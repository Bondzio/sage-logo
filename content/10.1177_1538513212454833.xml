<p>Like Poe’s purloined letter, college architecture is hidden in plain sight. Academics see it every day but take it for granted. Those of us who work at universities might think, how can something so near, so familiar, be a worthy historical subject? In fact, the history of campus planning as it relates to the social construction of knowledge is a weighty and fast-moving discipline; there is much to be learned from environments that are close at hand.</p>
<p>The three books under review here manipulate that familiarity: the American college is taken seriously and purposely made distant. Every aspect of the collegiate built environment is thrown open to reconsideration by authors from diverse scholarly perspectives. Gumprecht is an award-winning cultural geographer whose take on the college town is personal yet nearly comprehensive; he reviews a wide range of regions and includes vivid descriptions of the inhabitants of college towns. Haar is an architect and historian who uses Chicago as a case study to demonstrate the vitality of the urban campus. Tolles’s overview of New England’s pre–Civil War colleges offers a traditional, object-based architectural history. All three books are valuable to planning historians, because college campuses—both urban and rural—are microcosms of cities. Campuses reify ideas about education, youth, gender, class, race, and American citizenship. The architecture of these distinctive places can be keyed to important changes in American education, including the Morrill Act (1862), the G. I. Bill (1944), and the rise of the antiestablishment youth culture of the 1960s that challenged the authority of college officials in unprecedented ways.</p>
<p>Tolles, the author of <italic>Architecture &amp; Academe</italic>, clearly loves his subject. He likes the clean lines, the honest use of materials, and the simple, elegant facades of these quintessentially American buildings. He celebrates the blocky rows of buildings that define greens, and he equally admires the quadrangles with their private courtyards. He applauds the “pioneering and enterprising spirit” (p. 41) of their founders. The book covers the antebellum settings for Harvard, Yale, Brown, Dartmouth, Williams, Bowdoin, the University of Vermont, Middlebury, Amherst, Holy Cross, Tufts, Trinity, Wesleyan, Colby, Bates, and a few more. A pro-Yankee sentiment permeates the visual analysis; the smell of clam chowder practically wafts from the pages.</p>
<p>A book needs constraints, and perhaps the region of New England was a reasonable way to frame this project. However, the regional style he proposes (“rationally conceived, inelaborate, solidly constructed, reliant on English precedents”; p. 23) could just as easily describe Old Queens at Rutgers in New Jersey or Latrobe’s Old West at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania, so the regional style he posits may not be the most useful gesture made here.</p>
<p>Indeed, the other aspects of the book are more compelling. For example, we learn about unsanitary conditions, dormitories that lacked heat, and poorly constructed buildings that deteriorated under the wear and tear of student life. Spun a different way, this book could have been a history of renovation, a catalogue of responses to fires, or a chronicle of college officials’ persistent refusal to follow master plans. It is generously illustrated, with thorough captions and color plates on glossy paper. I especially appreciated the wealth of vintage interior photographs, since so many of these buildings have been rearranged or gutted. Regrettably, the press has made some awkward editorial decisions. (Ordinary readers do not need to know the dimensions of every building; such information would be better placed in an appendix for number crunchers and other zealots). His research reveals how difficult it was to get campuses constructed in the antebellum period, and how much diplomacy was required for each new edifice. This art historical method exemplifies one strand of architectural writing that traces its lineage to Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Vincent Scully; it is a method that assumes that identifying that which is truly American is the historian’s highest duty.</p>
<p>Although many historians (myself included) resist American exceptionalism, one cannot help noticing that higher education in the United States is different from its appearance in other countries. There are three primary reasons for this: (1) Americans favor housing students on campus, (2) Americans romanticize the college as a secluded “place apart,” to use Robert A. M. Stern’s term (Haar, xxii.), and (3) athletics departments dominate universities and their towns in a way that non-Americans find peculiar, if not disgraceful.</p>
<p>All of these circumstances are examined in <italic>The American College Town</italic>, which manages to be quirky and magisterial at the same time. Gumprecht’s subject, the historical geography of the American college town, is close to his heart, as he readily admits. He uses first person throughout, lets us know the names of his favorite vegetarian restaurants, and refers frequently to the long duration of the project’s gestation. Gumprecht once worked as a reporter, as his accessible and confident prose demonstrates. He captures the ethos of a college town, where residents tend to be well educated and eager to engage in critical debate about every imaginable political issue, both the global and the local. Each chapter focuses on a different college and town. For public space, we visit Norman, Oklahoma, in a chapter that relies on the social history of landscape architecture. “Fraternity Row, The Student Ghetto, and the Faculty Enclave” transports us to Cornell in Ithaca, New York. “Campus Corners and Aggievilles” (chapter 4) extends the book’s reach to Manhattan, Kansas. Davis, California (chapter 5) is ripe for an insightful look at what is really liberal about white, upper-class precincts. “Paradise for Misfits” (chapter 6) romps through Athens, Georgia, where we meet the characters who make college towns distinct. The most illuminating chapter for me was “Stadium Culture” (chapter 7) in which Gumprecht paints a surprisingly sensitive picture of how athletics came to dominate the little town of Auburn, Alabama, home of Auburn University. The town has 50,000 residents; the football stadium seats 87,451 (p. 228). He sympathizes with merchants who are dependent for survival upon a handful of football games. His short history of tailgating shows that in the 1970s, visitors began arriving with picnics because there were just not enough restaurants to feed the influx of people who descended for six autumn weekends. And people began to drive to the stadium in motor homes and recreational vehicles because there were not enough hotel rooms—or bathrooms—in small towns with big football teams.</p>
<p>Going back to the middle ages, students’ bad behavior, amplified by alcohol consumption, has led to problems in town-gown relations. As Gumprecht points out, some nineteenth-century presidents disliked dormitories, finding that the density of students, especially those who drank heavily, led to turbulence and worse. On the other hand, in both the nineteenth century and the twentieth century, unsupervised students who lived in boarding houses or off-campus apartments outraged neighbors with their drunken antics. Alcohol consumption caused trouble both on and off campus. Even raising the drinking age did not alleviate the problem. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan, erstwhile promoter of states’ rights, signed into law a bill that required “states to raise their drinking age to twenty-one . . . or lose part of their federal highway funds” (Gumprecht, 133), but even this device was only partly successful. Parties, noise, pollution, and public lewdness make students unwanted neighbors. Gumprecht reviews several university strategies, such as tightening the student conduct code and parental notification when students violate the code, which seem to improve student behavior. The town of Newark, Delaware sought to limit the number of “student homes” (defined as any rental occupied by three or more students, regardless of familial relation) and by constructing new apartments aimed at the student market. Finally, the town incentivized home ownership by giving people a $50,000 loan for taking a rental house and turning it back into a primary residence. All these clever strategies have allowed the residents of Newark to dwell more peacefully with students. Ultimately, though, Gumprecht concludes that the adversarial town-gown relationship is likely to stay that way.</p>
<p>The topic of Sharon Haar’s outstanding book contrasts that of both Tolles and Gumprecht. Tolles focuses on campuses that are graceful, while Gumprecht asks rhetorically, “Why must a campus be pretty? Why must it be spacious and park-like? Why must its buildings be grand?” (Gumprecht, 63). Haar answers that universities do not need to be graceful, park-like, or grand. The universities in her study have no lawns, no ivy, no tweed-clad professors dispensing wisdom under oak trees. The ancient universities of Europe were urban; they had no iron gates or stone entrances; their facilities mingled with the town’s own, and yet their students became educated. Oxford and Cambridge, which Americans tend to think of as normative, were in fact unusual in their creation of monastery-like residential quadrangles. Haar’s point is well taken: just because Americans like the idea of the isolated bucolic academy, that does not make the gritty urban campus any less vital, economically significant, or historically important.</p>
<p>Haar first introduces issues related to urbanism and educational history. Chapter 2, “The City as Laboratory,” highlights Hull-House and the rise of the Chicago School of sociology. The city was seen as raw material for study by a newly professional class; these professionals reciprocated by creating a metropolitan culture based on “rationality, expertise, training, and authority.” (Haar, 41) “Modern City, Modern Campus” (chapter 3) explores European-style modernist urban planning and the expansion of universities after World War II (WWII); it is a familiar picture, except that Haar’s nuanced portrayal is refracted through the lens of education. In “Classrooms Off the Expressway: A New Mission for Higher Education,” the author cleverly ties together the newly built highways of the 1960s and the invention of “mass higher education,” taking the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle (which later dropped the word <italic>circle</italic>) as an ideal case study. Some residents of the neighborhood near Hull-House, the Near West Side, fiercely rejected the Mayor’s plan to locate the giant university there. An immense battle over the site followed, and eventually the cluster of buildings known as the Hull-House Social Settlement was demolished, although two small structures were saved; thus an aggressively modernist campus aimed at higher education for the many replaced the “neighborly pedagogy” of Jane Addams (Haar, 95).</p>
<p>Designed by Walter Netsch of Skidmore Owings and Merrell, the University of Illinois at Chicago is remarkable for its convergence of people, ideas, cars, trains, and state funding. Chapter 5 is a detailed and well-illustrated summary of its formal development. Figure 5.15 is a stunning aerial night view of UIC—the grid of the state of Illinois and the smaller grid of Chicago unfold into the distance; in the near ground, squared-off college blocks, some tall and some not, surround a sunken forum; walkways and highways suggest dynamism. As Haar wryly comments, the major campus features were “best understood from a helicopter” (p. 126). Those students who did not have the foresight to bring a flying machine to college might be forgiven if the overarching planning ideas were lost on them. But as Haar explains evenhandedly, Netsch also paid attention to the student on the ground, with casual spaces tucked in and around classrooms, and a successful outdoor gathering space. It was a totalizing scheme, even utopian. As Haar points out, “The Circle campus was built during the last moments of utopian modernism in the belief that particular architectural forms could produce particular human responses, societies, interactions, and communities” (Haar, 140–41).</p>
<p>Haar includes additional chapters on UIC’s efforts to remake itself as a more traditional residential (i.e., noncommuter) campus in the 1980s with the addition of dormitories. Her book ends with a positive conclusion about urban universities and globalization. With “Eds and Meds” the buzz phrase for economic development in cities with moribund industry, her later chapters are particularly relevant. Haar is an advocate for the engaged campus, not the cloistered institutions of yore. She sees a long and powerful history for higher education that serves its immediate community, and if that community is urban, then so much the better. Although <italic>The City as Campus</italic> will not appeal to the general reader as much as <italic>The American College Town</italic>, it is appropriately pitched to educational theorists, architects, and Chicago-land aficionados. Those interested in planning history will find much to enhance their understanding of the history of urbanism and higher education.</p>
<p>These books testify to the importance of campus planning in recent scholarship on cities and the history of education. Gumprecht and Haar are writing different and important histories of state universities, the exact institutions whose impending demise is carefully revealed in Christopher Newfield’s <italic>Unmaking the Public University: The Forty-Year Assault on the Middle Class</italic> (2008). State universities face deep budget cuts, and it is clear that such disinvestment in higher education will lead to poorly maintained facilities. Competition from for-profit educational businesses, like the University of Phoenix, poses another threat to the physical places of higher education: distance learning requires neither a campus nor a town. <italic>College Town</italic> and <italic>The City as Campus</italic> may turn out to be morphologies of endangered species. The subject of campus planning benefits greatly from cross-disciplinary discussions; these authors are attuned to conflict and contingency in the invention of spaces for higher learning, and, although they come from different disciplines, they would nonetheless agree that local knowledge illuminates sweeping historical themes.</p>
