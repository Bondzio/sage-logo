         <abstract>
            <p>Although contraception language is typically required in subject informed consent forms (ICFs) used in clinical trials, there are no regulatory guidelines on the type and duration of methods of contraception that should be used. The authors conducted an anonymous 3-part survey to assess what contraception language biopharmaceutical companies use in their ICFs as well as the staff composition of the companies’ pharmacovigilance teams dealing with pregnancy and lactation. The majority of the companies sponsor clinical trials involving either small molecules (drugs) or a mix of small and large (biologics) molecules. The survey showed notably different answers between companies. Also, only a few companies have staff specifically dedicated to overseeing the enrollment of women of childbearing potential and following their progress if they become pregnant. The findings from this survey indicate that there is little uniformity among biopharmaceutical companies with respect to the contraception language included in ICFs.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Informed consent language can be challenging to draft in a clinical trials setting. Furthermore, the complexity can substantially increase when addressing issues involving contraception and pregnancy. There are a number of regulatory guidances specifying types and recommendations of contraception<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512438747">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512438747">2</xref>
            </sup>; however, there is no consistency among them and, in some cases, they contradict each other.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512438747">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861512438747">4</xref>
            </sup> Recently, the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) published a memo that clarifies the contraception wording that it recommends in clinical trials. This document specifically names the 5 methods of contraception that are considered highly effective (ie, less than 1% failure rate per year when used consistently and correctly, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0092861512438747">Table 1</xref>).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512438747">1</xref>
            </sup> Other governmental agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) list methods of highly effective contraception and their possible failure rate, but they do not recommend any specific type of method.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861512438747">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861512438747">6</xref>
            </sup> Within the field of clinical trials, the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines do not make any specific recommendations but require that contraception used in clinical trials have less than a 1% failure rate per year.<sup>

         <p>Along with the contraception methods, another parameter to be considered is the duration that such methods should be used. Given the variation in drug metabolism and elimination, medications typically follow a zero- or first-order half-life elimination. Since there is no simple formula to calculate elimination for all medications, most of this information is generated from reproductive-toxicity studies and usually based on half-life calculations. The only guidance from regulatory agencies on this subject stems from the MHRA’s recommendation that condoms be used for a full spermatogenic cycle or 5 drug half-lives.</p>
         <p>More recently, the idea of paternally mediated embryo/fetal developmental toxicity has garnered much discussion in the scientific community.<sup>

         <p>In its guidance, the MHRA mentions that male subjects with partners of childbearing potential should continue using an effective method of contraception for a suitable period after the last dose of study medication. The document also addresses the potential harm that vaginal absorption of the drug may cause to the mother and to the fetus.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512438747">1</xref>

         <p>A survey was administered to representatives of biopharmaceutical companies. The objectives of the survey were (1) to evaluate the current contraception language used in ICFs; (2) to examine whether the companies included recommendations of what is considered a highly effective form of contraception; and (3) to understand the staff composition in the companies for pregnancy and lactation programs.</p>

         <title>Materials and Methods</title>
         <p>The survey was conducted by WCI, a consulting firm that manages the PVnet and PVconnect pharmacovigilance forums. PVnet is a neutral drug safety forum and has 14 leading life science member companies. Members are leaders of pharmacovigilance in top pharmaceutical companies. PVconnect is an industry forum focusing on drug safety in midsized life science companies.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092861512438747">16</xref>
            </sup> Through this forum, we presented the survey to all members of PVnet and PVconnect who represent these companies’ leaders in drug safety and regulatory affairs. Information obtained from the survey was anonymous.</p>
         <p>The survey was developed for Internet-based administration and contained 3 demographic questions, 2 case scenarios, and 3 follow-up pharmacovigilance team composition questions. Demographic items included revenue, type of products manufactured (small or large molecules), and the individual’s position and department within the company. The scenario posed in our survey was that of a woman of childbearing potential enrolled in a clinical trial. The question posed was whether the company’s consent form mentioned the use and type of contraception required after the last dose of study drug. The MHRA-recommended highly effective methods of contraception<sup>

            </sup> were displayed in a drop-down window, and a free text box was available for those who responded that their consent form did include types of contraception not otherwise mentioned by the MHRA. The respondents were also queried to see how different companies determine the required time frame of contraception use after the drug has been discontinued. Options such as calculations according to fixed times (eg, days, weeks, and months) or half-life, as well as free text, were given for this question. The entire scenario was repeated again with a man being the subject of interest. Finally, 3 follow-up questions were posed in regard to the composition of each company’s organizational structure as it related to pregnancy and lactation. The survey included a total of 10 questions.</p>
         <p>After refinement and pilot testing, this Web-based survey was conducted over a 2-week period with an e-mail reminder after 1 week into the survey and an additional reminder at the end. Because this survey targeted both PVnet and PVconnect, multiple individuals within a same company may have been sent this survey. In the event that there were multiple differing responses from the same company, an additional query was sent to those individuals in order to reconcile their responses.</p>

            <title>Contraception Language for Females and Males</title>
            <p>The survey presented 2 scenarios in which a woman and a man were taking part in a clinical trial. For the woman of childbearing age enrolled in a clinical trial scenario, 13 of 22 (59.1%) responders mentioned language in their company’s consent forms related to contraception use in females after the study drug had been discontinued. One company did not require any contraceptive methods, 1 company did not have any language, and 7 companies did not know whether there was any contraception language mentioned in their ICF. Most companies (59.1%) tend to recommend some variation on highly effective methods of contraception, which include hormonal methods, IUDs, condoms with spermicide, and sterilization. “Other” responses included, for example, “double protection” and “highly variable.” The entire list of “other” responses can be found in Appendix 1.</p>
            <p>In the scenario in which a man takes part in a clinical trial, 11 of 22 (50%) of the companies mention language in their consent forms related to contraception use after the study drug had been discontinued. One company did not require any contraception methods, 4 did not have any language, and 6 companies did not know whether any contraception language was mentioned in their ICF. With respect to the type of contraception, several companies included explanations with their responses such as considering preclinical findings of mutagenicity, drug transport via semen, and large versus small molecules. The entire list of “other” responses can be found in Appendix 2. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0092861512438747">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0092861512438747">4</xref> summarizes the responders’ answers stratified by type of pharmaceutical product in the various scenarios.</p>

            <p>When asked about how the duration required for contraception after the last dose of a study drug was calculated, most companies responded that they base this on half-lives versus a specific numerical time frame. Many companies do not use a formula to calculate time frames, marking a “none” response, as seen in 23% and 36% of companies, for the women and men scenarios, respectively. In females, 4 companies reported that they base the time duration on specific days or months, whereas for males, 2 companies had specific times and 1 company used a combination half-life and time combination. There was 1 invalid response due to the responder not answering the question properly.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>This survey attempted to identify the type of contraception language used in ICFs of biopharmaceutical companies. The results show notable disparity among companies. The United Kingdom’s MHRA recommends 5 types of acceptable forms of contraception considered highly effective in clinical trials. These methods include hormonal, implanted device (IUD), barrier method with spermicide, male sterilization, and true abstinence.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861512438747">1</xref>
            </sup> For contraception language in females of childbearing potential, only 2 companies mentioned all 5 options; many of the remaining companies have their own protocols and variations of MHRA recommendations. Of the 22 companies that responded to the survey, 13 have female contraception language, 1 did not include any language, and another did not require any method of contraception in their clinical trials. The remaining 7 did not provide a response. In the male scenario, 11 companies did mention types of contraception, while 4 did not include any male contraception language. One company required no contraception language, and the remaining 6 did not provide a response. Overall, in both scenarios, there was no uniformity across companies. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first cross-sectional study examining contraception language in ICFs of biopharmaceutical companies. One of the most significant imperatives in clinical trials is protection from unintentional exposure of an embryo or fetus before information is available concerning the potential benefits versus the potential risks.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861512438747">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861512438747">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092861512438747">17</xref>
            </sup> Reproductive toxicity studies can help characterize that risk; however, a more common approach is to prevent pregnancies from occurring during the study period. As one-half of all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned, contraception language in ICFs becomes very important in protecting the fetus from inadvertent drug exposure.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092861512438747">15</xref>
            </sup> From this survey, it was observed that most of the companies do include some form of contraception language for females and males in their ICFs. However, a number of individual responders did not know this specific information about their own company’s ICF.</p>
         <p>The survey has several methodological limitations. First, the number of responders was small. Therefore, the reader is cautioned against generalizing conclusions to the entire biopharmaceutical industry. Second, the identity of the responders is unknown. Thus, it is not possible to determine the knowledge about company procedures and the level of expertise in the field of contraception of those individuals who answered the surveys. Third, it is not known what specific products each company manufactures. As a result, it is unclear whether contraception language in ICFs would even be pertinent (eg, drugs targeted solely to the geriatric postmenopausal population).</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>The findings from this survey show that there is little uniformity among biopharmaceutical companies in determining the type of contraception and the duration of use. Since there is limited guidance on this topic from regulatory agencies worldwide, the results of this survey suggest that a formal discussion among representatives of the various interested parties (eg, the biopharmaceutical industry, regulatory agencies, clinical research, bioethics, and epidemiology) is needed to provide guidance and standardize contraception language to be used in ICFs in clinical trials.</p>
