<abstract>
<p>The tooth root is an important part of the tooth that works together with the surrounding periodontium to maintain the tooth in the alveolar socket. The root develops after crown morphogenesis. While the molecular and cellular mechanisms of early tooth development and crown morphogenesis have been extensively studied, little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling tooth root formation. Here, we show that β-catenin is strongly expressed in odontoblast-lineage cells and is required for root formation. Tissue-specific inactivation of β-catenin in developing odontoblasts produced molars lacking roots and aberrantly thin incisors. At the beginning of root formation in the mutant molars, the cervical loop epithelium extended apically to form Hertwig’s epithelial root sheath (HERS), but root odontoblast differentiation was disrupted and followed by the loss of some HERS inner layer cells. However, the outer layer of the HERS extended without the root, and the mutant molars finally erupted. The periodontal tissues extensively invaded the dental pulp. These results indicate that there is a cell-autonomous requirement for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the dental mesenchyme for root formation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tooth roots develop following crown formation. During early root morphogenesis, the cervical loop epithelium extends and forms the Hertwig’s epithelial root sheath (HERS). Mesenchymal cells in the dental papilla differentiate into pre-odontoblasts inside the HERS and further differentiate into odontoblasts to produce root dentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512470137">Thomas, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The Wnt family of proteins plays an important role in morphogenesis and cellular differentiation in many tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512470137">Logan and Nusse, 2004</xref>). The canonical Wnt signaling pathway involves the stabilization and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, which activates the expression of Wnt target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512470137">Reya and Clevers, 2005</xref>). It is well known that Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays multiple roles in various stages of tooth morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512470137">Liu and Millar, 2010</xref>). However, little is known about the involvement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in odontoblast differentiation. During dentin formation, <italic>Wnt10a</italic> is expressed in odontoblast-lineage cells, and <italic>Axin2</italic> is also expressed in developing odontoblasts and dental pulp cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512470137">Yamashiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512470137">Lohi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). In addition, <italic>Dkk1</italic>, an inhibitor of Wnt signaling, is strongly expressed in pre-odontoblasts, but is decreased in secretory odontoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512470137">Fjeld <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Moreover, it was recently reported that <italic>Lef-1</italic> overexpression accelerates odontoblast differentiation of dental pulp cells, and constitutive <italic>β-catenin</italic> stabilization in the dental mesenchyme can lead to excessive dentin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512470137">Yokose and Naka, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512470137">Kim <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). These reports strongly suggest that modulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling may play an important role in odontoblast differentiation.</p>
<p>During root formation, numerous growth factors and transcription factors, such as Shh, BMP, and Msx, are extensively expressed in the dental epithelium and mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512470137">Yamashiro <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512470137">Nakatomi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Recently, TGF-β and Shh signaling have been implicated in tooth root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512470137">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate odontoblast differentiation for root formation remain unclear. In addition, it is not known whether Wnt signaling in the dental mesenchyme is involved in root formation. Here, we analyzed mice with tissue-specific inactivation of β-catenin, an obligatory transducer of canonical Wnt signaling, in developing odontoblasts to directly investigate the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in root formation.</p>

<title>β-catenin Expression in Odontoblast-lineage Cells during Root Formation</title>
<p>In the developing root of the mouse mandibular first molar at P14, odontoblast-lineage cells were classified as odontoblasts, differentiating odontoblasts, or pre-odontoblasts, according to their status of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512470137">Fig. 1A</xref>). Immunohistochemical experiments revealed that Phex, a phosphate-regulating endopeptidase, was exclusively localized in odontoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512470137">Fig. 1B</xref>). ALPL, a tissue-non-specific alkaline phosphatase, was localized in differentiating odontoblasts and odontoblasts, but not pre-odontoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512470137">Fig. 1C</xref>). In contrast, β-catenin was observed in all odontoblast-lineage cells in the root as well as in HERS cells and the periodontium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512470137">Fig. 1D</xref>). However, ALPL was not localized in HERS cells or the epithelial cell rests of Malassez, which were clearly marked by cytokeratin 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512470137">Fig. 1E</xref>). <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization analysis revealed that <italic>Dsp</italic> mRNA was expressed exclusively in odontoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512470137">Fig. 1F</xref>). <italic>Osteocalcin</italic> mRNA was expressed in both odontoblasts and differentiating odontoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512470137">Fig. 1G</xref>).

<title>Lack of Tooth Roots in <italic>OC-Cre;Ctnnb1<sup>CO/CO</sup></italic> Mice</title>
<p>To determine the roles of β-catenin in odontoblast-lineage cells during root formation, we generated a conditional β-catenin gene inactivation mouse in the dental mesenchyme using the <italic>OC-Cre</italic> promoter. We confirmed that Cre recombination from the <italic>OC-Cre</italic> promoter was active in the odontoblast lineages during root formation.

<p>The mutant mice exhibited striking tooth phenotypes. By 4 wks of age, the incisors were completely erupted in control mice but not in mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512470137">Figs. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512470137">2B</xref>).

Periostin was strongly localized in the periodontal tissues and periosteum of alveolar bone in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512470137">Fig. 3H</xref>), but in mutant mice, periostin was extensively localized in the radicular pulp as well as in the periodontium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512470137">Fig. 3L</xref>).</p>

<title>Disruption of Odontoblast Differentiation in <italic>OC-Cre; Ctnnb1<sup>CO/CO</sup></italic> Mice during Root Formation</title>
<p>Because roots failed to form in mutant mice, we compared histological differences in the developing roots of the mandibular first molar between mutant and control mice. In tooth germs of P5 control mice, the cervical loop epithelium was extended to the apical side of the crown to initiate root formation. No distinguishable differences were found in the tooth germs of mutant littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512470137">Figs. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512470137">4E</xref>).

In control mice, the cervical loop epithelium extended further down to form HERS. Odontoblasts were well-differentiated in the crown, and differentiating odontoblasts appeared in the cervix, the presumptive crown-root junction. Pre-odontoblasts were located below the differentiating odontoblasts next to HERS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512470137">Fig. 4C</xref>). In mutant mice, pulp cells were condensed, and there were no differentiating odontoblasts in the cervical area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512470137">Fig. 4G</xref>). Inner layer cells of HERS as well as pre-odontoblasts were absent just below the cervical area, but pulp cells aligned inside the two-layered HERS on the apical side.</p>

<p>At P10, differentiating odontoblasts and HERS moved downward following root dentin formation in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512470137">Fig. 4D</xref>). Although HERS in mutant mice extended apically similarly to control littermates, no dentin was formed due to failure of odontoblast differentiation in the root region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512470137">Fig. 4H</xref>). Instead of odontoblast-lineage cells, numerous pulp cells were condensed along the inside of HERS, and a cell-free area was evident.</p>
<p>Because histological differences between control and mutant mice were apparent in the mandibular first molar at P8, we performed BrdU-labeling experiments and immunohistochemistry to assess cell proliferation and molecular changes following β-catenin gene inactivation in the dental mesenchyme. In control mice, BrdU-labeled cells were mainly located around HERS but were not found in the cervical area of the pulp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512470137">Fig. 4I</xref>). However, BrdU-labeled cells were located in the cervical area of the pulp and around HERS in mutant mice teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512470137">Fig. 4N</xref>). β-catenin was immunohistochemically localized in odontoblast-lineage cells, cells derived from dental epithelium, and the dental follicle in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512470137">Fig. 4J</xref>). ALPL expression overlapped in the differentiated odontoblasts and differentiating odontoblasts, which were located in the crown and cervical area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512470137">Fig. 4K</xref>). However, ALPL was not observed in the pre-odontoblasts or cells derived from dental epithelium, except the stratum intermedium. In mutant mice, β-catenin, ALPL, and Axin2 partly co-localized in crown odontoblasts but were not found in the dental mesenchyme below the cervix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512470137">Figs. 4O</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512470137">4P</xref>, Appendix Fig. 4). In control mice, Phex was observed only in crown odontoblasts, not in differentiating odontoblasts or pre-odontoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512470137">Fig. 4L</xref>). In addition, Phex was also localized only in the odontoblasts of the crown in mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512470137">Fig. 4Q</xref>). In both control and mutant mice, cells derived from dental epithelium, ameloblasts, and HERS cells were marked by cytokeratin 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512470137">Figs. 4M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512470137">4R</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated the functional significance of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the dental mesenchyme during tooth root formation. <italic>OC-Cre;Ctnnb1<sup>CO/CO</sup></italic> mice exhibited remarkable tooth phenotypes characterized by erupted molars lacking roots and thin incisors. This abnormality was closely associated with odontoblast differentiation.</p>
<p>Currently, the molecular mechanisms that regulate odontoblast differentiation for root formation are unknown. Similar to crown formation, molecular interactions between dental epithelium and mesenchyme are important for root formation. It is generally accepted that HERS is important for root formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512470137">Thomas, 1995</xref>). It is thought to initiate odontoblast differentiation from the mesenchymal cells in the dental papilla and to determine root shape and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512470137">Ten Cate, 1996</xref>). In the developing molars of <italic>OC-Cre;Ctnnb1<sup>CO/CO</sup></italic> mice, HERS initially extended after crown morphogenesis, but odontoblast differentiation was disrupted in the cervical end of the crown. Although the outer-layer cells of HERS were normally extended apically, inner-layer HERS cells lost cellular integrity, and some disappeared. These findings indicate that odontoblast differentiation could be necessary to maintain HERS cellular integrity and that HERS could be extended without root dentin formation. Therefore, our results suggest that Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the dental mesenchyme might be essential for root formation (Appendix Fig. 5).</p>
<p>To date, several signaling molecules are known to be necessary for root elongation in the dental mesenchyme. <italic>Nfic</italic>, a CTF binding transcription factor, regulates odontoblast differentiation during root formation, and <italic>Nfic</italic>-knockout mice exhibit short molar roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512470137">Steele-Perkins <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). In addition, it has been reported that Smad4 and Ptc1 are also associated with root elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512470137">Nakatomi <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512470137">Gao <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Ablation of these genes in the dental mesenchyme results in molars with short roots. Furthermore, it was recently reported that epithelial Smad4 signaling is essential for HERS elongation and is mediated by the Smad4-Shh-Nfic signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512470137">Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Although these mouse models showed defective root formation, they developed molar roots. This is in contrast to the complete absence of roots in <italic>OC-Cre;Ctnnb1<sup>CO/CO</sup></italic> mice. This finding suggests that Wnt/β-catenin signaling may play a key role in the initiation of root formation and that molecular crosstalk between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and the other pathways mentioned above may be important for root elongation.</p>
<p>Wnt/β-catenin signaling is involved in bone formation and maintenance. Gain- and loss-of-function β-catenin mutations in osteoblasts result in osteopetrosis and osteoporosis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512470137">Glass <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The complementary regulation is principally controlled by osteoclast function. It is well known that osteoclast-mediated bone resorption is essential for tooth eruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512470137">Wise and King, 2008</xref>). In fact, several animal models with osteoclast dysfunction show osteopetrotic bone formation and tooth eruption failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512470137">Tiffee <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512470137">Lu <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, these models also exhibit a lack of tooth roots. This phenotype is similar to our findings in <italic>OC-Cre;Ctnnb1<sup>CO/CO</sup></italic> mice, which have osteoporotic features with tooth eruption rather than osteopetrosis with eruption failure. HERS was extended but roots did not form because of odontoblast differentiation disruption in <italic>OC-Cre;Ctnnb1<sup>CO/CO</sup></italic> mice. Moreover, despite lacking roots, periodontal structures formed and invaded the potential space between the crown and alveolar bone. Our findings indicate that teeth could erupt without root formation. Failure of root formation in osteoclast dysfunction models might be due to the interruption of HERS extension rather than to disrupted odontoblast differentiation. Taken together, the evidence suggests that HERS extension and periodontium formation, but not root formation, are critical for tooth eruption.</p>
<p>The results of the present study further imply that Wnt/ β-catenin signaling in the dental mesenchyme is required to differentiate odontoblasts for root formation.</p>
