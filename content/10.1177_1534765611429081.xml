<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the demographic and psychological factors of women court mandated into a batterer intervention program (BIP) to provide further descriptive information on the characteristics of women who initiate intimate partner violence (IPV). Specifically, the study explored the characteristics of these women in terms of race, class, and gender. The study employed a secondary analysis of 485 women mandated into a BIP at the Domestic Abuse Center in Columbia, South Carolina. Analysis indicated as follows: (a) Although significant differences in psychosocial variables exist between African American and White women mandated into treatment, race remains an ineffective predictor of program involvement; (b) Socioeconomic factors provide a more consistent description of women batterers regardless of race; and (c) Both men and women mandated into this particular BIP exhibit similar demographic traits. These findings, concerning the characteristics of women batterers as they pertain to, race, class, and gender, should assist professionals to better address female initiated IPV and better fashion intervention programs suited to their unique needs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>When Amy Bishop, a neuroscience professor at the University of Alabama, Huntsville, with a PhD from Harvard, was arrested a few months ago for opening fire on her fellow faculty at a department meeting, the nation reacted with shock and dismay. Similar reactions followed the revelation that Andrea Yates’ had systematically drowned her five children in the bathtub in 2001. In 1990, the nation was enthralled with the serial murderer, Aileen Wuornos, who killed seven men in Florida. A movie called <italic>Monster</italic>, released in 2003, chronicled Wuornos’ life, and Charlize Theron was awarded an Oscar for best actress for her depiction of Wuornos as a victim of ongoing sexual and physical abuse who turned the tables on her tormentors. Recently, when a woman playing soccer for New Mexico yanked an opponent to the ground by her ponytail and when Baylor’s female center broke the nose of her opponent, the N.C.A.A. cited the incidents as “isolated.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765611429081">Longman, 2010</xref>, p. 1). As a society, we are quick to relegate acts of female aggression, like the above examples, to the exceptional status despite their prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534765611429081">Tanenhaus, 2010</xref>). A central issue underlying the intrigue of these acts is our attempt as a society to understand the phenomena of female aggression. Although today’s media is rife with examples of females initiating violence, there exists a lack of conceptual understanding, limited empirical information, and cultural naiveté concerning the nature and scope of violence perpetrated by women.</p>
<p>Female-initiated intimate partner violence (IPV) is one field that exemplifies such a dearth of comprehension about the nature of female-initiated violence. Despite rising numbers of arrests for women for domestic violence over the last 30 years (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765611429081">Henning, Renauer, &amp; Holdford, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765611429081">Hirschel &amp; Buzawa, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765611429081">Mignon &amp; Holmes, 1995</xref>), the landscape of female-initiated violence remains virtually unexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534765611429081">Tanenhaus, 2010</xref>), certainly compared to the literature on male batterers. The increase in women defendants involved in intimate partner violence, as perpetrators, challenges the traditional focus of the court system on male perpetrated IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765611429081">Henning et al., 2006</xref>). It also highlights the need to explore theories surrounding women and the use of violence. Unlike the large body of research exploring male IPV offenders, there has been minimal research conducted that explores the psychosocial and demographic factors related to female- initiated intimate partner violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765611429081">Carney, Buttell, &amp; Dutton, 2006</xref>). Research into this topic has been complicated by questions about the scope of this problem, the types of violence perpetrated by women offenders, and their reasons for initiating violence. Furthermore, many batterer intervention programs are shaped by feminist theory and focus on the function of society’s patriarchal norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765611429081">Ehrensaft, 2008</xref>). Without a clearer understanding of who women batterers are, and why they participate in violence, the effectiveness of these interventions and prevention programs remains limited. An understanding of the psychosocial and demographic correlates to women’s participation in IPV is necessary to clarify the issues and concerns specific to this unique population and the corresponding appropriate treatment and interventions.</p>
<p>Female arrests for IPV have been quietly and steadily on the rise in the last 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765611429081">Chesney-Lind, 2002</xref>). In certain jurisdictions, women have been found to be responsible for up to 25% of domestic violence arrests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765611429081">Chesney-Lind, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765611429081">Henning &amp; Feder, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534765611429081">Swan &amp; Snow, 2002</xref>). In part, these higher arrest rates can be attributed to the institution and implementation of mandatory arrest laws for domestic violence. These laws, started in the late 1980s and instituted in most states by 1997 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765611429081">Hirschel &amp; Buzawa, 2002</xref>), fundamentally changed the nature of domestic violence criminalization. Before mandatory arrest laws, if the complainant in a domestic disturbance refused to participate in filing a complaint, the responding police were not required to make any arrests. With the advent of mandatory arrest laws, law enforcement officers responding to the scene of a domestic disturbance were mandated to make their own judgments concerning probable cause and arrest perpetrators accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765611429081">Carney &amp; Buttell, 2005</xref>). Shifting responsibility for arrest to law enforcement officials meant that, in cases in which victims were too frightened or too emotionally invested in their abusers to file complaints, offenders could still be prosecuted. These laws led to the expected result of higher arrest rates for domestic violence but they also, surprisingly, resulted in much higher rates of arrest for female offenders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765611429081">Carney &amp; Buttell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765611429081">Henning et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The reason for these higher arrest rates is a topic of much discussion in IPV literature. Some authors contend that these arrest rates reflect women being arrested for self-defense, or law enforcement officials’ unwillingness to attribute blame to a single party (thus arresting both parties) in the face of potentially litigious situations involving mixed violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765611429081">Henning et al., 2006</xref>). Others feel that arrest rates for female-initiated IPV were lower prior to the mandatory arrest laws due to a reluctance on the part of male victims to press charges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765611429081">Henning et al., 2006</xref>). These authors contend that the new, higher arrest rates are a more accurate picture of domestic violence in this country than the previous one, colored by cultural beliefs and stigmas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765611429081">Carney et al., 2006</xref>). For example, research has shown that many emergency clinics do not ask men about domestic violence as a potential source of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765611429081">Carney et al, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765611429081">Marshall (1992)</xref> found that males rated the item “burned him with something” (p. 200) significantly less seriously than females rated the item “burned her with something” (p. 117). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534765611429081">Brown (2004)</xref> found that in severe injury cases, only 28.6% of men were found not guilty, in contrast to 87.8% of the women. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534765611429081">Brown (2004)</xref>, in the cases studied, more than half of the male victims were unwilling to testify, and charges were withdrawn from female offenders 77.8% of the time. These findings seem to reflect an unwillingness on the part of society in general and male victims in particular to openly acknowledge the phenomenon of female-initiated IPV.</p>
<p>Moving beyond women arrested for IPV, recent studies using large populations of college students across the world have indicated growing numbers of female initiators of IPV in populations other than court-mandated offenders. In a study of nearly 16,000 students across 21 nations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765611429081">Chan, Straus, Brownridge, Tiwari, and Leung (2008)</xref> found that the proportion of female students who had engaged in physical assault of their male partners was higher than that of male students who had engaged in physical assault of their female partners in 12 out of the 21 nations. In addition, in a similar study, female adolescents were found to be 115% more likely than their male counterparts to have assaulted their partners, even in cases of severe assault. These statistics appear to indicate a growing phenomenon which, if left unaddressed, could have drastic consequences as these women come of age.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to provide further descriptive information on the characteristics of women who initiate IPV. This study employs a secondary data analysis of 485 women mandated into a batterer intervention program at the Domestic Abuse Center (DAC) in Columbia, South Carolina. These women participated in an extensive intake interview that included the completion of a demographic questionnaire providing insight as to the specific psychosocial and socioeconomic composition of this population, as well as a psychological scale designed to determine their propensity for abuse. The large size of the current sample provides a unique opportunity to glean relevant information about this population. Specifically, this study addressed the following the research questions:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1534765611429081">
<title>Measurement Instruments</title>
<p>The current study employed a secondary analysis of data collected by the Domestic Abuse Center [DAC], a nonprofit agency in Columbia, South Carolina. The DAC had been providing counseling services to individuals court-ordered into treatment since 1982. At intake, clients participated in an interview administered by DAC staff covering information contained on a demographic questionnaire. They also completed two psychological instruments: the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding [BIDR] and the Propensity for Abusiveness Scale [PAS].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1534765611429081">
<title>BIDR</title>
<p>The BIDR is a two-factor measure used to determine the level of socially desirable responding in the sample population. The BIDR is a 40-item Likert-type scale divided into two subscales: the BIDR-SD (Self-deception) and the BIDR-IM (Impression Management). For the purposes of this study, the primary function of the BIDR-SD and the BIDR-IM was to eliminate study participants whose answers could be considered to be unduly influenced by internal impulses toward social desirability. Participants who score high on the BIDR-SD have been shown to believe their own skewed positive self-reports, while respondents who score high on the BIDR-IM are believed to be responding from a manipulative desire to impress others. Self-deception and impression management scores each range from 0 to 20, and participants who scored higher than 14 on either are considered to be in the high range. Thus participants with scores in excess of 14 were eliminated from the study, on the grounds that their answers to certain questions on the demographic questionnaire, (e.g., have you ever been violent before) may be overly skewed toward answers that they believe to be socially desirable.</p>
<p>Research indicates that these measures are particularly effective in measuring social desirability among offenders. Both subscales were previously determined to be internally reliable, with test results of a .73 for the self-deception scale and a .84 for the impression management scales. External validity was previously demonstrated through a comparison of scale differences. However, it should be noted that there is no research indicating the appropriateness of these measures for women offenders and/or ethnic minorities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1534765611429081">
<title>PAS</title>
<p>The Propensity for Abusiveness Scale (PAS) measures the likelihood of a given respondent to use physical force in an intimate relationship. This scale has a score range from 32 to 160, with higher scores correlating to increased likelihood of IPV. It measures three factors: affective labiality, recalled negative parental treatment, and trauma symptoms. The PAS was previously determined internally reliable, yielding a test score of .88. A study establishing the accuracy and appropriateness of this measure found a mean score for nonviolent men of 44.7 (<italic>SD</italic> = 11.7), while violent men had a mean score of 59.2 (<italic>SD</italic> = 17.1). Once again, it should be noted that there is no research indicating the appropriateness of these measures for women offenders and/or ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>The intake questionnaire was orally administered to women entering the BIP program by DAC counselors. The questionnaire covered a wide range of demographic information. Variables to be analyzed include race, age, referral source, relationship to the victim, length of this relationship, number of children, whether or not the offender was still with the victim at intake, whether social services were involved, education level, whether or not the offender was employed at intake, whether or not the offender uses alcohol and/or drugs and whether or not the offender was using drugs and/or alcohol at the time of the incident, whether or not the offender was currently also receiving mental health treatment and/or addiction therapy, the offender’s past criminal history, past violent behavior, history of being abused as a child, history of sexual abuse, and whether or not the offender witnessed domestic violence as a child.</p>
<p>To protect the privacy of the women in the study, the researchers were not given direct access to client files. Rather, an employee of the agency deleted personal information from the demographic information form, copied both this form and the psychological instruments, and provided the researchers with this modified data.</p>

<sec id="section6-1534765611429081">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The DAC has been using the above assessment process since January, 2006. The current study population encompasses women referred to the batterer intervention program between the period of January 1, 2006 and June 30, 2009. Women comprised 15.6% of the total number of people referred during this period. In that time, 1,039 women were court- mandated to the 16-week batterer intervention program (BIP) at the DAC. Of the 1,039 women referred, 495 dropped out of the program (48%) before completing the initial intake sessions. Of the remaining women, 136 (13%) dropped out before completing the program, 335 (32%) completed the program, and 73 were still active in the program (7%) when the study was concluded. The sample for this study included all women referred during this period who attended at least two sessions and completed the assessment (<italic>N</italic> = 544).</p>
<p>Of the 544 originally selected for the sample, 59 women originally selected for the sample were omitted from the analysis due to high scores (&gt;14) on either the BIDR-SD or BIDR-IM subscales. Due to social desirability biases, it was concluded that high scores for either of these measures threaten the accuracy of the responses. Thus the final sample consisted of 485 women, of whom 284 (58%) reported being White, 180 (37%) reported being African American, 7 (1%) reported being Hispanic or Latino, and 14 (3%) reported “Other” for race.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section8-1534765611429081">
<title>General Characteristics</title>
<p>The sample population contained the following racial breakdown: 58% White, 37% African American, 1% Latino, and 3% Other. The majority of the participants reported having children (82%), still living with the victim (55%), and being employed (57%). While the majority reported currently using alcohol (60%), a minority reported illegal drug use (12%), and very few women in this sample (16%) were receiving addiction therapy while participating in the BIP. Under half reported receiving mental health therapy (43%).</p>
<p>In terms of behavioral and psychosocial predictors for IPV, a minority of the women in this sample indicated a past criminal history (37%), or past violent behavior (31%). In addition, a minority indicated that they had been abused as children (41%), or been the victim of sexual abuse (27%), while half indicated that they had witnessed domestic violence as a child. A little over half (55%) reported no alcohol use at time of incident, a little under a quarter (22.7%) reported that both the victim and perpetrator were drinking at the time of the incident, 9% reported that only the victim was drinking, and 13% reported that only the abuser was using alcohol at the time of the incident. Only 15% reported social services involvement.</p>
<p>The average age of women in this sample was 33, and the average score on the PAS was 69. The sample included women averaging 7-year relationships, and roughly a third (34.5%) were married while participating in the program, roughly a third were living together (35.3%), while the remaining program participants was divided between women who were divorced (13.2%) and women who reported “having a child in common” (13.8%) as the only form of relationship with the victim; 3% of the women in the study reported their relationship with the victim as “other.” Participants were roughly equally divided between women who had not completed high school, women who had achieved a 12-grade-level education, and women who had completed additional schooling past high school. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534765611429081">Table 1</xref> shows the general characteristics of this population at the time of the intake interview.</p>

<p>A comparison of program participants grouped by race (African American and White) using independent <italic>t</italic> tests and chi-square tests of significance yielded significant results in several areas. It should be noted that the sample size for Latino women (<italic>N</italic> = 7) and women who indicated “Other” for race (<italic>N</italic> = 14) were considered to be too small hold sufficient statistical relevance. Independent <italic>t</italic> tests indicated that African American women (<italic>N</italic> = 180) in this sample manifested higher levels of self-deception, with a mean score of 7.3 on the BIDR-SD compared to White women (<italic>N</italic> = 284) who scored an average of 5.6 (<italic>t</italic> = −5.52, <italic>df</italic> = 442, <italic>p</italic> = .000). Analyses also indicated that African American participants exhibited a lower propensity for abuse than White participants, scoring an average of 66.0 on the PAS compared to the White women’s average score of 71.5 (<italic>t</italic> = 2.72, <italic>df</italic> = 439, <italic>p</italic> = .007). No significant differences were found between scores on the BIDR-IM for African American women and White women (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534765611429081">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Analyses of psychosocial indicators of abuse also found significant differences between the two racial groups. Almost half of the White women in this population (47%) reported having been abused as a child, while only a third (32%) of African American women reported the same (χ<sup>2</sup> = 11.17, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = .001). In addition, the rates of having been a victim of sexual abuse were more than double for White women (34%) in relation to African American women (16%; χ<sup>2</sup> = 17.1, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = .000). Interestingly, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of past criminal history, past violent behavior, or having witnessed domestic violence as a child.</p>
<p>Differences between African American and White women in this sample are also evident in their reported use of alcohol and drugs. Chi-square analyses revealed that White participants were significantly more likely to use alcohol (67% as opposed to 51%; χ<sup>2</sup> = 11.77, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = .001) and illegal drugs (16% as opposed to 6%; χ<sup>2</sup> = 11.76, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = .001) than African American participants. In line with these findings, White women were also significantly more likely than African American women to have been drinking with (28% as opposed to 15%) or without (11% as opposed to 5%) the victim at the incident of abuse (χ<sup>2</sup> = 20.95, <italic>df</italic> = 3, <italic>p</italic> = .000). In fact, a majority of African American women (67%) reported no alcohol use by either party at the time the arrest was made. In contrast, less than half (43%) of the White women in the sample reported no alcohol use during the instance of abuse.</p>
<p>In terms of receiving treatment and interventions, it should be noted that significantly more White women in the program (18% as opposed to 9%; χ<sup>2</sup> = 7.82, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = .005) received social services involvement, as well as mental health therapy (55% as opposed to 25%; χ<sup>2</sup> = 40.19, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = .000), and addiction therapy (22% as opposed to 7%; χ<sup>2</sup> = 16.71, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> = .000).</p>
<p>Demographic variables, such as having children, level of education, and employment were not found to be significantly different between the two groups. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534765611429081">Table 2</xref> shows the results of the chi-square and independent <italic>t</italic> test analyses for these two populations.</p>
<p>To further examine differences between the characteristics of African American and White Women in this program, this study employed logistic regression to predict racial group membership based on a variety of psychosocial characteristics. The analysis strategy employed allowed for the simultaneous entry of the independent variables. The variables included in the model were alcohol use, illegal drug use, receiving mental health treatment, criminal history, history of violence, experienced child abuse, experienced childhood sexual abuse, and witness domestic violence as a child. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534765611429081">Table 3</xref> presents the estimated coefficients of the logistic regression model. The omnibus test was significant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 66.91, <italic>df</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic> = .000). The model successfully predicted significant differences between African American and White women in terms of alcohol use, illegal drug use, receiving mental health treatment, and having experienced childhood sexual abuse, with probability levels ranging from .000 to .032. It also predicted no significant differences between White women and African American women in terms of criminal history, history of violence, experiencing child abuse, or having witnessed domestic abuse, with probability levels ranging from .085 to .482. The classification table provided information about the extent of accuracy in predicted group membership. The observed instances of White group membership was 61% (<italic>n</italic> = 283) for this sample, (<italic>n</italic> = 463) as compared to the percentage of women predicted to be in the White group: 66% (<italic>n</italic> = 306). The percentage of women correctly predicted to be in the White group (77.7% <italic>n</italic> = 220) and correctly predicted to be in the African American group (52.2% <italic>n</italic> = 86) resulted in a correct classification in 67.8% of the sample, significantly better than chance. Incorrect classification according to the model was as follows: 32.18% of the sample population were incorrectly classified (<italic>n</italic> = 149), with 22.26% of the White women being incorrectly classified as African American (<italic>n</italic> = 63), and 47.78% (<italic>n</italic> = 86) of the African American women being incorrectly classified as White.</p>

<title>Question 1: Are there differences within batterer intervention programs between White participants and African American participants?</title>
<p>This is the first study of female batterers in which the racial distribution of the sample mirrors that of the population at large. According to data from the 2000–U.S. Census, the racial distribution for women in South Carolina is 66% White, 30.5% African American, and 9.5% Other. The current study’s sample population of female offenders is relatively close to this statistic, consisting of 58% White women and 37% African American women. The few previous studies analyzing female batterers have consistently exhibited populations in which there were much higher percentages of African American women in comparison to percentage of African American women in the population at large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765611429081">Carney &amp; Buttell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765611429081">Henning et al., 2006</xref>). In their studies of female batterer populations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765611429081">Henning et al. (2006)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765611429081">Carney and Buttell (2006)</xref> found racial distributions of African American women in their studies to be overly represented in comparison to the African American population in Tennessee and South Carolina respectively. Henning’s study sample was comprised of 85% African American women, significantly higher than the 16.4% African American population of Tennessee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765611429081">U.S. Census Bureau, n.d.</xref>), 2000). Carney and Buttell’s study sample was comprised of 51% African American women, significantly higher than the 29% African American population of South Carolina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765611429081">U.S. Census Bureau, n.d.</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior studies also found that these disproportionate numbers of African American women in batterer programs were proportionate to typical incarceration rates for African American women in the same geographic locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765611429081">Carney &amp; Buttell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765611429081">Henning et al., 2006</xref>). Past research has indicated that the BIP at the DAC is highly effective in reducing psychological variables related to domestic abuse for both African American and White women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765611429081">Carney &amp; Buttell, 2006</xref>). Therefore, it is interesting to note that the current study population <italic>does not</italic> mirror the typically inflated incarceration rate for African American women in South Carolina, which was 53% in 2004 (South Carolina Department of Corrections, 2004). This would suggest that in the population of African American women being arrested, only a limited portion are receiving social service interventions (such as the BIP examined in the current study). In contrast, it would appear that similarly at-risk White women are receiving social services and not being incarcerated. This is borne out by the results of the logistic regression, which demonstrated that despite no statistical difference in past violent behavior and past criminal behavior based on race in this sample, 18% of the sample’s White women had received, or were currently receiving social service involvement compared to 9% of the African Americans. In addition, 55% of the sample’s White women had received or were currently receiving mental health treatment, compared to 25% of the sample’s African American women.</p>
<p>The data here also revealed significant psychosocial differences between African American and White women mandated into this intervention program. African American batterers, relative to the White batterers, manifested higher levels of self-deception per their BIDR-SD scores, a lower propensity for abuse as represented by their scores on the PAS, lower incidences of being the victim of child or sexual abuse, and reported lower levels of alcohol and drug abuse. Previous studies have speculated that the discriminatory practices of the criminal justice system provide an explanation for why African American women with lower levels of alcohol use and a lower propensity for violence exhibit a higher level of self-deception when entering a BIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765611429081">Carney &amp; Buttell, 2006</xref>). In essence, it is argued that the belief held by African American batterers that they have been unfairly persecuted by a racist criminal justice system yields higher levels of self-deception regarding their role in the domestic violence incident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765611429081">Carney &amp; Buttell, 2006</xref>). While this is a colorable argument in light of the disproportionate representation of African American women in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765611429081">Carney and Buttell (2006)</xref> study (51%), the present study does not reveal a racially disproportionate number of African American women batterers (37%). Thus the underlying reasons for these differences based on race are ripe for further exploration. The implications of this analysis reveal that despite the differences in psychosocial variables between African American and White women mandated into treatment, race remains an ineffective predictor of program involvement.</p>

<title>Question 2: Do socioeconomic factors contribute to risks for battering behavior among women?</title>
<p>The logistic regression performed using the demographic variables of the women constituting this sample on the basis of race reveals three interesting points: (a) While the racial distribution of the sample is reflective of the general population, educational and employment demographics differ from the general population for the White women comprising the study sample; (b) the sample’s White women received more social services than the sample’s African American women; (c) it is thus likely that socioeconomic status contributes to BIP involvement for convicted female batterers.</p>
<p>Although the racial composition of the sample is consistent with the racial composition of South Carolina, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534765611429081">Table 2</xref> reveals no significant difference based on race between the level of education attained by African American and White women in this sample. Interestingly, distribution for level of education for this population corresponded with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765611429081">Henning et al., 2006</xref>), indicating that women batterers as a group tend to have lower levels of education than the population at large. According to the 2000–U.S. Census, 19.1% of Whites in Columbia, SC, have less than a high school education, as opposed to 35.1% of African Americans. Whereas past studies may have attributed the lower level of education within their study populations as a correlate of having larger representation of African American women, there was no significant difference in distribution of level of education between White women and African American women in the present sample. Approximately 33% of each race in this sample reported achieving less than a high school degree. Thus, the White women in this sample are less educated than the general population of South Carolinian White women.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534765611429081">Table 2</xref> also reveals no significant difference based on race between the employment rate of African American and White women; 57% of the women in the sample indicated that they were employed. In contrast, based on the 2000–U.S. Census, 64.8% of the South Carolina White population were members of the labor force compared to 59.2% of African American South Carolinians. Thus a greater percentage of White women in this sample were unemployed.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that lack of education, unemployment, and receipt of social services are all indicators of poverty. The White women in this sample were less educated and less employed than the general population and received significantly more social services and mental health treatment than the sample’s African American population. Broadly speaking, this would appear to be an indicator that socioeconomic status is a defining risk factor for female-initiated domestic violence. Certainly, in this analysis, socioeconomic factors provide a more consistent description of women batterers, regardless of race.</p>

<sec id="section12-1534765611429081">
<title>Question 3: How do male and female batterers differ?</title>
<p>It should be noted that many demographic characteristics of this population are consistent with findings for male batterers in similar intervention programs. Several studies indicate that average relationship length for male batterers is between 7 and 8 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765611429081">Carney &amp; Buttell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765611429081">Jackson et al., 2003</xref>). Female batterers in the current study had a mean relationship length of 6 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.75). This is consistent with the findings for female batterers by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765611429081">Henning et al. (2006)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765611429081">Carney and Buttell (2006)</xref>. Data from the DAC reflects racial distribution consistent for that of the general population for both male and female batterers). In addition, the current study replicates the findings of current research (Henning et al., 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765611429081">Henning &amp; Feder, 2004</xref>) indicating that for both male and female batterers the mean age is in the early 30s (national mean age for male batterers is 31, the mean age for women in the current study is 33), and that two thirds or more do not have an education beyond high school. Consistent with past findings for male batterers, African American women batterers exhibit lower levels of alcohol and drug use than White women, lower scores on the PAS, and higher scores on the BIDR-SD.</p>
<p>There are two implications of these findings. First, it would appear that racial inequities within the criminal justice system and their consequent psychological effects extend across gender lines. Second, it indicates that the populations at risk for domestic violence are consistent across gender lines. The current, limited body of research indicates that interventions designed for men also appear to be effective for reducing psychological predictors of IPV in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765611429081">Carney &amp; Buttell, 2006</xref>). This suggests that domestic violence prevention campaigns should be targeted at individuals who exhibit traits consistent with these psychological predictors, regardless of gender or race. Interestingly, the data for both men and women in these studies indicate that socioeconomic status should be considered in determining risk.</p>

<sec id="section13-1534765611429081">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are several limitations of the current study. First, the appropriateness of the BIDR and PAS for ethnic and female populations had yet to be established. Second, there is no direct data concerning socioeconomic status, making it difficult to clearly define the relationship between this variable and battering behavior. Furthermore, the applicability of this information is limited by the specific setting (i.e., the rural south) of the current population. In addition, the sample is completely comprised of court-mandated batterers, limiting study applications for voluntary participants in batterer intervention programs.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Women constitute the fastest growing population of the criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765611429081">Carney et al., 2006</xref>) with a steady increase seen in the number of female batterers involved in the criminal justice system for domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765611429081">Carney &amp; Buttell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765611429081">Chesney-Lind, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765611429081">Henning &amp; Feder, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534765611429081">Swan &amp; Snow, 2002</xref>). Between 1998 and 2002, the U.S. Department of Justice found that 2.1 million incidents of domestic violence were reported to the police. They also concluded that the reporting rate among female victims was not significantly greater than the reporting rate among male victims. Of these incidents, 36% resulted in arrest.</p>
<p>Because of the prevalence of domestic violence, many states have allocated increased resources and attention to the issue. In South Carolina, the Attorney General identified domestic violence as the number one crime problem in that state. Many states now process domestic violence charges in state criminal court, with assigned prosecutors who work in conjunction with victim advocates, investigators, probation officers, and social service agencies to holistically address the many civil and criminal issues surrounding a domestic violence charge. Consistent with the logic underlying mandatory arrest laws, this system relies on a best evidence practice where the state will pursue a domestic violence case regardless of the victim’s wishes or participation. No longer are cases dismissed because the alleged victim seeks to withdraw the complaint. This trend in prosecuting intimate partner violence cases in criminal court should result in real consequences for defendants in terms of sentencing. Furthermore, reducing recidivism for intimate partner violence depends on the effectiveness of the batterer intervention programs that are often part of the mandated sentence.</p>
<p>In light of both the steady increase of women defendants arrested and prosecuted for domestic violence and the increase in court-allocated resources to combat domestic violence, it is essential for society to better comprehend the nature and scope of female-initiated violence. This study has provided an exploration of the psychological and demographic correlates to IPV present in a large sample of female batterers. Within this population, significant differences in psychosocial factors based on race and surprising similarities in racial demographics were found between the African American and White women. These findings support previous studies that concluded that race was an ineffective and inconsistent predictor of program involvement. In addition, an analysis of the socioeconomic factors of the sample indicate that, regardless of race, poverty is positively correlated with inclusion in this court-mandated BIP. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the demographic characteristics for male and female batterers are consistent within racial classifications.</p>
<p>This information should assist the legal system in tailoring future BIPs to better meet the needs of female batterers in a variety of ways. The foregoing information strongly suggests that the legal system should reevaluate its traditional focus on male-perpetrated IPV and should examine the effectiveness of BIPs on female perpetrators. Since many batterer intervention programs have been shaped by feminist theory and operate within the rubric of patriarchal norms, a reevaluation of the effectiveness of the current therapeutic model of intervention on female clients is required if any headway is to be made in reducing female-initiated IPV. To best serve the female perpetrators, the legal system must become more familiar with the characteristics of females who initiate IPV. For example, this study found that socioeconomic factors provide the more consistent description of female batterers, regardless of their race. This information should be used to better tailor BIPs, not only to address female perpetrators but also to address those females who are struggling with a lack of education and employment. This is relevant information that should be considered in creating the time, place, and manner of court-mandated programs for female batterers to maximize retention and promote effectiveness of the programs. Appropriate and effective treatment for female batterers requires an understanding of the population served and attention to the concerns specific to that population. This study has examined the psychological and demographic characteristics of female batterers with the goal of providing insight into this unique population, which can be used to fashion intervention programs that best serve their participants and ultimately society at large.</p>
