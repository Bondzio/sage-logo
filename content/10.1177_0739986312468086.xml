<abstract>
<p>This article examines first-birth timing among Mexican women in the United States over two birth cohorts. Currently, Mexican women are one of a small group that maintains above-replacement fertility in the United States, contributing to both Mexican population growth and overall national population growth. Yet, the fertility timing of Mexican women has undergone a significant transformation over the past 40 years. Using the 1988, 1995, and 2002 National Survey of Family Growth, this article employs first-birth probabilities and Cox proportional hazard models to show how Mexican fertility timing differs from that of other major racial and ethnic groups. The evidence suggests that the racial/ethnic, nativity, and educational diversity of the Mexican-origin population has led to the emergence of two distinct patterns of first-birth timing. The findings from this study point to the need to reconsider the role of Mexican fertility timing in important national discussions of women’s reproductive health and immigration/population polices.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The fertility contributions of Mexican immigrant women in the United States are significant, as they continue to have the highest birthrates among all women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739986312468086">Bustamente, Jasso, Taylor, &amp; Lagaretta, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0739986312468086">Kahn, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0739986312468086">Ford, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0739986312468086">Stephen, 1989</xref>). With current political discussions surrounding women’s reproductive decision-making, women’s health and health insurance coverage, and national immigration, understanding the fertility patterns of women should be at the forefront of these discussions. While fertility in the United States has remained relatively stable and fairly low over the past two decades, the United States remains a pronatal country and women still desire to have children. However, it has been the timing of this desire that has experienced profound change in the past decades. For all women, the timing of fertility has shifted toward older ages with the average age at first-birth increasing from 22.7 years in 1980 to 25.2 years in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0739986312468086">Martin et al., 2011</xref>). Age at first-birth not only influences the total number of children a woman can have, but also significantly affects a wide range of birth outcomes, including birth weight, birth defects, and the occurrence of multiple births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739986312468086">Chen &amp; Morgan, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0739986312468086">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739986312468086">Sullivan, 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, the average age at first-birth varies widely among women across racial and ethnic lines. This article extends previous work on the timing of first-births by exploring how the fertility timing of Mexican women differs from those of White and Black women.</p>
<p>Mexican women are one of the small groups in America to maintain above-replacement-level fertility—an indication of rapid population growth through reproduction. Widespread studies on Hispanic fertility and childbearing indicate the importance of separately examining Mexican-origin women, as they have markedly different patterns than other Hispanic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739986312468086">Abma &amp; Krivo, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739986312468086">Aneshensel, Fielder, &amp; Becerra, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739986312468086">Carter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0739986312468086">Martin et al., 2011</xref>). In 2009, a Mexican woman averaged 43% more children per woman than a non-Hispanic woman (total fertility rate of 2.64 compared to 1.85; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0739986312468086">Martin et al., 2011</xref>). Compared to their Cuban (total fertility rate of 1.46) and Puerto Rican (total fertility rate of 2.08) counterparts, Mexican women are averaging 1.18 and 0.63 more children, respectively. The Hispanic teenage birthrate remains the highest of any major racial/ethnic group in the United States, a trend that intensifies health disparities for Hispanic women and increases public costs of teenage childbearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739986312468086">Hamilton &amp; Ventura, 2012</xref>). Although teenage childbearing has witnessed national declines among all racial/ethnic groups, the fertility rate for teenagers aged 15 to 19 was 55.7 for Hispanics, 51.5 for Blacks, and 23.5 for Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739986312468086">Hamilton &amp; Ventura, 2012</xref>). With higher teenage birth rates, it is not surprising that Mexican women also have the youngest mean age at first-birth. The average age at first-birth for Mexican women in the United States was 22.5, compared to 26.0 for non-Hispanic White women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0739986312468086">Martin et al., 2009</xref>). Clearly, early age at first-birth for Mexican women is a leading explanation for their corresponding higher completed fertility. This article is guided by the following research questions: How does the socioeconomic diversity of the Mexican-origin population affect their fertility trends? How do immigrant women differ from native-born Mexican women in their fertility timing? How do the patterns of first-birth timing change over time for Mexican women?</p>
<sec id="section2-0739986312468086">
<title>The Importance of Mexican Fertility</title>
<p>There are three major reasons for focusing attention on the fertility experiences of Mexican women in the United States. First, Mexico continues to be the driving force behind population growth in the United States, through immigration and fertility. Between 2000 and 2010, the Mexican American population witnessed a historic demographic dynamic when the number of births surpassed immigration as the leading factor in Mexican population growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739986312468086">Pew Hispanic Center, 2011</xref>). In terms of immigration, Mexico has provided and continues to provide the largest share of legal and illegal immigrants to the United States. In 2010, the Mexican population was nearing 33 million people in the United States. Over two thirds of Hispanics identify their country of origin as Mexico and nearly 36% of Mexicans were foreign born (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0739986312468086">Motel, 2012</xref>). In states such as Texas and California, the Hispanic population now exceeds one third of the state population. In terms of fertility, U.S. births are disproportionately Hispanic and disproportionately Mexican (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739986312468086">Pew Hispanic Center, 2011</xref>). Mostly fueled by the large Mexican immigration wave since 1970, births among Mexican Americans accounted for 63% of the 11.2 million increase in Mexican population growth between 2000 and 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739986312468086">Pew Hispanic Center, 2011</xref>). According to the Pew Hispanic Center, between 2006 and 2010 alone, more than half of all Mexican American births were to Mexican immigrant parents.</p>
<p>Second, Mexican immigrants come from a country where women begin childbearing earlier and have historically had higher fertility rates. In 2009, the mean age at first-birth for women in Mexico was 21.3 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0739986312468086">OECD, 2011</xref>) compared to 22.5 in the United States. As a group, Mexican women are a younger population, resulting in a greater share of women of childbearing age compared to other racial and ethnic groups. And, until the 1990s, large families and high total fertility rates were very prevalent in Mexico. In 1960, women in Mexico averaged 7.3 children, compared to only 3.6 in the United States. Interestingly, fertility rates in Mexico have witnessed such dramatic declines over the past 40 years due to economic growth and modernization that total fertility rates in Mexico (2.36) are now lower than those for Mexican women in the United States (2.64; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739986312468086">Pew Hispanic Center, 2011</xref>). Thus, given the patterns between fertility in Mexico and those of Mexican women in the United States, it is important to examine why Mexican women’s fertility in the United States is not consistent with those of women in Mexico.</p>
<p>Third, the geographic location of Mexico to the United States, coupled with continuous immigration and large ethnic communities in the Southwest regions, has provided opportunities for “cultural replenishment” unlike previous immigration waves (Jimenez, 2011). From a theoretical perspective, the emergence and growth of ethnic communities has challenged the historical assimilation argument that immigrants eventually “blend” into the American mainstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0739986312468086">Bean, Swicegood, &amp; Berg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0739986312468086">Stephen &amp; Bean, 1992</xref>). Contemporary scholarship contends that over time, with the sharing of space, common language, religion, and cultural roots, today’s immigrants are “remaking” the American mainstream (Alba &amp; Nee, 2003). If indeed this is the case, and “cultural replenishment” is shaping Mexican communities and the assimilation processes of Mexican immigrants and their children, then Mexican women might also be “remaking” their fertility norms. Recent studies that use fertility as a measure of immigrant incorporation have confirmed this interesting fertility dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0739986312468086">Bean et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0739986312468086">Dye, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0739986312468086">Frank &amp; Heuveline, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739986312468086">Wildsmith, 2004</xref>). Contrary to a linear assimilation pattern of fertility decline that would show third and later generations of Mexican women to have lower fertility rates than the second generation, contemporary fertility scholars have revealed a more curvilinear pattern of fertility by generational status. Third and later generation Mexican women have a total fertility rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0739986312468086">Bean et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0739986312468086">Dye, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0739986312468086">Frank &amp; Heuveline, 2005</xref>) and nonmarital fertility rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739986312468086">Wildsmith, 2004</xref>) that is higher than second-generation Mexican women. The evidence shows that over time, as women from other ethnic groups witness generational declines in fertility rates, Mexican women in the United States do not.</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>Building upon the claim that Mexican women are exhibiting unique fertility patterns in the United States, this study focuses on whether age-at–first-birth patterns have experienced similar changes over time. The timing of first-births for Mexican women will play a significant role in U.S. population growth, as current reports indicate that population growth from Mexican immigration has come to a standstill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0739986312468086">Passel, Cohn, &amp; Gonzalez-Barrera, 2012</xref>). Therefore, if the United States wants to maintain national population growth, it will come single handedly in the form of Hispanic fertility.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0739986312468086">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The data in this study are from cycles 4 to 6 of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). Collected in 1988, 1995, and 2002, these data include the birth histories of a nationally representative sample of women of reproductive age (15-45). The NSFG has been the premier fertility survey of women in the United States since 1973. Women in the data will have been in childbearing ages between 1958 and 2002. The merged data set covers a distinct period of time during which fertility behaviors have changed dramatically and immigration levels have increased. This data provides a unique opportunity to explore whether changes in the fertility behavior of Mexican women reflect changes in the nature of immigration over time, and how first-birth timing differs among segments of the Mexican population.</p>
<p>All births included in this analysis are first-births that occurred within the United States. To be included in the analysis, Mexican women must have identified themselves as either Hispanic with Mexican origin, and/or report their country of birth as Mexico. I also include White and Black women as comparison groups. The final sample on which I base my analysis consists of 23,595 women, including 1,215 native-born and 903 foreign-born Mexican women.</p>

<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>The analysis conducted in this article centers on a continuous dependent variable utilizing the respondent’s age at first-birth. A duration variable is created that includes the years until a woman experiences a first-birth from the age of 15 years old.</p>

<title>Control Variables</title>
<sec id="section8-0739986312468086">
<title>Birth cohorts</title>
<p>I use birth year to create birth cohorts that measure change over time between groups of women. For descriptive purposes, I use three birth cohorts of women born between 1950 and 1979. However, many women in the 1970s birth cohort have yet to experience a first-birth. Therefore, the analytic models include two birth cohorts. The first cohort, or the “older” cohort, includes women born between 1950 and 1960. These women were of primary childbearing ages between 1965 and 1985, a time period that is simultaneous with the beginning of the immigration waves from Mexico to the United States. The second cohort, or the “younger” cohort, includes women born between 1961 and 1972. These women were of primary childbearing ages between 1976 and 1997 and more likely to experience their first-birth during a time period in which Mexican culture and norms were increasingly more abundant and influential in America. Based on the ethnic resilience argument that emphasizes group size and cultural influence, the incorporation strategies for women in the <italic>older</italic> cohort may be very different than those from women in the <italic>younger</italic> cohort.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0739986312468086">
<title>Educational attainment</title>
<p>In an effort to explore the socioeconomic diversity among the Mexican population, I control for educational attainment as a measure of socioeconomic status. Education is a valid measure of socioeconomic achievement and is also a well-documented measure of assimilation among immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739986312468086">Chen &amp; Morgan, 1991</xref>; Fischer &amp; Marcum, 1988). In addition, the impact of socioeconomic status on Mexican American fertility is substantial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0739986312468086">Bean &amp; Swicegood, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0739986312468086">Bean, Cullen, Stephen, &amp; Swicegood, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739986312468086">Carter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0739986312468086">Forste &amp; Tienda, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739986312468086">Hill &amp; Johnson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0739986312468086">Fischer &amp; Marcum, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0739986312468086">Wildsmith &amp; Raley, 2006</xref>). Simply put, Mexican-origin women with greater levels of education have lower completed fertility. In the analytic models, education is measured as two categories. Those reporting at least some college education or more are identified as having “high” education, while those with a high school degree or less are identified as having “low” education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0739986312468086">
<title>Family background</title>
<p>I also control for the respondents’ mother’s education and mother’s age at first-birth. By including mother’s education, I am able to control for parental socioeconomic status, an indicator of the socioeconomic values in which the respondent was raised. Research is consistent in showing that daughters are less likely to engage in early sexual activity and delay first-birth when their parents have higher levels of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0739986312468086">Miller, Benson, &amp; Galbraith 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0739986312468086">Udry &amp; Billy, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0739986312468086">Voydanoff &amp; Donnelly, 1990</xref>). Similarly, qualitative studies of adolescent Latinas have shown that daughters look to their mothers when facing reproductive health and childbearing decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0739986312468086">Gillam, 2007</xref>). Other studies have shown a strong relationship between mother’s age at first-birth and daughter’s fertility timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0739986312468086">Barber, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0739986312468086">Yamaguchi &amp; Ferguson, 1995</xref>). It is expected that women whose mothers experienced very early births will be more likely to also experience an early birth. Furthermore, I also include controls for the poverty status and geographic residence of women in the analytic sample. The only measure of geographic location available in the NSFG data is a current measure of metropolitan or nonmetropolitan residence. Finally, I include controls for religious affiliation, which have been shown to affect age–at-first-birth patterns among White and Black women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0739986312468086">Rindfuss &amp; St. John, 1983</xref>). This measure is based on the woman’s religious affiliation at the time of the survey and includes four categories: catholic, protestant, other religion, and no religion.</p>

<sec id="section11-0739986312468086">
<title>Analytical Approach</title>
<p>The retrospective data of the NSFG makes it possible to estimate hazard models for the transition to an event by pooling the surveys of women who experienced the event and women who did not. I transformed the data into person–year records to generate one observation for each person–year of life to capture year-to-year variation in variables that could have significant implications for the likelihood and timing of an event. Because the fertility patterns of foreign-born Mexican, native-born Mexican, White, and Black women differ considerably with respect to timing and incidence, I look at results of pooled models and models run separately for these groups. I use person–year records to estimate discrete-time proportional hazard models for the transition to first-birth.</p>

<p>The educational differences between foreign-born Mexican women and native-born Mexican women most likely account for the nativity and ethnic gap in first-birth timing. Nearly 68% of foreign-born Mexican women have less than a high school education compared to 37% of native-born women. Over one third of native-born Mexican women have at least some college education, whereas only 15% of foreign-born women have attended school beyond high school. Compared to White women, Mexican women are educationally disadvantaged.</p>

<title>First-birth probabilities</title>
<p>I begin my analysis by describing first-birth timing of women using a series of conditional first-birth probabilities in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0739986312468086">Table 2</xref>. Within each of these segments, the proportion remaining childless and the proportion that has a first-birth clearly vary by race and ethnicity. According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0739986312468086">Table 2</xref>, 53% of foreign-born Mexicans are still childless by age 24 compared to 59% of native-born Mexicans and 75% of Whites. As the probability of experiencing a first-birth increases with age, so do the differences in the proportion remaining childless across racial and ethnic lines. By the age of 30, only 25% of foreign-born Mexican women are still childless, compared to 44% of their native-born counterparts. Thus, the nativity gap in Mexican women’s fertility expands with age and it is the foreign-born who are more likely to experience a first-birth.</p>

<p>The bottom segment of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0739986312468086">Table 2</xref> explores the proportion of women experiencing a first-birth within the interval of those who are childless at the start of the interval. Again, the results clearly highlight racial and ethnic differences in first-birth timing. Aside from teenage fertility, the foreign-born Mexican population has the greatest proportion of women giving birth at each interval from age 20 to 29. Based on these conditional probabilities, it is clear that the Mexican foreign-born population experiences first-birth fertility at earlier ages and in greater proportions than native-born Mexican, White, and Black women. However, it is unclear whether this pattern has been consistent over time. Another series of first-birth probabilities was examined by birth cohort, but not displayed in this paper. The cohort differences show that Mexican women are experiencing a different pattern of first-birth timing at younger ages compared to White and Black women. The proportion remaining childless between the ages of 22 and 23 years old for both foreign-born and native-born Mexican have not changed over time. However, the proportion of White and Black women remaining childless has increased by 11% and 16%, respectively.</p>
<p>Whereas White and Black women have experienced declines in the proportion of teenage fertility over time, foreign-born and native-born Mexican women have shown increases in the proportion of women experiencing a first-birth before the age of 20. This pattern is especially strong for foreign-born women, indicating a nativity gap in teenage fertility among Mexican women.</p>

<title>Multivariate results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0739986312468086">Table 3</xref> displays the results from the Cox proportional hazard model. This analysis is restricted to the 1995 and 2002 NSFG data and includes 15,737 observations. The 1988 data are excluded because the data does not include the age at arrival for immigrant women and, therefore, cannot guarantee that the first-birth occurred in the United States. The results are presented in the form of hazard ratios. A hazard ratio less than one implies a <italic>lower</italic> risk of experiencing the event while a hazard ratio greater than one implies a <italic>greater</italic> risk of experiencing the event during the interval. According to the zero-order results in Model 1, foreign-born Mexican women are 117% more likely than White women, and native-born Mexican women are 64% more likely than White women to have a first-birth during each interval. Black women are 66% more likely than White women to experience their first-birth. According to these bivariate results, foreign-born Mexican women are making the transition to first-birth much earlier than their native-born counterparts. Thus, a more substantive question that arises is whether these two groups have always exhibited a nativity gap in first-birth timing, and if so, whether this gap has changed over time for Mexican women.</p>

<p>Model 2 includes an interaction term that is the product of race/ethnicity and birth cohort to better examine whether changes in first-birth timing have been occurring at similar rates for each ethnic group. According to these results, there remains a significant racial and ethnic difference in the first-birth timing after controlling for birth cohort. However, these results indicate that women in the younger birth cohort are experiencing delays in first-birth timing compared to women born in the earlier birth cohort. This finding is consistent with others that age at first-birth has increased over time in the United States and holds true for both foreign-born and native-born Mexican women.</p>
<p>Model 3 displays the results from a full analytic model that includes the addition of socioeconomic characteristics, life course factors, and other important control variables such as poverty status, rural residence, and religious affiliation. The important contribution of this model is the addition of an interaction term that is the product of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (education). This measure will show whether the effects of birth cohort and other important controls on first-birth timing operate differently for women across educational attainment.</p>

According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0739986312468086">Figure 1</xref>, foreign-born Mexican women delay first-birth later than their native-born counterparts, but experience a crossover in first-birth timing between the ages of 22 and 23 years old. From this age forward, foreign-born Mexican women experience first-births earlier and in larger proportions than native-born women. At the age of 25, only 20% of the foreign-born remain childless compared to 28% of the native-born women.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0739986312468086">Figure 2</xref> displays the same survival curve analysis, but for women in the younger birth cohort (1961-1972). It is evident that these women are experiencing a different pattern of first-birth timing compared to their older counterparts. The nativity gap in this figure is clearly reduced. It appears that the survival curve of native-born women has shifted to more closely resemble the curve of foreign-born women. At the age of 25, only 20% of the foreign-born are still childless compared to 23% of native-born women. Compared to the results from the older birth cohort in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0739986312468086">Figure 1</xref>, native-born women have experienced declines in the proportion remaining childless over time. At the age of 25, native-born women have exhibited a 5% decline in the proportion remaining childless between the two birth cohorts. The data confirm that native-born Mexican women, in more recent birth cohorts, are experiencing first-births earlier. Cumulatively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0739986312468086">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0739986312468086">2</xref> tell a unique story about the fertility timing of Mexican women with low levels of education. While the foreign-born have not witnessed much change in their first-birth timing, native-born Mexican women are showing the most change over time. Before the age of 25, fertility timing is occurring earlier among native-born Mexican women with a high school education or less. This pattern of earlier first-birth timing for Mexican women with low education has implications for the total fertility of these women, as earlier first-birth timing is directly associated with higher fertility.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0739986312468086">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0739986312468086">4</xref> display results for foreign-born and native-born Mexican women with high education by birth cohort. Similar to the patterns of their less educated counterparts, the nativity gap is widest among women in the older cohort, those born between 1950 and 1960. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0739986312468086">Figure 3</xref>, foreign-born women experience first-birth earlier at every age compared to the native born. At the age of 25, 31% of foreign-born women remain childless compared to 63% of their native-born counterparts. Mexican women with at least some college education are delaying first-birth timing compared to women with less education, but they still exhibit a rather large nativity gap.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0739986312468086">Figure 4</xref> displays the survival curve for women born between 1961 and 1972. For these women, the nativity gap is much smaller. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0739986312468086">Figure 4</xref>, the nativity gap has been narrowed due to changes in the fertility timing of foreign-born women. At the age of 25, nearly 53% of the foreign born remain childless compared to 60% of the native born. Over time, highly educated foreign-born Mexican women are delaying first-birth timing, while native-born Mexican women have experienced a more stable pattern. The 23% increase between the two birth cohorts among foreign-born women remaining childless at the age of 25 offers a much different story from the patterns of women with low education. Whereas the native born experienced the most change over time among Mexican women with low education, it is the foreign born witnessing the most dramatic change in first-birth timing among Mexican women with higher education.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These results provide an empirical basis on which to begin exploring the role of Mexican fertility on population growth in the United States. As the primary driver of current and future U.S. population growth, Mexican fertility should be at the forefront of women’s health discussions and social/political policy change. Most fertility research on Mexican women in the United States has focused on completed fertility and their above-replacement-level fertility rates. However, this study shows that first-birth timing deserves much more scholarly attention. The findings in this article point to two distinct patterns of first-birth timing among Mexican women. Each of these patterns has significant implications for the composition of the U.S. population.</p>
<p>The first pattern shows that native-born women with low education are experiencing earlier first-birth timing over time. These women are witnessing shifts in fertility timing that more closely resemble the patterns of their foreign-born counterparts who begin childbearing earlier. Because Mexico has maintained an earlier age at first-birth, it is not surprising that foreign-born women in the United States will begin childbearing earlier. However, the surprising result is that the fertility timing of native-born Mexican women is undergoing an unfamiliar shift. Historically, Mexican fertility patterns have proscribed to a linear assimilation model of change. Over time, both age at first-birth and total fertility rates have become more similar to those of the majority group (White women) in the United States. Yet, my data suggest that among the least educated women, the linear model of fertility timing has been interrupted. Native-born Mexican women in lower socioeconomic positions are challenging traditional patterns of assimilation and essentially <italic>remaking</italic> their fertility norms. With the constant influx of immigrant arrivals and a high fertility rate, the Mexican population has grown significantly over the last 40 years. As such, the influence of Latino culture and norms has become more discernible and influential, especially in large ethnic communities. As scholars have noted, the sharing of space, common language, religion, and cultural roots have created mainstream opportunities for Latino cultural replenishment (Alba &amp; Nee, 2003; Jimenez, 2011) and there is no <italic>one-size-fits-all</italic> explanation for the complex relationship between acculturation and childbearing outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0739986312468086">Biggs et al., 2010</xref>). The changing nature of fertility timing among native-born Mexican women in lower socioeconomic positions corresponds to fertility behaviors found in other studies, such as increased total fertility rates and nonmarital fertility rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0739986312468086">Bean et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0739986312468086">Dye, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0739986312468086">Frank &amp; Heuveline, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739986312468086">Wildsmith, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The second unique pattern found in this study shows that foreign-born women with high education are delaying first-birth timing over time. Even though foreign-born women come from a country that has until very recently been extremely pronatal, those with at least some college education are delaying childbearing, and doing so increasingly over time. While this pattern of delayed childbearing among the more highly educated is not novel, and models a traditional assimilation path, it is the dramatic increase occurring over two birth cohorts that is significant. Historically, fertility has been a behavior that requires several generations to witness dramatic change, especially among immigrant groups in the United States. Yet, for these highly educated Mexican immigrant women, change occurred much sooner, in the span of one birth cohort. The primary explanation for this rapid change is that early childbearing would impede the assimilation process and produce opportunity costs for these women. The time between 1976 and 1997, the period of first-birth timing for women in the younger cohort, was at the height of the largest immigration wave in the history of the United States. Immigrant women from Mexico were benefitting from economic restructuring and labor market growth in the United States, both of which opened labor market doors for the most highly skilled and educated women. The rapid succession of U.S. mainstream fertility norms to educated foreign-born women is both noticeable and significant.</p>
<p>Largely, this study shows that two distinct patterns of fertility timing are emerging among Mexican women. The distinctiveness of the patterns relies on differences in nativity and education, which both lead to an important discussion of the future composition of the Mexican population in the United States. On one end, Mexican fertility is becoming the only driving force behind population growth in the United States. Yet, the bulk of this fertility will come from Mexican women in lower socioeconomic positions who begin childbearing earlier and will experience higher completed fertility. Consequently, early childbearing commences a challenging track of structural barriers for these women that may perpetuate a cycle of poor socioeconomic achievement and early childbearing for their children. On the other end, Mexican women with the greatest opportunities for socioeconomic success are delaying childbearing altogether, resulting in below-replacement fertility for these women. In the past, it required several generations for fertility behaviors to align with mainstream fertility norms. However, today’s Mexican immigrant women with higher educational attainment have abruptly nixed the multiple-generation transfer of fertility norms. Instead, they swiftly delayed childbearing, leaving very little room for population growth from these women. If this distinct cycle of Mexican fertility is realized, the future of U.S. population growth will face important health, social, educational, and economic questions. As current debates about women’s reproductive rights and access to contraceptives intensify, it is important that health professionals, education specialists, and policymakers recognize the role of Mexican women’s fertility in their decisions.</p>
