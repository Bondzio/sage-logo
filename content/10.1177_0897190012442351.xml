<abstract>
<p>The potential for biological weapons to be used in terrorism is a real possibility. Biological weapons include infectious agents and toxins. Toxins are poisons produced by living organisms. Toxins relevant to bioterrorism include ricin, botulinum, <italic>Clostridium perfrigens</italic> epsilson toxin, conotoxins, shigatoxins, saxitoxins, tetrodotoxins, mycotoxins, and nicotine. Toxins have properties of biological and chemical weapons. Unlike pathogens, toxins do not produce an infection. Ricin causes multiorgan toxicity by blocking protein synthesis. Botulinum blocks acetylcholine in the peripheral nervous system leading to muscle paralysis. Epsilon toxin damages cell membranes. Conotoxins block potassium and sodium channels in neurons. Shigatoxins inhibit protein synthesis and induce apoptosis. Saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin inhibit sodium channels in neurons. Mycotoxins include aflatoxins and trichothecenes. Aflatoxins are carcinogens. Trichothecenes inhibit protein and nucleic acid synthesis. Nicotine produces numerous nicotinic effects in the nervous system.</p>

<p>The United States has been on heighted alert for terrorism since the attacks on September 11, 2001. The anthrax letters that soon followed added to the concerns with terrorism. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) defines terrorism as “the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012442351">1</xref>
</sup> Amid these concerns are preparations by various government agencies and the private sector regarding potential attacks with chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives (CBRNE).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012442351">2</xref>
</sup> Management of CBRNE events includes public safety, political, forensic, clinical, disaster response, and environmental issues to name a few.</p>
<p>Biological weapons can include replicating agents and nonreplicating agents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012442351">3</xref>
</sup> Replicating agents involve live organisms or spores. Replicating agents are also known as pathogens or infectious agents. Examples of replicating agents include anthrax, plague, tularemia, brucellosis, Q fever, smallpox, and viral hemorrhagic fevers. Nonreplicating agents are toxins. Toxins are effective and specific poisons produced by living organisms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012442351">4</xref>
</sup> Toxins with potential as terrorist weapons include botulinum, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), diphtheria, trichothecene mycotoxins, and ricin. Toxins from a pharmacological and toxicological perspective can be considered chemical weapons.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012442351">5</xref>
</sup> However, most CBRNE experts and the US Army classify toxins as biological weapons.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012442351">6</xref>
</sup> The Chemical Weapons Convention considers some toxins such as saxitoxin and ricin to be chemical weapons.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012442351">4</xref>
</sup> A significant exposure to a toxin produces a poisoning, whereas a pathogen produces an infection. Toxins, unlike infectious diseases, lack an incubation period although a latent period may occur before the onset of symptoms. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190012442351">Table 1</xref> for a contrast of toxins with traditional chemical weapons. The list is not absolute though with the comparisons. The mycotoxins can be dermally reactive. Cyanide is produced on a limited scale naturally. Biological agents may be produced by recombinant expression or chemical synthesis. Toxins are immunoreactive, whereas traditional chemical weapons are not. The implications of an immune response are that potential vaccines can be developed to protect against the toxins.</p>

<p>Risks of toxin exposure from terrorism include aerosol dispersal and contamination of food sources. Toxins are not volatile so they would need to be aerosolized in order to make an effective dispersal over a relatively large area (eg, a crowded sports arena). Another barrier to production of bioweapons is the creation of the optimal particle size of 1 to 3 µm.<sup>

</p>
<p>The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish and regulate a list of biological agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a high threat to public health and safety.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012442351">8</xref>
</sup> The lead agency in HHS is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Agricultural Bioterrorism Protection Act of 2002 requires the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish and regulate a list of biological agents with the potential to produce a high threat to the animal health and safety, plant health and safety, or to the safety of animal or plant products. The lead agency in USDA is the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). The CDC and APHIS share responsibility for some agents because they are a potential threat to humans and animals. Both agencies collaborate to maintain the National Select Agent Registry, which can be found at www.selectsagents.gov. A “Select Agents and Toxins List” can be found on the Web site. Toxins on this list include abrin, ricin, botulinum neurotoxins, <italic>Clostridium perfringens </italic>epsilon toxin, conotoxins, saxitoxin, shigatoxin, staphylococcal enterotoxins, T-2 toxin, and tetrodotoxin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012442351">8</xref>
</sup> Examples of infectious agents on the CDC select agent list include Ebola virus, Lassa fever virus, <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, and Marburg virus. Examples of USDA infectious agents include African horse sickness virus, sheep pox virus, and Goat pox virus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012442351">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The CDC also has another classification for potential agents of bioterrorism. The categories are A, B, and C. Category A agents possess a high risk to national security.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012442351">9</xref>
</sup> Category A agents are so categorized because they can be easily disseminated or spread from person to person, result in high mortality rate and substantially impact public health, might cause public panic and social disruption, and require special action for preparedness. Category A agents include anthrax (<italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>), botulism, plague (<italic>Y pestis</italic>), smallpox, tularemia (<italic>Francisella tularensis</italic>), and viral hemorrhagic fevers. Category B agents are so categorized because they are moderately easy to disseminate, result in moderate morbidity rates and low mortality rates, and require specific enhancements of CDC diagnostic capacity, and enhanced disease surveillance. Category B agents include brucellosis, epsilon toxin, food safety threats, glanders (<italic>Burkholderia mallei</italic>), melioidosis (<italic>Burkhoderia pseudomallei</italic>), Q fever (<italic>Coxiella burnetti</italic>), ricin, staphylococcal enterotoxins, typhus fever (<italic>Rickettsia prowazekii</italic>), viral encephalitis, and water safety threats. Category C agents are so categorized because they are emerging pathogens that could be engineered for mass dissemination in the future because of availability, ease of production, and potential for high morbidity and mortality and a major health impact. Category C agents include emerging agents such as Nipah virus and hantavirus.</p>
<p>Pharmacists are a valuable resource when dealing with actual or potential toxin attack. Their knowledge of chemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, toxicology, and therapeutics makes them an asset to health care facilities and government agencies. This article will focus on the clinical effects of some potential toxin weapons and their treatment.</p>

<title>Notable Toxin Incidents</title>
<p>George Markov was a Bulgarian writer who defected to the West. He was highly critical of the communist regime in Bulgaria. Markov worked for British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) World Service. While waiting for a bus in London on September 7, 1978, George Markov was stabbed by a dart filled with ricin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012442351">10</xref>
</sup> The dart was fired from an adapted umbrella. During the attack, he felt a sharp pain in his leg and witnessed a man picking up an umbrella. A red swelling appeared on the thigh. He then went home where he soon developed a high fever. The next day, he was admitted to the hospital and was diagnosed with septicemia. Markov died on September 11, 1978. An autopsy located a pellet containing ricin. The autopsy also revealed pulmonary edema. Small hemorrhages were found over the heart, intestines, and lymph nodes.<sup>

</p>
<p>Alexander Haig, when Secretary of State, on September 13, 1981, accused the Soviet Union of supplying trichothecene mycotoxins to communist regimes in Vietnam and Laos to suppress insurgents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190012442351">12</xref>
</sup> During the summer of 1975, refuges report a number of toxic chemicals were being released from aircraft. Most of the reports involve a yellow oily liquid being released. Exposure to this substance caused hemorrhaging from the nose and gums, blindness, tremors, and seizures. Samples were analyzed at the University of Minnesota. Trichorothecane mycotoxins were detected in concentrations and mixtures not known to occur in nature. The results of the analysis have been challenged by scientists at Harvard University.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190012442351">13</xref>
</sup> Challenges include a lack of forensic testing of the samples, inconsistencies among the witnesses, and lack of well-documented medical effects.</p>
<p>In November 2003, ricin was discovered in the White House mailroom. In 2004, ricin was discovered in the mailroom of Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012442351">11</xref>
</sup> The FBI arrested 3 men on November 1, 2011, who were planning to use ricin in attack against government officials and US citizens.<sup>

<sec id="section4-0897190012442351">
<title>Ricin</title>
<p>Ricin is a poison produced and found in castor beans from the <italic>Ricinus communis</italic>, a flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190012442351">15</xref>
</sup> The plant is widespread throughout tropical regions of the world. Pure ricin is a white powder and soluble in water.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012442351">16</xref>
</sup> Ricin is stable over a wide range of pH. Ricin is a by-product of castor oil production. Accidental exposure to ricin is unlikely, with the exception of ingestion of castor beans. Ricin is a terrorism risk and people could be exposed through air, food, or water. The military explored the use of ricin as a warfare agent in the 1940s.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012442351">11</xref>
</sup> Ricin has been studied as a possible anticancer drug.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012442351">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Ricin is a glycoprotein lectin with an A and B chain. A disulfide bond connects the A and B chains. The B chain is a lectin and binds to galactose containing glycoproteins and glycolipids found on the surface of cells. The A chain inhibits eukaryotic ribosomes by removal of a single adenine from the 28 ribosomal RNA loop contained within the 60 subunit. This halts polypeptide elongation (ie, protein synthesis) and results in cell death.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012442351">16</xref>
</sup> Other mechanisms of toxicity include direct membrane damage, apoptosis pathway, and promoting the release of cytokines.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012442351">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>With inhalation, the symptoms will appear within a few hours.<sup>

</sup> Clinical manifestations may include respiratory distress, fever, cough, and tightness in the chest. Pulmonary edema would likely occur and could be diagnosed with a chest X-ray and a stethoscope. Hypotension and circulatory collapse would follow. Laboratory studies in monkeys indicate widespread pulmonary edema with multiple areas of necrosis and inflammation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012442351">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Ingestion of ricin would produce vomiting and diarrhea.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190012442351">18</xref>
</sup> Severe dehydration and low blood pressure may follow. Other signs can include hallucinations, seizures, and blood in the urine. Differential diagnosis for ingestion of ricin includes enteric pathogens, mushrooms (eg, <italic>Amanita phalloides</italic>), caustics (eg, acids and bases), metal iron, arsenic, and colchicines.<sup>

</sup> The onset of symptoms is often within 4 to 6 hours of ingestion but can be late as 10 hours. Multiorgan failure should include a differential diagnosis of abrin, heavy metals (eg, arsenic, mercury, copper, lead, cadmium, etc).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012442351">16</xref>
</sup> Abrin, a closely related to ricin, is found in the bean of the <italic>Abrus precatorius</italic> plant. The toxicity for abrin is greater than ricin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190012442351">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Nonspecific laboratory findings with ricin poisoning include metabolic acidosis, elevated liver function tests, hyperbiliribinemia, anemia, elevated renal function tests, hematuria, and leukocytosis. Differential diagnosis for inhalation ricin exposure includes phosgene, SEB, by-products of organofluorines, and chlorine.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012442351">16</xref>

</sup> Treatment is nonspecific and supportive. Consider a single dose of activated charcoal for nonvomiting patients. Supportive treatment includes fluid and electrolyte replacement and vasopressors. Inhalational exposure treatments include oxygen, bronchodilators, endotracheal intubation, and supplemental end positive expiratory pressure. Contaminated clothing and jewelry should be removed. The skin should be washed with soap and copious amounts of water.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012442351">16</xref>
</sup> The pulmonary edema from aerosol ricin is not cardiogenic so diuretics should not be used. Research is underway to develop a vaccine against ricin. The Army started clinical trials<sup>

<title>Botulinum</title>
<p>Botulinum toxin is the most poisonous substance known with an LD<sub>50</sub> in humans of 1 ng/kg.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190012442351">21</xref>
</sup> Botulinum toxin is primarily produced by <italic>Clostridium botulinum</italic>, an encapsulated gram-positive anaerobic bacterium. It is found in soil and untreated water throughout the world.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190012442351">22</xref>
</sup> The resulting disease from botulinum is botulism which is a neuroparalytic disease. There are 4 forms of naturally occurring botulism: foodborne botulism (from ingestion of preformed toxin), infant botulism (from ingestion of <italic>C botulinum</italic> which produces toxin in the intestinal tract), wound botulism (from contamination of the wound with <italic>C botulinum</italic> which produces toxin), and adult intestinal contamination (a rare disease where <italic>C botulinum</italic> colonizes the intestines of adults or children, usually occurs with intestinal abnormalities).<sup>

</sup> Rarely botulism can be caused by <italic>Clostridium butyricum</italic> and <italic>Clostridium barati</italic>. Botulinum toxin is commercially available as a pharmaceutical product. Approved Food and Drug Administration (FDA) uses for pharmaceutical grade botulinum toxin include strabismus, blepharospasm, cervical dystonia, moderate to severe glabellar lines (wrinkles on the forehead), and severe axillary hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating in the underarms). Note specific labeled indications vary between individual products.</p>
<p>Botulism was first described by Justinus Kerner in 1817.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190012442351">21</xref>
</sup> The German physician Mϋller coined the term botulism when he reported cases resulting from contaminated sausage. Botulism comes from the Latin word <italic>botulus</italic> meaning “sausage.” The bacteria was discovered in 1895 and the toxin was first isolated in 1928.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190012442351">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>There are seven kinds of botulinum toxins (A-G). Types A, B, E, and rarely F cause disease in humans.<sup>

</sup> Botox<sup>®</sup> is botulinum type A produced from fermentation of Hall strain C botulinum. Types C and D cause disease in birds and mammals. The most common source of accidental exposure is improper home canning of fruits, vegetables, and meats. Type E botulism is almost exclusively from aquatic animals. Type G has not been found to cause paralytic disease in humans or animals. Type G has been associated with sudden death in humans.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190012442351">21</xref>
</sup> Type G is produced by <italic>Clostridium argentinense</italic>. This bacteria was previously classified as a type of <italic>Clostridium botulinum</italic>. Type A toxin is the most common toxin in the west of the Mississippi, whereas type B toxin is the most common in the east of the Mississippi.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190012442351">22</xref>
</sup> The Pacific Northwest (eg, Alaska) and the Great Lakes region is where type E is found. Toxin type E is produced by <italic>C botulism </italic>and <italic>C butyricum</italic>. Type F is produced by <italic>C baratti</italic>. <italic>C botulinum </italic>produced type A, type B, and type E toxins. The average incidence according to the CDC is 110 cases per year.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190012442351">22</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The toxin is a high-molecular-weight protein with 3 components: a heavy chain, a light chain, and a nontoxic hemagglutinin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190012442351">21</xref>
</sup> The heavy chain has the ganglioside binding and translocation domains permitting the toxin to bind with the cell. The light chain contains zinc-dependent endopeptidase which enables the toxin to stop the calcium release. The nontoxic components may help protect the toxin from heat and enzymes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190012442351">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The toxin is spread through the bloodstream. The toxin then binds to receptors on the presynaptic cholinergic terminals. The toxin is internalized into vesicles and translocated to cytosol.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A wide variety of toxins have potential as terrorist weapons. These toxins can come from bacterial, fungal, plant, or animal sources. The most potent toxin is botulinum. The dispersal of aerosolized agents in a concentrated population area is the most dangerous scenario and perhaps the most likely method to be used by terrorists. Many of the effects of aerial dispersal are unknown. Predictions can be made on natural or accidental exposure to the toxin. Pharmacists can be a resource in the clinical management of toxin exposures.</p>
