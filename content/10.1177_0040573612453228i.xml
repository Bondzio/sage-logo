<p>Mark Lewis Taylor is a Princeton Seminary professor who has long engaged the weight of the world, whether in Chiapas, Mexico, or with the prison industrial complex here in the USA. His new work is a brilliant book that anyone interested in theology should read. It is not an easy read, as it interprets and interacts with several thinkers of our time: Foucault, Schatzki, Nancy, and Bourdieu to name but a few. However, Taylor navigates this difficult path by choosing and explaining his words very carefully, and so develops his argument clearly.</p>
<p>His insights are critical for upending “theology,” the formal guild in its white male Europeanness, with the order placed on the “study of God.” Similarly, he challenges “Politics” with the “order” placed on the world politically. He opposes the oppressiveness of the two. The “theological” and the “political” in contrast are those “seething” aspects of life excluded from theology and politics, but ever-present and interruptive. He critiques our guild for its refusal to change or even to acknowledge the constant shifting and moving of our world, but he moves beyond these parameters. The theological is theology’s Hydra, perceived to be negative, unwieldy, and messy by the guild. However, in reality, these are the sites of hope, the possibility for liberation and change. The structure of the book is clear, progressing from theory to practice, noting the critical intrusions of the “theological” throughout.</p>
<p>The five chapters examine (1) the theological, (2) the political (3) transimmanence (4), the weight of transimmanence, and (5) its radical practices, with the last two chapters focusing on the issue of torture. In his first chapter he articulates the theological as a “haunting.” This haunting emerges from the people suffering under and within the weight of the world, oppressed, excluded, suffocating. I think of it as the release of an earthquake, always there under the surface, occasionally disrupting the order imposed on the world. In the theological it often erupts through art (what Taylor terms art-force).</p>
<p>In the second chapter, Taylor analyzes the political itself and its connections to politics and to agony. This agony plays out in two ways: first, in our being enmeshed in practices as part of a society and, second, in being misrecognized and misplaced in that society. This includes being ignored or forced to fit another’s assumption in order to support the existing order. Like the plates of the earth, that order is always shifting and moving, although we deem it permanent.</p>
<p>The third chapter explores the notion of “transimmanence,” between transcendence and immanence, neither rejecting nor limiting itself to one or the other. Transimmanence is that erupting of one sphere into another, moving within and between the liminal spaces. He explores this eruption through art, in particular poetry on lynching and from the Guantanamo Detention Center. In his fourth chapter, Taylor brings together the discussions of transimmanence and weight to analyze torture. He uses the notion of “spectral humans” (from Butler) to analyze the weighing-in of the theological. Finally, he tightens his analysis in the fifth chapter with a reflection on Sr. Diana Ortiz’s discussion of her own experience of torture and survival, her weighing-in with the living and the dead to challenge the practice of torture.</p>
<p>As I wrestled with this book, I was left with two questions. The first centers around the survivors of torture, the spectral humans themselves. While I accept that their experiences can teach us (those of us in the guild of theology) much, I worry about placing responsibility on the sufferer to do so. Second, I kept wondering what happens next. Does the theological upend theology itself? Should it? If not, are the marginalized left at the margins? Where do we go from here? Perhaps some of these questions will be addressed in the next work.</p>
<p>Working through this book is thoroughly worthwhile and will change the way you think about the field. Spend eight hours sitting, notebook or iPad in hand, and read this book. Take notes. Mull it over. Let it sink in. Then work through it again.</p>
