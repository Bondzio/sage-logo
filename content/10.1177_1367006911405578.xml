<abstract>
<p>This article investigates the transfer of verb-second syntax (V2) from L1 German and Dutch into L2 English. A comparative learner corpus analysis between L1 German, Dutch and French, and native English writing reveals that the German and Dutch speakers produce distinct patterns of inversion in declarative clauses, indicating the transfer of V2. They produce non-target subject–auxiliary inversion and copula inversion. However, other reflexes of V2 in interrogatives or with sentential negation are not produced. This is analysed as evidence that the German and Dutch learners have mastered the syntax of English but transfer continues to occur at the level of discourse-pragmatics, where L1 preferences for topicalization structures continue to transfer. This is in line with predictions of the Interface Hypothesis in second language acquisition, which assumes that the interfaces of syntax with other modules of the grammar are more difficult to acquire and may continue to show L1 effects even after the narrow syntax has been mastered.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Transfer is often at the centre of theorizing in generative approaches to second language acquisition (SLA). Discussion has revolved around the role of transfer at the initial state and subsequent parameter resetting (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367006911405578">Eubank, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367006911405578">Schwartz &amp; Sprouse, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367006911405578">Vainikka &amp; Young-Scholten, 1996</xref>). Recently, attention has focused more on the nature of near-native L2 competence and a significant body of opinion has coalesced around the Interface Hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367006911405578">Sorace &amp; Filiaci, 2006</xref>), which states that at near-native stages of L2 acquisition (or in other contact situations such as bilingual first language acquisition and L1 attrition), the interfaces between narrow syntax and other modules of the grammar are vulnerable to transfer effects, while narrow syntax itself, i.e. elements internal to the syntactic computation, is resilient to transfer or attrition. In particular it has been suggested that the interface between syntax and discourse-pragmatics is prone to residual L1 effects, i.e. continued infrequent transfer even after learners have achieved a high proficiency level (or even near-native proficiency) in the L2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367006911405578">Sorace, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367006911405578">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study examines the transfer of the verb-second constraint into the L2 English of L1 German and Dutch speakers from the point of view of the Interface Hypothesis by comparing the production of inversion and verb movement diagnostics to the production of French L1 learners whose L1 does not have a V2 constraint. While V2, and verb movement in general, has enjoyed a privileged status in studies of the transfer of parametric settings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367006911405578">Beck, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367006911405578">Vainikka &amp; Young-Scholten; 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367006911405578">White, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367006911405578">1992</xref>, inter alia), it has not been studied in the emerging interface stream of research. An analysis of the transfer of V2 from an interface perspective has a bearing on a number of issues raised in the introduction to this special issue. Chief among these is the question of what linguistic levels are affected by transfer in addition to more general issues of the role of transfer in SLA.</p>
<p>The article is organized as follows. The terminological issues around transfer and interference outlined by Grosjean (this issue) are outlined in connection with a presentation of the Interface Hypothesis in section 2. The comparative syntax of German/Dutch and English and previous SLA studies involving V2–V3 language pairs are outlined in section 3. The corpora and corpus methodology which form the basis of the study are presented in section 4, and results are presented and discussed in the final sections.</p>

<title>2. Transfer, interference and the Interface Hypothesis</title>
<p>The precise conceptualization of an interface in linguistic theory is the subject of some variation in different theoretical models (see papers in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367006911405578">Ramchand &amp; Reiss, 2007</xref> for a theoretical overview). SLA researchers have not on the whole adopted a particular interface model from theorists but rely on the whole on interfaces between traditional descriptive modules of the grammar, usually syntax with one or more of discourse-pragmatics, morphology, phonology or semantics. Research on the interfaces in SLA has tended to study the production and interpretation of pronominal subjects in the L2 acquisition of a pro-drop language as a ‘privileged’ area of research on the syntax–discourse interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367006911405578">Belletti, Bennatti, &amp; Sorace, 2007</xref>, p. 661). Other detailed proposals, however, have been made for interface accounts of different linguistic phenomena implicating other modules of grammar (on syntax–morphology see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367006911405578">Lardiere, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367006911405578">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367006911405578">Prévost &amp; White, 2000</xref>; on syntax–lexicon see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367006911405578">Montrul, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367006911405578">Sorace, 1993</xref>; for syntax–semantics see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367006911405578">Montrul &amp; Slabakova, 2003</xref>; on the interaction of various interfaces in word order variation in L2A see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367006911405578">Lozano &amp; Mendikoetxea, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>For present purposes, the Interface Hypothesis is defined as the generalization that ‘narrow syntactic properties are completely acquirable in a second language, even though they may exhibit significant developmental delays, whereas interface properties involving syntax and another cognitive domain may not be fully acquirable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367006911405578">Sorace &amp; Filiaci, 2006</xref>, p. 340). This gives rise to variability even at the most advanced stages of acquisition, where advanced and near-native learners’ grammars will tend still to license non-target structures, leading to differences in production and comprehension compared to native speakers. In production then, it is to be expected that near-native speakers of an L2 will optionally produce non-target forms in interface areas alongside target L2 forms. A further assumption that has usually been made in connection with the Interface Hypothesis is that there is continued L1 interference at the interfaces at advanced stages of L2A. L1 interference is understood as ‘<italic>unsystematic L1 effects</italic> surfacing in the L2 speakers’ production’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367006911405578">Sorace, 2006</xref>, pp. 111–112, my emphasis). Recent research has, however, proposed that the residual difficulties are at the general processing level of handling two languages simultaneously rather than due specifically to L1 influence on syntactic representations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367006911405578">Sorace, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367006911405578">Sorace &amp; Filiaci, 2006</xref>). The analysis advanced in the present article assumes an L1-influenced representational deficit while acknowledging that this is in many ways an artefact of the corpus methodology adopted, which is not conducive to a consideration of online processing factors. Nevertheless, from a theoretical and terminological point of view, the distinction between representation and processing is an important one and is reminiscent of the distinction Grosjean (this issue) draws between transfer and interference or dynamic and static cross-linguistic influence, where transfer could be equated with differences in knowledge representation and interference with processing difficulties. Viewed from the point of view of a corpus of learner production, this sort of distinction is in effect a restatement of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367006911405578">Corder’s (1967)</xref> seminal distinction between errors and mistakes. Second language learners produce errors as a result of systematic differences in their underlying competence, while mistakes are the result of intermittent problems exploiting that competence in online production. More efforts within the Interface Hypothesis are now being concentrated on identifying the source of processing difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367006911405578">Sorace, 2009</xref>) and it is no doubt the case that a more complex and subtle picture of the processing of interface properties in different bilingual populations will emerge as more data become available.</p>
<p>However, for the purposes of this article, no matter whether instances of cross-linguistic influence are ‘permanent, or relatively permanent, traces of one language on another’ or ‘ephemeral intrusions of the other language’ (Grosjean, this issue), the Interface Hypothesis predicts that the linguistic levels which will be most affected are where syntax interfaces with other modules of the grammar or other cognitive domains.</p>
<p>An illustration of L1 influence in production comes from the distribution of overt subject pronouns in the near-native L2 Italian of English native speakers ((1) and (2) from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367006911405578">Sorace (2006</xref>, pp. 112–113):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(1) a. Perche Maria è andata via?</p>
<p>    Why Maria is gone away?</p>
<p>  b. (perche) lei ha trovato un altro lavoro.</p>
<p>    (because) she has found another job.</p>
<p>  c. (perche) ____ ha trovato un altro lavoro.</p>
<p>    (because) has found another job.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sorace argues that, in these examples, the answer in (1b) would be typical of English L1 speakers of Italian, even at near-native stages of acquisition, where they optionally realize the subject overtly whereas a native speaker of Italian would more naturally produce (1c) in this context with a null subject pronoun. A similar pattern can be observed for the position of the subject in relation to the verb in the examples in (2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367006911405578">Sorace, 2006</xref>, p. 113):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(2) a. Che cosa è successo?</p>
<p>    ‘What happened?’</p>
<p>  b. Gianni è partito</p>
<p>    Gianni is left.</p>
<p>  c. È partito Gianni.</p>
<p>    Is left Gianni.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The continued residual optionality of overt and/or pre-verbal subjects in production, apparently due to the influence of L1 English, shows that even though the learners have acquired a null-subject grammar, i.e. a grammar that syntactically licenses null and post-verbal subjects, they have not completely acquired the pragmatic constraints on the distribution of these subjects in discourse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1367006911405578">1</xref></sup> Similarly, it will be claimed that for V2-L1 learners of English, they have acquired the fact that English does not have a general V2 requirement in syntax, but that the encoding of discourse-pragmatic options proves more difficult to acquire and there may be continued optional transfer of V2 in restricted contexts involving non-target subject–verb inversion.</p>

<sec id="section3-1367006911405578">
<title>3. Linguistic background: V2 in English and German/Dutch</title>
<p>V2 distribution in German and Dutch is outlined in (3). The finite verb in main clauses always occupies second position, while virtually any adverbial or argumental XP may be fronted to clause-initial position:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(3) a. Ich kenne seit Jahren die Babsi.</p>
<p>  b. Ik ken Babsi al jaren.</p>
<p>    ‘I have known Babsi for years.’</p>
<p>  c. Die Babsi kenne ich seit Jahren.</p>
<p>  d. Babsi ken ik al jaren.</p>
<p>    Babsi know I since years.</p>
<p>  e. Seit Jahren kenne ich die Babsi.</p>
<p>  f. Al jaren ken ik Babsi.</p>
<p>    Since years know I Babsi.</p>
<p>  g. *Seit Jahren ich kenne die Babsi.</p>
<p>  h. *Al jaren ik ken Babsi.</p>
<p>  i. Was machst du?</p>
<p>  j. Wat doet u?</p>
<p>    What do you?</p>
<p>    ‘What are you doing?’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This pattern is usually derived by a double movement syntactic analysis whereby the finite verb, e.g. German <italic>kenne</italic> ‘know’ in (3a) is raised from an underlying clause-final position to the left periphery of the clause, accompanied by topicalization of another sentential constituent, for example the subject <italic>die Babsi</italic> in 3(c). This then leads to a surface structure whereby the topicalized constituents appear in the first position and the finite verb in the second position in the sentence. There are a number of possible analyses which motivate the verb movement to second position. In order to keep the analysis as straightforward as possible I follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367006911405578">Bohnacker’s (2006</xref>, p. 451) advice that ‘in syntactic acquisition research it is generally advisable to keep the – often ephemeral – formal syntactic apparatus to a minimum’. It is therefore assumed here that V2 is derived by head movement of the finite verb from a head-final VP, through T to C, accompanied by topicalization to Spec, CP.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1367006911405578">2</xref></sup> Notice that this assumes a symmetric account of V2, whereby all clauses are CPs and clause-initial subjects are in Spec-CP (refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367006911405578">Schwartz &amp; Vikner, 1996</xref> for arguments in support of this position).</p>
<sec id="section4-1367006911405578">
<title>3.1 Verb in situ and mixed V2 in English</title>
<p>English is a non-raising language in which thematic verbs always remain in situ in VP and thus appear to the right of sentential negation and sentence-medial adverbs. Fronting or topicalization of sentential constituents does not force movement to a V2 configuration, except in a restricted range of cases where a (residual) V2 constraint is in evidence. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367006911405578">Rizzi (1996)</xref> characterizes aux-movement in questions and negative inversion as instances of a residual V2 constraint.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is evidence that <italic>be</italic> and <italic>have</italic> raise in English. In particular, <italic>be</italic> has V2 distribution in English and must be inverted where predicate complements are fronted (compare (4)):</p>
<p><disp-quote>

<p>    *Next to the English Department the administration building is.</p>
<p>    Where is the administration building?</p>
<p>    *Where does the administration building be?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367006911405578">Westergaard (2007)</xref> suggests that, in addition to interrogatives, English shows evidence of a V2 constraint in various clause types when certain information structural conditions are in place. In this analysis, stylistic inversion (SI) as in (5) is derived by VP remnant movement when the verb is informationally lighter than the subject:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(5) On the table lay some papers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The syntactic derivation and discourse-pragmatic peculiarities of SI in English have been much discussed and are not uncontroversial (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367006911405578">Levin &amp; Rappaport-Hovav, 1995</xref>, Ch. 6). I will not venture into any specific analysis of SI. Whatever the syntactic derivation, the relevant fact is that this is one of a number of structures which diverge from the standard English V3 pattern and are identical on the surface in English and German/Dutch, e.g. (6) and (7). Target-like production of these structures is differentiated from non-target inversion in sections 5.3 and 5.4 later:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(6) Naast het instituut voor Anglistiek is het administratiegebouw. (Dutch)</p>
<p>  Neben dem Institut für Anglistik ist das Verwaltungsgebäude. (German)</p>

<p>(7) Op de tafel liggen enkele papieren. (Dutch)</p>
<p>  Auf dem Tisch lagen einige Papiere. (German)</p>
<p>  On the table lay some papers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The task facing the V2-L1 learners in the present study is twofold. They must realize that, unlike in their L1s, English thematic verbs never raise. Second, they must notice the distinctions between the surface V2 patterns in English and the L1. In the corpus study, I do not examine the acquisition of patterns of stylistic and locative inversion but concentrate on the distinction between narrow syntactic verb movement and interface-related inversion. Nevertheless, it is necessary to distinguish between target use of the inversion structures and ungrammatical inversion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1367006911405578">
<title>3.2 From V2 to V3: previous SLA studies</title>
<p>Previous studies of SLA involving V2-L1 learners targeting a V3-L2 have proposed that the transfer of V2 patterns is connected to interface difficulties, even before the advent of the Interface Hypothesis as discussed earlier. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367006911405578">Hulk (1991</xref>, p. 14), for example, observed that, for L1 Dutch learners of L2 French, losing the V2 parameter might be more difficult in topicalization contexts:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>On learnability grounds . . . a distinction may be made between the position of the head and finite verb movement on the one hand and topicalization to SPEC,CP on the other hand. . . . So, on learnability grounds we might expect that the SPEC,CP parameter will be reset rather late and is even a candidate for fossilization.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There is a clear developmental trend in the grammaticality judgement data in the Hulk study, whereby L1 Dutch third graders on the whole have already set the target option for the headedness of VP and IP to the target French settings. Fronting and topicalization, however, remain a residual problem, even for learners at university level, 10 per cent of whom continue to accept topicalization of non-arguments along with verb movement to C. The argument goes that even though the learners have reset the landing-site of verb movement to I rather than C, these settings do not preclude each other, i.e. there is evidence in French interrogatives that topicalization of <italic>wh</italic>-constituents may force movement to C. Thus either I or C may be the target of verb movement in French, with the distinction that movement to C is more restricted than in Dutch in that it only occurs with topicalization to Spec-CP, which is restricted to <italic>wh</italic>-constituents in native French. To the extent that the Dutch speakers optionally allow the verb to target either I or C, this shows that they have acquired the head movement properties of French. The difficulty is that they allow any constituent to topicalize to Spec-CP rather than only <italic>wh</italic>-constituents.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367006911405578">Bohnacker and Rosén (2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367006911405578">2007b)</xref> report similar findings with regard to clause-initial position in the acquisition of L2 German by L1 Swedish learners. L1 Swedes acquiring German have no problems with V2 syntax (as the V2 constraint can be transferred from Swedish). However, they have persistent problems realizing target-like information structural patterns in declarative V2 clauses in German. Swedish and German have different preferences for what type of elements may be fronted to sentence-initial position and L1 Swedish speakers continue to transfer information structural patterns by realizing thematic elements and expletives in clause-initial position to a greater extent than would be natural in German.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367006911405578">Robertson and Sorace’s (1999)</xref> study of corpus evidence and grammaticality judgements shows that transfer also persists in L1 German learners of L2 English but that the residual V2 constraint is realized only by non-thematic verbs, i.e. auxiliaries and copula <italic>be</italic>, as there are no instances of main-verb raising in their corpus. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367006911405578">Hulk (1991)</xref>, there is a developmental trend in the data. The occurrence of V2 patterns decreases as proficiency increases but is not definitively expunged from the learner grammar (at least at the group level) at the highest proficiency level.</p>
<p>The analysis Robertson and Sorace develop to account for this rests on the assumption that V2 is a reflex of the checking of a strong C-feature, rather than a strong V-feature on C. Second, the values of these strong C-features ([+affect], [+wh], [+neg], etc.) are abstract lexical items, which are available for selection from the lexicon and therefore may or may not be included in the Numeration in the same way as any other lexical item.</p>
<p>The selection of one of these features for inclusion in the Numeration is determined by the pragmatically motivated choices of a speaker. In German, where any constituent is fronted for discourse-pragmatic reasons, the presence of a strong [affect] C-feature then forces overt movement to C for checking purposes. Where the feature is not part of the Numeration it plays no role in the derivation. Therefore Robertson and Sorace adopt an asymmetric approach to V2, whereby if there is no fronted constituent, main clauses in German are IPs. ‘Optionality then derives from the exercise of choice at the point of Numeration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367006911405578">Robertson &amp; Sorace, 1999</xref>, p. 353).</p>
<p>The developmental pattern is explained by the fact that in response to input an initial obligatory V2 grammar must be restructured as there is ample evidence in English that fronting a constituent in declarative clauses does not give rise to movement to C. The learner therefore learns that the relevant feature should not be included in the Numeration and this is a self-reinforcing learning mechanism whereby lack of use leads to attrition in feature strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367006911405578">Robertson &amp; Sorace, 1999</xref>, p. 354). The learning process for German speakers targeting English is to establish which C-features are strong (i.e. [neg] and [wh]) and which are not.</p>
<p>The locus of the problem on this analysis is therefore syntactic interfaces. One could argue that it is either at the interface of syntax with the lexicon, i.e. the projection of lexical items in the syntax, or at the interface with discourse-pragmatics as the relevant strong features are connected to the exercise of discourse-pragmatic options. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367006911405578">Sorace (2005</xref>, p. 64) herself suggests that ‘V2 phenomena are related to the specification of the illocutionary force of an utterance, and ultimately to the speaker’s pragmatically motivated choice, for example, the decision to put a constituent in focus, or to topicalise it’. English diverges from German in that V2 is, in Sorace’s terms ‘lexically conditioned’ in English and therefore restricted to certain types of fronted constituents, while German retains a generalized V2 pattern.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367006911405578">Westergaard (2003</xref>) studies the transfer of V2 by young L1 Norwegian learners of English and develops a cue-based explanation for the widespread transfer of V2 into English. The cue-based learning analysis suggests a combination of the facts that the English system is more marked and that the input, both in terms of the frequency of occurrence of certain structures in English as well as the controlled input in a pedagogical setting, makes it difficult for the learners to retreat from a V2 grammar. The markedness side of the analysis comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367006911405578">Henry and Tangney (1999)</xref>, who argue that a grammar is more marked or complex if it only has movement in certain contexts compared to a language which has movement in all contexts. For example, where English has V2 only in certain types of clause or with certain lexical items, this would be more complex than a language like Norwegian or German, where V2 is more consistent. The corollary of this for acquisition according to Henry and Tangney is that a learner ‘will only adopt a more complex grammar . . . where there is overwhelming evidence in the input in its favour’ (1999, p. 240, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367006911405578">Westergaard, 2003</xref>, p. 84).</p>
<p>Given the cue-based model of L1 acquisition which Westergaard extends to L2A, it is argued that the evidence for V3 available to the young learners in her study is decidedly underwhelming. Assuming Full Transfer, learners will need two specific cues in the input to move from their L1 V2 grammar to an L2 English non-V2 grammar. SVO is ambiguous with respect to V2, therefore, the necessary cues would be topicalization to show that English does not have generalized V2, and <italic>do</italic>-support in questions and negation to show that lexical verbs do not move. Topicalization is infrequent in English, and these are instructed primary-school aged learners with minimal contact with English. <italic>Do</italic>-support in questions is avoided in the teaching materials used as it is thought to be a complex structure. However, questions with raised auxiliaries do not rule out the possibility that lexical verbs might raise, rather <italic>do</italic>-support is specifically necessary as aspectual and modal auxiliaries are in the clause for independent semantic reasons to begin with. Thus given that they have transferred their V2 L1 grammar, there are not enough explicit cues in the English input to which they are exposed to reset to a non-V2 grammar.</p>
<p>None of these previous studies specifically test the Interface Hypothesis as they predate its formulation. Nevertheless, Hulk’s distinction between thematic verb placement and topicalization provides hypotheses for L1 German/Dutch–L2 English pairing, which are not tested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367006911405578">Robertson and Sorace (1999</xref>). Drawing on their corpus evidence, which shows no evidence of non-target inversion of thematic verbs, Robertson and Sorace do not further test thematic verb placement relative to negation and in questions. The present study tests the possible production of these word order patterns in addition to inversion structures. It is hypothesized that the lack of thematic verb raising in English should be target-like as movement out of VP would be motivated by narrow syntactic tense and agreement requirements, while there may be continued non-target inversion signifying residual V2 transfer. For the analysis of the corpus data, interface contexts are operationalized as clauses which have a fronted non-subject XP; subject–verb inversion in this case indicates the transfer of a V2 constraint triggered by topicalization. Narrow syntactic contexts are operationalized as (i) subject-initial clauses, where evidence for V2 would be thematic verb movement over sentential negation, and (ii) interrogatives, where transfer in narrow syntax would involve movement of thematic verbs to second position. Evidence of transfer in environments (i) and (ii) would indicate continued V2 transfer internal to the syntactic computation.</p>

<title>4.2 Method</title>
<p>The subcorpora of ICLE were all tagged using the CLAWS7 tagset in WMatrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367006911405578">Rayson, 2008</xref>). All possible V2 diagnostics sequences were extracted semi-automatically by conducting batch searches for the relevant POS-tag sequences in MonoConc 2.2. The sequences extracted from the corpora were then sorted manually to identify only those tokens which reflected possible V2 order. These included negative inversion contexts in declaratives, where V2 order would be required in English.</p>
<p>In order to identify and differentiate target structures such as locative and stylistic inversion and negative inversion, various relevant variables for each inversion sentence were coded. These variables were:</p>
<list id="list1-1367006911405578" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the function of the fronted constituent (locative, discourse adverbial, etc.);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the type of verb (auxiliary, transitive thematic, intransitive thematic, <italic>be</italic>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Statistical comparisons were carried out between the different L1 groups using <italic>z</italic>-tests for proportion. These examined differences in the occurrences of each structure as a proportion of the number of individuals in each L1 group who produced the particular structures of interest.</p>

<p>Overall, the results will be seen to confirm the hypothesis that narrow syntactic verb movement has been mastered while interface contexts, i.e. inversion after clause-initial non-subjects, prove more problematic.

The patterning of <italic>be</italic> in particular provides interesting evidence for the interplay between interface difficulties, the role of transfer and the role of input (see section 5.4).</p>

<p>Word order in main clause interrogatives conforms overwhelmingly to target English syntax.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1367006911405578">3</xref></sup> There are only a small number of linear orders in each corpus which reflect the apparent raising of thematic verbs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1367006911405578">Figure 1</xref>) and there are no statistically significant differences between the different L1 groups (DU/FR <italic>z</italic> = 0.70, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05; DU/GE <italic>z</italic> = 0.22, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05; FR/GE <italic>z</italic> = 0.78, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). However, on closer inspection, even these occurrences of apparent transfer are doubtful as evidence of the transfer of verb movement.</p>

</fig>
<p>The examples of non-target word order in questions seem to reflect a common tendency to overgeneralize surface subject–auxiliary inversion (SAI) patterns present in the input rather than L1-specific transfer. This overgeneralization takes two clear patterns (neither of which are attested in LOCNESS): first, the overextension of movement to thematic verbs homophonous with auxiliaries (8):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(8) Has television as much influence on people as religion had in former days? (ICLE-DU)</p>
<p>  Did it anything to their cruel and brutal way of coldly killing innocent people? (ICLE-GE)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Second, there is overgeneralization of inversion with <italic>be</italic> in contexts where participial or infinitival forms are raised (9):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(9) However, if it hadn’t been for some strong women who enchained this emancipation movement, how would have been the women’s situation today? (ICLE-GE)</p>

<p>  Very nice, but what will be reality like? (ICLE-FR)</p>
<p>  What will be the price to pay? (ICLE-FR)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In all three corpora, there are only three examples of structures that could be taken to be representative of the transfer of thematic verb movement (10), suggesting that thematic verb movement/V2 does not generally transfer in questions:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(10) Exclude this two things themselves mutually? (ICLE-GE)</p>

<title>5.2 Verb movement over negation</title>
<p>The results for negation further support the analysis that there is no thematic verb movement/V2 transfer in narrow syntactic contexts. Non-target thematic verb placement with sentential negation occurs in less than 1 per cent of possible contexts in each of the corpora.

<p>Again, it seems that the distinction between the syntactic behaviour of auxiliaries and their homophonous thematic counterparts is problematic. This is particularly prevalent in ICLE-FR and ICLE-DU, where the thematic homophones of <italic>have</italic>, <italic>do</italic> and modal auxiliaries account for 80 and 100 per cent of word order errors respectively (11):</p>

<p>The other occurrences of V<sub>LEX</sub>-Neg sequences in ICLE-GE also appear not be the result of V2 transfer. Of the remaining examples of V<sub>LEX</sub>-Neg, they are either formulaic as in (12), which is a possible idiomatic structure in native English, or they are seemingly due to problems with the scope of negation (13):</p>

<p>The learners seem to allow <italic>not</italic> to take narrow scope over sentence constituents, which may in itself involve the transfer of the scope properties of the German negator <italic>nicht</italic> to English, or it may be a more general developmental problem with acquiring the relevant semantic properties of English negation. In the examples which follow, bracketing indicates where the reading of the scope of the negator seems to be intended:</p>

<title>5.3 Main verb inversion in declaratives</title>
<p>The results for inversion structures in declaratives show that the native speakers behave as one would expect and produce inversion in the main with copula <italic>be</italic> (the results reported here are for stylistic and locative inversion, for negative inversion with SAI see below). In addition, what has been coded in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1367006911405578">Figure 2</xref> as ‘intransitive thematic’ are typically canonical unaccusative verbs in stylistic and locative inversion structures; 80 per cent of instances of inversion in these contexts in LOCNESS involve a form of the lexical item <italic>come</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1367006911405578">4</xref></sup></p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1367006911405578-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The rate of main verb inversion in LOCNESS illustrates how rare the structure is in modern English. There were a total of 57 inversion structures, equating to a rate of occurrence of 1.98 inversion constructions per 10,000 words. The rate of main verb inversion in the learner corpora is within a similar range (ICLE-DU 1.65; ICLE-FR 1.09; ICLE-GE 2.05).</p>
<p>All the learner groups also produce inversion which conforms to English grammatical norms for locative and stylistic inversion (although, even in these cases there may be divergences in the information status of the subject or fronted constituent which render some examples awkward in context, in addition the learners show divergence, possibly indicative of transfer, with inversion around <italic>be</italic>, see section 5.4). The most obvious difference is the occurrence of auxiliary verbs in inversion structures in the learner corpora, which are absent from the native corpus. There is a significant difference in the proportion of individuals who produce this sort of auxiliary inversion only between the German and French groups, <italic>z</italic> = 1.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, but not between the French and Dutch groups, <italic>z</italic> = 1.02, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. However, the one instance of auxiliary inversion in ICLE-FR needs to be explained independently as it appears to be a calque of a French structure where the translation equivalent of the English lexical item <italic>maybe</italic> (FR <italic>peut-être</italic>) would in any case give rise to inversion, at least in formal written contexts (14):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(14) And maybe will we be able to comprehend why so many people have followed him.</p>
<p>  Et peut-être peut-on comprendre pourquoi . . .</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Taken together with the results for questions and negation, it would thus seem that the non-movement of thematic verbs in English has been mastered, but that where there is a residual V2 constraint, this is satisfied by auxiliary T-to-C movement (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367006911405578">Robertson &amp; Sorace, 1999</xref> for similar results with L1 German–L2 English and Discussion section). This is of course a permissible syntactic operation in English, for which there is evidence in the input with T-to-C in questions and in negative inversion. It is striking that <italic>do</italic>-insertion is also used in these contexts to maintain V2 order in instances where there would otherwise be no modal or aspectual auxiliary available for movement (15):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(15) Nowadays do not only students cry out loud, but it’s especially their parents who run amok among schools and ministeries in order to get them ban this ‘cruel, inhumane institution’ forever. (ICLE-GE)</p>
<p>  Already then did America see itself as a kind of global cop (they used the term very frequently in post-war months). (ICLE-DU)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367006911405578">Robertson and Sorace (1999</xref>, p. 336) observe that there is no particular pattern in their corpus data in terms of the type of fronted constituent which might give rise to V2 and a range of constituents occur in initial position without any specific prominence in their discourse status. The patterns of aux V2 in ICLE also show little sign of regularity in terms of the syntactic type of initial constituent. In both ICLE-DU and ICLE-GE, the rate is approximately 25 per cent fronted arguments to 75 per cent fronted adverbials of various sorts (16):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(16) This excellent example of this principle, can we find whenever two countries or nations went to war. (ICLE-DU)</p>
<p>  And secondly, can the government effectively use television to control and influence the public opinion. (ICLE-DU)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, it is striking that in the cases of ungrammatical auxiliary inversion divergence from target English norms is not confined solely to the presence of inversion but that the type of initial constituent would not be felicitous in a fronted position in any case. This can be seen in the examples which follow, where fronting of the constituent in each case is anomalous or gives rise to scope or interpretive distinctions in English, but would be permissible with the intended reading in initial position in Dutch and German:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(17) a. Only has this place become smaller. (ICLE-DU)</p>
<p>  b. For them it is quite frustrating to see other peoples who are rich from birth, and whom will everything be put in their laps because the have the right connections to certain circles. (ICLE-GE)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In (17a) for example, <italic>only</italic> is apparently being used in the sense of the Dutch <italic>maar</italic> (a possible translation equivalent), which in the equivalent context in Dutch would indicate contrast, while in English it would only be possible in fronted position as a modifier of some other sentential constituent over which it takes narrow scope. Similarly, (17b) reflects the transfer of the properties of German pronominal forms, which in this case would be licit in fronted position in dative case. The use of <italic>whom</italic> in initial position therefore reflects the information structural preferences of German. We return to similar issues of the status of the initial constituent in non-target structures immediately below.</p>
<sec id="section13-1367006911405578">
<title>5.3.1 Negative inversion</title>
<p>There are clear differences between the corpora in the rates of target SAI in negative inversion contexts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1367006911405578">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, the Dutch and German learners pattern together in producing lower rates of grammatical SAI in this residual V2 structure in English than the French (although the only statistically significant between-group difference is between ICLE-DU and ICLE-FR, <italic>z</italic> = 1.70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>

<p>This may also reveal the influence of the L1 in terms of avoidance of surface V2 structures (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367006911405578">Schachter, 1974</xref> on avoidance as a form of transfer).

<title>5.4 Inversion of be</title>
<p>All the learner groups are sensitive to the fact that <italic>be</italic> has V2 distribution in English. <italic>Be</italic> is always inverted in target-like fashion where this would be required in native English. There are, in addition, no instances in any of the subcorpora where <italic>be</italic> has non-target V3 distribution. There is, again, a significant difference between the proportions of Dutch and French learners who produce <italic>be</italic> inversion (<italic>z</italic> = 2.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). However, this seems to reflect the general pattern whereby the Dutch group on the whole is more likely to produce word order variation. There are, however, instances where XP-<italic>be</italic>-Subj are not target-like and differ from patterns in the native corpus, and here, interestingly, there are no between-group differences (DU/GE <italic>z</italic> = 0.54, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05; GE/FR <italic>z</italic> = 1.39, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05; GE/DU <italic>z</italic> = 0.44, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). It may be the case then, that non-target <italic>be</italic> inversion is the result of overgeneralizing the V2 pattern for the copula in English as the L1 French also produce non-target inversion (18):</p>

<p>However, there are qualitative differences in the types of structures produced by the French, on the one hand, and the German/Dutch learners, on the other. In addition, as with the auxiliary inversion instance in ICLE-FR, the sentences in (18) would be possible in French and likely reflect transfer of constraints on French inversion.</p>
<p>Similarly to the auxiliary inversion structures in ICLE-DU and ICLE-GE, the difficulty appears to be one of discourse-pragmatics rather than syntax. This can be illustrated by the fronting of adjectival complements. In these contexts in the native corpus, there is only inversion after comparative XPs (19), or after constituents which establish an overt link with the immediately preceding discourse (20). The only instances in LOCNESS where fronted complements could plausibly be analysed as adjectives without some overt comparative element involve formulaic usages of fronted participial adjectives (21):</p>

<p>Examples as in (22) seem to be the result of L1 transfer as this linear order is acceptable and occurs in German and Dutch, but not in French (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367006911405578">Jarvis, 2000</xref> on the role of intergroup heterogeneity as a criterion for deciding on the role of L1 transfer). But what exactly is transferring here? It is not V2 <italic>syntax</italic> per se as <italic>be</italic> has V2 distribution in English in any case. The problem seems to lie at the discourse-pragmatics interface, i.e. once again the type of fronted constituent is infelicitous in English, not the syntactic configuration. What has transferred then is the possibility of topicalizing adjectival predicates, which would not felicitously undergo topicalization in English.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1367006911405578">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>6. Discussion</title>
<p>As we have seen, where V2 patterns are in evidence it is not the syntactic configuration which is ungrammatical but the distribution of this configuration in discourse in the case of auxiliary inversion or the divergence from native norms specific to the type of fronted constituent in non-target <italic>be</italic> inversion. The empirical findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367006911405578">Robertson and Sorace (1999</xref>) are therefore confirmed to the extent that V2 may continue to transfer from L1 German to L2 English even at advanced levels of proficiency while thematic verb placement is more consistently target-like. Rather than the possibility of an abstract affect feature transferring into the interlanguage lexicon as in Robertson and Sorace’s analysis, I propose that it is discourse-pragmatic patterns that transfer as opposed to syntactic interference. As previously mentioned, the standard assumption, contra Robertson and Sorace, is that V2 is symmetric, i.e. that all main clauses involve movement to the highest syntactic projection on the left of the clause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367006911405578">Schwartz &amp; Vikner, 1996</xref>). Assuming subject-initial clauses also implicate V2, it remains unclear why there should be no reflexes of V2 apart from with XP-fronting. For example, it is conceivable that non-target <italic>do</italic>-support could also be employed in subject-initial clauses to check a residual V2 requirement, for which there is no evidence in ICLE.</p>
<p>Inversion around <italic>be</italic> is especially informative with respect to the transfer of information structural patterns. The structures with ‘bare’ adjective inversion in ICLE-DU and ICLE-GE seem quite obviously to be the result of L1 transfer but it is not V2 <italic>syntax</italic> that has transferred, rather what has transferred is the preference to topicalize certain constituents which do not felicitously undergo topicalization in English (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367006911405578">Bohnacker &amp; Rosén’s, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367006911405578">2007b</xref> results for L1-Swedish/L2-German learners). The distribution of <italic>be</italic> inversion in English poses a significant learnability problem in general but is particularly problematic for learners with a V2-L1. First of all, learners need to establish that copula <italic>be</italic> is an exception to the English V3 rule in that it gives rise to surface V2 patterns in declaratives and interrogatives. However, having acquired this exceptional rule, they need to acquire further subtle restrictions on the V2 distribution of <italic>be</italic> by realizing that not all copula sentences can be inverted. This poses a learnability problem as it would require negative evidence to establish target-like distribution; having acquired the quasi-V2 distribution of <italic>be</italic> in English and hence the possibility of inversion as in (23), there is no positive evidence in the input which would prevent a learner from assuming that (24) is also possible (especially given the grammaticality of the inverted copula construction in (25)):</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>So the transfer of German and Dutch V2 patterns with copula <italic>be</italic> seems to reflect the transfer of discourse-pragmatic preferences in the form of L1 strategies for encoding topicalization, focus and contrast. This analysis may be extended to the structures with ungrammatical subject–auxiliary inversion in ICLE-DU and ICLE-GE. Again, the syntax of English has been acquired to the extent that subject–auxiliary inversion is a legitimate syntactic operation. However, it may be co-opted in topicalization structures to permit the formation of a unique clause-initial position to host discourse-relevant fronted constituents and thus maintain L1 discourse-pragmatic options. It is thus expected that subject-initial clauses should not show evidence of V2 effects. This may be explained under the Interface Hypothesis by the fact that interface features (topic, focus, contrast) remain consistently unstable in the L2.</p>
<p>As is the case with <italic>be</italic> inversion, there may be a learnability problem associated with SAI in English. There is abundant evidence that English requires SAI after fronted interrogative operators, and indeed in the corpora it is found that interrogative syntax poses no major problems for the learners. It is also clear that at least some of the learners have acquired that SAI is a requirement after fronted negative operators. However, this remains highly variable (especially in the Dutch and German corpora). This variability appears to apply also to a lesser extent to declaratives with topicalization structures, where the topic operator also optionally triggers SAI. The learnability issue arises if we assume a Full Access/Full Transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367006911405578">Schwartz &amp; Sprouse, 1996</xref>) model of the initial state in SLA; it is then questionable whether the English input provides robust enough cues to restructure V2 in all contexts. As discussed earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367006911405578">Westergaard (2003</xref>, p. 91) suggests that the relevant restructuring cues for V2-L1 learners of English are <italic>do</italic>-support as a cue for V-in situ and topicalization as a cue for V3. However, while <italic>do</italic>-support in questions and sentential negation provide unambiguous evidence that lexical verbs never move, it is not unambiguous with regard to V2. S-V<sub>AUX</sub>-Neg-V<sub>LEX</sub> and Wh-V<sub>AUX</sub>-Subj-V<sub>LEX</sub> can be parsed by a V2 grammar and may make it difficult for V2-L1 learners to definitely lose the constraint. In effect, SAI may be employed to realize V2, where this is optionally triggered by fronted operators (whether neg or top).</p>
<p>This analysis assumes that the transfer of V2 is due to representational deficits, i.e. it is the result of transfer rather than interference in Grosjean’s terms. Corpus evidence is not, however, directly informative in this regard. Online experiments would be required to determine the role online processing plays in the production and comprehension of inversion structures in L2 English. The L1 option may be more economical from a processing point of view in the sense that the learners lack the processing resources to access and compute simultaneously both the syntactic and discourse properties of L2 structures online. They therefore resort to L1 options. In addition, the data are not informative as to whether or not V2 transfer is truly a candidate for residual optionality in Sorace’s original sense, i.e. at the end-state in <italic>near-native</italic> speakers. Nevertheless, the prediction of the Interface Hypothesis that interface properties will present greater developmental difficulties in SLA seems to be borne out. The study further highlights that V2 transfer may be the result of transferring discourse-pragmatic patterns from the L1 rather than syntactic deficits.</p>

<p>This is a rather simplified picture. As pointed out in the text, a wealth of research has studied the production and interpretation of null- and post-verbal subject in learners of a pro-drop L2. Findings that native speakers of a pro-drop L1 have similar problems in the acquisition of subject pronoun distribution in a pro-drop target language (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367006911405578">Rothman, 2009</xref>) may lend support to the general processing account rather than transfer alone.</p>

<p>The motivation for the head movement may be assumed to be encoding illocutionary force features on C, i.e. [decl] or [Q], while fronted constituents are interpreted as topics and check a topic feature (after the analysis in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367006911405578">Adger, 2003</xref>, pp. 329–331). Alternatively, the fronted constituent may involve checking different discourse-relevant features such as focus or contrast (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367006911405578">Bradner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367006911405578">Frey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367006911405578">Westergaard &amp; Vangsnes, 2005</xref> for more detailed theoretical treatments along these lines).</p>

<p>The data reported below deal with word order in main clause questions which would require SAI in English and are therefore informative as to the status of verb movement.

<p>‘Unaccusative’ was not used as a separate coding variable because of a lack of reliable independent tests for unaccusativitiy in English. In addition, it has been shown that the traditional analysis of SI occurring only with unaccusatives in English is not borne out. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367006911405578">Levin and Rappaport-Hovav (1995</xref>, Ch. 6) show that the types of verbs in attested inversion structures are both too large, including unergatives, and too small, as not all unaccusatives permit inversion. An anonymous reviewer points out that it is, however, unsurprising that inversion would be more frequent with verbs like <italic>come</italic>, which typically display unaccusative behaviour cross-linguistically.</p>

<p>It is not entirely straightforward to claim that all such adjectival fronting in English is ungrammatical. However, such structures are rare and tend to be literary or archaic, as in ‘Long and arduous was the struggle to reach the true answer to this difficult question’ (<italic>The Planetary and Stellar Worlds</italic>, 1867). Given the input the ICLE learners have had in university courses in English Studies, it cannot be discounted that they would have encountered such forms in literary media. However, even if this were the case, it would perhaps only reinforce a tendency to transfer V2 patterns from the L1.</p>
