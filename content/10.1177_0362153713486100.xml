While acknowledging the need to work within limits, he argues against arbitrary external constraints on a scope of practice that involves talking, listening, and lifelong learning. The practice of counseling should be determined instead by the needs of clients who present for help with developmental difficulties that can be facilitated through human exchange and meaning making.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>counseling</kwd><kwd>university counseling services</kwd><kwd>counseling contracts</kwd><kwd>counseling process</kwd><kwd>challenges in counseling</kwd><kwd>engagement fatigue</kwd><kwd>working within limits</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>My counseling colleagues work in settings nearly too numerous to name: schools, prisons, job sites, military bases, religious institutions, medical facilities, social service agencies, eldercare homes, hospices, public health offices, community centers, drug and alcohol treatment centers, women’s shelters, methadone maintenance clinics, birth control clinics, shelters for the homeless, residential treatment homes for adolescents or the chronically mentally ill, crisis hotlines, and private practices. We bring our skills and commitment to bear in countless “special fields” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0362153713486100">Clarke, 1981</xref>).</p><p>However, more than just an acknowledgment, this long list suggests why any definition of counseling will fail to capture the extraordinary diversity of the profession. And given the challenges faced in these many different and difficult settings, I have found nothing written that does not oversimplify or underconceptualize the work that counselors are called to do every day.</p><p>In the space of a paper, I cannot do justice to these particularities and complexities encountered by counselors in so many milieus. So, rather than speak generally of counseling or counselors, I will describe my own formation as a professional over the past nearly 25 years. In particular, I will consider how my work as a counselor and therapist is affected by my position in the larger field of mental health, by my particular background and life experiences, by my nature and character, and finally by the university-based counseling center where I have been employed the past 7 years. Each of these aspects demarks a limit within which I am still learning to work.</p><sec id="section1-0362153713486100"><title>Lower Class</title><p>I began working as a trainee in mental health counseling in 1989. By the time I had graduated with my master’s degree in 1991, I knew I was considered part of an inferior class of practitioners. Within the hierarchy of the mental health professions in the area of the United States where I live and work, psychiatrists are lords, psychologists the landed gentry, social workers the merchants with varied status and success, and counselors the street sweepers. This is the broader social construct as I have observed and characterized it.</p><p>Of course, not all counselors are as sensitive to rejection as I am, a theme of personal importance and vulnerability that I have explored under the rubric of <italic>social pain </italic>(N. M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0362153713486100">Landaiche, 2009</xref>). Yet speaking for myself and other similarly sensitive colleagues, this denigrating construct has made it difficult to develop a professional identity and pride. At the same time, I can imagine that this status system hinders self-development no matter where one falls within it.</p></sec><sec id="section2-0362153713486100"><title>A Muddle of Categories</title><p>Within the field of mental health in the United States, <italic>counselor</italic> is a licensed category (like psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, marriage and family therapist, drug and alcohol specialist, and massage therapist). As a licensed counselor, I am not permitted to do things for which I have no training, such as prescribe medication, administer psychological tests, or write a psychiatric hospital discharge plan. These limits are fine with me since I am primarily interested in the work that involves talking with clients.</p><p>That primary interest in talking is shared by other professionals, of course, including psychotherapists and psychoanalysts, neither of which belongs, so far, to a licensed category where I live and work. (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0362153713486100">Mazzetti, 2010/2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0362153713486100">2010/2012b</xref>, for a discussion of the implications that different laws in different countries have for counselors’ work.) In my country, I could conceivably be licensed as a counselor and be trained as a psychoanalyst or psychotherapist. This is how things become complicated.</p><p>When I earned my master’s degree, I graduated with a role (inferior) and an attitude (open, interested in helping, growth oriented) but not much of an identity. Most importantly, I had only a rudimentary method of practice. Yet I found myself working with difficult clients in an agency that offered services to families in which there had been sexual and physical abuse. I felt increasingly at a loss as to how to help.</p><p>This has been essentially the story of my career. I encounter a challenge in practice, I obtain more training and supervision, I work with some improved effectiveness, I make some regrettable mistakes. This is true today. After all these years, I still cannot say: “Now I am fully prepared.” In this aspect of my work life, there appears to be no limit.</p></sec><sec id="section3-0362153713486100"><title>What Is in a Name?</title><p>When I wanted to learn to be more effective in talking with my clients, I sought training as a psychotherapist, primarily in the psychodynamic tradition (e.g., the unconscious, transference, countertransference, and all that). Over the years, I have pursued training in psychoanalytic object relations theory, group-as-a-whole models (based on object relations theory), and family systems theory. I have had the good fortune to learn from many fine teachers and supervisors. I am still in training and seeking supervision. All of this has freed me to work at increasing levels of challenge with somewhat less strain.</p><p>So, what am I supposed to call myself? My clients call me “doc,” “therapist,” “counselor,” “shrink,” “Mick,” and a host of other odd handles. I am licensed as a counselor, and my current job position is staff psychotherapist (and training supervisor). I work at a university-based clinic called a “counseling center.”</p><p>Whatever you call me, perhaps the bigger questions are: What do I think I am doing? What do my clients require of me?</p></sec><sec id="section4-0362153713486100"><title>A Process, Not a Category</title><p>I find the splitting and turf hoarding of professional categories especially frustrating because I think it places the emphasis wrongly. What does it matter what I am called or how I am licensed? I need to know how to work with my clients and their particular demands and challenges. And for me that work occupies the realm of talking and listening, that very basic, if at times convoluted, human communicative process that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0362153713486100">Monin (2011</xref>) characterized as one of common interest in all fields of counseling.</p><p>Knowing how to talk and listen meaningfully means that any one of us could, for example, be a counselor in a women’s shelter who, at times, needs to understand and interpret unconscious communication as it may relate to a client’s transference and one’s own countertransference. Or one might be a certified psychoanalyst in private practice whose analysand needs basic information about daily living, the contact information for a human services resource, or maybe just a word of encouragement. The notion that these various modes of exchange should somehow be restricted to certain settings seems absurd.</p><p>Even more egregious is the notion that, once designated a counselor, psychoanalyst, social worker, psychotherapist, or psychologist, a practitioner is now unqualifiedly qualified to address the needs of certain clients or patients in certain settings. How can this be? Learning to function in any of these roles—which is to say, learning to talk in some useful way with the people who come to us for help—is, I believe, a lifelong project that we continually fulfill with more or less success. In that process, “We learn all the time from our experiences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0362153713486100">Newton &amp; Napper, 2007</xref>, p. 150).</p><p>I include in this discussion educators, trainers, coaches, and organizational consultants, all of whom fall under the broad term <italic>special fields, </italic>which has its own unique meaning in the history of transactional analysis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0362153713486100">Cornell, 2013</xref>). I include these and other roles to the extent that their work involves the facilitation of psychological and emotional growth through the medium of human relating and communicating. After all, people, clients and professionals alike, bring their serious disturbances and idiosyncrasies wherever they show up for help and work.</p></sec><sec id="section5-0362153713486100"><title>Self-Definition</title><p>Like many people I have met in the international transactional analysis community, I have a complicated work history. In addition to my preparation for mental health work, I was trained in the visual arts (drawing, photography, and printmaking). I worked in corporate communications (slides, video, and print production). I taught myself to program software for small business bookkeeping applications. I have consulted with organizations and written strategic plans, grant applications, research summaries, and operations manuals. I have coordinated the transition from paper to electronic mental health records for the clinic where I now work. Along the way, I earned a doctorate in the humanities. This list could go on. The point is, all of this, including many other personal experiences, informs my understanding of the human experience and operates in my work as a counselor.</p></sec><sec id="section6-0362153713486100"><title>Where I Find Myself</title><p>For the past 7 years, I have worked in a university-based counseling center, a type of mental health clinic for undergraduate and graduate students of the university that employs me. Most U.S. universities and colleges offer some kind of counseling or mental health service to their students, usually limited in terms of sessions and intensiveness of care. At my center, we offer basic assessment and referrals (to community mental health resources); brief, 12-session “psychotherapy” (in quotes because, in practice, our interactions with students are far more complex and varied); limited psychiatric evaluation and medication management; crisis management (in the event of suicidality or a psychotic break); and case management for students whose access to community and campus resources requires some coordination. Occasionally we work with student couples.</p><p>Our student clients range in age from 17 to the mid-forties (sometimes older since there is no age limit for graduate studies). They present with an array of symptoms, from mild to severe: unbearable anxiety and panic, sleep disturbance, disordered eating, substance use, depression, suicidality, self-harm, psychosis, academic failure, cultural adjustment, romantic and family relationship problems, social isolation, substance abuse, compulsive Internet use, sexual concerns, sexual assault, and so on.</p><p>The university is academically rigorous, with its strongest programs on seemingly opposite ends of the spectrum. On the one hand, we are well known for computer science, robotics, and other high tech fields. On the other, we have distinguished schools of drama, music, visual arts, design, and architecture. In between are the other sciences and a smattering of studies in the humanities. The higher-profile areas of study attract very bright, talented, driven, hyper- (and hypo-) mature individuals. We also draw students from all over the world, many pressured by parental and family expectations for success, many struggling to bridge the differences between their home cultures and that of the United States.</p><p>During one week last spring, the students I saw at the counseling center were roughly 45% East Asian (Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese), 22% Latino (Chilean, Dominican, and Mexican), 22% Caucasian/European American (from every corner of the United States), and 11% Indian. Every day when I go to work, I have the sense of arriving in another country.</p></sec><sec id="section7-0362153713486100"><title>Contracts Clear or Convoluted</title><p>At times, contracting with my clients is fairly straightforward. They say what they want, and I can provide it: “I have been so angry with friends—I need a place to vent”; “I’ve been depressed—I think I need to talk with someone”; “My drinking [alcohol] is out of control—I want to look at that”; “I keep getting into relationships that end badly—what am I doing?”; or “I need to talk about something that I’ve never told anyone.”</p><p>These straightforward contracts can change from week to week as we determine how many times to meet (within the 12-session limit), what to talk about, or how to talk. Our focus can shift as new awareness develops, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0362153713486100">Maquet (2012</xref>) described as key to the contracting process. Some clients find talking to be more upsetting than they imagined and so choose to stop, saving self-exploration for a later, less tumultuous time in their lives.</p><p>At times my clients cannot articulate why they came to the counseling center. Their sense of something being wrong may be vague, even if they have given me a list of what would seem obviously problematic behaviors, troubled emotions, disturbed eating or sleeping, even bizarre thoughts. Some clients do not believe talking will help or that they have any role in their own troubles. They just want me to take it (whatever “it” is) away, like a magical doctor. They may be hostile to my inquiries. They may be contemptuous of my interest or my wondering if “A” might be connected to “B.” Some refuse to talk, even if they return for additional sessions. Some give no clear indication that they will keep the next appointment they have made with me. Some seem clearly engaged and then vanish without a word of explanation.</p><p>I could write a long list of the impossible arrangements I have been asked to participate in, along with another list of proposals I could not even clarify enough to decline.</p><p>But, unless a client presents with a medical or severe enough psychiatric condition (warranting referral to a more appropriate resource), is a threat to self or others (in which case I call campus police), or asks for help better secured, for example, from the university career counseling services or an academic advisor, I do not have the freedom to say, “I’m sorry. I don’t think I can be of help.” Partly this is due to the contract I have with my employer, the university, which expects that the counseling center will meet with students who request services. Yet I also agree to meet with students when we cannot arrive at a clear contract because I do not believe someone has to have a functioning Adult in order to request or receive help of the kind I can offer.</p><p>In such cases, I work with an <italic>as-if contract </italic>in which I assume that each individual wants to grow and thrive, to be free of as much pain as possible, and to live as if living felt like a blessing more than a curse. In this spirit, “the heart of the counseling contract is facilitating the client’s self-awareness and innate maturational forces” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0362153713486100">Cornell &amp; Hine, 1999</xref>, p. 184).</p><p>During the time that I meet with clients, some never achieve a functioning Adult. Some remain quite symptomatic. Still, I am watching carefully all the while for their signs of growth and life, however small or fragile. I am adjusting my interventions (my speaking, listening, being, goading, showing emotion) to their specific developmental needs and rhythm, to the best of my understanding and ability. I am contracting with a future potential I am likely never to see.</p></sec><sec id="section8-0362153713486100"><title>Multicornered Contracts</title><p>Sometimes my clients come to the counseling center voluntarily; sometimes they are pressured to do so by parents, teachers, or university staff. They may be legally mandated due to involvement in a theft, interpersonal violence, substance abuse, a suicide attempt, or a psychotic episode. I have mentioned already the preexisting contract with my employer, which can become further complicated by contracts, overt or implicit, with other university personnel, the client’s family, outside mental health care providers, and so forth.</p><p>Working in the context of multicornered contracts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0362153713486100">English, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0362153713486100">Sichem, 1991</xref>) is common for counselors. Even if the client has voluntarily asked for help, there is often at least a third party invested in the client’s behavioral change. That third (or fourth or fifth) party might be child protective services, law enforcement, family members, an educational institution, the military, a medical facility, a religious organization, a government office, a corporation, and so on. The pressure from these other parties is often intense, certainly a constant presence, often impossible to satisfy, though their wishes may be understandable. Still, it is one thing to want someone else to change; it is something else altogether to consider change in the face of the client’s actual life, capacities, and personal priorities.</p><p>Yet as counselors we often owe something to these other parties that may directly or indirectly pay our salaries. This tension is a limit on the freedom we might want to offer our clients and their work with us. I work within this tension and area of conflict first by prioritizing the welfare of my client, to the best of my ability to define that. I will not do something requested by another party if I think it will harm my client, which is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0362153713486100">Grégoire’s (1998)</xref> priority of protection. At the same time, I keep in mind that my client operates within a larger system, whether of family, university, or the greater community. Unless the outside party is making the client the whole problem (versus concerned about the problem the client may be having), I usually consider there to be something useful in the pressures that those outsiders bring to bear on the counseling and that those pressures represent something the client must live realistically within.</p><p>For example, I work with many clients from India, China, and Korea whose families have high expectations of and for them, both academically and professionally. These clients, as university students, may be encountering the American culture of self-determination for the first time and may find it attractive if intensely conflicting with their families’ cultures of hard work and social accountability. As students studying abroad, they may be discovering they do not want the lives their families have mapped out for them. So, they may begin to perform poorly, become psychologically symptomatic, and/or engage in high-risk behaviors. Their families may then contact the university to mobilize more local pressure on their children to study harder, stay on track, snap out of it, and so on. The counseling center is often brought in as a resource. The expectation is that we will help return the student to optimal, presymptomatic functioning as defined by the family.</p><p>Such situations are highly complicated. However, I am careful not to make the family the problem. After all, they are promoting what they know or believe to be best. There is often some wisdom in their beliefs. More so, their values around work and community are woven into many facets of each family’s life.</p><p>So, though I do not have to agree with the agendas or goals of the many parties that affect the therapeutic work of my counseling clients, I do have to take seriously the fact that these outside parties likely represent something of the world and context to which my clients will, in some manner, eventually return.</p></sec><sec id="section9-0362153713486100"><title>Many Selves, One Mind</title><p>In my place of work, any fixed notion of a professional identity has been pulled and stretched beyond recognition. I have had to find ways to speak to clients from many cultures, some for whom speaking with any kind of mental health professional is intensely shameful, some who insist on being given advice (when I have no clue what to suggest), some who struggle to express themselves in their nonnative language. I have had to find ways to talk with clients whose development is markedly out of phase—sophisticated one moment and shockingly immature the next. I have had to learn to speak with clients who are usually much, much brighter than I am, who process information at lightening speeds, who have sometimes come to a revelation long before I have. Some clients are very shy and hardly know how to talk; some know never to shut up. Some require an almost delicate, quiet pace; others want to blast through the counseling process at the same speed they chew up everything else in life. I receive hostile demands to remove all distress, without the client having to do anything. I see clients who recognize a need for self-awareness. Some want to chitchat, some to complain, some go blank; some are just plain embarrassed to be there.</p><p>In the course of a day, I can be called on to be eight or more different versions of myself. Attempting to match my clients’ modes of being and relating, to attune with them, to establish rapport in a very short time, I have been called to discover and make use of aspects of myself that, by nature, I might never have accessed. In the beginning, I found this energizing and exhausting. Now it feels more second nature and calm.</p><p>But through all of this shape shifting, I am surprised to find I still have one mind, that I remain recognizably myself, coherent, with a consistent framework for my practice as a counseling psychotherapist. This is not to say that my framework is not challenged and updated on a regular basis. Rather, the data of clinical experience contribute to a process of refining an approach that is recognizably mine and flexible enough across multiple modes of relating.</p></sec><sec id="section10-0362153713486100"><title>Just Talking</title><p>A client walks into my office and sits down. From there we find some way to talk together. What could be more ordinary?</p><p>As I described earlier, clients arrive in varied states and stages of knowing what they do or do not want to say, expecting or tolerating sometimes very particular, restricted responses from me. So I engage in conversation (or silence) in any manner that seems most comfortable for my clients. All the while, and in parallel, I am registering the flow of this conversation in my own body, perhaps like a traditional Chinese healer or Indian ayurvedic practitioner who listens to the rhythm and interaction of multiple bodily pulses in the person who has come for help. I ask, what is the effect of this talking—the client’s as well as my own—on the flow of sensations and meaning in my body? Does it begin to settle? Does it become more organized? Does it develop in capacity to bear the difficulties of life? I thus register the meaning of our exchange.</p><p>This sensing and evaluating is my guide for conversation, whether we are problem solving, commiserating, or apparently just discussing the weather. Each conversation becomes part of a larger story in which I can begin to find the meaning of this particular client’s life. All the while, I may be drawing on multiple frames of reference from many sources of training and life experiences.</p><p>I have learned to trust that in following this natural human process of interaction, something productive can come of it. I have learned to pay minute attention to the ways in which my part in the process can and must be adjusted to facilitate movement in the direction of maturation and development as those are defined by each client’s way of being, history, and current life context.</p><p>It may look like ordinary chatter, but it is constrained by my particular way of listening. For no matter how natural or ordinary it may appear, I do not talk (or listen) in this way when I am engaged with family, friends, or even colleagues. Yet I also refer to my practice as “just talking” as a way of acknowledging and valuing its everyday, human qualities.</p></sec><sec id="section11-0362153713486100"><title>One-Session “Treatment”</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0362153713486100">Fassbind-Kech (2011</xref>) has asked, “What if the first interview is also the last?” (p. 291). This has become an ever-present question for me, with no clear answer. So, I work with the assumption that each time I meet with a client in this counseling context, it may be our last session, even if it is also our first.</p><p>This fact of clinical life where I work is difficult for many of us on staff, and particularly for our trainees, who are learning to listen and conceptualize in a more psychodynamic manner, a method usually associated with long-term treatment. I have often wanted to create a course for our counseling trainees called, “One-Session Psychotherapy.” But I have not figured out how to frame it, and the press of everyday demands of seeing clients makes it hard to find time to sit and reflect. That is one of the limiting hazards of my current workplace.</p><p>In this section’s header, I put the word “treatment” in quotes because who really knows what to call the procedure(s) used in any given session?</p><p>Essentially, “one-session treatment” (be it counseling, coaching, consulting, or psychotherapy) means that I must engage with my client quickly, adjust to her or him within limits, not insist that he or she submit to my procedural norms. I have to absorb a great deal of information, verbal and nonverbal. I have to listen intently to my intuition while remaining fully skeptical of it. I speak what comes to me not as truth or certainty but framed for my client as a wondering or a thought that popped into my head or a possibility that may not be of much validity or use. Surely, I have to speak before I might be comfortably ready or certain. And during this 50-minute session, in which time is intensely compressed—without any expectation of a future, often without much of a past—I have to find my way to being present with this person, this client, hopefully to affect the flow of sensations and meaning, as I described listening earlier.</p><p>One-session work is partly pragmatic. I may have this one chance with this particular client, who in some manner has called for help. Existentially, working within the frame of a single session means a radical embodiment in the present, however much I may imagine the past or hope for a better future. This present-centered discipline is echoed for me in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0362153713486100">Verzaal’s (2012)</xref> discussion of “the spiritual core of counseling,” a practice of helping clients reconnect to their inner cores or “spirits within.” Verzaal’s reframing of counseling’s here-and-now focus acknowledges that we may have “but a short time with a client whose challenges may seem overwhelming and not realistically resolved quickly, but we may discover how to be with and accept, thus demonstrating a capacity of suffering with that is a mercy in its own right” (N. M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0362153713486100">Landaiche, 2012</xref>, p. 9).</p><p>This is where we are now, this is what we have to work with, life may offer no other chance.</p><p>And if we get a second or third chance? Actually, not much changes. Because after a week has passed in any client’s life—a week in which I have been only one of likely many encounters—the person who walks in the door next time may be in a different place, in a different mode of being. So we set to work from there, again as if this were our one and only time for an encounter with meaning.</p></sec><sec id="section12-0362153713486100"><title>A Steady Flow of Suffering</title><p>Most of the workweek I am locked, as it were, in my office, engaged in some form of conversation. On the few occasions when I get out and walk across our university campus, I am always surprised to see students who are smiling, appear energetic and hopeful, and are engaged with others. I then realize the skewed view I have of our student body. I see only things going wrong. In some cases, I see students whose lives were not going well before coming to university and whose lives after, given family histories, are not likely to get much better. Every day of work, this kind of unhappiness and suffering is what comes to me and my colleagues. And once there is some sign of amelioration, that person is free to move on and make room for the next distraught soul.</p><p>I have a good friend and colleague, someone I have known since graduate school, who works as a counselor in a methadone clinic not far from my office. Her clients are heroin addicts, socioeconomically disadvantaged, from rough neighborhoods and equally rough family lives, who also suffer from any number of other psychological and emotional difficulties. My friend describes her work as standing in disbelief while the flood of misery pours into her office, week after week, with any movement toward growth overwhelmed by the far greater press of misfortune.</p><p>This is similar to the clinic work of another friend, a psychotherapist with Jungian training, whose clients are sex offenders, many mandated by law to treatment. She must deal with the complications of law and family, of history and psychological makeup, not to mention the moral tensions in offering help to individuals who have harmed others terribly.</p><p>In the early 1990s, I cofacilitated a support group for volunteers who provided emotional and practical support to individuals with HIV disease at a time when AIDS was still seen as fatal, albeit then slowed in the wealthiest countries by the advent of newer, costly drug combinations. The volunteers worked one on one with—and became attached to and invested in—individuals whose life prospects were grim. As volunteers, they showed impressive resilience and compassion; many also showed signs over time of burnout.</p><p>These are just a few of the worlds—of professional work and clients’ lives—in which suffering may be softened but likely not relieved, perhaps akin to the lives and work of those in hospice care who face terminal illness in their clients.</p></sec><sec id="section13-0362153713486100"><title>Engagement Fatigue and Rupture Phobia</title><p>No matter what I call myself, my work setting demands that my practice fit certain parameters. For example, we can only offer treatment to currently enrolled students of the university. I must terminate with students who drop out, take leaves of absence, or graduate, even if we have established a strong, productive working relationship and they plan to stay in the area. I can only meet with students for, at most, 12 sessions each academic year, no matter how symptomatic, how well we are working or how well attached, or how unlikely the student will follow through on a referral to an outside provider once our 12 sessions are up.</p><p>In fact, most clients come for six sessions or less.</p><p>With so many different people, so much distress (both acute and chronic), so many new problems just when I think I have seen it all, so many demands for my differing modes of engagement, so much absorbing distress without always seeing a resolution, taking in more facts about lives than I can possibly remember, having to work fast, making so many likely errors, heartbroken, caring in spite of my wish to withdraw: I am often worn out. Surprisingly, I am not yet burned out.</p><p>I can tell this is changing me in some way. There is no way one’s body can come into this kind of contact, so often, so intensively, without it leaving a mark over time. There are moments when, having taken in so many histories and having imagined so many others’ lives, I can hardly remember my own.</p><p>But hardest is the fact that each intense encounter and attachment is inevitably broken. As I approach each client—whether new or someone I have seen before—I can feel myself bracing for the recurring anguish of another rupture. It remains painful after all this time. Nothing seems to help me find anything natural or good in this kind of repeated meeting and ripping apart, no matter how much I may love my work or find it worthwhile. As I have also discovered in choosing to be part of groups for my mental well-being, even when the group experience itself is hateful (see M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0362153713486100">Landaiche, 2012</xref>), worthwhile does not always mean grief free.</p></sec><sec id="section14-0362153713486100"><title>Limits Chosen and Given</title><p>When I think of limits, I think in part of my own limitations as a professional and person. No matter how skilled I may be with some clients, every week, sometimes every day, I encounter a client whose needs exceed my capabilities. I feel keenly my inability to be of help at those times.</p><p>Some limits that I live and work within are chosen. For example, I chose to be licensed as a mental health counselor, which means I will never be paid as much as a psychologist or enjoy quite the same prestige. I continue to choose my current place of work, which means I encounter all of the constraints I have just described and with them the intense frustrations and exhaustions of the work I am asked to do each day, albeit with satisfactions, too. I also choose my manner of working, which takes its toll physiologically and mentally but seems efficient and effective and thus worth pursuing.</p><p>I also think of limits existentially as the limits of this physical world and of my finite lifetime in it. This aspect of constraint is also something I feel strongly, sometimes achingly, with my clients as they encounter the limits of their own lives, both the chosen and the given.</p><p>I am lucky, so far, to work where I have some freedom to practice in a way that—even limited by the setting, my abilities, and what my clients need—is not really limited by a licensing or credentialing board. But if I were so constrained, how would I then construct my practice within those limits in a way that felt responsive to my clients and to my own developing sense of what is possible in human relating and conversation? This is the question to which I continually return.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn1-0362153713486100"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn2-0362153713486100"><label>Funding</label><p>The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0362153713486100"><citation citation-type="journal" xlink:type="simple"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>J.
