<abstract>
<p>In this study, we made an attempt to improve the mechanical and thermal properties of polypropylene (PP) using clay and alumina fillers. The dispersion of modified clay and alumina fillers in the polymer matrix was improved using (blended with) two different modifiers, maleic anhydride-grafted PP and ethylene–propylene–rubber, along with coupling agent. The effect of different loading levels of clay and alumina, keeping the other compositions constant, on mechanical and thermal properties of the nancomposites was studied and optimized. The dispersion of fillers was supported by X-ray diffraction and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. Presence and absence of modifier and coupling agent on the mechanical properties were also studied. Nanocomposites with 4% clay along with modifier and coupling agent have shown the best mechanical property. While nanocomposites with 4% alumina along with modifier and coupling agent have shown better thermal properties over the other composition. There is a 20–25% of improvement in both mechanical and thermal properties.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0892705711408633"><title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Polypropylene (PP) is the one which is used as general thermoplastics due to its excellent physical and mechanical properties, good heat resistance, high crystallinity, excellent moisture barrier, easy processability, good optical properties, and recyclable characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0892705711408633">1</xref>]. In order to further improve its properties, PP composites and nanocomposites have been developed. Typically, PP/organically modified clay nanocomposites are prepared by melt or solution blending techniques.</p>
<p>Nanocomposites provide significant improvement in the properties as compared to virgin polymer or conventional composites. Incorporation of nanofiller enhances the modulus, strength, and heat resistance, and decreases the gas permeability and flammability. Generally used layered silicates are montmorillonite (MMT), hectorite, and saponite. MMT is a 2:1 phyllosilicate; its crystalline structure consists of an octahedral sheet of alumina or magnesia which is surrounded by two tetrahedral silica sheets. The MMT has very high potential specific area (700 m<sup>2</sup>/g), a high aspect ratio, and good swelling properties. MMT can enhance thermal stability and mechanical strength and barrier properties when incorporated into a polymer at a very low concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0892705711408633">2</xref>].</p>
<p>The use of a compatibilizer undoubtedly improves the bonding between the clay and a polymer matrix. However, high compatibilizer content sometimes adversely affects the integrative properties of composites and increases the material cost. Lot of attention was given to the use of layered silicates (clay), as a great potential for producing materials of improved flame retardancy along with superior physical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0892705711408633">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0892705711408633">4</xref>]. The currently preferred anisotropic nanofiller MMT, which has a layered structure and hydrophilic in nature and not compatible with most polymers; so, it was chemically modified to render its surface more hydrophobic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0892705711408633">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0892705711408633">6</xref>]. Nanocomposites of layered silicate are gaining great improvement due to their unique properties resulting from the homogeneous dispersion of nanoclay as filler with low filler loading as compared to the conventional particulate-filled composites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0892705711408633">7</xref>].</p>
<p>The polarity of hydroxyl groups, which exist on the clay surface, prevent the entry of non-polar PP chains into the galleries; so, it is difficult to prepare exfoliated PP/clay nanocomposites with the solution and melt blending methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0892705711408633">8</xref>]. In this study, the mechanical and thermal properties of PP were improved using clay and alumina fillers. The dispersion of clay and alumina in the polymer matrix was improved by making three modifications to the system. Those are: (1) blending with maleic anhydride-grafted PP and ethylene–propylene–rubber (EPR), (2) improving the interaction of polymer and filler using coupling agent, and (3) increasing the hydrophobic nature of clay by modifying with organic modifier. The effect of different loading levels of clay and alumina on mechanical and thermal properties of the nancomposites was studied. Presence and absence of coupling agent on the mechanical properties were also studied.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0892705711408633"><title>Compounding and Test Specimen Preparation</title>
<p>PP nanocomposites were prepared by melt blending processes. The formulation details of composite are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0892705711408633">Table 1</xref>. PP, MAH-g-PP, MAH-g-EPR, nanoclay, and alumina were dried at 80°C for 4 h in air-circulated oven prior to compounding to remove moisture. PP was blended with 5 phr of two different matrix modifiers, i.e., MAH-g-PP and MAH-g-EPR. Then, it was compounded with nanoclay and alumina at the different loadings (0–4 phr) levels by twin-screw extruder Rhecord Haake 9000 (<italic>L</italic>/<italic>D</italic> ratio 24:1). During the extrusion process, the screw speed and temperature profile were set at 60 rpm and 170–210°C, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0892705711408633">9</xref>]. Standard specimens for mechanical and thermal testings were prepared by semi-automatic injection molding machine, Taxair – 40, using a set of temperature programs 190–230°C.

<sec id="sec14-0892705711408633"><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
<p>In this study, we made an attempt to improve both mechanical and thermal properties of PP by incorporating alumina and clay fillers along with compatiblizer and coupling agents.</p>
<sec id="sec15-0892705711408633"><title>Dispersion State of Filler Particles</title>
<p>It is well known that the dispersion of nanofillers is very good at concentrations below 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0892705711408633">11</xref>]. In this study, we have used 4% of different proportions of mixture of clay and alumina fillers. Also, 5% of two different compatibilizers, MAH-g-PP and MAH-g-EPR, along with 1% coupling agent were used to improve compatibility of hydrophilic filler with hydrophobic matrix. The dispersion of filler in the matrix was confirmed by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and XRD. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0892705711408633">Figure 1(a)</xref>, it is very clear that low-intense broad peak was present at around 10° (2<italic>θ</italic>), while pure MMT gives a sharp peak, indicating the formation of intercalated nanocomposite using MAH-g-PP as compatibilizer. Similarly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0892705711408633">Figure 1(b)</xref> shows that exfoliated nanocomposite was formed using MAH-g-EPR as compatibilizer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0892705711408633">12</xref>]. Further, the dispersion was supported by high-resolution SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0892705711408633">Figure 2</xref>(a)–(c)).

<sec id="sec16-0892705711408633"><title>Mechanical Properties</title>
<p>The effect of different formulations, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0892705711408633">Table 1</xref>, on mechanical properties of nanocomposites was studied by UTM and impact tester. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0892705711408633">Figure 3</xref>(a) and (b) shows that tensile and flexural strengths were increased with increasing proportion of modified clay. Similarly, the same trend was observed in the case of tensile and flexural moduli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0892705711408633">Figure 4</xref>(a) and (b)). This indicates that the compatibilizer (both MAH-g-PP and MAH-g-EPR) and coupling agents enhanced the uniformity of filler dispersion in the PP matrix, which leads to the improvement in the mechanical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0892705711408633">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0892705711408633">14</xref>].

<p>The similar trend was observed for impact property of nanocomposite where MAH-g-EPR compatibilizer showed better property compared to the other because of more rubbery/elastic nature of MAH-g-EPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0892705711408633">Figure 5</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0892705711408633">15</xref>].

<p>The attempt made to improve the mechanical and thermal properties of PP using clay and alumina fillers was successful. Presence and absence of modifier and coupling agent on the mechanical properties were also studied. The coupling agent and modifiers are effective in their function in improving the dispersion of fillers. The better dispersion of fillers reflected in the improvement of mechanical and thermal properties. Nanocomposites with 4% clay along with modifier and coupling agent have shown the best mechanical property. While nanocomposites with 4% alumina along with modifier and coupling agent have shown better thermal properties over the other composition. There is a 20–25% of improvement in both mechanical and thermal properties.</p>
