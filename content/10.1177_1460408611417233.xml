<abstract>
<p><bold>Objectives</bold>: Blood loss has long been recognised as a significant problem in burn surgery. Efforts have been made in the past to quantify this loss and determine what factors influence it the most. Several researchers have been able to produce and validate formulae that predict the volume of blood loss during excisional surgery. Accurately determining this allows appropriate volumes of blood to be ordered, reducing risk to patients and saving scarce resources. This article reviews the literature on blood loss in burns surgery, including influencing factors, methods of prediction and effective management.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: A literature review was conducted to examine methods used to measure, calculate and reduce blood loss in burn surgery. The validity of these methods and the limitations on accuracy will be discussed. Alternative methods shall also be considered.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Most current methods of estimating blood loss attempt to determine the volume of erythrocytes required to return haemoglobin concentrations to their pre-operative level. Various formulae have been developed to calculate this volume.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Several authors have produced formulae that predict the volume of blood loss to a significant degree of accuracy. Different techniques have been shown to significantly reduce blood loss. In other areas of surgery, thromboelastometry has been used to identify the levels of specific blood component defects. The use of this method in burns surgery could, in the future, help develop a protocol for operative blood transfusion.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1460408611417233"><title>Background</title>
<p>Early excision and grafting of burn wounds is now the standard practice at most major burn centres around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1460408611417233">Jeffery, 2009</xref>). Since it was first described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408611417233">Janzekovic (1970)</xref>, a lot of attention has been paid to the significant blood loss associated with burn surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408611417233">Ong et al., 2006</xref>). This blood loss necessitates cross-matching and blood replacement. It is therefore important to know how much blood is being lost during surgery so that the correct number of units of blood can be ordered and delivered. This has been shown to be most closely related to the area excised, but assessing the volume has been shown in several studies to be difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408611417233">Desai et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611417233">Dye, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611417233">Budny et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408611417233">Brecher et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408611417233">Hart et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1460408611417233">Jeschke et al., 2007</xref>). The difficulty in estimating blood loss often leads to a disparity between the number of units cross-matched and the number of transfusions required. Under-ordering blood may leave patients dangerously anaemic, whereas over-ordering and over-transfusing is associated with an increased risk of immunosuppression and sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611417233">Dye, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1460408611417233">Jeschke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408611417233">Tricklebank, 2009</xref>). It also places a greater financial burden on the health service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611417233">Criswell and Gamelli, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408611417233">Rahe-Meyer et al., 2009</xref>). One study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611417233">Brown et al. (1995)</xref> at a centre in South Africa found that, despite awareness of the potential for unnecessary expenditure, 46% of their total year’s blood costs went on unutilised blood. While some studies advocate ‘eye-balling’ the volume of blood lost during surgery as the most exact method of assessing the required replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611417233">Budny et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611417233">Criswell and Gamelli, 2005</xref>), others state that the inherent difficulties in monitoring intra-operative blood loss make this inaccurate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408611417233">Desai et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611417233">Dye, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408611417233">Brecher et al., 1997</xref>). This situation has highlighted the need for a method of determining, before the start of surgery, the likely blood loss a patient will suffer. Several groups have tried to tackle this problem by isolating the factors that determine the volume of blood loss likely to occur and comparing this to measured or calculated volumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408611417233">Desai et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611417233">Dye, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611417233">Budny et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611417233">Brown et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611417233">Barret et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408611417233">Hart et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611417233">Criswell and Gamelli, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>There are a number of challenges facing authors and researchers who wish to describe the association between burn surgery and blood loss. A variety of influencing factors have been proposed including individual variability, surgical technique, total burn size, the burn-to-excision time, and the site and size of the area excised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611417233">Dye, 1993</xref>). This, combined with the fact that surgeons are continuously developing new methods to try and reduce surgical blood loss, makes developing a universal approach difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408611417233">Warden et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408611417233">Robertson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408611417233">Hart et al., 2001</xref>). Identifying the factors that influence blood loss requires an accurate method of measuring or calculating the volume lost. Those described in literature include formulae that look at changes in blood test results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408611417233">Warden et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1460408611417233">Steadman and Pegg, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611417233">Budny et al., 1993</xref>), measurement of weight changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611417233">Budny et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611417233">Brown et al., 1995</xref>) and estimations made by the surgical team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611417233">Budny et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611417233">Criswell and Gamelli, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>This article reviews the current literature, examining methods used to measure or calculate blood loss in surgery, the relationship between burns and blood loss, and the techniques employed to reduce bleeding.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1460408611417233"><title>Calculating blood loss</title>
<p>Accurate measurement of blood loss is difficult. The most obvious method of determining blood loss would seem to be direct measurement by collecting the blood lost during surgery. This can be attempted by gravimetric analysis; weighing swabs, drapes, dressings and surgical gowns before and after surgery, as well as measuring volumes in suction canisters. This method is complicated; the collection of fluid used in lavage procedures, evaporation and blood loss that escapes collection (e.g. to the operating room floor) lead to an inaccurate result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408611417233">Brecher et al., 1997</xref>). One study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611417233">Budny et al. (1993)</xref> found that when comparing gravimetric analysis with other techniques, this method underestimated blood loss by as much as 49%. To get a result with any accuracy this method of blood loss analysis must be planned and executed extremely carefully. This makes the technique slow and complicated, and results are rarely available immediately at the end of surgery, so it would be difficult to implement on a large scale. Despite the recognised drawbacks this method of blood loss analysis is still used, but generally reserved for determining the accuracy of other methods of calculation. For these trial procedures the operations are strictly controlled; blood collection is meticulous and additional lavage fluid is limited or not used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408611417233">Desai et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611417233">Dye, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611417233">Brown et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>A technique that can be faster and easier to implement is to draw on the experience of the surgical and anaesthetic team to settle on an intra-operative estimated blood loss (EBL) by visual assessment during the operation and observation of monitored cardiovascular signs (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.). It has been suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611417233">Budny et al. (1993)</xref> that it is probably in this manner that most surgeons and anaesthetists base the transfusion requirements of patients. It is a recognised technique in research too; it has been used by several different groups to quantify blood loss in a variety of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408611417233">Brecher et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408611417233">Robertson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611417233">Criswell and Gamelli, 2005</xref>). Critics of EBL say that it may not always be suitable; blood loss may be rapid, there may be many surgeons working on different areas of one patient simultaneously and blood may escape unnoticed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611417233">Budny et al., 1993</xref>). As this method of blood loss analysis is based on estimation it seems that it would be inherently inaccurate. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408611417233">Robertson et al. (2001)</xref> noted that, in a series of 37 procedures, this method varied from a formulaic calculation of blood loss by less than 10%. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611417233">Budny et al. (1993)</xref> attempted to validate clinical EBL by comparing it to a calculated blood loss. They found that, while there was a good correlation between the EBL and calculated loss, clinicians tended to underestimate blood loss, giving a value of between 57% and 87% of the calculated value.</p>
<p>The intra-clinician variability demonstrated by EBL highlights the value of a more consistent, universally applicable method of devising a value for the volume of blood lost. A simple method of calculating blood loss is to use values shown on common blood tests to demonstrate changes and extrapolate from these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408611417233">Brecher et al., 1997</xref>). A Full Blood Count (FBC) is one of the most commonly performed blood tests and gives values that relate to the makeup of an individual’s blood. Haemoglobin and haematocrit values in particular relate to the concentration of red blood cells and acute changes in these measurements strongly indicate loss or addition (through transfusion) of red cells. This observation was quantified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1460408611417233">Mollison (1979)</xref>, who noted that 1 unit (510 mL) of whole blood increases haemoglobin by 1–1.25 g/dL in a 70 kg individual. Using this and other values, formulae have been developed to quantify blood loss from variables recorded peri-operatively in a FBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1460408611417233">Steadman and Pegg, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611417233">Budny et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408611417233">Brecher et al., 1997</xref>). One of the most cited formulae is that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408611417233">Warden et al. (1982)</xref> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1460408611417233">Formula 1</xref>), which is given as follows:</p>
<p><bold>Formula 1:</bold>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1460408611417233"><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula1-1460408611417233" xlink:href="10.1177_1460408611417233-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>RBCV</italic> is the red blood cell volume, (m) refers to male patient, (f) refers to female patient. Volumes are measured in mL.</p>
<p>This formula uses pre- and post-operative haematocrit (the percentage of blood composed of erythrocytes) results along with transfusion data to calculate the number of red cells lost and from this; the blood volume lost. The calculation is simplified; it assumes that the circulating volume of is 7% total body weight for men and 8% for women. It also implies that total circulating volume will be maintained despite blood loss, as the calculated circulating blood volume uses the same (pre-op) body weight. If circulating blood volume decreased with blood loss then the haematocrit would be maintained; therefore, the post-operative FBC must be taken when the patient is once more haemodynamically stable. Even if this is the case, the equation actually calculates the volume of erythrocytes lost and extrapolates from that. The denominator of the equation is the post-operative haematocrit; implying that all lost blood was at the concentration of the post-operative blood. Despite these assumptions and approximations, when this method is tested against precise gravimetric analysis it has shown to be accurate to within 15% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408611417233">Desai et al., 1990</xref>). It has since been used in clinical practice at one centre to derive resuscitation requirements and has shown good results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408611417233">Hart et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Another formulaic way of calculating blood loss uses the change in the concentration of haemoglobin. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1460408611417233">Steadman and Pegg (1992)</xref> used a formula attributed to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1460408611417233">a 1984 publication by Snelling and Shaw</xref> that applied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1460408611417233">Mollison’s (1979)</xref> observation and change in haemoglobin (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1460408611417233">Formula 2</xref>):</p>
<p><bold>Formula 2:</bold>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1460408611417233"><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula2-1460408611417233" xlink:href="10.1177_1460408611417233-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
This formula was not designed to calculate the volume of blood lost, but the volume of whole blood required to return the patient’s haemoglobin to the pre-operative level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1460408611417233">Mollison, 1979</xref>). As it was noted that 510 mL of whole blood raises haemoglobin of a 70 kg individual by ≈1 g/dL, this formula can essentially be simplified to the change in haemoglobin multiplied by 510 mL, adjusted for patient weight (a 1 g/dL change implies more blood loss for heavier patients and less for lighter patients owing to the differing circulating volumes). It is apparent that this formula does not attempt to account for additional units of blood transfused during the operation; however, this can be added on subsequently. In this study patients were only transfused with whole blood, so the correction for blood loss is simply the addition of volume transfused. Currently, packed red cells (PRC) are more commonly used, so to use this formula a correction would have to be made when adding the transfused units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611417233">Budny et al., 1993</xref>). Once again blood volume is assumed to remain constant. The study used post-operative haemoglobin from a FBC taken 24 h post-operatively; assuming that by this time the patient will have been made haemodynamically stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1460408611417233">Steadman and Pegg, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>A formula that similarly uses the change in haemoglobin concentration was devised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611417233">Budny et al. (1993)</xref>, though this formula, rather than using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1460408611417233">Mollison’s (1979)</xref> calculation, uses a formal estimation of blood volume (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1460408611417233">Formula 3</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>Formula 3:</bold>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-1460408611417233"><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula3-1460408611417233" xlink:href="10.1177_1460408611417233-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>
This formula calculates how much blood must have been lost for the concentration of haemoglobin to have dropped that amount, assuming the circulating volume is returned to the pre-operative level. FBC measurements were taken 24 h before surgery and 48 h post-operatively. Once more it assumes transfused volume will be whole blood but a simple calculation can give an equivalent value if PRC or other blood products are used. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611417233">Budny (1993)</xref> used the formula as the control method for measuring blood loss against which to compare other methods. This formula was used again by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408611417233">Robertson et al. (2001)</xref>, who also recorded an agreed EBL from the anaesthetists and surgeons involved. There was less than 10% difference between the two methods of measurement.</p>
<p>The previously described formulae all simplify the process of blood loss and transfusion. They imply that blood loss and subsequent change in haemoglobin and haematocrit is linear and can be described in a single formula. The reality is clearly more complicated. In an attempt to develop a more accurate model of blood loss, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408611417233">Brecher et al. (1997)</xref> produced a formula that separates peri-operative blood changes into three phases: from commencement of surgery to the start of transfusion, from the start of transfusion to the end of blood loss and from the end of blood loss through until recovery. The formula is complex and requires serial intra-operative measurements of haematocrit to detect the level at which transfusion is triggered. The result of a trial including 250 patients with this formula demonstrated a strong correlation (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) with the EBL produced by the anaesthetists, although the correlation coefficient was poor (<italic>r</italic> = 0.38), with EBL generally being half that calculated. This was attributed to the recognised weaknesses of EBL and the general underestimation previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611417233">Budny et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408611417233">Brecher et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The calculation of blood loss using a mathematical model is included commonly in burns literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408611417233">Desai et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611417233">Barret et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408611417233">Hart et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408611417233">Robertson et al., 2001</xref>). This is despite criticism; peri-operative administration of colloid and crystalloid, as well as fluid loss through evaporation, urination and third spacing, all affect haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1460408611417233">Ors, 2002</xref>). It has been well established that the stress response to both burns and surgical intervention induce a systemic inflammatory response. This response causes bodily endothelial dysfunction, allowing protein and fluid to leak into the interstitium. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1460408611417233">Vlachou et al. (2008)</xref> demonstrated a markedly raised albumin–creatinine ratio (a marker of capillary leak) in burns patients, which was further exacerbated by excisional surgery. Burn resuscitation is often carried out using crystalloid fluid, which can quickly leave the circulation into the interstitium. Leakage in this manner places considerable doubt upon the assumption made by these formulae; that circulating volume stays the same peri-operatively, even with adequate circulatory support with transfusion and fluid resuscitation. Third spacing of fluids in this manner also affects patient weight peri-operatively with an increase of 0.2 kg/%full thickness burn in patients resuscitated with crystalloid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1460408611417233">Vlachou et al., 2010</xref>). This may lead to further inaccuracy of the estimation of blood volume. The formulae do not account for the body’s innate replacement of blood cells, which in patients who do not receive their post-operative FBC until after 48 h may be significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408611417233">Goodnough, 2007</xref>). There is also the fact that the formulae, in reality, do not measure blood loss; they measure erythrocyte concentration changes and extrapolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611417233">Budny et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408611417233">Warden et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1460408611417233">Steadman and Pegg, 1992</xref>). Blood is a far more complex tissue than just erythrocytes. Platelets, plasma proteins and clotting factors are also a substantial and important part of blood composition. Transfusions with units of platelets and Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) may also be required to adequately replace blood. Despite this, research into their rate of depletion with blood loss seems notably absent from the literature. There is evidence that some starch colloids used in fluid resuscitation may measurably impair coagulation, suggesting that this also influences blood requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408611417233">Tricklebank, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec3-1460408611417233"><title>Predicting blood loss</title>
<p>The obvious drawback of the above methods is that, regardless of their accuracy, they are all retrospective. In the case of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611417233">Budny’s (1993)</xref> original formula, to calculate actual blood loss one must wait 48 h post operatively for a result. Ordering blood takes time. Cross matching takes labs approximately 45 min, so not ordering blood for a patient in advance could prove costly. Electronic or computer cross matching may be shorter and is the answer in some departments to reduce blood wastage. There is also the time taken to deliver cross-matched blood to a patient; if a clinician has underestimated the volume required then the extra units required may not be to hand when needed. With these dangers apparent, there is a temptation to err on the side of caution and over order blood, which in turn has financial implications as well as potential negative side effects of unnecessarily transfusing a patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611417233">Brown et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408611417233">Tricklebank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611417233">Criswell and Gamelli, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>To counter the deficiency of these methods, some have attempted to develop formulae that use patient features measurable before surgery to predict the blood loss that will occur during their operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611417233">Dye, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408611417233">Hart et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611417233">Brown et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611417233">Criswell and Gamelli, 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1460408611417233">Table 1</xref>). Measurement of these features has identified significant relationships with blood loss. This has allowed the development of rudimentary formulae for predicting blood loss in burns surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611417233">Dye, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611417233">Brown et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611417233">Criswell and Gamelli, 2005</xref>). The strongest determinant of blood loss is the area excised during surgery; either the absolute area in square centimetre, or as a percentage of the total body surface area (TBSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408611417233">Hart et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408611417233">Tricklebank, 2009</xref>). This will be decided in most cases pre-operatively by the surgeon. Other factors thought to be important are the area of the donor site to be taken and the circulating volume of the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611417233">Dye, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611417233">Brown et al., 1995</xref>). All these can be estimated prior to surgery.

<p>Despite not finding a significant relationship, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611417233">Dye (1993)</xref> produced a paper that concluded a blood loss to area excised ratio of 6:1 was suitable for modelling purposes. In order to adequately cover the transfusion needs of patients he suggested a formula for ordering whole blood (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-1460408611417233">Formula 4</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>Formula 4:</bold>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula5-1460408611417233"><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula5-1460408611417233" xlink:href="10.1177_1460408611417233-eq5.tif"/></disp-formula>
Rearranging this formula to give results in terms of volume of whole blood gives almost the same relationship noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611417233">Budny et al. (1993)</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1460408611417233">Table2</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611417233">Dye (1993)</xref> suggested that if PRC were used instead of whole blood then the rest of the volume should be made up in human albumin or FFP. He stated that ordering by this protocol would cover the requirement for over 75% of cases.</p>
<p>The above formulae are very basic and take into account few variables. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408611417233">Hart et al. (2001)</xref> showed that area excised was the most strongly predictive factor for blood loss but it was only responsible for 50% of the variability, implying that other factors also contribute. Using other variables they devised a formula that would account for nearly 80% of the variability in blood loss (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-1460408611417233">Formula 5</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>Formula 5:</bold>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula6-1460408611417233"><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula6-1460408611417233" xlink:href="10.1177_1460408611417233-eq6.tif"/></disp-formula>
This formula involves many variables and requires several measurements that may be difficult to take (TBSA and log count of gram-negative bacteria in wound) and some of the data would only be known after the operation (length of operation and volume of epinephrine solution used). Other authors, using their own, simpler, formulae for determining the volume of blood that should be transfused to burns patients, have shown good results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611417233">Brown et al. (1995)</xref> tested a formula that also incorporated the area of the donor site for use with children (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula7-1460408611417233">Formula 6</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>Formula 6:</bold>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula7-1460408611417233"><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula7-1460408611417233" xlink:href="10.1177_1460408611417233-eq7.tif"/></disp-formula>
When comparing this formula to measured blood loss (by gravimetric analysis) a highly significant correlation was found (<italic>R</italic> = 0.994, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 98.8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611417233">Brown et al., 1995</xref>). The formula used gives equal importance to the excised area of the burn and the area of the donor site, implying that blood loss from these two areas is the same. For instance, using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611417233">Brown et al.’s (1995)</xref> formula, a patient with an excised area of 30%TBSA covered with a 15%TBSA split skin graft (SSG) meshed at 2:1 would be expected to lose as much blood as a patient with an excised area of 22.5%TBSA covered with a 22.5%TBSA SSG fenestrated at 1:1.</p>
<p>Using Brown’s formula for transfusion purposes implies blood loss can be accounted for by transfusing the same volume of whole blood or an equivalent volume in PRC. A different approach was taken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611417233">Criswell and Gamelli (2005)</xref>. Rather than focus on replacing volume they used a patient’s post-operative haematocrit as a target for replacement. By using 25–31 as an acceptable range they devised a formula for transfusing units of PRC that would result in an appropriate haematocrit in adults (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula8-1460408611417233">Formula 7</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611417233">Criswell and Gamelli, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>Formula 7:</bold>
<disp-formula id="disp-formula8-1460408611417233"><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula8-1460408611417233" xlink:href="10.1177_1460408611417233-eq8.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>This formula produced a good correlation (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02); however, when it is compared with the relationship others have recorded between area excised and blood loss a discrepancy can be seen. Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611417233">Barret et al.’s (1999)</xref> noted relationship of: <italic>Blood loss (mL) = cm<sup>2</sup> to be excised</italic> × 0.51 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), a patient who has 2000 cm<sup>2</sup> excised would be predicted to have lost 1020 mL of blood (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1460408611417233">Table 2</xref>). Criswell’s (1999) formula states that the same patient should be transfused with 3.56 units of PRC. In terms of haemoglobin replacement, this translates roughly to an equivalent of 1780 mL of whole blood (1 unit of PRC ≈ 1 unit of whole blood; 1 unit of whole blood ≈ 500 mL); over 50% more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1460408611417233">Mollison, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408611417233">Warden et al., 1982</xref>). This difference shows that blood replacement may be more complicated than simply replacing the volume of red cells lost.</p>
<p>The different formulae and relationships noted by the above authors display a large amount of variability. This can partly be explained by surgical ability and inter-procedural variability, but it also highlights that there are other factors involved in blood loss. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408611417233">Hart et al. (2001)</xref>, many different variables have an influence to a greater or lesser extent (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-1460408611417233">Formula 5</xref>). In an effort to reduce blood loss, different surgical practises have been employed. These may vary between centres and therefore the blood loss relationships noted by each of the authors may reflect slightly different procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611417233">Barret et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408611417233">Robertson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1460408611417233">Ors, 2002</xref>). Recognition of these other significant factors and the development of improved surgical technique can help to significantly reduce blood loss in patients and improve outcome.</p>

<p>While being able to measure and predict blood loss may improve the ability to adequately transfuse blood products, there are recognised drawbacks to simply replacing lost volume. Patients who receive large blood transfusions are more susceptible to infections and sepsis because the replacement products lack immune components, leaving the recipient immunocompromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611417233">Dye, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1460408611417233">Jeschke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408611417233">Tricklebank, 2009</xref>). There is also a risk, however small, of contracting a blood born infection. An estimated 1 in 1,000,000 units of PRCs transfused results in transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus and 1 in 100,000 result in transmission of hepatitis C. Approximately 40 people a year die from transfusion reaction or blood contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611417233">Criswell and Gamelli, 2005</xref>). Even when patients are adequately transfused with red cells, it is difficult to predict what other blood products are appropriate. Massive blood loss accelerates the consumption of coagulation factors and can lead to an acquired coagulopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408611417233">Rahe-Meyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408611417233">Gertler et al., 2011</xref>). The cost of ordering blood is also significant, whether the blood is used or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611417233">Criswell and Gamelli, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408611417233">Rahe-Meyer et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>All these factors have lead to the development of different techniques and methods to reduce blood loss in general and, therefore, lower the requirement for transfusion and its associated drawbacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611417233">Barret et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408611417233">Robertson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408611417233">Warden et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408611417233">Hart et al., 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408611417233">Warden et al. (1982)</xref> looked at a variety of parameters for reducing blood loss and found that application of a tourniquet reduced blood loss by up to 40% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1460408611417233">Table 1</xref>). While this is a significant reduction, it is only suitable for the limbs and may have drawbacks even in this setting. By preventing blood flow to the excised area there is a reliance on surgeon experience and judgement to decide when enough tissue has been excised. Without visible bleeding it is easy to leave behind areas of inadequate excision, or to sacrifice healthy tissue to ensure a sufficient depth has been taken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611417233">Barret et al., 1999</xref>). Another approach to haemostasis is with the use of adrenaline (epinephrine). Adrenaline in this situation acts as a vaso-constrictor; tightening blood vessels to the skin and hence reducing the blood that could be lost there through surgery. Both pre-excisional sub-dermal injection of adrenaline by the tumescent technique and post-excisional compression of wounds with adrenaline soaked compresses have been examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611417233">Barret et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408611417233">Robertson et al., 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611417233">Barret et al. (1999)</xref> found no significant reduction in bleeding between a group of 21 patients who received topical and subcutaneous adrenaline and a control group who received saline. However, 2 years later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408611417233">Robertson et al. (2001)</xref> reported a significant reduction of almost 70% in blood loss when the tumescent technique was used (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0001). Neither of these two groups found any negative effects of the use of adrenaline and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611417233">Barret et al. (1999)</xref> noted that it is remarkable that no complications have been reported with the use of adrenaline, despite levels as high as those seen in phaeochromocytoma patients having been reported. Both these groups used topical thrombin spray as an adjunct to coagulation on the donor and excision sites. Thrombin, as an important part of the coagulation pathway, helps with haemostasis by encouraging clotting. Other studies have shown that used in isolation, thrombin and adrenaline are as effective as each other but the relative prices make adrenaline the preferred management option. An alternative option for sealing wounds using clotting factors is fibrin. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408611417233">Ihara et al. (1984)</xref> found that the use of a fibrin sealant when skin grafting reduced the amount transfused from 2038 mL per operation to 1226 mL. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1460408611417233">McGill et al. (1997)</xref> reported that estimated blood loss was reduced from 0.98 to 0.5 mL/cm<sup>2</sup> if a fibrin sealant (Tisseel<sup>TM</sup>) was used in conjunction with skin grafting.</p>
<p>A theme that has been important in burn surgery since it was first highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408611417233">Janzekovic (1970)</xref> is the time between burn and surgery. She determined that in a series of 1600 patients, excision between the third and fifth day improved healing and reduced morbidity. This has been corroborated by numerous sources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408611417233">Desai et al. (1990)</xref> found that there was a window between 2 and 16 days post burn, during which bleeding was more severe. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611417233">Barret et al. (1999)</xref> found a similar relationship, with burns operated on between 2 and 7 days losing significantly more blood than those outside this window; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408611417233">Hart et al. (2001)</xref> found a significant increase between 3 and 15 days. Other studies like those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408611417233">Warden et al. (1982)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1460408611417233">Steadman and Pegg (1992)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611417233">Dye (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611417233">Brown et al. (1995)</xref> have not been able to show this association. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408611417233">Warden et al. (1982)</xref> looked at the difference between surgery before and after 14 days, as did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1460408611417233">Steadman and Pegg (1992)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611417233">Dye (1993)</xref> looked at patients operated on before and after 7 days. These studies may be confounded by the fact they only consider two time periods and have not noted the window of blood loss seen by the other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408611417233">Desai et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611417233">Barret et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408611417233">Hart et al., 2001</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611417233">Brown et al. (1995)</xref> did consider this three-phase model and found no significant difference between blood losses in surgeries performed between 3 ando 6 days, 7 ando 16 days and over 16 days. This may be due to the earliest window noted (3 to 6 days post-burn) being too late, as the other studies found that, for a notable reduction in blood loss, surgery should be performed before day 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408611417233">Hart et al., 2001</xref>). A meta analysis by Ong et al. (2005) found that early excision was in fact associated with an increased need for blood products, but the time frame for this is not described and they make no reference to any time window in which bleeding may be different.</p>

<p>Another way to potentially reduce the volume of blood transfused is to predict the blood products required more accurately. As was previously noted, most of the equations and predictions mentioned above focus solely on erythrocyte depletion. Blood is a far more complex tissue and its components are not necessarily lost at the same rate. Epithelial damage, as seen in burns, leads to a rapid consumption of clotting factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408611417233">Vlachou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408611417233">Rahe-Meyer et al., 2009</xref>). By transfusing just red cells, or an inadequate ratio of blood products, this problem can be exacerbated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408611417233">Luddington, 2005</xref>). Although the above studies do mention the use of other blood products such as platelets and FFP, there is no strict regime adhered to and the volumes transfused are often too low to analyse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611417233">Criswell and Gamelli, 2005</xref>). Correctly replacing blood components in the right ratios has been shown to significantly reduce the volumes of blood products required in other areas of surgery. To accurately establish the required components, information about the clotting quality of blood needs to be determined. In other areas of surgery this has been achieved by the use of thromboelastometry (thromboelastography) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408611417233">Davidson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408611417233">Luddington, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408611417233">Gertler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408611417233">Rahe-Meyer et al., 2009</xref>). Systems for this include the TEG® and ROTEM® devices that analyse clot formation and subsequent lysis. By individually examining the phases of clot development and the introduction of various reagents, detailed information about clotting can be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408611417233">Luddington, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Thromboelastography has been used in both hepatic and cardiothoracic surgery with good results. This can be performed near the patient, and can provide the surgeon with a rapid differentiation between surgical and coagulopathic bleeding. Both these surgeries can involve massive blood loss with associated coagulopathy and transfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408611417233">Davidson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408611417233">Luddington, 2005</xref>). Results from these tests have been used to develop formulae for the dosing of clotting factors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408611417233">Rahe-Meyer et al. (2009)</xref> used ROTEM® to guide transfusion of fibrinogen in cardiothoracic patients. Using FIBTEM, a test that extrinsically activates coagulation and platelet inhibition, to measure maximum clot firmness (MCF) at the end of surgery a formula was developed (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula9-1460408611417233">Formula 8</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>Formula 8:</bold>

where <italic>C</italic> is a constant indicating a patient of 70 kg requires 0.5 g of fibrinogen concentrate to raise FIBTEM MCF by 1 mm:

This study showed that use of thromboelastometry to guide clotting factor replacement improved peri-operative management of coagulopathic bleeding and reduced the need for transfusion when compared to algorithmic management with platelets and FFP.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1460408611417233" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Bleeding in burn surgery has always been a problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408611417233">Warden et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408611417233">Ong et al., 2006</xref>). Various studies have been conducted to try and quantify volumes lost in relation to other factors; most significantly, area excised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611417233">Dye, 1993</xref>; Hart <italic>et al</italic>., 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408611417233">Ong et al., 2006</xref>). These investigations have led some to develop their own formulae for predicting the volume of blood lost and hence the volume that should be transfused to replace this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611417233">Brown et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611417233">Criswell and Gamelli, 2005</xref>). These formulae are focused purely on red cell replacement and this may be inadequate. Despite recognition of the need for other blood components, no formal guide for their use has been examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408611417233">Rahe-Meyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611417233">Criswell and Gamelli, 2005</xref>). There is also the issue of cost and transfusion-related complications such as immunosuppression and sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611417233">Brown et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408611417233">Tricklebank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408611417233">Rahe-Meyer et al., 2009</xref>). To counter this, efforts have been made to reduce the volume of blood products transfused. Timing of surgery and use of surgical adjuncts such as tourniquets, adrenaline and thrombin spray have all been shown to significantly reduce blood loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408611417233">Desai et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611417233">Barret et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408611417233">Robertson et al., 2001</xref>). In other surgical specialties where large volumes of blood loss have been a problem, thromboelastometry has been shown to give data that can be used to significantly reduce blood loss. These results can be used to tailor treatment with clotting factors and so reduce the need for transfusions and subsequently, reduce morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408611417233">Davidson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408611417233">Luddington, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408611417233">Gertler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408611417233">Rahe-Meyer et al., 2009</xref>). Thromboelastometry has yet to be used in burn surgery but the features of burns, such as large areas of wound exposed to the air, large volumes of blood loss and endothelial dysfunction all predispose to consumption of clotting factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408611417233">Ong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1460408611417233">Ors, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1460408611417233">Vlachou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1460408611417233">Rahe-Meyer et al., 2009</xref>). This suggests that further investigations into blood loss and application of thromboelastometry data could help develop transfusion guidelines that would help reduce blood loss, reduce transfusion requirements and reduce morbidity.</p>
