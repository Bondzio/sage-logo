<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The abdominal core muscles (internal and external oblique, rectus and transversus abdominis) play an important role in the baseball activities of pitching and hitting. Proper abdominal muscle activation during throwing and swinging is crucial for generating optimal ball velocity and bat speed. Abdominal muscle strains can result in substantial loss of playing time, and their incidence has never been reported in baseball.</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis:</bold> The incidence of abdominal muscle strains in Major League Baseball has been rising over the past 20 years. Injuries contralateral to the dominant arm or batting side are more common and require more time to recover.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design:</bold> Descriptive epidemiology study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Abdominal muscle strains in baseball players were determined by retrospective review of the Major League Baseball disabled list from 1991 to 2010. Player age, position, dominant hand, batting side, and recovery time were recorded.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> There were 393 abdominal muscle strains in Major League Baseball from 1991 to 2010, constituting 5% of all baseball injuries. At least 92% of these injuries were internal/external oblique or intercostal muscle strains, and 44% of injuries were sustained by pitchers. The reinjury rate was 12.1%. An upward trend was seen from 1991 to 2010, especially in early-season injuries, and the overall injury rate was 22% higher in the 2000s than in the 1990s. Pitchers averaged 35.4 days on the disabled list compared with 26.7 days for position players (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01); 78.1% of pitcher injuries were contralateral to their dominant arm, and 70.3% of position player injuries were contralateral to their dominant batting side (excluding switch hitters). Position players missed more time for contralateral than for ipsilateral injuries (28.9 vs 21.2 days, <italic>P</italic> = .03), whereas pitchers missed more time for ipsilateral injuries (44.5 vs 32.8 days, <italic>P</italic> = .04).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The incidence of abdominal muscle strains in baseball has been increasing over the past 20 years, especially early in the season, and there is a relatively high reinjury rate. This upward trend is in spite of new and more advanced diagnostic procedures, preventive core strengthening exercise programs, and rehabilitation techniques. Injuries contralateral to the dominant arm or batting side are more common.</p>

<body>
<p>Abdominal oblique muscle strains, sometimes referred to as side strains, are well known in the training room but have received little attention in the medical literature. These injuries have been reported in baseball, cricket, tennis, golf, and javelin throwing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511433030">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511433030">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511433030">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511433030">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511433030">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511433030">25</xref></sup> among other sports, but their overall incidence is unknown. The injuries are characterized by a sudden, sharp onset of side pain near or on the rib cage with localized tenderness and often occur after a throwing, swinging, or twisting movement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511433030">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511433030">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511433030">25</xref></sup> Abdominal muscle strains have recently received increased attention in professional baseball, and the aim of this study is to characterize these injuries and report on their incidence in baseball over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>Trunk rotation plays a critical role in generating power in sports such as baseball, tennis, golf, cricket, and Olympic throwing events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511433030">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511433030">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511433030">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511433030">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511433030">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511433030">26</xref></sup> It is through the trunk, or core, that forces are transferred from the lower extremities to the shoulder and arms. Activities such as throwing and swinging are unique because they place a dual demand on the core muscles—trunk stabilization and the creation of side-specific axial torque.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511433030">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511433030">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Core stabilization training has recently become popular in many sports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511433030">10</xref></sup> The core can be defined as the thoracolumbar, abdominal, pelvic, and hip musculature, which provide trunk stability for integrated limb movements (such as throwing and swinging). The abdominal core muscles include the rectus abdominis, transversus abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique muscles. The focus of this article is on these abdominal core muscles as a distinct type of side strain injury specific to pitching and hitting, which is also seen in other sports with a rotational component such as golf, tennis, and cricket.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511433030">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511433030">12</xref></sup> The rest of the core is functionally integrated with these abdominal muscles, and by focusing on this specific injury pattern, it is not meant to negate the importance of the other core muscles, in which an imbalance may actually contribute to an abdominal muscle injury.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The Major League Baseball disabled list (DL), which is publicly available, was reviewed retrospectively from 1991 to 2010. The DL functions as a roster management tool rather than being a true injury database, but it is verified by a team physician and contains consistent, reliable injury information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511433030">6</xref></sup> There has not been a change in rules in placing a player on the DL since 1991, and the minimum amount of time a player must stay on the DL is 15 days, so some minor injuries may not be recorded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511433030">6</xref></sup> Also of note, from 1991 to 1992, there were only 26 teams in the league; from 1993 to 1997, there were 28 teams; and from 1998 onward, there have been 30 teams. It was necessary to make calculations to normalize the data because there were fewer players playing before 1997. There are different methods of making this adjustment. In this study, the data were normalized to the total number of major league players on the active roster each year. This not only accounts for the number of teams per year but includes only the players who were used on the roster during a particular year.</p>
<p>When reviewing the DL to identify abdominal muscle strains, it was found that the terminology sometimes varied to describe the same injury. The intention of the study was to include all abdominal muscle strain injuries, which would most often involve the internal and external obliques and occasionally the intercostal muscles or rectus abdominis, so the following terms were searched:</p>
<list id="list1-0363546511433030" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>oblique (internal or external) strain</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>abdominal muscle strain</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>rib cage/rib muscle strain</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>intercostal muscle strain</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>rectus abdominis strain</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Care was taken to exclude injuries such as rib stress fractures, rib fractures, contusions, latissimus dorsi and pectoralis strains, hamstring and groin strains, and athletic pubalgia (also sometimes called sports hernia, although it is not a true hernia). Rectus abdominis strains were included because of their side-specific involvement in pitching, although there were only 4 injuries specifically listed as rectus abdominis strains. Other data recorded include player age, position (pitcher or position player), dominant arm, batting side (right, left, switch), side of injury, and days missed due to injury.</p>
<p>In regard to laterality of injury, the side of injury was indicated on the DL in 84% of players. This included 146 pitchers and 184 position players. Of the position players, 29 were switch hitters, and 32 batted opposite the side of their dominant arm (31 of 32 batted left and threw right). Injuries in these players were categorized as contralateral or ipsilateral to the dominant batting side or arm. Electromyographic studies on abdominal muscles often use the opposite nomenclature because the side of the muscle is described in relation to direction of rotation, but for a baseball study, it is more straightforward to use dominant arm or dominant batting side as a reference point. In pitchers, a contralateral injury was defined as being opposite the dominant arm or on the lead side of the body that is facing the plate during the windup. In position players, a contralateral injury was defined as being opposite the dominant batting side or on the lead side of the body that is facing the pitcher. Batting side rather than dominant arm was chosen for position players because based on the authors’ experience, the most common mechanism of injury in position players is from swinging, and that swinging will be the last movement to fully recover from injury, and thus is the limiting factor in getting off the DL. Switch hitters were analyzed separately. Statistical analysis included using an unpaired <italic>t</italic> test for comparing DL days based on player position and injury side, using Fisher exact test to compare side-specific injury rates, and using linear regression analysis and reporting <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values to evaluate injury trends over time.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511433030">Figure 1</xref>, an upward trend can be seen in abdominal muscle strains from 1991 to 2010 (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.3376). The lowest injury rate was in 1993 at 0.011 per player (12 injuries out of 1104 players), and the highest rate was in 2007 with 0.023 per player (29 injuries out of 1278 players). The overall injury rate in the 2000s is 22% higher than in the 1990s. Although there have been more injuries in the past decade than in the 1990s, the injury rate has remained relatively steady since 2003 (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.0013), as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511433030">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>The highest percentage of injuries (28.8%) occurred at the beginning of the baseball season in late March and April, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546511433030">Figure 3</xref>. This number includes some injuries sustained toward the end of March in spring training, which slightly elevates this number compared with that of other months. An accurate calculation of statistical significance comparing this number with that of other months is not possible because of the absence of accurate injury data in early March. The number of March/April injuries has trended upward since 1991, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546511433030">Figure 4</xref> (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.4272). The low number of reported September injuries is due to the way the DL is used as a roster management tool. In September, the active roster expands from 25 to 40 players, so teams seldom need to place a player on the DL to make room for another player. This could lead to a slight underestimate of the true incidence of abdominal muscle strains, or any September injuries for that matter.</p>

<p>Out of the 346 players included in this study, 42 sustained repeat abdominal muscle strains, for a reinjury rate of 12.1%. Fourteen of these players were pitchers, and 28 were position players. Of the players with reinjuries, 23 out of 42 (54.8%) sustained them during the same season or in the next season.</p>
<p>In pitchers, 78.1% of injuries were contralateral to their dominant arm. In position players, 70.3% of injuries were contralateral to their dominant batting side. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0363546511433030">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0363546511433030">Figure 8</xref> show an internal oblique strain and an external oblique strain, respectively. In analysis of switch hitters, a dominant batting side could not be chosen, so injuries were analyzed in relation to the dominant throwing arm. The injuries were split evenly, with 52% of injuries contralateral to their dominant throwing arm (<italic>P</italic> = .03 compared with nonswitch hitters). In the 32 players who batted opposite their dominant arm, 68.8% of injuries were contralateral to their dominant batting side, which is the same rate as that of the other position players (<italic>P</italic> = .84). These data indicate that batting side rather than dominant arm is a more important factor in determining laterality of injury in position players.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first article evaluating the increasing incidence of abdominal core muscle strains in Major League Baseball. The hypothesis that the injury incidence is increasing is supported by the data, and it appears that a significant portion of this overall increase is due to the much higher rate of increase in early-season injuries. The hypothesis that lead-side injuries, or those contralateral to the dominant arm or batting side, are more common is strongly supported by the data, although the prediction that contralateral injuries would be more disabling was only true for position players. The relatively high reinjury rate (12.1%) highlights the need for proper treatment and prevention of these injuries. Reinjury may occur due to lack of complete healing or may be due to failure to appropriately modify training techniques, preparation, or a player’s form, and this is an issue that needs further investigation.</p>
<p>Identification of the exact muscle injured has become more common over the past several years, with the routine use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound to diagnose these injuries in professional athletes. Whereas in the past the injury may have been listed on the DL as a rib cage strain or abdominal strain, now it is becoming more common to identify the muscle injured as internal oblique, external oblique, or intercostal muscle based on MRI findings.</p>
<p>Understanding the anatomic location and function of the abdominal muscles is helpful for thorough evaluation of these injuries. The external and internal oblique muscles are oriented in an oblique fashion, perpendicular to each other. They are responsible for flexion and rotation of the trunk, as well as providing trunk stabilization during complex movements. The external oblique muscle is the more superficial of the 2, arising from the lower 8 ribs near the insertion of the serratus anterior muscle laterally. Its fibers travel anteriorly and inferiorly, inserting into the iliac crest and linea alba. Its direct actions are trunk flexion and bending and opposite-side trunk rotation. The internal oblique muscle lies deep to the external oblique, arising from the inguinal ligament, iliac crest, and thoracolumbar fascia. Its fibers pass superiorly and anteriorly to insert into the costal cartilages of the 9th through 12th ribs and the linea alba. Its direct actions are trunk flexion and bending and same-side rotation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511433030">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511433030">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511433030">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511433030">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511433030">18</xref></sup> The intercostal muscles are active in trunk stabilization and show side-specific activation during trunk rotation in EMG analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511433030">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511433030">27</xref></sup>; although technically considered thoracic muscles, they are included in the grouping of side-strain injuries because of their continuity with the internal oblique muscles and similar injury presentation, treatment, and recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511433030">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511433030">21</xref></sup> They include the external, internal, and innermost intercostal muscles but here are referred to as a group as intercostal muscles for simplicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511433030">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nomenclature of this injury is still confusing, as the terms <italic>side strain, oblique strain</italic>, and <italic>rib cage strain</italic> can all refer to the same injury. Care must be taken using the term <italic>rectus abdominis strain</italic> because it may have a different mechanism of injury than does a classic side strain. Rectus abdominis strains have been described in tennis players,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511433030">4</xref></sup> and an inferior rectus abdominis avulsion has been reported in baseball,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511433030">16</xref></sup> although this may be due to a different mechanism than that of an oblique or intercostal muscle strain. The rectus abdominis also can be involved at its inferior attachment in athletic pubalgia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511433030">15</xref></sup> although this often presents as a chronic injury that is different from the acute oblique strain.</p>
<p>In regard to laterality of the injury, it appears that the contralateral or leading side in both batters and pitchers is more susceptible to injury. Electromyographic studies of abdominal muscles have shown that the leading-side internal oblique and trailing-side external oblique have the highest activity with maximal-exertion axial twisting,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511433030">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511433030">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511433030">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511433030">18</xref></sup> which is consistent with muscle fiber alignment; essentially, the internal oblique muscle is more active as a same-side rotator, and the external oblique muscle is more active as an opposite-side rotator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511433030">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511433030">17</xref></sup> The respective opposite-side oblique muscles also registered significant EMG activity, indicating that they also have a stabilizing role during trunk rotation. In a medicine ball testing model, higher EMG activity in the external oblique muscles was correlated with a more forceful throw, supporting the concept that oblique muscles play a role in generating rotational power.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511433030">9</xref></sup> The reason that batters appear to sustain more ipsilateral injuries than do pitchers may be because the external oblique muscle is more active in swinging than in pitching,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511433030">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511433030">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511433030">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511433030">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511433030">26</xref></sup> and because it acts as an opposite-side rotator, the trailing or ipsilateral external oblique would likely be most active when swinging. It is perhaps not as widely recognized that the intercostal muscles are also active in both trunk stabilization and trunk rotation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511433030">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511433030">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regarding baseball-specific activities, the role of abdominal muscles in trunk rotation is borne out well in 2 EMG studies of hitting and pitching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511433030">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511433030">26</xref></sup> In pitching,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511433030">26</xref></sup> side-specific activation of the oblique and rectus abdominis muscles is seen throughout all phases of a pitch, with the muscles on the lead side, contralateral to the dominant arm, showing greater activation than the ipsilateral, or trailing-side, muscles. The greatest side-to-side increase in activation of any muscle group was seen in the oblique muscles during the cocking phase, with a mean 98% increase in the lead side over the trailing side. Some subjects showed 300% to 500% increases in lead oblique activation over the trailing side. This study did not attempt to measure the internal and external oblique muscles separately, and the surface electrode placement may have allowed detection of both muscles on each side. Nevertheless, lead oblique muscles registered significantly more activity during pitching.</p>
<p>In EMG analysis of batters,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511433030">24</xref></sup> both the leading and trailing abdominal obliques demonstrated maximal activity throughout the swing, suggesting that they have an important role in trunk stabilization during batting but bring into question how much side-specific involvement they have in trunk rotation. One explanation for the lack of recorded side-to-side difference is, as in the study on pitching, that the electrodes were measuring contributions from both the internal and external oblique muscles. Previously mentioned EMG studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511433030">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511433030">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511433030">18</xref></sup> show that there is concomitant activation of the leading internal oblique and trailing external oblique muscles during side-specific trunk rotation, and measurement of activity from both of these muscles could mask any differences in side-specific activity. In any case, maximal activation of the oblique muscles indicates that they play a significant role in swinging, along with the other trunk muscles.</p>
<p>This follows the findings in the EMG studies discussed earlier. The mechanism of injury was not listed on the DL, so it cannot be assumed that all of these injuries occurred while pitching or swinging. Players have ample opportunities to sustain oblique or intercostal muscle strains while fielding, especially in cases in which there is the need to throw cross-body. However, in the analysis of switch hitters, there was no correlation with dominant arm and injury side, with just 52% of injuries occurring contralateral to the dominant arm. Also, in players who throw right but bat left, one may expect to see a higher rate of left-sided injuries based on the idea that some of these injuries in batters may be throwing related, but that was not the case. These players sustained injuries contralateral to their batting side at approximately the same rate (68.8%) as did other players (70.3%). If the less common ipsilateral (trailing) injuries actually are occurring during swinging, there is a physiological basis for this explanation. Based on EMG studies discussed previously, the leading internal oblique (same-side rotator), along with the trailing external oblique (opposite-side rotator), would be expected to contract maximally when swinging. It could be that most contralateral injuries in batters are to the internal oblique muscle, whereas most ipsilateral injuries are to the external oblique muscle. Magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound diagnosis indicating which muscle is injured will help answer this question in the future.</p>
<p>In pitchers, it was found that injuries ipsilateral to the dominant arm take longer to recover from than contralateral injuries. One possible explanation is that there is actually a different injury process that occurs on the ipsilateral side. The ipsilateral injuries may occur more laterally at the attachments of the external oblique and serratus anterior muscles on the rib cage, presenting as a muscle injury, when there is actually an underlying stress reaction or stress fracture in the rib. This ipsilateral injury process has been described in 2 professional baseball pitchers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511433030">19</xref></sup> and can take substantially longer to heal than does a muscle strain. Even without a rib stress reaction or stress fracture in ipsilateral injuries, there may be other aspects of the injury that contribute to longer recovery time.</p>
<p>In position players, recovery was found to be longer for contralateral injuries. One explanation for this is that when swinging, the contralateral or leading oblique muscles contract more intensely; complete healing is necessary before being able to hit at an elite level, thus requiring more time on the DL, whereas ipsilateral, trailing-side injuries are better tolerated. Another explanation is that, as with pitchers, it is a different injury pattern that has not yet been recognized. It could be that most contralateral injuries in batters are to the internal oblique muscle and take slightly longer to heal than do ipsilateral injuries, which may be more likely to involve the external oblique muscle, as discussed above.</p>
<p>Another injury that has not been mentioned but may have the same presentation as that of abdominal muscle strains is a rib tip injury. This has been called slipping rib syndrome, rib tip syndrome, painful rib syndrome, clicking rib, and other names, and the origin of this condition is not thoroughly understood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511433030">7</xref></sup> When it occurs with a traumatic onset, there is pain at the costal cartilage at the rib tip near the attachment of the internal oblique muscle. The injury often has similar symptoms to those of an internal oblique strain, although a hallmark of diagnosis is tenderness to palpation right on the costal margin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511433030">13</xref></sup> Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography can help differentiate between muscle strains and costal cartilage fracture. Excision of the rib tip is sometimes done in refractory cases.</p>
<p>Treatment for abdominal muscle strains includes activity modification, ice, analgesia, and gradual increase in activity. Reported recovery time was 1 to 70 days in 10 cricket bowlers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511433030">8</xref></sup> and 27 to 33 days in 3 professional baseball pitchers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511433030">25</xref></sup> although some of these athletes received corticosteroid injections at the injury site. In professional baseball players, for whom minimizing time spent on the DL is important, a protocol of MRI for diagnosis then ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection has been used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511433030">25</xref></sup> In these pitchers, recovery time was acceptable, and there were no recurrences after 1 year of follow-up. It is important to remember that although abdominal muscle strains have received increased attention lately, they only account for 5% of all injuries that result in placement on the DL.</p>
<p>No obvious cause for the increased rate in abdominal muscle strains, especially early in the season, has been found. Possible reasons for the injury spike early in the season include relative deconditioning of athletes, a sharp increase in intensity of activity, overtraining, and dehydration. There is the possibility that these injuries are better diagnosed now compared with the 1990s, causing only a perceived rise in injury rate. It is likely true that diagnostic accuracy has improved (in terms of defining the exact muscle injured) with the use of MRI and ultrasound, but it is not likely that these injuries as a group were missed more often in the 1990s because they are debilitating and have a lengthy recovery, which would result in DL placement. What is more likely is that the terminology of these injuries is changing, although this was taken into account when analyzing the data, as explained in the “Materials and Methods” section.</p>
<p>The idea that the rise in injuries is related to the increased focus on core strengthening over the past several years is somewhat countered by the fact that the overall injury rate has remained relatively stable from 2003 to 2010, which is a time period during which core strengthening has become more popular. There is significant variability in the core strengthening programs used by each team, and by each player in the off-season, and discussion of these differences is outside the scope of this article. In theory, core strengthening should prevent abdominal muscle strains by reducing muscle imbalances in the trunk, although care must be taken to maintain core flexibility and not overtrain certain muscle groups in relation to others. The idea that hip impingement could be related to core injuries is plausible because decreased hip range of motion could lead to overcompensation and injury to other muscles, although this would not explain an increase in injury rate. More research is needed in this area.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the rate of abdominal muscle injuries appears to have increased in professional baseball, and the reinjury rate of 12.1% is relatively high, indicating a need for improved treatment. There is no clear reason for the overall increase, although the sharper increase in early-season injuries suggests that the off-season and early-season training regimens play an important role. This study also improves our understanding of injury laterality and position-specific injury rates and recovery times, providing useful information for team physicians and trainers. Because of the sequential integration of the trunk muscles during pitching and hitting, an abdominal core muscle strain should not always be viewed as an isolated event but instead as a potential indicator of improper form or muscle imbalance, which may require refocusing on pitching or hitting technique in addition to medical treatment.</p>
