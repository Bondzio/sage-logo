<abstract>
<p>Somatosensory-evoked spikes (ESp) are high-voltage potentials registered on the EEG, which accompany each of the percussions on the feet or hands. The objective of this research was to study the longitudinal clinical and EEG aspects of children with ESp. A total of 313 children, 53.7% male, showing ESp on the EEG and with an average initial age of 6.82 (range from 2 to 14 years) were followed for a mean period of 35.7 months. In the initial evaluation, 118 (37.7%) had a history of nonfebrile epileptic seizures (ES). Epileptiform activity (EA) was observed on the EEG in 61% and showed a significantly greater occurrence in children with ES than in those without (<italic>P</italic> = .000). Of the 118 showing seizures from the start, 53 (44.9%) continued to have seizures; of the 195 without seizures at the start, only 13 (6.67%) developed them. Thus, only 66 (21.1%) children showed ES during the follow-up. ESp disappeared in 237 (75.7%) cases and EA in 221 (70.6%). In the children with ES, it was found that the presence of EA on the first EEG did not indicate continuation of the ES throughout the remaining period, while the 13 children who presented their first ES in a later period showed a greater occurrence of EA on the initial EEG than those who did not develop ES (<italic>P</italic> = .001). Evidence of brain injury was observed in 43 (13.7%) children and was associated with a greater continuity of the ES during the study (<italic>P</italic> = .018). ESp, EA, and ES tend to disappear, suggesting an age-dependent phenomenon. The finding of ESp, particularly in the absence of any evidence of brain injury, indicates a low association with ES and benign outcome.</p>

</sup>
</p>
<p>However, controversy still exists concerning the neurophysiological significance of ESp, of its characterization as a neurophysiological marker of epilepsy, and of its longitudinal outcome.</p>
<p>Longitudinal studies in children with ESp are rare, limited with respect to the number of cases assessed, the time of follow-up, and inclusion criteria.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1550059411429530">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059411429530">8</xref>
</sup> The criterion used in the largest longitudinal study was that of patients with spontaneous rolandic discharges accompanied or otherwise by Esp.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1550059411429530">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the present study the inclusion criterion was the occurrence of ESp on the EEG. The objective was to study the occurrence of ES in a longitudinal way, including its relationship with clinical aspects, epileptiform activity (EA) and ESp characteristics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1550059411429530">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The clinical and EEG aspects of children, who presented ESp on the EEG, were studied in a retrospective and longitudinal way. They were examined in the private clinic of the authors and in the EEG service of the Celso Pierro Hospital and Maternity Hospital, PUC-Campinas, Brazil.</p>
<p>The clinical aspects, and any data of personal antecedents indicating brain injury, were noted. In the children with nonfebrile epileptic seizures (ES), the age when the first seizure occurred was noted and the occurrence of ES during the period was studied. Neuroimaging examinations were carried out on about 30 children with ES.</p>
<p>The EEGs were obtained while awake, and, whenever possible, also when asleep. The presence of ESp as a result of percussion on the feet and hands was elicited with a technique identical to routine deep tendon reflex testing. Evoked spikes were high-voltage EEG potentials, which met the criteria for spikes in clinical EEG. The occurrence of EA on the EEG was also studied with respect to the type and localization, and also its evolution during the period of follow-up.</p>
<sec id="section3-1550059411429530">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The relationships between the occurrence of ES and the EEG findings in the initial evaluation were studied and also a comparison between the initial and final evaluations. The children were classified into 2 groups according to the clinical complaint: non-febrile ES and the group with “other complaints” of a nonepileptic nature, such as headaches, learning or behavioral disorders, mental deficiencies, cerebral palsy, sleeping disorders, and febrile crises, among others (other complaints group). Children showing evidence of brain damage in clinical assessment, or neuroimaging (available in a only a few cases), were satisfied. Statistical tests adequate for the various data distributions were carried out with a level of significance of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
<p>A total of 804 children showed ESp on the EEG. Only a single EEG was performed in 491, whereas the other 313 in the longitudinal study presented for more than 1 return examination. With the objective of identifying possible differences between the children who took part in the longitudinal study and those with only a single evaluation, the occurrence of EA and ESp on the EEG was compared between the 2 groups. The Ethics Commission for Research with Human Beings of PUC-Campinas approved the project.</p>

<sec id="section4-1550059411429530">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 313 children in the age range of 2 to 14 years was followed for a mean period of 35.7 (standard deviation [SD] = 30.7) months. In all, 146 children were assessed on 2 occasions, 70 on 3, 40 on 4, 25 on 5, 20 on 6, and 13 on 7 occasions. The mean initial age of the children was 6.82 years (ranging from 2 to 14) and there was a discrete, nonsignificant predominance of the male gender (53.7%).</p>

<title>Clinical-EEG Aspects in the Initial Assessment</title>
<p>In the comparison of the 491 children with a single assessment and the 313 children in the longitudinal study, it was shown that the latter had a greater proportion of ES (37.7% × 19.1%, respectively, chi-square, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), as also EA on the EEG (60.7% × 34.6%, respectively, chi-square, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) as compared to those with a single assessment.</p>
<p>Of the 313 children who took part in the longitudinal study, 118 (37.7%) had ES and in 195 children the EEG was performed for other reasons.</p>
<p>In the majority of cases (61.0%), EA was observed in the first EEG and in a greater proportion in the ES (77.1%) group than in the other complaints group (51.2%; χ<sup>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The objective of this retrospective study of ESp on the EEG, was to determine the evolution of ES and its relationship with clinical aspects and EA. Clinical EEG data of the 491 children who only had a single assessment were compared with the 313 who were followed; and it was noted that right from the start, the latter had a significantly higher proportion of ES (41.8%) and EA 60.7%) compared with 19.1% and 34.6%. Such a finding suggests the importance of follow-up. It is likely that the association of ESp and ES is underestimated compared with that observed in the present longitudinal study.</p>
<sec id="section8-1550059411429530">
<title>Longitudinal Study: Initial Assessment</title>
<p>The reasons for requesting the EEG were ES; but in the majority of the cases the reasons included nonepileptic manifestations such as behavioral disturbances, headaches, and other complaints, as already described in the literature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059411429530">5</xref>

</sup> In a significant way ES occurred preferentially in the children who presented both EA and ESp. It is known that ESp and EA are the result of greater cortical excitability, especially in the parietal areas, and that this would be responsible for the predisposition to ES. Elements suggesting brain injury occurred in a small proportion of the children (about 14%), in agreement with previous findings.<sup>

<title>Longitudinal Aspects</title>
<p>The starting point for this longitudinal study was the presence of ESp on the EEG, and the study consisted of a mean follow-up period of 35.7 months and represented the largest such study in the literature (313 children). The proportion of children who had seizures during the follow-up was small (about 22%), and even smaller (about 7%) if one considers the subgroup of children without evidence of brain injury (86%), evidence of the low association of ESp with epilepsy, indicating its benign, idiopathic nature. For the small subgroup of cases with evidence of brain injury, the occurrence of ES was greater, being 46.5%. There was no relationship between the use of AEDs and the prognosis of a continuation of the ES during follow-up.</p>
<p>During the follow-up the ESp and EA could as easily be present on the same EEG (about 11% of the cases) as only EA (18% of the cases) or only ESp (13%). Thus, the evolution described by De Marco and Tassarini,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059411429530">9</xref>
</sup> in which first the EA would disappear and then the ESp, was not found.</p>
<p>Normalization of the EEG occurred in the majority of cases and in a greater proportion in the children who did not show EA on the initial EEG. Similar longitudinal studies were not found in the literature for comparative purposes. The observed remission of the abnormalities on the EEG supports the hypothesis of their age-dependent nature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059411429530">9</xref>
</sup>

<p>Thirteen children, who experienced their first ES during the follow-up, showed a significantly greater occurrence of EA on the initial EEG, when compared with the children with other complaints. Thus, the risk of ES appears to be connected to the mechanisms of greater hyper-excitability with a spontaneous expression on the EEG, such as the EA, but not when only evoked by stimuli. In the present cases, it was not possible to characterize the phases described by De Marco<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059411429530">1</xref>
</sup> in which the ESp occurred first as an isolated finding on the EEG, followed by the appearance of EA and finally ES.</p>
<p>In summary, the ESp, EA, and ES tend to disappear, suggesting an age-dependent phenomenon. The association of ESp with ES is very low, especially in the absence of evidence of brain injury, as occurred in more than 80% of the cases. The occurrence of ES appears to be restricted to the concomitant presence of EA, denoting a cortical hyper-excitability phenomenon more ample than ESp. There was a greater occurrence of EA on the initial EEG in the children with ES, and this defined the occurrence of ES in the follow-up EEG in children with other clinical conditions. The evidence of brain injury was a factor for the occurrence of ES.</p>
<p>The findings of this study suggest a tendency for the EA and ESp to disappear in the great majority of the children. The routine search for ESp is a very simple procedure and appears to provide relevant clinical information.</p>
