<abstract>
<p>Honor is implicated in a variety of social psychological processes, including morality, male violence, sexuality and gender, in-group identification, responses to devaluation, and biculturalism. The papers in this Special Issue illustrate the importance of honor in these and other social-psychological processes. In addition, these papers expand and deepen our understanding of honor by presenting research on honor in a diverse array of groups (e.g., the military, law enforcement), relationship contexts (e.g., family relations, romantic relations) and countries (e.g., Afghanistan, Brazil, Canada, Estonia, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, Switzerland). Taken together, the contributions to this Special Issue show honor to be a multifaceted construct that is a core concern of individuals and groups across cultures.</p>

<p>Honor is often in the headlines. Remember the case of Private Bradley Manning. In May 2010, the private was arrested on suspicion of passing classified military and diplomatic documents to Wikileaks. Manning is alleged to have written “I want people to see the truth” to Adrian Lamo, the ex-hacker who turned him in. The private is currently facing 22 charges for violation of the military code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430212472590">Savage, 2012</xref>). For some, Manning is a traitor, a man who betrayed his compatriots and his nation. For others, Manning is the embodiment of honor, a hero who holds himself to a standard higher than the military court that is judging him: a standard of integrity and honesty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430212472590">Price, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Manning’s story illustrates the positive facet of honor as virtue. Honor, however, also has a less positive side. Remember the many women and girls who are killed in the name of honor. In a 2009 case that shocked Canadian society, the bodies of Zainab, 19, Sahar, 17, Geeti 13, and Rona, 53, were found inside a car that plunged into a canal in Kingston, Ontario. They were murdered because they behaved in ways that their family perceived as a stain on their collective honor. In January 2012, three family members—Mohammad Shafia, Tooba Mohammad Yahya, and Hamed Shafia—were convicted on four counts of first-degree murder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430212472590">Austen, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>As these stories illustrate, honor is multifaceted. Honor is about one’s integrity and honesty and honor is also about the reputation of one’s family or gender codes of behavior for men and women. This Special Issue offers a diverse array of research on the different facets of honor and their influence on a variety of social-psychological processes. The seven papers included also address honor from diverse theoretical and methodological perspectives, revealing honor to be a core concern of individuals and groups across cultures.</p>

<title>Previous Research on Honor</title>
<p>In social psychology, Cohen and colleagues pioneered research on honor with their studies on the nature and implications of masculine honor. Using a cross-regional approach to honor within the USA, this research compared White, non-Hispanic Northern and Southern males in their use of anger and aggression in response to insults to their honor (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430212472590">Cohen &amp; Nisbett, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430212472590">Cohen, Nisbett, Bowdle, &amp; Schwarz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430212472590">Cohen, Vandello, &amp; Rantilla, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368430212472590">Leung &amp; Cohen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430212472590">Vandello, Cohen, &amp; Ransom, 2008</xref>). These studies on the U.S. Southern culture of honor motivated other social and cultural psychologists to study honor in other cultures and contexts. For example, Ijzerman and colleagues studied the embodiment of honor as well as men’s reactions to insults in Dutch culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368430212472590">Ijzerman &amp; Cohen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430212472590">Ijzerman, van Dijk, &amp; Galluci, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212472590">Uskul, Cross, and colleagues compared honor in Turkish and European-American culture (Uskul, Cross, Sunbay, Gercek-Swing, &amp; Ataca, 2011</xref>), while Barnes, Brown and colleagues have examined the implications of honor for risk-taking, school violence, and violence against the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430212472590">Barnes, Brown, &amp; Tamborski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430212472590">Brown, Osterman, &amp; Barnes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368430212472590">Osterman &amp; Brown, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, Rodriguez Mosquera and colleagues have examined how honor influences emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368430212472590">Fischer, Manstead, &amp; Rodriguez Mosquera, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430212472590">Rodriguez Mosquera, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430212472590">Rodriguez Mosquera, Fischer, &amp; Manstead, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430212472590">Rodriguez Mosquera, Fischer, Manstead, &amp; Zaalberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368430212472590">Rodriguez Mosquera, Liskow, &amp; DiBona, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430212472590">Rodriguez Mosquera, Manstead, &amp; Fischer, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430212472590">2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430212472590">2002b</xref>). The papers included in this Special Issue add to previous research by presenting work on honor in a wide range of countries (e.g., Afghanistan, Estonia, Finland, Macedonia, Israel, Russia, United Kingdom), relationship contexts (e.g., romantic relationships, family relations), and groups (e.g., law enforcement, the military).</p>

<title>Honor Across Cultures</title>
<p>The first two papers of this Special Issue present the largest cross-national studies on honor to date. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368430212472590">Helkama et al.’s (2013)</xref> study is the first to systematically examine cross-cultural variations in the meaning of honor. This paper presents a cross-national study on honor among adolescents in Estonia, Finland, Italy, Russia, and Switzerland. The researchers assessed the meaning of honor by examining honor’s associations with Schwartz’ values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430212472590">Schwartz, 2004</xref>), an approach that allowed Helkama et al. to identify distinctive cultural clusters of honor meaning. In Estonia and Finland, honor is predominantly associated with power-related (social prestige, wealth) and achievement values. The self-enhancement connotations of honor in these countries contrast with the collectivistic connotations of honor in Russia and Italy, where honor is positively associated with tradition, conformity, and security values (e.g., humility, family security, honoring parents and elders). Furthermore, honor in Russia also carries moral connotations through its association with benevolence (e.g., being honest, helpful). A third cultural cluster emerged for Switzerland, where honor is both a self-enhancement and a moral value.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368430212472590">Helkama et al. (2013)</xref> also present data on contextual variations in the meaning and importance of honor across a diverse set of Finnish samples (e.g., military cadets, Red Cross volunteers, secondary school students). Interestingly, honor showed the same associations with the Schwartz values across all samples, indicating a high degree of cultural consensus in the meaning of honor. In terms of importance, however, honor carried the greatest significance for military cadets followed by reserve office conscripts. This approach of distinguishing <italic>meaning</italic> from <italic>importance</italic> is vital for the cross-cultural study of values. As Helkama et al.s’ research reveals, equal meaning does not imply equal importance.</p>
<p>In another large-scale, cross-national study presented in the paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430212472590">Guerra, Giner-Sorolla, and Vasiljevic (2013)</xref>, honor is examined in a different set of countries than those investigated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368430212472590">Helkama et al. (2013)</xref>. Guerra et al.’s research explores the importance of different facets of honor, or different honor-related concerns, in Brazil, Israel, Japan, Macedonia, New Zealand, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States. Participants from all countries completed the honor scale, measuring the importance of honor as virtue (i.e., moral integrity), family honor, feminine honor, and masculine honor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430212472590">Rodriguez Mosquera et al., 2002b</xref>). Guerra et al.’s results are revealing. Participants in all countries recognized moral integrity, family honor, feminine honor, and masculine honor as distinct facets of honor. Thus, in all eight countries, honor was perceived to be multifaceted. Furthermore, <italic>honor as virtue</italic> (moral integrity) emerged as the most valued facet of honor across cultures, regardless of the collectivistic or individualistic leanings of the culture. In other words, honor as virtue was valued in collectivistic countries like Brazil as much as it was valued in individualistic, or dignity cultures, like the United Kingdom or the United States.</p>
<p>Cross-cultural variations only emerged in the extent to which other facets of honor were valued as much as moral integrity within each country. For example, a concern with family honor was equally strong to a concern with honor as moral integrity in Israel, Macedonia, and Japan. In other countries however, family honor was rated as less important than moral integrity (e.g., United Kingdom). Furthermore, this study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430212472590">Guerra et al. (2013)</xref> also extends knowledge on the cross-national importance of gender-specific honor codes. In their study, gender differences across countries were most pronounced for feminine honor. Taken together, Guerra et al.’s study highlights the value of theorizing and measuring honor as a multifaceted, rather than as a unitary, construct.</p>

<title>Honor, Gender, and Cultural Change</title>
<p>The papers by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430212472590">Cihangir (2013)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368430212472590">van Osch, Breugelmans, Zeelenberg, and Bölük (2013)</xref>, explore the psychological and social implications of gender-specific honor codes. Cihangir presents a comparative study on gender and honor among ethnic majority and minority youth in the Netherlands (Dutch, Turkish-Dutch, and Moroccan-Dutch secondary school students). This novel study assessed women and men’s perspectives on the importance of <italic>male and female sexual purity</italic> for honor. By including both perspectives, the study yielded new insights on the relationship between honor and gender. In particular, Moroccan-Dutch and Turkish-Dutch female participants rated <italic>male relatives</italic>’ sexual purity as more important for their honor, whereas their male counterparts rated the importance of <italic>female relatives</italic>’ sexual purity as more important for their honor. These results are significant as they show male and female youth from honor-oriented cultural communities to have diverging attitudes toward the role of male and female sexuality in honor, with women being less compliant with cultural codes that view their sexuality as an index of male relatives’ honor. Furthermore, male participants from all three cultural communities viewed their honor as determined by their parents, close relatives, friends, and peers to a greater extent than did female participants. Thus, male participants perceived their honor to be <italic>more interdependent with close others regardless of their cultural background</italic>.</p>
<p>Cihangir’s study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430212472590">2013</xref>) is also the first to assess cultural change in the importance of gender-specific honor codes. His study was embedded in an educational program aimed at changing harmful attitudes that promote honor-related violence. Thus, the same measures were taken before and after the educational program. The results demonstrated that cultural change in honor-related attitudes and beliefs is possible. For example, feelings of responsibility for female relatives’ sexual purity <italic>decreased</italic> after the educational program for Turkish-Dutch male youth. These results are important because previous research has shown Turkish-Dutch male youth to be especially vulnerable to commit honor-related violence (e.g., honor killing) out of feelings of responsibility for female relatives’ sexual purity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1368430212472590">van Eck, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368430212472590">van Osch et al. (2013)</xref> explores the nature and implications of masculine honor in Turkish culture. In particular, this paper examines the cross-cultural specificity of the defense of male honor–aggression link in response to insults, an association commonly found in the Southern culture of honor of the USA (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430212472590">Cohen et al., 1996</xref>). Their goal is not to critique previous research, but rather to examine whether concerns other than masculine honor explain men’s aggressive responses to insults. In Study 1, van Osch et al. compared Turkish-Dutch and Dutch adolescents in their reported motivation to hit, swear at, or punish an offender after an insult. The novelty of this study lies in its focus on the role of biculturalism in honor. Study 2 addressed the role of masculine honor and family honor in wanting to aggress (i.e., hit a man who delivered the insult) in response to an insult among three groups of male adults (community samples): Dutch, Turkish-Dutch, and Turkish. Turkish participants reported that they valued family honor, and that they would want to hit the offender, more than Dutch participants did, with the Turkish-Dutch scoring in between the two groups. Masculine and family honor were measured with Rodriguez Mosquera et al.’s honor scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430212472590">2002b</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, there were no cultural differences in how much male participants valued masculine honor. Moreover, masculine honor predicted aggression for all three cultural groups, whereas family honor explained the cultural differences found. The more the Turkish participants were concerned with family honor; the more they wanted to hit the offender. Taken together, the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368430212472590">van Osch et al. (2013)</xref> suggest that the defense of masculine honor may be an equally important motivator for violence in cultures high and low in honor orientation. The role of family honor in motivating aggression among men, however, shows greater cultural variation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430212472590">Cross, Uskul, Gerçek-Swing, Alözkan, and Ataca’s (2013)</xref> paper also focuses on Turkish culture, but addresses a different question with regards to honor. Turkish and Northern American male and female university students evaluated scenarios that manipulated the type of honor threat and response to the threat. The scenarios described either rude behavior (e.g., “someone calls you a name”) or a false accusation (e.g., “someone accuses you of lying”). Furthermore, the target of the honor threat (a male) was described in the scenarios as either confronting the offender (expressing disapproval) or withdrawing from the situation. Cross et al. included a variety of measures in their study, including cognitive evaluations of the scenario and behavioral tendencies to respond similar to the target. Interestingly, Turkish participants showed higher levels of approval for <italic>confrontation</italic> when the target person was <italic>falsely accused</italic> compared to when the target person was treated rudely. In contrast, Turkish participants showed higher levels of approval for withdrawal when the target person was treated rudely compared to when the target person was being falsely accused. Although European Americans showed a similar pattern of results, the difference between scenarios in endorsement of withdrawal versus confrontation was stronger among the Turkish participants.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430212472590">Cross et al.’s (2013)</xref> findings remind us of the relevance of situational factors in responses to honor threats. Cultural differences in responses may be strengthened in response to certain types of threats. In Cross et al.’s study, Turkish participants believed confrontation to be an appropriate response to being falsely accused, a finding that suggests a greater sensitivity to situations that impugn one’s moral character. Thus, Cross et al.’s findings demonstrate the importance of honor as virtue in Turkish culture.</p>

<title>Honor and Men: On Violence and Virtue</title>
<p>The paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430212472590">Baldry, Pagliaro, and Porcaro (2013)</xref> provides a close examination of masculine honor’s role in intimate partner violence (IPV). In cultures where the protection of masculine honor is a core cultural value, IPV is justified in the name of protecting a husband’s honor. IPV is often triggered by the perception that a woman’s behavior violates the feminine honor code. By relating masculine honor to hostile and benevolent sexism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430212472590">Glick &amp; Fiske, 1996</xref>), Baldry et al. elucidate how the defense of male honor perpetuates the societal oppression of girls and women. Furthermore, the paper by Baldry et al. adds to previous literature on honor in two important ways. First, the study was carried out in a country that has not received much attention in the honor literature: Afghanistan. What’s more, the study of IPV, and its relation to honor, is especially important in this country as Afghan women and girls are often the targets of diverse forms of honor-related violence (e.g., honor killing, acidification; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430212472590">UNIFEM, 2006</xref>). Second, Baldry et al. present an experimental study conducted on police officers, an understudied group in the honor literature.</p>
<p>Participants (99 males out of 108 police officers) were presented with a <italic>real</italic> case of IPV, with the threat to masculine honor manipulated between-subjects. In the threat to masculine honor condition, the IPV victim admitted having an extramarital relationship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430212472590">Baldry et al. (2013)</xref> measured how much participants justified violence against women, and how much participants were willing to intervene on behalf of the victim (e.g., arrest the perpetrator). Although violence against women is currently punishable by law in Afghanistan, police officers reported more lenient attitudes toward IPV when the victim admitted an infidelity (threat to masculine honor condition). Moreover, police officers also reported being <italic>less</italic> wiling to help the victim of IPV in the threat to masculine honor condition. Baldry et al.’s paper shows us what happens when the protection of masculine honor prevails over laws that protect the rights of women and girls to live a life without violence.</p>
<p>If <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430212472590">Baldry et al.’s (2013)</xref> study reveals the most negative side of masculine honor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430212472590">Mandel and Litt’s (2013)</xref> paper shows a more positive side of men’s relationship with honor. In particular, Mandel and Litt present a study on the implications of honor as virtue in the military. In a large sample of mostly male Canadian Forces members, Mandel and Litt examined the role of the perceived honor of peers in participants’ willingness to sacrifice their life in military operations. The participants rated their peers’ honor in terms of acting with moral integrity (e.g., do not tolerate dishonesty, treat others with dignity). Importantly, participants evaluated peers at their same rank, and at ranks above and below their own.</p>
<p>The results are intriguing. Participants’ evaluations of their peers’ honor predicted the extent to which they were willing to risk their lives while performing a variety of military duties, from defending their country to aiding in humanitarian operations around the world. Moreover, the relationship between perceived peers’ honor and willingness to sacrifice one’s life was explained by affective commitment to the military as well as a sense of personal duty. Thus, the more the participants evaluated their peers as honorable, the more intense their feelings of belonging to the military and their commitment to serve their society. This greater sense of belonging and duty predicted, in turn, a greater willingness to sacrifice one’s life. These results are significant as they show honor to be a motivational force in in-group relations. Indeed, Mandel and Litt’s findings demonstrate that the perception that in-group members are honorable increases individuals’ attachment to the in-group as well as their motivation to act with integrity. For the participants in Mandel and Litt’s study, the honor of in-group members acted as a moral compass.</p>

<title>The Future of Honor</title>
<p>The contributions to this Special Issue expand and deepen our understanding of honor by presenting research on honor in a variety of groups (e.g., the military, law enforcement), relationship contexts (e.g., family, romantic) and countries (e.g., Afghanistan, Brazil, Canada, Estonia, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, Switzerland). This research also shows honor to be implicated in a variety of topics central to social psychology, including morality, male violence, sexuality and gender, in-group identification, responses to devaluation, and biculturalism. In addition, the contributions to this Special Issue reveal the importance of conceptualizing and examining honor as a multifaceted construct. Honor is not just about masculine toughness or family reputation; honor is also about moral integrity and feminine sexuality.</p>
<p>The Special Issue also identifies important avenues for future research. The way in which women view, and are affected by, honor is an especially important area for future studies. To date, men’s relationship to honor has received more research attention than women’s relationship to honor. The paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430212472590">Cihangir (2013)</xref> suggests that women may challenge notions of honor that subordinate their sexuality to concerns for the honor of their male relatives and their family. This can have consequences. In cultures that value feminine honor highly, challenging cultural beliefs may have detrimental consequences to women’s social and familial position. For example, women who choose to protest may be punished through ostracism, exclusion, or other forms of social aggression. Given these potential negative implications, what are the avenues women in these cultures have for collective action and how and when are they pursued? How can women change their families’ and cultures’ beliefs in ways that more closely reflect their own understandings of honor? Future research on women’s relationship to honor can do a great deal to explore the gendered nature of honor in addition to addressing other important social psychological questions regarding their collective action and the possibilities of social change.</p>
<p>To date, research on honor killings (also called honor crimes) has mostly been conducted from an anthropological perspective (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1368430212472590">van Eck, 2003</xref>). However, social and cultural psychology have much to contribute to an understanding of the cultural and group dynamics surrounding honor killings. For example, what are the cultural values and beliefs that sustain the practice of honor killings? As shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430212472590">Lindisfarne (1998)</xref>, transgressions of the feminine honor code do not necessarily result in violence towards women. Thus, one may wonder which social conditions increase the likelihood of an honor killing? Since family honor is based on reputation, public exposure of a “transgression” of the feminine honor code can play an important role in explaining this type of violence. Social psychological work on reputation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430212472590">Rodriguez Mosquera, Uskul, &amp; Cross, 2011</xref>) could be used effectively here, as could work on the effects of audience on behavior. Furthermore, male relatives typically are the perpetrators of honor killings. Little is known, however, about the emotions and motivations that drive these men to take the life of a loved one. Do they feel ashamed or humiliated by female relatives’ behavior? Or do they fear social rejection if they fail to restore their family’s honor? The social psychology of rejection and of emotion and motivation can be integrated with the study of honor to enrich our understanding of these theoretically and practically important topics.</p>
<p>Interestingly, several papers in this Special Issue have shown honor as virtue to matter for individuals across cultures and contexts, with the paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430212472590">Mandel and Litt (2013)</xref> revealing its beneficial effects on one’s affective commitment to an in-group. Future research should examine the ways in which honor as virtue affects other aspects of in-group identification. Current approaches to in-group identification distinguish among different components of identification, like satisfaction, solidarity, or the extent to which a group member sees him or herself as similar to other group members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430212472590">Leach et al., 2008</xref>). The perception that in-group members are trustworthy and loyal should increase in-group solidarity and pride in one’s group. Another promising avenue for future research on honor is the related question of how honor as virtue affects behavior toward in-group members. Does the perception that in-group members are honorable increase prosocial behavior or cooperation, behaviors that may have a long-lasting positive effect on group cohesion and performance? Are transgressions of the honor code viewed as a threat to group solidarity, thereby encouraging social exclusion of the dishonorable “black sheep” of the family or other in-group?</p>
<p>Because honor is a potent social and cultural force, it affects how individuals think, feel, and behave in profound ways. As such, honor is a topic central to social psychology and its most important concepts and theories. As this Special Issue shows, honor operates across levels of analysis, involving individuals, families, communities, and whole societies in a dynamic interplay. Thus, a fuller future understanding of honor will likely require all of the theoretical and methodological tools offered by social and cultural psychology, employed in a flexible way across contexts. This is the future of honor research and also the future of psychology and the other sciences.</p>
