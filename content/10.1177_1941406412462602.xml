<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adult obesity rates in the United States are increasing rapidly with rates in many states having tripled since 1989.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412462602">1</xref></sup> Childhood obesity rates are following a similar trend, increasing from 6.5% in 1980 to 17% in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412462602">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412462602">2</xref></sup> Obesity is linked with several health-related consequences including cardiovascular disease, asthma, hepatic steatosis, sleep apnea, diabetes, and psychosocial risks such as early and systemic social discrimination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412462602">1</xref></sup> As a way to combat the widespread prevalence of obesity, many health-focused, obesity prevention programs have been implemented by public health organizations. However, one group often not included in these programs are those adults who had been treated for childhood cancer. Obesity rates for pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) survivors vary from 11% to 57%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412462602">3</xref></sup> Pediatric ALL survivors are children or adults who have been in remission for 5 years who were diagnosed before the age of 18 years. In these survivors, obesity exacerbates the known increased risks for developing type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, and secondary cancers later in life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412462602">3</xref></sup> Survivors of ALL often have low self-esteem and depression that may be negatively affected by increased body weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412462602">3</xref></sup> Although there is conflicting evidence, children with ALL who are obese at the time of diagnosis exhibited a higher probability of relapse than those who were of a healthy weight at diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412462602">3</xref></sup> Advancements in cancer treatment have resulted in a growing population of survivors, in whom, long-term consequences are now becoming apparent.</p>
<p>It is well documented in cancer patients that there are changes in metabolism that differ from healthy controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412462602">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412462602"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412462602"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412462602"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412462602">8</xref></sup> In the cancer-bearing host, there is an increase in lipid breakdown, increased protein turnover, and shifts in carbohydrate metabolism (ie., upregulation of Cori cycle related to lactate production from the tumors consumption of glucose), which results in higher levels of energy expenditure and often times results in weight loss, specifically from muscle wasting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412462602">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412462602"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412462602"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412462602">8</xref></sup> Changes in nutritional intake have also been observed with regard to cancer and cancer-related treatments. These changes are related to alterations in taste, mucositis, emesis, diarrhea, and anorexia that result from chemotherapy and radiation treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412462602">9</xref></sup> Although these changes in metabolism have been well documented in cancer patients, it is unknown whether these changes persist after successful completion of cancer treatment or to what extent. There are, however, many factors known to influence development of overweight and obesity in pediatric ALL survivors. Factors associated with increased weight gain include age at diagnosis, female sex, being overweight or obese at time of diagnosis of ALL, treatment with cranial radiation therapy, treatment with corticosteroids, and being of black or Hispanic race.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412462602">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412462602">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412462602">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412462602"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412462602"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412462602"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412462602"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412462602"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412462602">16</xref></sup> To date, no studies have evaluated the diet of pediatric ALL survivors in relationship to the development of obesity and for any possible differences from the general population. This information may be valuable in designing future dietary interventions to reduce obesity and its related complications in this group that is already at a greater risk secondary to their cancer treatment.</p>

<sec id="section3-1941406412462602">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>This retrospective study was an analysis of existing data that were collected for the Diminished Bone Mineral Density in Survivors of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL): A Severity-Adapted Clinical Trial (BONEII).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412462602">17</xref></sup> BONEII was approved by the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital Institutional Review Board. The inclusion criteria followed the same guidelines as the BONEII protocol: survivors of ALL who were at least 5 years from completion of therapy, were in first remission, and were treated on Total XI, XII, or XIII protocols.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412462602">17</xref></sup> In addition, for inclusion in the current study, participants must also have completed a 24-hour food recall obtained within the first 6 months from the start of the study; demographic and anthropometric data were recorded. The exclusion criteria included any participants enrolled on the BONEII protocol who did not have a 24-hour food recall obtained within the first 6 months of the study, or were missing demographic or anthropometric data. A total of 146 patients were eligible for medical chart review; 4 were excluded because of missing 24-hour recalls within the first 6 months of BONEII study enrollment. Thus, final analysis included 142 patients. Of the 142 participants eligible for the study, 91% were white, 7% black, 1% Asian, and 1% were of other race; 55% were male. Average age at diagnoses was 6.28 years with a range of 0.9 years to 17.44 years. There were 86 participants (61%) in the underweight/healthy weight category and 56 participants (39%) in the overweight/obese category. All data for all protocols were managed according to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. This study was deemed exempt by St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and The University of Memphis Institutional Review Boards.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1941406412462602">
<title>Participant Grouping</title>
<p>Participants were grouped by body mass index (BMI) into the underweight/normal weight group and the overweight/obese group for comparison. BMI was calculated from measured height and weight. For children younger than 20 years, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts and BMI percentiles were used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412462602">18</xref></sup> Children were considered to be underweight/normal weight if they fell below the 85th percentile in BMI for age and overweight/obese if they fell at or above the 85th percentile in BMI for age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941406412462602">19</xref></sup> For patients 20 years and older, BMI was used to assess weight status. Underweight/normal weight was defined as a BMI of less than 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and overweight/obesity was defined as 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and greater. BMI and growth chart data for the participants was calculated at the time of the 24-hour recall.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412462602">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941406412462602">19</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1941406412462602">
<title>Nutrient Analysis</title>
<p>Food records and macronutrient levels were evaluated to assess dietary intake. Twenty-four-hour food recall records collected during the first 6 months of the BONEII study were retrieved from the existing data entered in the Nutrition Data System for Research database. A qualified member of the research team, dietitian, or research licensed practical nurse, met with each study participant and entered the recall into the Nutrition Data System for Research program during an outpatient visit. Macronutrient intake was assessed by determining the quantity eaten, preparation, and detailed description of the food (ie, 8 ounces skim milk, 2 slices whole wheat bread, 3 ounces ground beef [90%/10% lean/fat ratio], etc). Macronutrient levels evaluated in this study included kilocalories (kcal), grams of fat, percentage kcal from fat, grams of carbohydrates, percentage kcal from carbohydrates, grams of sugar, grams of protein, and percentage kcal from protein.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1941406412462602">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>The data collected were examined for total calorie intake, total fat, carbohydrate, and protein intake, and percentage of calories from fat, carbohydrates, and protein. Demographic and treatment related variables were used to investigate association with weight categories. Descriptive data included: BMI at enrollment, age at diagnosis, ethnicity, race, gender, corticosteroid use, cranial radiation therapy, and standard/high risk. ALL group. Fisher’s exact test, exact χ<sup>2</sup> test, and exact Wilcoxon tests were applied to compare confounding factors and caloric/macronutrient intake across different obesity statuses (ie, underweight/normal weight vs overweight/obese). One-way analysis of variance tests were not used because of the fact that it requires normality and is highly sensitive to outliers. Exact nonparametric tests were used because our data were not normally distributed. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (V9.2, 2010, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412462602">20</xref></sup></p>

<title>Confounders Examined</title>
<p>Centigray (cGy) is a measurement of absorbed radiation dose of ionizing radiation and is given in cranial radiation therapy to some individuals with ALL. Higher doses are associated with increased severity of disease. Cranial radiation therapy may cause a growth hormone deficiency, which can influence the development of obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412462602">21</xref></sup> Only 35% of patients enrolled received cranial radiation therapy with the majority (67%) receiving 1800 cGy and 33% receiving 2400 cGy. In examination of risk categories, 15 of the 142 patients (11%) received therapy on a nonrisk-stratified protocol. Of the remaining 127 participants, 63% were classified as high risk and 37% were classified as standard risk. The median age of the overweight/obese category (3.5 years) was younger at diagnosis than that of the underweight/healthy weight group (4.8 years), though not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .4033). Steroid therapy is also known to cause increased appetite and weight gain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412462602">22</xref></sup> All participants received steroid therapy; however, steroid therapy differed depending on treatment protocol. Regardless, there was no statistically significant association between obesity and type of steroid therapy received.</p>

<sec id="section9-1941406412462602">
<title>Calorie and Macronutrient Intake</title>
<p>Underweight/normal weight participants were marginally more likely to obtain a higher percentage of calories from protein (<italic>P</italic> = .0301) and overweight/obese patients were more likely to consume more calories (<italic>P</italic> = .0215) and total carbohydrates (<italic>P</italic> = .0220). No statistically significant difference was found between groups in relation to percentage of calories from fat, carbohydrates, and sugar, or total intake of protein.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Research has shown that, in the United States, ALL is more common in whites than in blacks with the incidence of 75%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941406412462602">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1941406412462602">24</xref></sup> ALL is usually diagnosed in patients between the ages of 2 and 5 years and more often in males than in females.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941406412462602">25</xref></sup> Our cohort rendered similar results with median age at diagnosis of 4.3 years, and 55% of our sample consisting of males. Whites were more prevalent in our study (91%) than typically found in the ALL population because of patient availability.</p>
<p>In contrast to some published reports indicating their influence on BMI during ALL therapy, we found no association between BMI in this cohort and examined variables of gender, race, cranial radiation therapy, glucocorticoid therapy, and age at diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941406412462602">23</xref></sup> These results, inconsistent with those from other reports, may be attributed to the limited sample size of the study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412462602">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412462602"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412462602"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412462602">14</xref></sup> Though not reaching statistical significance, the median age at diagnosis for the underweight/healthy weight group was 4.8 years whereas the overweight/obese group was 3.5 years and was consistent with prior studies showing that the younger the age at diagnosis, the more likely a patient to be overweight/obese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412462602">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>We also compared caloric and macronutrient intake to BMI at BONEII enrollment. Participants who obtained a higher percentage of their calories from protein were more likely to be in the underweight/normal weight group (<italic>P</italic> = .0301) whereas the participants in the overweight/obese group consumed more calories (<italic>P</italic> = .0215) and total carbohydrates (<italic>P</italic> = .0220). No statistical difference was found between groups in relation to percentage of calories from fat, carbohydrates, and sugar, or total amount of protein. It is well established that the overconsumption of calories leads to weight gain through excess calories being stored as adipose tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1941406412462602">26</xref></sup> These results are consistent with our findings. Other studies have found that when compared with healthy subjects and survivors of other malignances, ALL survivors are less physically active.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1941406412462602">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1941406412462602">28</xref></sup> Exercise was not evaluated in this study since it was retrospective and data were not collected. Our findings suggest that dietary interventions should be more focused on consuming adequate protein and on controlling the amount of calories consumed by centering in on carbohydrate intake. Although there was no statistical significance with regards to sugar and BMI group, sugar intake does contribute to carbohydrate intake in the diet. It may be of value to monitor the amount of sugar in the diet by focusing on restricting sugary drinks and foods with added sugars especially around snack times in ALL survivors.</p>
<sec id="section11-1941406412462602">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Limitations include having a limited sample size and using 24-hour food recalls assessing dietary intake. The limited sample size may have been inadequately powered to assess confounders and/or dietary behaviors in comparison to BMI. Our study results may not accurately portray results across all races and ethnicities. The sample size used contained 91% whites while published data indicate that 75% of ALL cases occur in Whites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412462602">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412462602">22</xref></sup> Using 24-hour food recalls may not accurately represent an individual’s actual dietary intake since it estimates an individual’s diet based on recollection of foods consumed, preparation, quantity consumed, and is unable to determine how representative the report compared to that entered into the food analysis software. Underreporting is also an issue in completing food records.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1941406412462602">29</xref></sup> In addition, since participants in our study were seen as outpatients, many of them were traveling on the day that the 24-hour food recall was taken. Therefore, this record may not have been reflective of the participants’ usual dietary intake. Using food frequency questionnaires or 3-day food records may provide more accurate information of an individual’s dietary intake. BMI at onset of diagnosis was not examined as a confounder because of unavailable data.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, we found an association between BMI status at BONEII enrollment and calorie intake, total carbohydrate intake, and percentage of calories from protein. Specifically, those who consumed more calories and total carbohydrates were more likely to be overweight/obese and those who consumed a higher percentage of calories from protein were more likely to be underweight/normal weight. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data previously demonstrated that consumption of a higher percentage of energy from protein with a corresponding reduction in either the percentage of energy from fat or carbohydrates was strongly associated with reduced energy intake in both NHANES I and NHANES 2005-2006 across all BMI categories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1941406412462602">30</xref></sup> It has also been demonstrated that Americans have increased the percentage of energy from carbohydrates ranging from 44.0% to 48.7% of total calories since 1975, which occurred in association with the significant increase in energy intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1941406412462602">30</xref></sup> These factors support our findings. Additional research is warranted in larger patient cohorts using more refined methods of assessing body composition and dietary intake to develop effective interventions to improve the health of long-term survivors of childhood ALL. Survivors may benefit from dietary intervention after completion of therapy and should be provided with education on the benefits of consuming a healthy diet and its impact on quality of life, BMI status, and other comorbities.</p>
