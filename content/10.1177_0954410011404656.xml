<abstract>
<p>Aiming to realize a low-drag supersonic transport, Busemann biplane concept was adopted in this study. Two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) biplanes were analysed and designed to improve their aerodynamic performance using computational fluid dynamics. It was confirmed that 3D biplane wings have better aerodynamic-performance areas than 2D biplane airfoils. A winglet is also useful for improvement of their aerodynamic performance. Aerodynamic characteristics of these biplanes at their off-design conditions were also analysed. In 3D wings, a flow choking and its attendant hysteresis as starting problems, which arise when the biplanes accelerate from low Mach numbers, disappear at lower Mach numbers than those in 2D airfoils. It was confirmed that hinged slats and flaps are effective to settle these issues. Finally, interference effects of a body with the biplanes were investigated. When the biplane wings are affected by the expansion waves from the body, their aerodynamic performance at the design Mach number and the starting Mach number are better and lower than those of their isolated wings, respectively. A 3D biplane wing obtained by an inverse-design method was applied to the body. The wing of this wing–body configuration achieves higher aerodynamic performance than the 2D flat-plate airfoil at sufficient lift conditions, which is the almost identical performance of 2D biplane airfoils.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954410011404656"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>For the next generation of supersonic transport (SST), attaining low noise and high fuel efficiency are critical issues. A fundamental problem preventing commercial transport aircraft from supersonic flight is the creation of strong shock waves, whose effects are felt at the ground in the form of sonic booms. Because the strength of the shock waves generated by an aircraft flying at supersonic speed is a direct function of both the aircraft's weight and its occupying volume, it has been deemed nearly impossible to sufficiently reduce the shock waves generated by the heavier and larger conventional commercial aircraft to meet acceptable at-ground sonic-boom levels.</p>
<p>In 1935, Busemann [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011404656"><bold>1</bold></xref>] proposed a biplane configuration with the potential for satisfying low boom and low drag by utilizing favourable interactions between the two wing elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011404656"><bold>2</bold></xref>]. Wave drag due to airfoil thickness can be nearly eliminated by a biplane configuration that promotes favourable wave interactions between the two neighbouring airfoil elements (here, wave drag being defined as the resistant force on the airfoil due to the generation of shock waves). After the proposal of Busemann biplane, several studies of Busemann biplane have been conducted so far.</p>
<p>In 1936, Walcher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011404656"><bold>3</bold></xref><bold>]</bold> did a parametric study regarding the leading and trailing edge (LE and TE) angles of each upper and lower element of two biplanes, an original Busemann biplane and a staggered Busemann biplane. He concluded that the performance of drag reduction depends on the LE and TE geometries of each element. In 1944, Lighthill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410011404656"><bold>4</bold></xref>] discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the Busemann biplane. As a disadvantage, he pointed out that the biplane has a greater wing area than a monoplane, which increases skin-friction drag, and that the passage between the two elements might ‘choke’. In the same year, Ferri [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954410011404656"><bold>5</bold></xref>] conducted wind tunnel experiments. He measured aerodynamic forces and took Schlieren photographs to observe the viscous effect of the boundary layer and shock movement phenomena. He observed undesirable ‘choke’ and ‘hysteresis' situations. In 1947, Moeckel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954410011404656"><bold>6</bold></xref>] performed a detailed parametric study on the spacing of the gap and the LE and TE angles of the two elements of the biplane for lifting cases. He found that a well-designed biplane would show the best <italic>L</italic>/<italic>D</italic> (here, <italic>L</italic>/<italic>D</italic> refers to lift-to-drag ratio) performance of three for lifting case, and that unsymmetrical biplanes whose lower elements are thicker than upper elements would have higher <italic>L</italic>/<italic>D</italic> than symmetrical biplanes. He also concluded that the well-designed biplane would have better aerodynamic performance than the flat plate, which has the lowest wave drag at the identical lift conditions in monoplanes. In 1955, on research on two-dimensional (2D) supersonic biplanes, based on Moeckel's conclusion, Licher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410011404656"><bold>7</bold></xref>] made an analysis to design the optimal <italic>L</italic>/<italic>D</italic> unsymmetrical biplane with the given lift coefficient as a constraint using supersonic linear theory and mass conservation theory. Busemann showed that a supersonic biplane can eliminate wave drag due to thickness. Licher systematized reduction of wave drag due to lift using a multiple airplane and applied that to Busemann biplane.</p>
<p>Many studies have been conducted to investigate shock-wave interference effects and consider the configuration to reduce wave drag thus far inspired by the Busemann biplane concept. In 2004, these studies were summarized by Bushnell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011404656"><bold>8</bold></xref>]. At present, however, they did not result in realization of next generation SST. In the same year, a project of SST that is extended from the classic Busemann biplane concept started at Tohoku University. It has been led by Kusunose and other researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954410011404656"><bold>9</bold></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954410011404656"><bold>12</bold></xref>]. The goal of this project is to develop the idea of the supersonic biplane using modern technique, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools, advanced in the past 30 years, as well as to propose a practical biplane wing for low boom and low drag in supersonic flight. Not only the CFD analysis but also some experimental studies have been conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410011404656"><bold>11</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410011404656"><bold>13</bold></xref>].</p>
<p>In this article, the aerodynamics of 2D and 3D biplanes as a fundamental study for realization of next generation SST is discussed. The design (cruise) Mach number is set at 1.7, which is fixed in this article. The total thickness-to-chord ratio of each biplane is approximately 0.10. Sufficient lift coefficients, between 0.1 and 0.2, at these conditions are aimed at. On 2D biplane airfoils, the reduction of wave drag due to airfoil thickness and that due to lift are confirmed on traditional biplane configurations such as Busemann biplane and Licher biplane airfoils, and a Licher biplane airfoil which is one of ideal biplane configurations is improved using an inverse-design method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954410011404656"><bold>14</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954410011404656"><bold>15</bold></xref>]. On 3D biplane wings, the drag reduction effects of tapered biplane wings and a winglet are discussed. Here, new biplane wings using the inverse-design method are also designed. On both 2D and 3D biplanes, aerodynamic characteristics at their off-design conditions are discussed, simulating the acceleration and deceleration stages. ‘Choke’ and ‘hysteresis' indicated by Lighthill and Ferri are confirmed. Practical countermeasures against the phenomena are proposed. Finally, interactions of the strong shock waves with the expansion waves generated from a bulky body with biplane wings are demonstrated as a first step for realization of practical biplane-type SST.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954410011404656"><title>2 AERODYNAMICS OF 2D SUPERSONIC BIPLANE AIRFOILS AT A DESIGN MACH NUMBER</title>
<p>In this section, 2D biplane airfoils are discussed. First of all, focus is on aerodynamics of classic supersonic biplane airfoils such as Busemann biplane and Licher biplane, which is extended from Busemann biplane and an ideal biplane airfoil at lifting conditions. Then, an airfoil that has been designed using an inverse-design method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954410011404656"><bold>14</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954410011404656"><bold>15</bold></xref>] to have better aerodynamic performance at lifting conditions will be shown.</p>
<p>In this research, a flow solver named TAS code (Tohoku University Aerodynamic Simulation code), using a 2D or 3D unstructured grid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954410011404656"><bold>16</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954410011404656"><bold>17</bold></xref>], was used to evaluate aerodynamic performance. In simulation, the Euler/Navier–Stokes equations are solved by a finite-volume cell-vertex scheme. The lower/upper symmetric Gauss–Seidel implicit method for an unstructured grid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954410011404656"><bold>18</bold></xref>] is used for the time integration. For Navier–Stokes (NS) computations, a hybrid volume grid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954410011404656"><bold>19</bold></xref>] composed of tetrahedrons, prisms, and pyramids is used. A one-equation turbulence model by Spalart and Allmaras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954410011404656"><bold>20</bold></xref>] was adopted to treat turbulent boundary layers. In this article, the results obtained by Euler simulations (inviscid analyses) are discussed unless otherwise noted.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0954410011404656"><title>2.1 Busemann biplane</title>
<p>Busemann biplane is the airfoil that has the possibility of realizing low-boom and low-drag supersonic flight. It was proposed by Busemann [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011404656"><bold>1</bold></xref>] in 1935 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011404656"><bold>2</bold></xref>]. Wave drag can be divided into mainly two components. One is wave drag due to airfoil thickness (or volume), the other is that due to lift. Wave drag due to airfoil thickness can be significantly reduced by using the concept of Busemann biplane.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011404656">Figure 1</xref> shows a zero-lifting diamond airfoil and a Busemann biplane airfoil, which can be obtained by simply splitting the diamond airfoil into two elements and locating them in a way such that the waves generated by those elements cancel each other out. The diamond airfoil has zero lift, but has wave drag due to airfoil thickness corresponding to its thickness–chord ratio. Busemann showed that wave drag of a diamond airfoil can be completely eliminated.
<fig id="fig1-0954410011404656" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Diamond airfoil and Busemann biplane airfoil</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011404656-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In practical flow, Busemann biplane has some values of wave drag because of non-linearity of expansion waves. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011404656">Figure 2</xref>(a) and 2(b) shows pressure coefficient (<italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub>) visualizations of a Busemann biplane airfoil simulated by Euler and NS simulations, respectively. The Busemann biplane airfoil has zero angle of attack, therefore zero-lift conditions. When its chord length is defined as <italic>c</italic>, the total thickness-to-chord ratio (<italic>t</italic>/<italic>c</italic>) of the upper and lower elements is set at 0.10 (each element is 0.05). Therefore, <italic>ε</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011404656">Fig. 1</xref> is determined to be 5.71°. Under the condition that the free-stream Mach number is 1.7, the gap between the two elements (<italic>h</italic>/<italic>c</italic>) is set at 0.5 (It is defined so that the shock waves generated at the LEs hit the edge of the mid-chord). Reynolds number (<italic>Re</italic>) based on the chord length <italic>c</italic> is set at 30 million.
<fig id="fig2-0954410011404656" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p><italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> visualizations of a Busemann biplane airfoil in Euler and NS simulations (zero-lift conditions, <italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub> = 1.7)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011404656-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954410011404656">Table 1</xref> shows aerodynamic performance of the Busemann biplane airfoil obtained by these two simulations. Here, <italic>C</italic><sub>dp</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>df</sub> refer to pressure drag and skin-friction drag coefficients, respectively. The term <italic>C</italic><sub>d</sub> refers to sum of <italic>C</italic><sub>dp</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>df</sub>. These are defined using chord length <italic>c</italic>. Mesh dependency was already validated using the diamond airfoil with the identical volume of the Busemann biplane. The obtained <italic>C</italic><sub>d</sub> of the diamond airfoil using the identical quality of mesh of the Busemann biplane is 0.0289, which is the almost identical with <italic>C</italic><sub>d</sub> by the theoretical result in the thin airfoil theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011404656"><bold>2</bold></xref>] (Here, the value is 0.0292). The validations with calculations using structured grid were also conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410011404656"><bold>11</bold></xref>]. This fact also indicates that a Busemann biplane airfoil can reduce wave drag due to volume to less than one-tenth of the monoplane with the identical volume, and also that it can reduce total drag even though the friction drag could be approximately double of the monoplane. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954410011404656">Table 1</xref>, it can confirmed that the pressure drag coefficient in NS simulation is lower than that in Euler simulation. The reason is discussed by comparison of <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> distributions.

<sec id="sec4-0954410011404656"><title>2.2 Licher biplane</title>
<p>Busemann biplane cannot reduce wave drag due to lift, while it can do that due to airfoil thickness. In 1955, Licher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410011404656"><bold>7</bold></xref>] extended the idea of Busemann biplane to reduce the wave drag due to lift. Generally in supersonic flight, when a biplane airfoil has no interference with waves between its two elements, it can reduce wave drag due to lift to half compared with a monoplane airfoil.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011404656">Figure 4</xref> shows the theory of Licher biplane. It is obtained by combining a lifting biplane airfoil that has partial interference of the waves between its two elements (only interference of the shock wave generated from the leading of the upper element and the expansion wave from the mid-chord of the lower element) with a Busemann biplane airfoil. As the result of it, Licher biplane can reduce wave drag due to lift to two-thirds in addition to reduction of that due to airfoil thickness (effects of Buseman biplane).
<fig id="fig4-0954410011404656" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Licher biplane airfoil and its components of wave drag reduction</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011404656-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>

The aerodynamic performance of the Licher biplane airfoil is <italic>C</italic><sub>l</sub> = 0.0812, <italic>C</italic><sub>d</sub> = 0.00 449, and <italic>l</italic>/<italic>d</italic> = 18.1 at angle of attack of 1°.

Details of comparison of aerodynamic performance between the Busemann and the Licher biplane airfoils will be discussed in the next subsection with a newly designed biplane airfoil.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0954410011404656"><title>2.3 Two-dimensional desiged biplane airfoil</title>
<p>An ideal airfoil, Licher biplane, was modified to achieve higher aerodynamic performance at sufficient lift conditions of <italic>C</italic><sub>l</sub> from 0.1 to 0.2 at <italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub> = 1.7. An inverse-design method is used, which can determine the airfoil that has a specified <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> distribution.

<p>In this section, extension of 2D supersonic biplane airfoils to 3D wings controlling increase of drag at the design Mach number (<italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub> = 1.7) is performed.

<p>Wave drag characteristics of 3D supersonic biplane wings at the design Mach number using the Busemann biplane with zero lift are investigated. First of all, two cases of tapered Busemann biplane wings are cited in order to observe 3D effects on supersonic biplanes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011404656">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954410011404656">8</xref> show orthographic drawings of one of the two tapered Busemann biplane wings, and the mesh and <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> visualizations of the wing, respectively. The sectional configuration of the wing is the Busemann biplane evaluated in Section 2. Therefore, the total thickness-to-chord ratio (<italic>t</italic>/<italic>c</italic>) of each sectional configuration is 0.10 (each element is 0.05). The gap between its two elements (<italic>h</italic>/<italic>c</italic>) is 0.50. These are identical at all span stations. The mid-chord line of this wing is normal to the free-stream direction. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954410011404656">Table 2</xref> shows planform parameters of the tapered biplane wing when the root chord length of the wing (<italic>c</italic><sub>root</sub>) is assumed to be 1.

<p>Then, move back to discussion of aerodynamic performance and characteristics of the two tapered Busemann biplane wings. Case 1 has no LE sweep angle. Case 2 has some LE sweep angle and is identical with the wing discussed in the previous paragraph (The planform overviews can be confirmed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954410011404656">Fig. 10</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011404656">Figure 9</xref> shows spanwise <italic>C</italic><sub>d</sub> distributions of Cases 1 and 2, including that of a rectangular Busemann biplane (reference area (<italic>S</italic>) is 1, semi-span length (<italic>b</italic>) 1, and aspect ratio (AR) 2) and <italic>C</italic><sub>d</sub> of the 2D Busemann biplane for comparison, which is identical with the section <italic>C</italic><sub>d</sub> at the wing root of the rectangular wing.

<p>The aerodynamic characteristics of these two tapered biplane wings are discussed by dividing the area of the graph into three, referred to as Area 1, Area 2, and Area 3, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011404656">Fig. 9</xref>. Areas 1 and 3 are the areas affected by the Mach cones from the wing root and the wing tip, respectively. Area 2 is the area affected by neither the Mach cone from the wing root nor that from the wing tip.</p>
<p>It can be observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011404656">Fig. 9</xref> that both Cases 1 and 2 have lower <italic>C</italic><sub>d</sub> areas than the 2D biplane airfoil and the areas affected by the Mach cones from their wing tips which yield much increase of drag (Area 3) are smaller than that of the rectangular wing. The high drag in Area 3 (wing-tip effects) is one of the most important factors of drag increase in 3D biplane wings. (These are discussed in the next subsection.) The total <italic>C</italic><sub>D</sub>s of Cases 1 and 2 are 0.0 0367 and 0.00 300, respectively. Here, <italic>C</italic><sub>D</sub> of the rectangular wing is 0.00 685. Case 1 has lower <italic>C</italic><sub>d</sub>s at part of Area 1, which is affected by the Mach cone from the wing root. Case 2 has lower <italic>C</italic><sub>d</sub>s at the whole of Area 2, which is affected by neither the Mach cones from the wing tip nor those of the root. On the other hand, the <italic>C</italic><sub>d</sub>s of Case 1 at Area 2 are greater than that of the 2D biplane airfoil. The aerodynamic performance at Area 2 reflects unique characteristics of 3D biplane wings. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954410011404656">Figure 10</xref> shows <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> visualizations of the inner surfaces and <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> distributions of the upper element at 50 per cent semi-span stations (which is at Area 2) of Cases 1 and 2 compared with that of the 2D biplane airfoil. The <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> distribution of Case 2 is highly similar to that of the 2D result from the NS simulation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011404656">Fig. 3</xref>. The rear half of the <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> values of Case 2 is greater than that of the 2D biplane airfoil, whereas the <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> values of Case 1 are lower.</p>
<p>The reason why Cases 1 and 2 have different characteristics from each other at Area 2 and also from the 2D biplane airfoil is now discussed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954410011404656">Figure 11</xref> shows simple diagrams of effective interaction courses of shock waves and expansion waves on the inner surfaces of Cases 1 and 2. These courses do not show the streamlines. First of all, focus is on flow physics at the front half of the planform in Case 2. When the flow passes through the LE, the effective Mach number, which is the component normal to the LE angle, becomes <italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub>cos<italic>θ</italic><sub>2</sub>, which is lower than the free-stream Mach number. On the other hand, the deflection angle to the effective Mach number increases. According to the theory of oblique shock wave, a pressure jump through a shock wave is largely dependent upon the deflection angle and hardly dependent upon the upstream Mach number around this free-stream Mach number (1.6 &lt; <italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub> &lt; 1.8), which can be referred in Oblique Shock Chart 2 in Liepmann and Roshko [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011404656"><bold>2</bold></xref>]. As a consequence, the value of the pressure jump is slightly greater than those of the 2D biplane airfoil and Case 1 when the flow passes the shock waves generated from the LEs. This can be confirmed by the front half domain of <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954410011404656">Fig. 10</xref>. In the similar way, at the rear half of Case 1, the value of the pressure drop is also slightly greater than that of the 2D biplane airfoil when the flow passes the expansion waves generated from the mid-chord apexes. The value of the pressure drop in Case 2 is slightly lower than that of the 2D biplane airfoil because the effective Mach number is lower than the free-stream Mach number.
<fig id="fig11-0954410011404656" position="float"><label>Fig. 11</label><caption><p>Simple diagrams of effective interaction courses of shock waves and expansion waves on the inner surfaces of Cases 1 and 2</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011404656-fig11.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>These phenomena are confirmed by comparing the single elements (the upper or lower element) of Cases 1 and 2 with that of the 2D biplane airfoil. On the biplane wings, there are significant differences in <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> value at the rear half between Cases 1 and 2. In Case 1, only strength of the expansion wave generated from the mid-chord is different from that of the 2D biplane airfoil and is greater than the 2D airfoil. Therefore, the <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> value at the rear half is smaller than that of the 2D. In Case 2, strength of the shock wave is slightly greater and that of the expansion wave is slightly lower than that of the 2D biplane airfoil. When the flow passes the reflected shock wave, the rate of the pressure jump becomes double. Therefore, the <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> value at the rear half of Case 2 becomes much greater than that of the 2D biplane airfoil compared to the value at the front half. In practical conditions, Case 2 has lower <italic>C</italic><sub>D</sub> than Case 1. Case 2 is selected as the baseline planform on 3D biplane wings. More details of <italic>C</italic><sub>D</sub> characteristics with changes of the sweep angle are shown in Maruyama [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954410011404656"><bold>23</bold></xref>].</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0954410011404656"><title>3.2 Introduction of a winglet</title>
<p>The drag increase caused by the wing-tip effects is one of the most important factors in 3D biplane wings. Drag reduction effects at Area 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011404656">Fig. 9</xref> caused by a winglet is examined. Case 2 was used as the baseline model.

On the biplane with the winglet, the characteristics at Area 3 are in complete contrast to those at Area 1. Both the drag increase at Area 1 and the decrease at Area 3 are caused by mirror effects. Therefore, the drags of the biplane wing with the winglet at Area 3 are very small. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954410011404656">Table 3</xref> shows drag coefficients of these two wings at zero-lift conditions obtained by Euler and NS simulations.

<sec id="sec9-0954410011404656"><title>3.3 3D designed biplane wing</title>
<p>Low-drag biplane wings designed by the inverse-design method, which is a method that can determine the airfoil configuration that satisfies specified pressure distributions, are introduced and discussed based on a biplane wing with the taper planform selected in Subsection 3.1. The initial wing was first selected for the design. The planform parameters of the wing are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954410011404656">Table 2</xref> and the mid-chord line of the wing is normal to the free-stream direction. Under these conditions, the airfoil configuration discussed in Subsection 2.3 (‘2D Designed Airfoil’) was applied to all span stations of the wing and this new wing was set as the initial model referred to as ‘Initial Wing’ for the inverse-design method. Details of the design process can be referred in Maruyama [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954410011404656"><bold>23</bold></xref>]. Here, the aerodynamic characteristics of ‘Initial Wing’ and ‘Final Wing with Winglet’ are mainly discussed. In the actual design procedure, ‘Initial Wing’ was modified under the condition that biplane wings do not have the winglet. ‘Final Wing with Winglet’ is the wing that the winglet is attached to the designed wing by the inverse method, which is referred to as ‘Final Wing’.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954410011404656">Figures 14</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954410011404656">15</xref> show <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> visualizations of the inner surfaces and <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> distributions of the upper and lower elements of ‘Initial Wing’ and ‘Final Wing with Winglet’, respectively. The design concept is on the upper element to apply the <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> distributions at Area 2 (<italic>y</italic>/<italic>b</italic> of 50 per cent to 80 per cent) to those at Area 1 (<italic>y</italic>/<italic>b</italic> of 0 per cent to 40 per cent) to have better aerodynamic performance (Here, Areas 1, 2, and 3 correspond to the areas shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011404656">Figs 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954410011404656">13</xref>). On both the upper and lower elements, pressure peaks around their mid-chords were removed to have appropriate interaction between the shock waves and the expansion waves. However, the aerodynamic performance at <italic>y</italic>/<italic>b</italic> of 0 on the lower element was not improved. Therefore, the sectional configuration of ‘Initial Wing’ was used at this span station. <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> distributions at Area 3 (<italic>y</italic>/<italic>b</italic> of 90 per cent) were not modified in the inverse-design process because the aerodynamic performance at Area 3 would be well improved using the winglet, as discussed in Subsection 3.2.

The focus is on improvement of the aerodynamic performance at each area. At Area 1, the lift coefficients have significantly increased by getting additional angles of attack. The lift-to-drag ratios have also increased. At Area 2, the drag coefficients have slightly decreased without loss of the lift coefficients. Therefore, the lift-to-drag ratios have increased. At Area 3, the characteristics discussed in Subsection 3.2 can be confirmed. The drag coefficients have dramatically decreased at part of Area 3. There exists an area achieving lift-to-drag ratio of around 70.

<sec id="sec10-0954410011404656"><title>4 AERODYNAMICS AT OFF-DESIGN CONDITIONS</title>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, the flow choking and its attendant hysteresis problems on supersonic biplanes have been suggested by Lighthill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410011404656"><bold>4</bold></xref>] and Ferri [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954410011404656"><bold>5</bold></xref>].

The flow choking produces significant drag and it continues at a higher Mach number than a design one as the flow hysteresis. It is necessary for generation of SST using the biplane concept to settle these issues.</p>
<sec id="sec11-0954410011404656"><title>4.1 Flow characteristics and countermeasures against flow choking</title>
<p>Supersonic biplanes bring about the flow choking at their off-design conditions and their hysteresis problems in both acceleration and deceleration stages. On the 2D Busemann biplane discussed in Subsection 2.1, over a wide range, more than <italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub> of 0.6, <italic>C</italic><sub>d</sub> increases to more than 0.1, which is approximately 50 times greater than that at the design point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-0954410011404656">Fig. 20</xref>). Moreover, in acceleration stage, the choked flow continues to persist even at Mach numbers greater than the design Mach number as the hysteresis. These phenomena are highly similar to those of an intake diffuser. The Mach number at which the flow choking disappears in acceleration stage is referred to as ‘starting Mach number’. On the contrary, the Mach number at which the flow choking occurs in deceleration stage is referred to as ‘unstarting Mach number’. The objective here is to reduce the high drag coefficients over a wide range of free-stream Mach numbers and to reduce the starting Mach numbers of the biplanes.

In fact, the starting and unstarting Mach numbers of the 2D Busemann biplane agree well with those from the theory of intake diffuser. In the theory, the starting and unstarting Mach numbers are 2.15 and 1.60, respectively. On 3D wings, these devices are applied to all span stations. Only wings w/o-wlt is discussed here. In Section 5, the validity of the winglet is discussed, including interference effects from a body to biplane wings.</p>
<p>It can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-0954410011404656">Fig. 20</xref> that the high drag coefficients and the starting Mach numbers are significantly reduced by using the devices. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21-0954410011404656">Figures 21</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22-0954410011404656">22</xref> describe <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> visualizations of the 3D wings at <italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub> = 0.8 and 1.6, respectively. The reduction of the drag coefficients at high subsonic regions (0.8 &lt; <italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub> &lt; 1.0) is caused by increase of the sectional area ratio of the outlet to the throat (flap effects). The reduction of the drag coefficients at the supersonic region (<italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub> &gt; 1.0) and that of the starting Mach number are caused by increase of the sectional area ratio of the inlet to the throat (slat effects). Thus, the hinged slats and flaps are effective for avoiding the choked flow and its hysteresis problems.

<p>To demonstrate an actual flight cycle of the idealized 3D biplane wing, the concept of the hinged slats and flaps were applied to ‘Final Wing’ discussed in Subsection 3.3. In the present, a sufficient amount of lift is required for each flight condition. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig23-0954410011404656">Fig. 23</xref>, a list of biplane configurations from take-off to cruise conditions using the hinged slats and flaps are illustrated.

<p>Required aerodynamic performance at take-off and landing conditions can be assured using the hinged slats and flaps as high-lift devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410011404656"><bold>11</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954410011404656"><bold>22</bold></xref>]. In high subsonic flight, the hinged slats and flaps are used. This biplane wing requires some degrees of angle of attack from 2.5° to 4.0° to create a sufficient amount of lift. Then, in supersonic flight, the flaps are returned to their original positions. The biplane wing equipped with only the hinged slats flies with no additional angle of attack. The hysteresis of the choking disappears at <italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub> = 1.51. Thus, the biplane wing is reconfigured back to the form of the traditional biplane wing to produce good aerodynamic performance at the cruise condition (<italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub> = 1.7).</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec13-0954410011404656"><title>5 WAVE INTERFERENCE EFFECTS OF A BODY WITH SUPERSONIC BIPLANE WINGS</title>
<p>For practical design of a wing–body configuration, some fundamental studies on interference effects of bodies with supersonic biplane wings are necessary. Odaka and Kusunose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954410011404656"><bold>27</bold></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954410011404656"><bold>29</bold></xref>] have proposed a wing–body configuration, which generates strong shock waves and expansion waves, to assume the condition that supersonic biplane wings are strongly affected by those waves. They confirmed that a supersonic biplane wing w/o-wlt has the possibility of achieving better aerodynamic performance when it is affected by the expansion waves from the body.</p>
<p>In this section, focus is on the aerodynamic characteristics of the biplane wings w/o-wlt and w-wlt when they are affected by the body proposed by Odaka and Kusunose. Therefore, the aerodynamic performance of the wings is only discussed here. As a first step of investigation of the interference effects, some wing–body configurations are analysed with changes of the positions where the wings are attached to the body. These are simulated at the cruise conditions and also at their off-design conditions to investigate the unstarting problems on deceleration stages, because the unstarting problems are important for the stability around the cruise condition as discussed in Subsection 4.1.</p>
<sec id="sec14-0954410011404656"><title>5.1 Wing–body configurations</title>
<p>A diagram of the wing–body configuration proposed by Odaka and Kusunose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954410011404656"><bold>27</bold></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954410011404656"><bold>29</bold></xref>] is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig24-0954410011404656">Fig. 24</xref>. The body has a conical configuration at its nose and has a rectangular parallelepiped at its back. It generates strong shock waves from the nose and also generates expansion waves. In this study, two types of supersonic biplane wings are applied to the wing–body configuration. One is a Buseamnn biplane w/o-wlt and the other the one w-wlt. These are almost identical with the wings discussed in Subsection 3.2. The difference is only the gap between their two elements (<italic>h</italic>/<italic>c</italic>). The gap (<italic>h</italic>/<italic>c</italic>) of the wings discussed in this section is 0.505. These wings are referred to as ‘isolated w/o-wlt’ and ‘isolated w-wlt’, respectively.

<p>Under these conditions, four cases of the positions where the wings are attached to the body were investigated. Therefore, there are eight types of wing–body configurations in total. As examples, overviews of the positions where the Busemann biplane with the winglet is attached to the body are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig25-0954410011404656">Fig. 25</xref>. This figure also shows <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> visualizations of the wing–body configurations at <italic>z</italic> = 0 at zero-lift conditions The position where each wing is attached to the body is expressed with a parameter <italic>x</italic><sub>w</sub>, which refers to the distance in <italic>x</italic>-wise from the nose of the body to the mid-chord line of the wing. These wing–body configurations are discussed compared with the isolated wings. When <italic>x</italic><sub>w</sub> = 3 and 3.5, the wings are strongly affected by the compression waves generated from the nose of the body and also affected by the expansion waves from the body. When <italic>x</italic><sub>w</sub> = 4 and 4.5, they are exposed by only the expansion waves. For more precise analysis for calculations of the aerodynamic performance, it would be necessary to conduct mesh refinement around the waves generated from the body.

<p>When the wings are affected by the compression waves from the body (when <italic>x</italic><sub>w</sub> = 3 and 3.5), unique characteristics can be observed especially on the wings w-wlt. Focus is first on the cases of <italic>x</italic><sub>w</sub> = 3 and 3.5 w/o-wlt. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26-0954410011404656">Figs 26</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig27-0954410011404656">27</xref>, the regions affected by the compression waves have high <italic>C</italic><sub>d</sub>.

<p>When <italic>x</italic><sub>w</sub> = 3 w-wlt, the flow choking occurs from the wing tip. When <italic>x</italic><sub>w</sub> = 3.5 w-wlt, the reflection of the compression wave at the wing tip makes <italic>C</italic><sub>d</sub> around the wing tip very low (thrust force), as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig27-0954410011404656">Fig. 27</xref>(b). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28-0954410011404656">Figure 28</xref> shows drag polar diagrams of the isolated wings and the wings of all wing–body configurations.

<sec id="sec16-0954410011404656"><title>5.3 Aerodynamic characteristics at off-design conditions</title>
<p>When acceleration and deceleration of supersonic biplanes are considered, the starting and unstarting problems, which can be observed in intake diffusers, occur as hysteresis problems. Concerning the starting problem, slats are useful to make biplanes start at lower Mach numbers than their cruise Mach numbers. On the other hand, the unstarting problems are directly connected with stability at the cruise condition. The relations between the conditions that the flow choking occurs as the unstarting problem and that favourable interaction of the shock waves with the expansion waves occurs are highly close. In fact, the wing–body configuration w-wlt of <italic>x</italic><sub>w</sub> = 3 has the flow choking and has a high drag at the design Mach number.</p>
<p>Here, the aerodynamic characteristics of two wing–body configurations (w-wlt of <italic>x</italic><sub>w</sub> = 3.5 and w-wlt of <italic>x</italic><sub>w</sub> = 4) at their off-design conditions, especially for the unstarting problems, are discussed by comparing with an isolated wing (‘isolated w-wlt’). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30-0954410011404656">Figure 30</xref> shows surface <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> visualizations around the unstarting Mach numbers of the isolated wing w-wlt, wing–body configurations w-wlt of <italic>x</italic><sub>w</sub> = 3.5 and 4. The unstarting Mach number of the wing–body configuration w-wlt of <italic>x</italic><sub>w</sub> = 4 is 1.60, which is lower than that of the isolated wing (the unstarting Mach number of the isolated wing is 1.63). The wing–body configuration w-wlt of <italic>x</italic><sub>w</sub> = 3.5 begins unstarting at <italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub> = 1.69, which is extremely close to the cruise Mach number 1.7. The flow choking spreads over the whole area of the wing from the wing tip unlike the phenomena observed in other cases. The phenomenon at this condition is similar to that of the wing–body configuration w-wlt of <italic>x</italic><sub>w</sub> = 3 at the cruise condition discussed in the previous subsection.
<fig id="fig30-0954410011404656" position="float"><label>Fig. 30</label><caption><p>Surface <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> visualizations around unstarting Mach numbers of isolated wing w-wlt and wing–body configurations w-wlt of <italic>x</italic><sub>w</sub> = 3.5 and 4 at zero-lift conditions (zero angles of attack)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011404656-fig30.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It was confirmed that the reflection of the compression waves at the winglet is useful for improvement of the aerodynamic performance at the cruise condition. However, this indicates the beginning of the flow choking. When biplane wings are affected by expansion waves form a body, they are better than those of isolated biplane wings both in aerodynamic performance at their design conditions and in the unstart phenomenon at their off-design conditions.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec17-0954410011404656"><title>5.4 Appication to designed wing</title>
<p>For practical flight, designed wings discussed in Subsection 3.3 were applied to a wing–body configuration. From the view point of aerodynamic performance at the cruise condition and stability on the unstarting problem around the cruise condition, the wing–body configuration w-wlt of <italic>x</italic><sub>w</sub> = 4, the wing of which is affected by only the expansion waves from the body, was selected. In this subsection, ‘Final Wing with Winglet’, which was designed in Subsection 3.3, was applied to the selected wing–body configuration to demonstrate aerodynamic feasibility of biplane-type SST. This wing–body configuration is hereinafter referred to as ‘Final Wing–Body Configuration’.</p>
<p>At the design Mach number, <italic>C</italic><sub>L</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>D</sub> were improved from 0.126 to 0.131 and from 0.00 647 to 0.00 631, respectively. <italic>L</italic>/<italic>D</italic> increased from 19.4 to 20.8. This value is highly close to that of ‘2D Designed Airfoil’ shown in Subsection 2.3 (<italic>l</italic>/<italic>d</italic> of the airfoil is 21.7). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig31-0954410011404656">Figure 31</xref> shows surface <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> visualization of ‘Final Wing–Body Configuration’. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig32-0954410011404656">Figure 32</xref> describes a drag polar diagram including the wing of ‘Final Wing–Body Configuration’, ‘Final Wing with Winglet’, and also the 2D flat-plate airfoil. The wing of ‘Final Wing–Body Configuration’ achieves lower drag than the 2D flat-plate airfoil at <italic>C</italic><sub>L</sub> &gt; 0.14. This characteristic is almost identical with that of ‘2D Designed Airfoil’. Over the range of the sufficient lift conditions, 0.1 &lt; <italic>C</italic><sub>L</sub> &lt; 0.2, the 3D biplane wing can achieve lower wave drag than the zero-thickness, single flat-plate airfoil, which has the lowest wave drag in monoplanes at this cruise condition.

<p>Finally, the hinged slats and flaps discussed in Section 4 have been installed in ‘Final Wing–Body Configuration’ for improvement at the off-design conditions. In the same way as Subsection 4.2, the hinged slats and flaps are used at high subsonic region, then only the flaps are put back at the supersonic region with less angles of attack to make the biplane wing start by the effects of the hinged slats. A wing form and its corresponding <italic>C</italic><sub>L</sub>–<italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub>, <italic>C</italic><sub>D</sub>–<italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub> graphs are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig33-0954410011404656">Fig. 33</xref>. The configurations around the wing root and the wing tip are fixed to their original ones and the configurations of spanwise from 10 per cent to 90 per cent are equipped with the hinged slats and flaps. The starting Mach number of this form is 1.57, which is greater than that of the isolated wing equipped with the hinged slats at all span stations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954410011404656">Table 4</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig34-0954410011404656">Figure 34</xref> shows surface <italic>C</italic><sub>p</sub> visualizations of the wing–body configurations equipped with the hinged slats around the unstarting Mach number. It can be observed that the detached shock wave around the wing tip is not completely swallowed at <italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub> = 1.57, although the other spanwise areas are already swallowed. However, the drag coefficient and the starting Mach number are not so different from the case of the isolated wing. The hinged slats are also sufficient to make the wing bring the starting at a low Mach number.

Interference effects of a body with 3D biplane wings were also investigated. In this study, the design Mach number is 1.7 and total thickness-to-chord ratios of these biplanes are approximately 0.10. The sufficient lift coefficients at the cruise Mach number were set between 0.1 and 0.2. Our conclusions are as follows.
<list id="list1-0954410011404656" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A Busemann biplane airfoil can reduce wave drag due to volume less than one-tenth and the wave drag in NS simulations is lower than that in Euler simulations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A Licher biplane airfoil, which is one of the ideal biplane configurations, was improved using an inverse-design method. The designed biplane achieves lower wave drag than the 2D flat-plate airfoil at <italic>C</italic><sub>l</sub> &gt; 0.14.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Three-dimensional biplane wings with a taper planform have good aerodynamic-performance areas, whose performance is better than the 2D biplane airfoils defined by their sectional configurations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A winglet is useful to improve the aerodynamic performance around the wing tip of a biplane even though it slightly increases the skin-friction drag.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A three-dimensional biplane wing using the inverse-design method was designed. The designed wing achieves better aerodynamic performance than the flat-plate airfoil at <italic>C</italic><sub>L</sub> &gt; 0.16 by combining the above-mentioned advantages of the 3D biplane wings such as the taper planform and the winglet.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hinged slats and flaps are useful for avoiding the flow choking and its attendant hysteresis problems in acceleration and deceleration stages at the off-design conditions of both 2D and 3D biplanes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>On the 3D biplane wing with the taper planform, its starting Mach number is lower than that of the 2D biplane airfoil.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When biplane wings are affected by the expansion waves from a body, their aerodynamic performance at the design Mach number and their unstarting Mach numbers are better and lower than those of their isolated wings, respectively.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Finally, the designed biplane wing was applied to the body whose expansion waves affects the whole area of the wing. The wing of this wing–body configuration has <italic>C</italic><sub>L</sub> of 0.131 and <italic>L</italic>/<italic>D</italic> of 20.8 at an angle of attack of 1.19° in Euler simulations. This aerodynamic performance is highly similar to those of the 2D designed airfoil. The wing of the wing–body configuration achieves higher aerodynamic performance than the 2D flat-plate airfoil at <italic>C</italic><sub>L</sub> &gt; 0.14, which has the lowest drag in monoplanes at <italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub> = 1.7. This wing–body configuration can also avoid high <italic>C</italic><sub>D</sub> and high starting Mach number using the hinged slats and flaps between the wing root and tip.</p>
<p>In the future, studies of more practical fuselages and integration of these fuselages into supersonic biplane wings are necessary for realization of practical flight of biplane-type SST.</p></sec>
