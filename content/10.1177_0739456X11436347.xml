<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Few contest that planning operates at the interface of knowledge and action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0739456X11436347">1</xref></sup> The Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) sponsored Education Commission expressed the essential idea of (spatial) planning to be “critical thinking about space and place as the basis for action or intervention” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0739456X11436347">RTPI 2003</xref>, para. 4.17). However, to give meaning to these thoughtful yet innocent-sounding descriptions involves wrestling with the hoary old question of the relationship between <italic>is</italic> and <italic>ought</italic>. If planning is about intervening and taking action in the hope of realizing better place-based outcomes than would be achieved otherwise, it might be assumed that the better informed such judgments, the better the resulting outcomes are likely to be. But how does (and should) knowledge about the world get turned into actions designed to make the world a better place? This is the question that lies at the heart of this article.</p>
<p>The relationship between <italic>is</italic> and <italic>ought</italic>, while fundamental to research and practice, is hugely contested. The long-standing tensions between planning practitioners and researchers exemplify a world of seemingly conflicting priorities, even insecurities, rather than a fluent transition between knowledge (including that which finds its way into journal articles) and actions (such as public policies). Practitioners and politicians oft berate academics for the irrelevance of their work to real-world problems (and theorists all the more so!). These tensions are not limited to the planning domain. They link to wider debates about the role and purpose of universities. In the current global climate of severe cut-backs to the public sector, questions about the tangible contribution of the residents of so-called ivory towers to economic growth and societal well-being have become the focus of increasing attention. The focus of this article is on the planning activity and public policy making, but the underlying concerns relate to more general issues concerning the social sciences and universities.</p>
<p>Despite the enduring acceptance that planning is situated at the intersection between knowledge and action, it is intriguing how little explicit attention has been focused on such concerns. Donald Schön’s work on reflective practice, while being an exception to this, serves also to highlight the pertinence and immensity of the challenge. As he points out:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In the varied topography of professional practice, there is a high, hard ground where practitioners can make effective use of research-based theory and technique, and there is a swampy lowland where situations are confusing “messes”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0739456X11436347">2</xref></sup> incapable of technical solution. The difficulty is that the problems of the high ground, however great their technical interest, are often relatively unimportant to clients or to the larger society, while in the swamp are the problems of greatest concern. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0739456X11436347">1991</xref>, 42)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>So, according to Schön, knowledge (derived from research) and action may be linked, but only in relation to the least significant of the problems facing societies. It should be acknowledged that these distinctions and the underlying presumptions about the nature of knowledge and action require closer scrutiny, but at the very least Schön’s statement is indicative of the significance as well as the problematic qualities of the relationship.</p>
<p>Alongside the intuitive assumption that societies benefit from more informed decision making, intellectual debates about the nature of knowledge question the appropriateness and even efficacy of the link between, for example, research and policy outcomes. For different reasons, both positivist and postpositivist perspectives (broadly defined) doubt the connection between knowledge and action. On the one side, logic questions whether “ought” can be derived from “is”; on the other, recognition of diversity and multiple truths suggests all knowledge to be embedded within relations of power and hence subject to exploitation by dominant interests. Consequently, to give privileged status to a knowledge claim involves the imposition of a particular world view. On this basis, the legitimate grounds for choosing one particular course of action over another become problematic.</p>
<p>So where does this leave planning in its quest to interface between knowledge and action? Seemingly, planners and policy makers must either attempt the logically impossible or else relinquish idealistic pretentions and accept (willingly or unwillingly) their part within the infrastructure of imposition. As a result, planning would seem to be stuck in a vicious circle—a vicious circle, moreover, that casts doubt on the activity’s rationale and purpose beyond the instrumental, cynical, foolish, or hopelessly naïve.</p>
<p>The stimulus and focus for this article is very firmly a concern about the theory and practice of planning. That said, to ignore the closely aligned implications for academic practice would be hypocritical. For if knowledge has no particular qualities of truth or truthfulness, external credibility or validity, then, as Bernard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0739456X11436347">Williams (2002)</xref> points out, what of the efficacy of the whole academic endeavor? Overall, while the relationship between knowledge and action is fraught with difficult questions, practical and intellectual, for policy makers and academics, the general area is of fundamental importance and hence merits far greater consideration. The objective behind this article is to explore the nature of the practical and intellectual challenges involved in linking knowledge and action (or for that matter action and knowledge) and the resultant implications for theory and practice of planning.</p>
<p>The main reference points for this article are the British academic and practice communities, as they comprise the world with which I am most familiar. This is not to suggest that the article is essentially concerned with British planning practices. It is not. Furthermore, although the examples used mainly relate to the domain of public policy, there is no presumption that the concerns discussed are limited to planners working for state agencies. The challenge of moving from knowledge to action is as problematic for those working in the private sector as for community advocates. What should be done is rarely self-evident or uncontested when it comes to specific cases or problems.</p>
<p>These introductory remarks provide little more than a flavor of the issues at stake. Given the complexity of the underlying conceptual debates, it is inevitable that the discussion runs the risk of being overgeneralized and underspecified. Consequently, the arguments presented are somewhat tentative, in the sense that each element merits further explanation and scrutiny. However, it is hoped that the overall argument is at least sufficiently well formed to encourage, perhaps even provoke, debate.</p>
<p>The argument is presented in three further parts. The next section seeks to examine more fully the nature of the relationship between is and ought, knowledge and action, and hence the problem this presents for the theory and practice of planning. Building on this discussion, the third section of the article develops a framework, based on the juxtaposition of the qualities of analysis and synthesis, to highlight the constraints and possibilities for bridging the divide that currently seems to exist between knowledge and action. This argument suggests that although critical analysis is of value, much more attention needs to be focused on the qualities of synthesis. The concluding section explores the implications of the preceding argument for the theory and practice of planning and, more generally, how synthesis underpins our capacity to change the world for the better.</p>

<title>The Problem: <italic>Between</italic> Knowledge and Action</title>
<sec id="section3-0739456X11436347">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The concern at the heart of this article is with how planning (and public policy making) might be done better. This contrasts with the focus of much research that examines past planning practices, investigating why certain outcomes resulted given the prevailing socioeconomic and political contexts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0739456X11436347">3</xref></sup> The underlying focus is therefore less with the analysis of past practices and rather more with the making of judgments about appropriate forms of intervention (and nonintervention) in real time, when precise consequences are unknown and hindsight impossible. Such judgments involve drawing on existing knowledge to inform decisions about policy choices. This is not to imply a linear process or that the influence of knowledge is benign, but it is assumed that there is more to policy making than random guesswork.</p>
<p>Before progressing further, it is appropriate to clarify the way the term <italic>knowledge</italic> is being used and more generally to say a little more about how this argument links to existing debates within planning.</p>
<p>The concern of the article means that the precise definition of what is regarded as knowledge matters rather less than expectations as to how knowledge can and should become entwined into the processes of policy making. It is certainly the case that the qualities of knowledge are understood differently according to the (theoretical) starting point of the practitioner or researcher. This is most obviously indicated in the notion implied by, or terms chosen to substitute for, the use of the word <italic>knowledge</italic>, such as evidence, information, expertise, data, facts, research, proof, statistics, interpretations, values, or intelligence. Similarly descriptions of the qualities of knowledge suggest significant differences in emphasis, for example, intuitive, scientific, experiential, expert, ethical, technical, aesthetic, emotional, tactical, objective, lay, and so on. There is usually a conceptual association between the choice of term and the related descriptors, for example, between facts and the qualities of being scientific and objective. These associations are important in relation to the nature of the potential connections to choices of action, but for the purposes of this article mean the boundaries of what is regarded as “knowledge” can be left relatively broad. Further than this it is worth underlining two points. First, evoking a term like knowledge rather than, say, data generally suggests an underlying concern with some sense of causality, although not necessarily in a narrowly objective scientific sense. When the imperative is to move toward determining appropriate actions, there is usually an expectation that the value of knowledge lies in its capacity to provide insight. Second, it is assumed that while the research undertaken by academics contributes to the process of knowledge generation, the resulting findings from such studies are far from being the only source of knowledge.</p>
<p>So where do the concerns of this article fit into debates within planning? Consideration and reflection on how information and knowledge become, and should become, inscribed in policy is central to the concerns of planning theory. Those that write about planning theory are essentially writing about the nature, role, and (mis)use of knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0739456X11436347">4</xref></sup> In line with modernist policy traditions, much of the early concern within planning theory was with enhancing the scientific qualities of decision-making processes. The aspiration to give policy the irrefutable credibility of the natural sciences meant that the technical refinement of policy-making processes and the underlying models of socioeconomic phenomena dominated academic and practitioner concerns. It was assumed that (social) science would produce social progress, although it would be wrong to suggest that the planner as neutral technocrat (a type of knowledge engineer) was accepted without question. Perhaps what began to erode from the late 1960s onwards was confidence in the assumptions underlying the modernist agenda.</p>
<p>In the period since, the surfacing of doubt as to the progressive outcomes of planning policies, and broader debates about diversity and the potential for particular forms of knowledge to be enrolled in the service of powerful economic and political interests, has led to all aspects of knowledge production and use being subject to concerted deconstruction and critical appraisal. The resulting critiques have effectively highlighted the way knowledge is embedded within social relations, manipulated through exclusionary networks, and hidden in taken-for-granted assumptions. In the face of a barrage of deconstructive analysis, the emphasis of normative work has been on seeking ways to make planning more inclusive through the incorporation of more open deliberative and collaborative democratic practices. Among other things, this work has placed a priority on ensuring that nontechnical knowledge forms, such as aesthetic, experiential, or emotional perspectives and understandings, are not excluded from policy-making arenas.</p>
<p>In terms of its normative aspirations, the collaborative or communicative turn<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0739456X11436347">5</xref></sup> in planning thought has been complemented by more recent developments stressing the need to consider the justice of the distributive outcomes of planning policies. In the case of the latter, concern is placed on questions of ethical value and the substantive qualities of planning outcomes at least as much as the inclusiveness of the processes of deliberation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0739456X11436347">6</xref></sup> The choice of the word <italic>complemented</italic> in the preceding is no doubt controversial, as much commentary about the ideas of the “communicative turn” and the “just city” are couched in adversarial terms. Certainly there are important differences in emphasis, but for the purposes of this study, these differences are of limited significance. Both perspectives are centrally concerned with normative issues and therefore with the link between knowledge and action. In this quest they have been subject to considerable critique, typified by the “aha moment” of deconstructive analysis, whereby calls for greater inclusiveness end up being represented as gross naïveté in the face of powerful interests, or a concern with the justice of planning outcomes regarded as a surrogate for oppressive practices, posing the question: Who are you to say what’s <italic>just</italic>? Based on this, planning appears to have the dispiriting choice among the alternatives of naïveté, the evils of imposition, or the inertia and equivocation of openness such that “anything goes.” Raymond Tallis draws on an observation by Francis Fukuyama, in reflecting on the dilemma inherent more generally within contemporary intellectual debates:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Pessimism has become something of a fashion, a kind of intellectual pose to demonstrate one’s moral seriousness. The terrible experiences of [last] century have taught us that one never pays the price for being unduly gloomy, whereas naive optimists have been the object of ridicule. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0739456X11436347">Fukuyama 1993</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0739456X11436347">Tallis 1997</xref>, 358)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The goal within planning of linking knowledge to action assumes the maintenance of at least a degree of optimism, that things can be better. However, there is also the risk, and hence fear, that outcomes will fall short, particularly to the detriment of the innocent and most vulnerable.</p>

<title>Between Knowledge and Action—What Do We Need to Know?</title>
<p>General acceptance that the planning activity operates at the interface of knowledge and action, between <italic>is</italic> and <italic>ought</italic>, says little about what is involved. One way, which potentially starts to clarify the nature of the relationship, is to identify the sorts of questions that underpin the work of planning and policy making. At its most basic planning is concerned with addressing four generic questions. These can be summarized as follows, with an indication of the qualities of the knowledge implied:</p>
<list id="list1-0739456X11436347" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What <italic>is</italic> going on here?—<italic>descriptive</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Why is it like that?—analytical / explanatory</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What to <italic>do</italic>?—<italic>prescriptive</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What <italic>ought</italic> to be done?—<italic>normative</italic></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>It should be emphasized that the purpose of identifying these four questions is to help to tease out the types of knowledge interactions which go on in planning. It is not designed to provide a description of, or for that matter prescription for, a particular form of linear policy process. They also lead on to a range of important second-order descriptive and analytical questions, such as: Who is affected and how?</p>
<p>The first two questions suggest planners require insights into what <italic>is</italic>, in a descriptive sense, as well as why such sets of circumstances have arisen in an analytical sense. To take a simple example, a question such as “What is the distribution of nonwhite residents within a particular city?” might lead on to a further question asking “Why are certain nonwhite groupings disproportionately located in areas with the poorest quality housing and the lowest performing schools?” The underlying descriptive evidence can come in a multiplicity of forms from crude quantitative indicators to oral histories about everyday life. Whatever the case, the objective is to provide insight into how the world is, even if expectations over the level of generalizability vary considerably. However, planners do not just want to know about the world for its own sake. The action orientation of planning means descriptive or analytical insights are of limited worth in isolation from prescriptive and/or normative concerns about what to do and what <italic>ought</italic> to be done.</p>
<p>These four questions provide an indication of the nature of the knowledge underpinning planning activities, but this only goes so far. For what matters is not merely the knowledge that is generated in relation to each of the domains—descriptive, analytical, prescriptive, and normative—but rather the capacity to make connections between the different domains, more generally between <italic>is</italic> and <italic>ought</italic>. Before moving on to examine the nature of the inherent challenges this presents, it is worth using the notion of these four generic questions or domains to reflect on the enduring tensions between (and to some extent within) the practice and research communities.</p>
<p>For much of the traditional social science community, at face value, the imperative to move beyond the descriptive and analytical is less pressing than for a more applied field such as planning. David Marquand pointedly suggests that during the post-war years, “the academy cut itself off from the living forces of the outside world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0739456X11436347">2004</xref>, 76). Politicians and others may (misguidedly in some cases) question the relevance of the academic research undertaken. However, few from within the more traditional disciplines are likely to use this as a pretext to challenge the reason for those disciplines to exist. In contrast, within planning, calls for greater relevance represent more than rhetoric. They are institutionalized within the requirements associated with professional course accreditation, exemplified in the RTPI’s notion of the “effective planning school.”</p>
<p>The academic planning community, and more particularly individual academics, may be torn between seemingly conflicting priorities in attempting to meet both intellectual and professional demands. The nature of these tensions becomes clearer using the notion of the four domains identified previously, as it can be argued that the relationship between research and practice, and hence knowledge and action, exists at two rather different levels. The first is based on an axis running from description to prescription, while the second is more concerned with the potential links between the analytical and the normative. When practitioners call for “greater relevance,” their preoccupation is usually with the former. They are looking for immediate “answers,” which are generally concerned with maintaining existing systems and practices. They want to know about “what’s going on” and “what to do.” The concern underlying the analytical/normative axis is much more with challenging and even transforming existing practices. The aspiration is to know more about “why’s it like that” and then to consider “what ought to be done.” As noted above, the proportion of research studies that effectively link the analytical and the normative, or even aspire to do so, is relatively small (but includes the significant bodies of work associated with the communicative turn and just outcomes or the “just city”). Importantly the findings of such research tend not to translate easily into good practice guides. This points, at least in part, to the reasons behind the tensions between the worlds of practice and academic research. It would be inappropriate to imply that there is a clear distinction in perspective between academia and practice. There are practitioners who find themselves asking more analytical and normative questions, possibly at some irritation to those around them, and academics who, because of the requirements of consultancy-type research, pursue concerns of a more descriptive and prescriptive nature. Regardless, the notion of two axes, running either between the descriptive and the prescriptive or the analytical and the normative, helps to clarify why tensions and misunderstandings arise, even in cases where there is an explicit aspiration to move toward action.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0739456X11436347">
<title>Searching for a Connection between Is and Ought</title>
<p>The relationship between <italic>is</italic> and <italic>ought</italic> has been central to enduring debates within science and the humanities. Arguably, such concerns develop even greater pertinence when it comes to the societal problems with which the social sciences are concerned and even more so in planning’s case, given the explicit links to a professional practice. The underlying thrust of the arguments about that relationship has been influenced by two contrasting streams of thought, the first drawing on scientific or positivist perspectives and the second on postpositivist understandings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0739456X11436347">7</xref></sup> Very crudely, these two sets of intellectual understandings produce the following conclusions about the relationship between is and ought respectively:</p>
<list id="list2-0739456X11436347" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>You can’t get an <italic>ought</italic> from an <italic>is</italic>;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0739456X11436347">8</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is no <italic>is</italic>, and hence there ought not to be an <italic>ought</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0739456X11436347">9</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Overall, this does not make the prospects of legitimately moving from knowledge to action look at all promising. The link may be practically pertinent, but it appears to be intellectually illogical. The underlying arguments need to be examined in a little more depth.</p>
<p>So, why can’t an ought be derived from an is? Surely the more knowledge we have about the world, the better the resulting decisions are likely to be? As Sherlock Holmes said, “It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0739456X11436347">10</xref></sup> Much of the knowledge generated by early social science reflects the state’s perceived need for evidence on which to base policy decisions. “In fact, the shift from a largely normative and philosophical approach to society to one grounded in factual knowledge is probably the most important intellectual correlate of the rise of the modern state” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0739456X11436347">Evans, Rueschemeyer, and Skocpol 1985</xref>, 357). More recently, the notion of evidence-based policy, which has been promoted by governments on both sides of the Atlantic, is reflective of the same underlying assumption that more informed decision making will produce better policy outcomes.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it is easy to deride the promotion of evidence-based policy as a mere rhetorical flourish, certainly in the United Kingdom. However, there are more serious intellectual questions related to the challenge of making practical judgments. In the world of policy, rather than fictional detectives, knowing for instance that individuals within certain localities have lower than average life expectancy and that young adults have a greater chance of being unemployed, does not actually tell you what should be done or for that matter determine whether action should be taken. This remains the case even when it is known that a high proportion of the young unemployed also have poor levels of educational attainment. For if low educational attainment is perceived to be a “problem,” what is it a problem about? Is it about individual students, their family circumstances, the schools, teaching methods, lack of male role models, gang cultures, low female aspiration, the community, the environment, diet, health, the educational system, the political economy, globalization; none, some or all of the above? Similarly, climate change debates exemplify how even when the majority of scientists are agreed that human action is contributing to global warming, determining whether to act or what ought to be done is far from clear, even leaving to one side issues of individual or national self-interest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0739456X11436347">11</xref></sup> Evidence can be scientifically conclusive but is often not authoritative within the policy domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0739456X11436347">Lindblom and Cohen 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>The separation between is and ought is inherent in the quasi-scientific policy processes of the rational comprehensive approach. Hence, from this perspective, it is for politicians to establish the ends, and for planners and other technical experts to identify the appropriate means to achieve these ends. Planning and planners therefore maintain a distance from the problematic world of values. There is a further logic to this separation, as normative issues are fundamentally concerned with changing the world, while in contrast, evidence about how the world is reflects what is already there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X11436347">Appiah 2006</xref>). The qualities of is and ought on this basis can be regarded as quite different. For the rational comprehensive approach, therefore, is and ought are separated, with ought coming prior to is. This would seem to support the view that “ought”-type judgments cannot be derived from “is”-type statements.</p>
<p>Consequently, prompted by the debates surrounding evidence-based policy, Faludi and Waterhout conclude, “there can be no question of evidence forming a self-evident, objective basis for action,” and then go on to say: “Rather, on methodological grounds it is clear that what is accepted as decisive evidence is a matter of choice, and as such is value-laden and political” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X11436347">2006</xref>, 9). In much current debate, stronger language would be used to describe the roles evidence and knowledge perform in the power games of policy making, suggesting hidden, exclusionary, or oppressive impacts. This moves the argument away from the logical flaws positivism finds in considering the link between is and ought, and moves into the territory of postpositivism and debates founded on the presumption that knowledge is socially constructed: there is no <italic>is</italic> and hence there ought not to be an <italic>ought</italic>.</p>
<p>From a postpositivist perspective, truth is contingent and hence knowledge about what <italic>is</italic> has no external point of validation. What is known about the world is dependent on the perspective of the individual (within his or her community), and thus the basis on which to distinguish the merits of one way of understanding the world from another is problematic. Many knowledge forms are therefore valid; hence issues of incommensurability result. For positivists there may be a question mark over the nature of the link between is and ought, but for postpositivists there is only a highly provisional world and hence the basis for determining what ought to be done is highly contestable. Further, an individual’s views are shaped by his or her life experiences and hence are part of one’s very identity. Consequently, if you criticize “my views,” you impinge on issues concerning my identity. Simon Blackburn’s reflection on how such arguments shape thinking about the relationship between observations and action includes an intriguing turn of phrase for planners:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We no longer have a rational hierarchy in which observations, as the foot-soldiers, bear information up to the staff who, using experience and reason, organize it and then, with the cooperation of values, generate plans for using it. We have disorderly muddle, in which everything has a say in everything else.

<p>The normative response to the questioning of truth has been to urge tolerance and the enabling of all within society to have voice. In planning this perspective would be perceived as influencing, if not directly reflected in, the communicative turn. The underlying presumption is that through the inclusion and political participation of vulnerable and marginalized groups in particular, the constraining power of governments and capital can be challenged. There is a logical contradiction both in the affirmation of the absence of truth—there <italic>is</italic> no <italic>is</italic>—and in the notion that all views have equal validity while arguing for recognition, inclusiveness, and tolerance—there <italic>ought</italic> not to be any <italic>ought</italic>. It is striking that few seem to acknowledge that “if the powerful can’t criticize the oppressed, because the central epistemological categories are inexorably tied to particular perspectives, it also follows that the oppressed can’t criticize the powerful” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0739456X11436347">Boghossian 2006</xref>, 130). The implications are far more profound than the semantics of intellectual argumentation. As Kwame Anthony Appiah asks, “What is this tolerance actually a tolerance of?” other than providing “a reason to fall silent” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0739456X11436347">2006</xref>, 31) and Gillian Rose talks of the dangers of “passivity beyond passivity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0739456X11436347">1996</xref>, 38). Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0739456X11436347">Sandel (2009)</xref> is similarly concerned that the move toward being nonjudgmental as a way of respecting difference is having a hugely negative impact on the capacity of policy makers to foster a justice of the common good.</p>
<p>Silence (or hypocrisy) also marks the willingness academics display to reflect on the nature of their own contributions. For it follows that were all knowledge of equal merit, what point would there be in academic research other than keeping academics in employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0739456X11436347">Furedi 2006</xref>)? Yet, inherent to the near theological attachment to peer review is a sense that “anything does not, and more profoundly should not, go.” Bernard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0739456X11436347">Williams (2002)</xref> explains this seeming contradiction by noting that the increasing suspicion of whether there is such a thing as truth has not been accompanied by a rejection of the qualities of truthfulness. The latter he defines in terms of sincerity and accuracy. Doubt may be cast on the nature of truth but as individuals we do not want to feel we have been fooled or deceived. However, “If you do not really believe in the existence of truth, what is the passion for truthfulness a passion for? . . . This is not an abstract difficulty or just a paradox. It has consequences for real politics, and it signals a danger that our intellectual activities, particularly in the humanities, may tear themselves to pieces” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0739456X11436347">Williams 2002</xref>, 2). (He might equally have mentioned the social sciences in the final sentence.)</p>
<p>Critical analysis can effectively deconstruct the workings of the state and capital but what next: more analysis and more interpretations? The technological capacity that has heralded the rise of the so-called information age has arrived into a depoliticized intellectual landscape, where a concern for action tends to be side-stepped.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0739456X11436347">13</xref></sup> Arguably, the academic community has created its very own Gordian knot, whereby more and more is known about less and less, and with less and less intellectual legitimacy or inclination to attempt to use such knowledge to change the world for the better.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0739456X11436347">14</xref></sup> Frank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0739456X11436347">Furedi (2006)</xref> refers to the contemporary impulse for “<italic>uncritical criticism</italic>” (italics as the original, 163). More than this, a normative sensibility is cast as illegitimate, conceived in terms of a rare mixture of naïveté or imposition, while in effect the equivocation of “anything goes” commands intellectual respectability. The capacity to discern the benign from the malign is placed out of reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X11436347">Appiah 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0739456X11436347">Tallis 1997</xref>). Raymond Tallis provocatively summarizes the current position as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>An attitude wavering between fatalism, cynicism and moral superiority may suit the purposes of humanist intellectuals who prefer the comfort of the seminar room to the relative discomfort of the places where the real work of bringing about a better future must take place.

<p>Some will challenge the starkness of the argument that has been presented and will point to instances where knowledge about how the world <italic>is</italic> has apparently been connected to decisions about what ought to be done. Connected may be, but only at some superficial level and probably not without failing to meet the demanding logics of the preceding arguments. Arguably such failure is inevitable as both the positivist and postpositivist positions are framed around a concern with <italic>analysis</italic>—understanding how the world is or might be interpreted—not from a concern with <italic>synthesis</italic>—how to arrive at judgments about how the world ought to be. Hence, regardless of tradition the result is the generation of more and more knowledge while failing to provide, and even denying the possibility and efficacy of developing, the intellectual apparatus through which knowledge might be linked to action. The analytical, while generating knowledge about the world, is in many ways not designed for the synthetic challenges involved in judgment and in determining the appropriate action to take. John Dewey recognized this challenge in 1927 when he first wrote <italic>The Public and Its Problems</italic>:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>For in its strict sense, knowledge can refer only to what <italic>has</italic> happened and been done. What is still <italic>to be</italic> done involves a forecast of a future still contingent, and cannot escape the liability to error in judgment involved in all anticipation of probabilities. . . . Here, only too conspicuously, is a limitation of the existing social sciences. Their material comes too late, too far after the event, to enter effectively into the formation of public opinion about the immediate public concern and what is to be done about it. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739456X11436347">1954</xref>, 178-79)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Consideration of what remains still to be done looks close to the essence of planning. Analysis may be able to inform the planning process but synthetic capabilities will be necessary as the basis for judgment about what ought to be done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0739456X11436347">Schön 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to reiterate that the broad context for this article’s argument remains public policy making and planning more particularly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0739456X11436347">15</xref></sup> Given this, a concern with deciding what ought to be done is framed in relation to people who are trying to share their lives with one another in particular places and hence are interdependent, not around individuals operating on their own.</p>

<title>The Analytical and the Synthetic: A Framework for Exploring the Knowledge–Action Interface</title>
<p>This section examines the key distinguishing qualities of analysis and synthesis. There is no intent to derive conclusions as to whether analytical or synthetic approaches are better or worse than one another—they are complementary—but rather to consider the strengths and limitations of each in relation to the underlying concerns of this article. In an effort to ground the subsequent discussion, it is first helpful to focus directly on the world of planning practice.</p>
<p>My interactions with planning practitioners and policy makers suggest that if anything they understand the issues raised by this article far better than the academic community, as these are matters of everyday practice. Numerous illustrative examples could be used, but nothing would come closer to capturing the essence and immense significance of the issues at stake than the following observation by a strategic planner in the course of a personal written exchange with me about something else. He states: “I lost several years in promoting urban ecology because the experts felt we needed a 10 year study to ‘prove’ the value of urban Greenspace! I feel that we need to rediscover the approach of Dr John Snow in stopping cholera in London (i.e. turn off the tap even though we do not have all the research to prove it).”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0739456X11436347">16</xref></sup> This passage stopped me in my tracks both for its clarity and profundity. It suggests that analysis can help to provide planners with supporting evidence. However, the essence of a more transformative planning is (or should be) about the much more synthetic qualities of arriving at the judgment that the tap actually needs to be turned off <italic>now</italic>. The qualities of analysis and synthesis hence merit further scrutiny.</p>
<p>The most obvious distinction between analysis and synthesis is that the former is reductive while the latter involves making a whole out of parts and as such is about rather more than a detailed understanding of the individual parts. Analysis requires problems to be broken down into separate components, which are then researched (most frequently) empirically to produce facts and/or interpretations. Positivist and postpositivist approaches delimit the boundaries of the problem very differently, but given the emphasis on empiricism the underlying intent is similar. In the latter case, a desire for more porous boundaries is accompanied by a concern not to transgress beyond one’s limited (and fragile) expertise, which is often now also linked to aspects of individual identity. In the world of analysis, therefore, the tendency is to foster ever-increasing specialization, encouraging the development of disciplinary, professional, cultural, and organizational subgroupings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0739456X11436347">MacIntyre 1990</xref>). An appreciation of the limits of knowledge is important but the analytical mode also provides justification (or excuses) for division and fragmentation and in turn risks “a parochial narrowness of vision” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0739456X11436347">Schön 1991</xref>, 60). This provides further reason to fall silent, as the specialists in one area deny the appropriateness of exceeding the boundaries of their specialism, even within the same discipline or profession: “. . .the replacement of the pursuit of Knowledge with a pragmatic focus on specialist micro-knowledges” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0739456X11436347">Furedi 2006</xref>, 52). This is justified for reasons ranging from the self-effacing and comforting to the self-serving and egotistical. The tendency toward specialization is manifest even in analyses that purport to be interdisciplinary, for while many disciplines may contribute, the individual strands of analysis remain isolated. In contrast, the world of the synthetic displays something of a cavalier approach to boundaries of any sort. The imperative to act overrides being precious about the niceties of potentially overstepping the mark, bringing with it the risk of insensitivity and failing to appreciate the limits of knowledge or the contextual constraints. In other words, there is the potential, if not inevitability, of imposition or seeming naïveté, for good and bad.</p>
<p>It follows from the preceding that while the results of analysis point to the complexity of the world, synthesis seeks clarity. Ignorance and oversimplification have little to commend them but there are dangers that if all that can be seen is complexity and uncertainty, then the ability to conceive of a better future becomes problematic, perhaps impossible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0739456X11436347">Lindblom and Cohen 1979</xref>). Moreover, determining what should be done becomes, at its most benign, well-intentioned guesswork, or more sinisterly the playing out of power games. As the quotation from Francis Fukuyama highlighted earlier, currently there is little intellectual respectability to be garnered from being an optimist about the potential for progressive change. Certainly the conclusions of synthesis can appear trite or obvious. But the ability of the best synthesis to find clarity in complexity, which may appear as “<italic>the</italic> obvious,” should be distinguished from the merely “trite.” The former lies at the heart of judgment and practical wisdom. Much analysis, in discovering that the world is complex and full of limits and constraints, denies the possibility of hope for a better future. Raising doubts about existing practices can be a precursor to change but only if the “so what?” question is addressed. This requires the link to normative concerns to be made from the start and hence to more synthetic qualities.</p>
<p>The concern of analysis with breaking down problems to produce facts or interpretations can also be expressed in terms of a concern with universals (in a positivist sense) <italic>or</italic> particulars (in a postpositivist sense). In contrast, the concern of synthesis is with the universal <italic>and</italic> the particular. In the case of analysis, the search for universal understandings or local particularities becomes the end of the process, whereas for synthesis the interlinking of universals and particulars is the starting point for further insight. For synthesis, universal concepts such as good and bad, or right and wrong, act as reference points against which the nature and significance of particularities can be assessed, and in turn provide the basis for judgment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0739456X11436347">17</xref></sup> This follows Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0739456X11436347">Walzer’s (1994)</xref> notion of thick and thin moral concepts. The need for a reference point (or universal or thin concepts) on which to judge what matters locally (particularities or thick concepts) becomes clearer in situations characterized by disagreement or conflict, such as is found in many planning or public policy contexts. There is little reason or incentive to grapple with matters of principle and questions of ethical values in the absence of contestation and an imperative to act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X11436347">Appiah 2006</xref>). It might be argued from a different starting point that disagreement reflects doubt about the appropriateness of existing ethical norms. However, the questioning of norms does not then require a retreat to the exclusivity of the local; rather it involves the synthetic qualities of making links between the universal and particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0739456X11436347">Rose 1992</xref>). Effective synthesis attempts to combine both the sensitivity of the insider and the clarity and detachment of the outsider. Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739456X11436347">Walzer (1985)</xref> embodies such notions in the idea of the “connected critic”: being both “one of us” and yet also able to distance oneself sufficiently to challenge the taken-for-granted.</p>
<p>It is worth dwelling on the notion of universals a little more as they remain a source of considerable unease within contemporary debates. A link is often made between universals and the worst outcomes of postwar modernist planning: the destruction of local communities and the dissection of urban centers by motorways. The synthetic concern with universals and particulars, while having a normative intent, implies the interlinking of the two as a basis for judgment about specific actions. This means that reference will need to be made to issues of ethical value, but that what should be done is determined in the light of the specifics of each situation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0739456X11436347">18</xref></sup> Furthermore, the nature of universals is often exaggerated in relation to matters of practical judgment, being viewed as fixed, permanent, and without exception. As Stephen Toulmin points out, Aristotelian notions of the universal correspond to English phrases such as “on the whole” or “generally,” hence: “in many situations, a universal is what holds good generally <italic>as distinct from</italic> quite invariably” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0739456X11436347">1998</xref>, 352, italics in original). Effective synthesis involves judging whether the situation in hand should be treated as exceptional.</p>
<p>Perhaps the distinction of greatest significance concerns the main emphasis of the underlying mode of thought: between the fundamental concern of analysis with <italic>explanation</italic> and for synthesis with <italic>reasoning</italic>. John Dewey’s quotation above is suggestive of this crucially important difference in approach. Explanation by its nature is backward looking: it attempts to provide insight into what and why certain events or outcomes have come about. In contrast, reasoning is forward looking: concerned to provide the basis for judgment, to justify what ought to be done, and determine which courses of action should be taken.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0739456X11436347">19</xref></sup> Reasoning certainly involves learning from past experiences but it is directed toward normative rather than explanatory ends. Kwame Anthony Appiah suggests: “Reasoning—by which I mean the public act of exchanging stated justifications—comes in not when we are going on in the usual way, but when we are thinking about change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X11436347">2006</xref>, 73). The link between reasoning and change is significant and underlines a concern with the normative. This is particularly important in relation to strategic planning, the essence of which is to create a future both different and better than would have happened in the absence of any planning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0739456X11436347">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Explanation cannot substitute for reasoning in deciding what ought to be done, but explanation is likely to contribute to reasoning and justification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739456X11436347">Appiah 2008</xref>). Reasoning is necessary to avoid decisions about what should be done resting merely on assertions. It is the reasoning behind the choice of action that matters, not the decision alone. Yet for anything barring the simplest of policy problems the process of reasoning is unlikely to prove conclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739456X11436347">Flathman 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0739456X11436347">Schön 1991</xref>). In contrast, as noted earlier, explanation may prove to be conclusive but fail to have anything authoritative to say, especially in a normative sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0739456X11436347">Lindblom and Cohen 1979</xref>). Hence there can be agreement over the analytical “facts” (although from a postpositivist perspective even this may be problematic) but not over their meaning and implications. Underlying the issue of conclusiveness is the important question of from where validity is derived. Analysis derives a capacity for conclusiveness from methodological rigor, essentially an internal quality known before the explanation is presented, while synthesis is dependent on the less robust qualities of reasonableness, which cannot be assessed prior to the presentation of reasons and, as it involves judgment, concerns matters of ethics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0739456X11436347">21</xref></sup> The implications of this are manifest in the peer review of research proposals within the social sciences, which necessarily favors analysis as only its qualities of methodological rigor can be assessed prior to the research being undertaken.</p>
<p>The less robust qualities of synthesis, in the sense of the means to validate the reasonableness of the conclusions drawn, implies far greater risks for those involved: you might be wrong, perhaps at best, you might be partially right. This also further confirms that imposition is inevitable. In such circumstances it takes confidence to be prepared to confront the inherent dangers, both to personal reputation as well as the potential for successful outcomes. Confidence is not a characteristic currently synonymous with contemporary planning practice, like much of the public policy sector and even the social sciences. This may be viewed as a good thing as the distances between confidence, overconfidence, and arrogance are not all that great. However, here lies the route to equivocation and inertia. Raymond Tallis talks of the need to find ways of “separating rational respect and concern from missionary fervour, moral superiority and patronising arrogance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0739456X11436347">1997</xref>, 369). Confidence can exist alongside humility and an acceptance of fallibility. Inequalities in the distribution of spatial opportunities will not be solved by a single policy intervention or for that matter by planning alone. The best that can be hoped for is that some improvement is achieved. Regardless of the actual outcomes, it is the preparedness to keep learning, which is the crucial buffer against unrestrained arrogance.</p>
<p>Overall, it is easier to describe analytical knowledge than the synthetic, which is in many respects mysterious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0739456X11436347">Schön 1991</xref>). Yet the findings of analysis, while providing explanations of past events, fail in the absence of synthesis to connect to issues of how things ought to be. The reasoning of synthesis cannot provide the certainty of being right or finding the good, but it is concerned with the search for something <italic>better</italic>. The final section explores the implications of the article’s argument.</p>

<sec id="section7-0739456X11436347">
<title>Implications and Conclusion: Still Planning to Change the World</title>
<p>The world <italic>is</italic> complex, uncertain, even chaotic, and inequalities and injustices abound; the question is, given such circumstances, what <italic>ought</italic> to be done? The link between knowledge and action is central to the theory and practice of planning, yet attempts to engage with more normative concerns soon become subject to critique for some combination of naïveté in the face of the powerful interests, or for exclusionary or imposing sentiments. Such critiques are important in challenging existing practices but they bring with them a fear to act. Passivity becomes less risky than action; knowledge generation a self-serving enterprise, whereby more and more knowledge is produced but with less and less aspiration or intent that it might contribute to creating a better world. Crucially also, for different reasons, both positivist and postpositivist intellectual positions deny the logic and/or efficacy of the link between knowledge and action. However, this argument only holds if the analytical is the only mode of thought.</p>
<p>The argument underlying this article is that the analytical has become too dominant and has as a consequence deflected attention away from the development of synthetic capabilities, the ability to reason, and to come to conclusions about what ought to be done. Synthesis is certainly no less intellectually demanding than analysis but it brings with it greater dangers and risks. To paraphrase the earlier quotation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0739456X11436347">Raymond Tallis (1997)</xref>: the choice is between the comfort of the seminar room (or the planning office) and the relative discomfort of the places where the real work of bringing about a better future must take place. Analysis alone may produce knowledge. But analysis needs synthesis to become meaningful and to have effect and impact in the world. So what are the implications of engaging in more synthetic approaches?</p>
<p>First, if planning is serious about the connection between knowledge and action then further consideration needs to be given to the nature of planning <italic>education</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0739456X11436347">22</xref></sup> How far is current planning education (and education within the social sciences more generally) developing the reasoning capabilities that underlie an ability to determine appropriate courses of action? It is not enough to be able to explain the failings of past policies and the nature of current constraints. Planners need to be able to connect knowledge to action, which is about synthesis. Research-led teaching has been an important development in pedagogy but it is crucial that the reductive qualities of analysis, which are inherent in empirical research, do not squeeze out or obscure the development of synthetic capabilities. There are also dangers that trends toward specialization reduce both educational and other opportunities for real connections to be made across disciplines and professions. Compartmentalizing expertise and knowledge may offer comfort to professionals and researchers, but social problems have little respect for the niceties of such boundaries. Moreover, in educational terms such an approach sells short the interests of students and future practitioners.</p>
<p>Second, an appreciation of the synthetic has implications for debates within <italic>planning theory</italic>. This article has only begun to scratch the surface of the nature of synthesis and related issues concerning reasoning and judgment. This requires far greater attention and, yes, even analysis. Currently, most research that examines policy making is retrospective in nature, variously highlighting conspiracies and/or the micropolitics of practice, with the aim of explaining why certain outcomes came about. More focus on the process of reasoning in real time might offer helpful insights into effective forms of synthesis—in other words, how knowledge can effectively change the world for the better.</p>
<p>Further to this, planning theorists need also to ask whether what was described earlier in the article as the “aha moment” of deconstruction is any longer intellectually adequate on its own. Is it enough, as much work within planning, simply to highlight the extent of existing constraints or the imposing and exclusionary nature of normative perspectives, without looking to the possibility of how things might be otherwise? Normative perspectives imply imposition; hence, to reveal such is both to say the obvious while also fostering passivity. Those responsible for the development of thinking around the “communicative turn” and the “just city” have made important contributions in attempting to link analytical and normative concerns. However, much more remains to be tackled. This will undoubtedly involve difficult debates and conversations over matters of normative ethics and judgment. The challenge is considerable but the practical implications even greater. It will involve not just the methodological rigor of analysis but the further development of the intellectual demands of reasoning inherent to synthesis. As creatures of peer review, academics have a large hand in establishing the institutions (formal and informal) of what is judged acceptable and truthful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0739456X11436347">Williams 2002</xref>). It may be time to ask: whose interests are being served by current academic institutions? It has to be hoped the answer is not simply, or mainly, the furtherance of academic careers.</p>
<p>Third, an appreciation of the importance of synthesis poses challenges for the relationship between academia and practice and for <italic>policy makers</italic> more specifically. Regardless of perspective, if the link between is and ought is problematic then perhaps existing practices with regards to the commissioning of research by policy makers need to be reexamined. Analysis rarely if ever determines what ought to be done. This is not to suggest that knowledge has no contribution to make. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0739456X11436347">Lindblom and Cohen (1979)</xref> point to the value for policy making of opening up spaces of interaction between researchers and policy makers. Currently, policy makers tend to commission research through a process of tendering for specific projects. A synthetic approach suggests the importance of prior engagement whereby policy makers and researchers might actively work together in framing the nature of the problem and hence in determining the forms of analysis, if any, that need to be undertaken. This approach would also suggest that rather than the completion of the analysis being the end of the interaction between researchers and policy makers, consideration of the implications becomes an ongoing process of mutual learning leading to normative outcomes. Synthesis requires both researchers and policy makers to engage in a process of <italic>translation</italic>: of acknowledging the limits and possibilities for analysis and of making informed judgments about what ought to be possible. Translation between research and practice is undoubtedly challenging and probably also asks questions of the way politics is currently conducted through the media. However, in the face of the tensions, divisions, and equivocation of the alternative, such challenges need to be confronted and embraced by both academics and policy makers.</p>
<p>Finally, the argument presented in this article suggests that it is long past time to review how far the social sciences (and hence planning) take seriously the question Stephen Toulmin considers should underpin such work: “On what conditions—social or cultural, intellectual or emotional, collective or individual—do we find human affairs going <italic>well or badly</italic> in practice? And how can we intervene in those conditions to help them go <italic>better rather than worse</italic>?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0739456X11436347">1998</xref>, 352, ital in original). Or going back to the comments of the planning practitioner quoted earlier: how do we come to the judgment that the tap needs to be turned off <italic>now</italic>?</p>

<p>The use of any terms to describe such groupings of intellectual ideas is inevitably problematic. For the purposes of this paper, the terms used are positivist and postpositivist, the former referring to more rationalist, absolutist, and essentialist understandings, the latter embracing social constructivist thinking about knowledge, which can be found in postmodern and poststructuralist perspectives. This distinction reflects the approaches adopted by, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X11436347">Appiah (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0739456X11436347">Blackburn (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0739456X11436347">Boghossian (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0739456X11436347">Tallis (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739456X11436347">Walzer (1985)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0739456X11436347">Williams (2002)</xref>, when exploring related questions.</p>
