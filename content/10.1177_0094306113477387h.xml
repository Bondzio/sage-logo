<p>Zachary P. Neal uses a structuralist, network-based approach to understand how cities work, addressing the patterns of relationships between people and places. The book provides a new way to make sense of cities and urban phenomena through a network perspective. Building the analysis on three levels of networks—micro-urban, meso-urban, and macro-urban—Neal demystifies networks and network analysis. He stresses that network analysis does not ignore contextual elements like culture because networks are the contexts. Looking at the <italic>measurable</italic> relations between people and cities, and between cities, he argues that we can overcome the misconception that studies on networks are mathematically complicated. This book illustrates networks’ simultaneous role as both a theory and a methodology.</p>
<p>The book is organized into three sections according to the scale of the networks and the level of analysis. Part I focuses on networks within cities at an everyday level, depicting personal social networks, the role of communities in modern city life, and the formation of subcultures and ethnic enclaves. Part II views the city itself as a living organism, whose functioning relies on a wide range of intersecting and overlapping networks such as infrastructure and social services. The macro-urban networks in three geographical domains—regional, national, and global—are investigated in the last section of the book, where Neal demonstrates the ways in which entire cities are linked to each other, within a world-city network.</p>
<p>Each chapter in this book includes both main text and method notes; given the reader’s interest in either theory or method, or both, it can be read in various ways. At the end of each chapter, Neal provides discussion questions and activities for classroom teaching. It will be useful to both undergraduate students and graduate students within and beyond sociology, including geography and political science.</p>
