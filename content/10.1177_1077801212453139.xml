<abstract>
<p>This research used logistic regression to test components of Choice and Lamke’s (1997) two-part decision-making model and Hamby’s (2008) holistic risk assessment as predictors of the decision to separate from an abusive partner, comparing significant predictors for immigrant (<italic>n</italic> = 497) and nonimmigrant (<italic>n</italic> = 808) women. Findings demonstrated that immigrant women reported higher levels of perceived risks/barriers to leaving, provided some support for the use of a holistic risk assessment in understanding women’s decisions to leave, and demonstrated that immigrant and nonimmigrant women have both similarities and differences in the factors that predict leaving. Clinical and policy implications are addressed.</p>

<p>Immigration rates have been on the rise in the United States since the passage of the Immigration Act in 1965 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077801212453139">Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 2006</xref>), and some have noted that the trends of increasing migration rates within the United States call for a closer examination of intimate partner violence (IPV) within immigrant families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801212453139">Denham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212453139">Erez &amp; Hartley, 2003</xref>). Prevalence of IPV has been found to be at least as high among many groups of immigrant women as among nonimmigrant women, and higher among some ethnic immigrant groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212453139">Bauer, Rodriguez, Szkupinski Quiroga, &amp; Flores-Ortiz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077801212453139">Klevens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212453139">Menjívar &amp; Salcido, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801212453139">Raj &amp; Silverman, 2002</xref>). Yet research into IPV in immigrant families has lagged behind research on the mainstream population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212453139">Menjívar &amp; Salcido, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077801212453139">Raj &amp; Silverman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077801212453139">Tran &amp; Des Jardins, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior research has suggested that in order to develop domestic violence frameworks that fit the experience of immigrant women researchers must examine similarities and differences in the experiences of immigrant and nonimmigrant women, rather than simply adding in factors that are assumed to be relevant for immigrant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212453139">Menjívar &amp; Salcido, 2002</xref>). The use of comparative reasoning to examine the experiences of immigrant and nonimmigrant women could contribute more to a theoretical understanding of domestic violence for all women, bringing with it a broader scope that would encompass all experiences, rather than a particular focus on the factors that are thought to specifically affect immigrant women. Without the ability to rigorously test the similarities and differences in experiences, we are left with a limited understanding of the implications regarding domestic violence in general. Most of the previous research seeking to understand the experiences of immigrant women in abusive relationships has consisted of exploratory studies of specific immigrant groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212453139">Abraham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212453139">Bhuyan, Mell, Senturia, Sullivan, &amp; Shiu-Thornton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212453139">Crandall, Senturia, Sullivan, &amp; Shiu-Thornton, 2005</xref>). Although these studies provide useful information, they have neither compared immigrant women to nonimmigrant women, nor examined the factors that predict immigrant women’s decision to leave an abusive relationship.</p>
<p>The purpose of the current study, therefore, is to use a comparative framework in a secondary analysis of a data set including both a substantial proportion of immigrant and nonimmigrant women, to examine the similarities and differences between groups in regard to the risks and barriers that predict leaving an abusive relationship. Although differences in experiences may exist between immigrant women from different cultural backgrounds, there are some experiences that are shared by many immigrant women, such as experiences of disenfranchisement and feelings of isolation stemming from relocating far from home, possible language barriers in access to services, and experiences of discrimination in interactions with social service and criminal justice systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077801212453139">Menjívar &amp; Salcido, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>The Decision to Stay or Leave an Abusive Relationship</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212453139">Choice and Lamke’s (1997)</xref> two-part decision-making model and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212453139">Hamby’s (2008)</xref> holistic risk assessment model were used to frame the study. By integrating many of the theoretical constructs brought to previous research on women’s stay/leave decisions (e.g., constructs stemming from the approaches of learned helplessness, reasoned action/planned behavior, investment model and psychological entrapment), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212453139">Choice and Lamke (1997)</xref> argued that in deciding whether or not to leave an abusive relationship, women ultimately examine the two questions of “Will I be better off?” and “Can I do it?” They posited that the decision-making process in answering the first question is influenced by a woman’s evaluation of her relationship satisfaction, her perception of irretrievable investments, her quality of alternatives, and her subjective norm. The current study used this model of a two-part decision-making process in deciding whether or not to leave an abusive partner; however, rather than examine the constructs identified in Choice and Lamke’s first part of the model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212453139">Hamby’s (2008)</xref> holistic risk assessment was used in the current study to define an additional set of considerations involved in answering this question. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212453139">Hamby’s (2008)</xref> holistic risk assessment suggested that, in addition to considering the risk of personal physical harm, women in abusive relationships who are considering leaving also weigh a number of risks, including the risk of harm to others, and the financial, social, and legal risks. This study tests the extent to which these types of risks are examined by immigrant and nonimmigrant women in their decision to leave.</p>
<p>In examining the second question, “Can I do it?” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212453139">Choice and Lamke (1997)</xref> posited that a woman examines the available resources and potential barriers to leaving. These resources and barriers may be personal (e.g., feelings of self-efficacy and feelings of control) or structural (e.g., access to money, employment, shelter, or other services). To investigate this part of the model, the current study examined personal and structural barriers for immigrant and nonimmigrant women, thus combining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212453139">Choice and Lamke’s (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212453139">Hamby’s (2008)</xref> models.</p>

<title>Studies of Holistic Risk Assessment Factors: Will I Be Better Off?</title>
<p>Because the concept of a holistic risk assessment is an emerging one, there is little empirical research in this area with either immigrant or nonimmigrant populations; however, the types of risks identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212453139">Hamby’s (2008)</xref> holistic risk assessment, particularly the risk of physical harm for women and others, have received empirical attention. Women’s perceptions of their risk for future physical harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801212453139">Cattaneo, Bell, Goodman, &amp; Dutton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212453139">Heckert &amp; Gondolf, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077801212453139">Weisz, Tolman, &amp; Saunders, 2000</xref>) and the risk of harm to children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212453139">Hilton, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077801212453139">McCloskey, Figueredo, &amp; Koss, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077801212453139">Zoellner et al., 2000</xref>) have been investigated with nonimmigrant populations and in studies that have not differentiated participants based on immigrant status, but have not been a focus of study for immigrant women specifically.</p>
<p>The financial risks of leaving have been identified in research with nonimmigrant study samples where abusers’ attempts to increase or maintain women’s economic dependence has been identified as a form of abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077801212453139">Moe &amp; Bell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077801212453139">Weaver, Sanders, Campbell, &amp; Schnabel, 2009</xref>). Research with immigrant women has focused on economic dependence resulting from immigration laws and policies that prevent them from working, and from abusers manipulating the immigration system in ways that perpetuate women’s economic dependence on partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212453139">Abraham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212453139">Bauer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212453139">Bhuyan et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous research with immigrant women has identified a number of social risks of leaving, including feeling disloyal to their culture or losing their cultural identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212453139">Dasgupta &amp; Warrier, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077801212453139">Tran &amp; Des Jardins, 2000</xref>), community sanction and stigmatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212453139">Crandall et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212453139">Dasgupta &amp; Warrier, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212453139">Sullivan, Senturia, Negash, Shiu-Thornton, &amp; Giday, 2005</xref>) and the risk of family breakup through the loss of access to their children or through separating children from their fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212453139">Dasgupta &amp; Warrier, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212453139">Kelly, 2009</xref>). Research with nonimmigrant women has also noted the social risk of family breakup or of losing or alienating children or depriving children of the benefits of a father (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077801212453139">Shalansky, Ericksen, &amp; Henderson, 1999</xref>), stigmatization and stereotyping by case managers or social service workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801212453139">Busch &amp; Wolfer, 2002</xref>), and the legal risk of “failure to protect” charges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801212453139">Busch &amp; Wolfer, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Research with immigrant women examining legal risk has focused on the risk of deportation for women themselves or other family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212453139">Latta &amp; Goodman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212453139">Sullivan et al., 2005</xref>). This is applicable to both documented and undocumented immigrants, as abusers may manipulate the immigration system, keeping women uninformed about immigration policies, or denying women access to their own immigration papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212453139">Crandall et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, individuals on temporary visas or with Lawful Permanent Residency can be subjected to deportation if they are convicted of a crime, including domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801212453139">Bui, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212453139">Erez &amp; Hartley, 2003</xref>). Thus, previous research has demonstrated that immigrant women consider the risk of deportation for an abuser in calling the police, as well as for themselves in the case of mandatory arrest policies, or if contact with authorities increases their vulnerability to child abuse charges.</p>

<title>Research on Barriers to Leaving: Can I Do It?</title>
<p>High levels of feelings of commitment and love as well as hope that the situation will improve are personal barriers that have been widely found to prevent women from ending a relationship with an abusive partner or seeking help through the social service or criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801212453139">Davis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801212453139">Dziegielewski, Campbell, &amp; Turnage, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212453139">Griffing et al., 2002</xref>). For immigrant women, commitment is often described as a desire to live up to a cultural ideal (e.g., being a “good wife” or a “good mother”) rather than as an emotional attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212453139">Dasgupta &amp; Warrier, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801212453139">Kelly, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212453139">Shiu-Thornton, Senturia, &amp; Sullivan, 2005</xref>). Other personal barriers to ending a relationship with an abusive partner identified in research with nonimmigrant women are self perceptions, particularly feelings of low self-esteem and an external locus of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212453139">Johnson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212453139">Kim &amp; Gray, 2008</xref>), and fear of repercussions from an abuser, especially the escalation of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212453139">Fleury, Sullivan, Bybee, &amp; Davidson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212453139">Kim &amp; Gray, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077801212453139">Wolf, Ly, Hobart, &amp; Kernic, 2003</xref>), though these barriers have not been a focus of research with immigrant women.</p>
<p>A lack of awareness of services has been noted as a structural barrier to leaving in research with both immigrant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212453139">Abu-Ras, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212453139">Keller &amp; Brennan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077801212453139">Moracco, Hilton, Hodges, &amp; Frasier, 2005</xref>) and nonimmigrant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077801212453139">Lutenbacher, Cohen, &amp; Mitzel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801212453139">O’Campo, McDonnell, Gielen, Burke, &amp; Chen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212453139">Short et al., 2000</xref>). Other structural barriers identified for both groups include experiences of discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212453139">Bauer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212453139">Latta &amp; Goodman, 2005</xref> with immigrant women; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077801212453139">Wolf et al., 2003</xref> with nonimmigrant women) and a lack of financial resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212453139">Bauer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212453139">Griffing et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077801212453139">Lutenbacher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077801212453139">Murdaugh, Hunt, Sowell, &amp; Santana, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212453139">Sullivan et al., 2005</xref> with immigrant women; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077801212453139">Wolf et al., 2003</xref> with nonimmigrant women). The current study included measures of age, employment status, and education because of their relation to survivors’ ability to earn income. Immigrant women have been reported to experience additional structural barriers, including language barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212453139">Bauer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212453139">Keller &amp; Brennan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212453139">Shiu-Thornton et al., 2005</xref>) and cultural beliefs and practices, such as beliefs in traditional gender roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212453139">Bauer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801212453139">Keller &amp; Brennan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212453139">Sullivan et al., 2005</xref>), that marital violence is normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212453139">Latta &amp; Goodman, 2005</xref>), beliefs that prohibit going outside of the family for help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801212453139">Abu-Ras, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212453139">Bhuyan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212453139">Shiu-Thornton et al., 2005</xref>), and practices that prevent women from going to school or obtaining employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212453139">Abraham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212453139">Bhuyan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212453139">Sullivan et al., 2005</xref>). Finally, research with nonimmigrant women has identified previous negative interactions with the criminal justice system as a structural barrier to leaving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801212453139">Fleury et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077801212453139">O’Campo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077801212453139">Wolf et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although research with nonimmigrant and immigrant populations has identified a variety of risks, as well as personal and structural barriers to leaving, research has not attempted to determine how these risks and barriers predict the decision to leave an abusive relationship for immigrant and nonimmigrant women. This analysis, therefore, focuses on two research questions. First, how do immigrant women compare to nonimmigrant women in the types of risks and barriers that influence leaving a relationship with a violent intimate partner? Second, how do these risks and barriers predict the decision to leave the relationship for immigrant and nonimmigrant women? These questions lead to the following hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list1-1077801212453139" list-type="simple">

<title>Data Collection and Sample</title>
<p>This study used the data set from the RAVE (Risk Assessment Validation) Study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801212453139">Campbell, O’Sullivan, Roehl, and Webster (2005)</xref>. The RAVE study was a multisite field test funded by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ 2000WTVX0011) to collect predictive validity data on two risk assessment instruments used by practitioners to assess the risk of IPV recidivism, and two methods used to assess the risk of lethality or near lethality and repeat offending. This data set was chosen because it includes data on IPV and participants’ country of origin, with nearly 40% of participants reporting foreign-born status.</p>
<p>Data were collected through structured interviews in New York City and Los Angeles County at two points in time; only Time One (T1) data are used for this analysis. Interviews were conducted in person or by telephone, and bilingual (Spanish/English) interviewers were available. In New York City, participants were recruited at the Family Courts of Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx; at domestic violence shelters and the Safe Horizon Community Offices in Brooklyn, Staten Island, the Bronx, and Queens; at one domestic violence shelter in Manhattan; and through four public hospitals. In Los Angeles, participants were recruited through the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department and one domestic violence shelter.</p>
<p>T1 interviews gathered information on demographic and background characteristics, the history of abuse in the relationship and over the past six months, any actions taken by the participant or the criminal justice system that could mitigate risk of future violence, the survivor’s assessment of risk, the affect of the questionnaire on perceived risk and on intention to take self-protective measures, and administered two risk assessment questionnaires. Questions about history of abuse in the relationship were taken from the Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077801212453139">Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, &amp; Sugarman, 1996</xref>), the Women’s Experience of Battering (WEB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801212453139">Hall-Smith, Smith, &amp; Earp, 1999</xref>), and the HARASS Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077801212453139">Sheridan, 1998</xref>). Measures of the risk of revictimization by the abuser were the DVSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077801212453139">Williams, 1999</xref>) and the K-SID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801212453139">Gelles, 1998</xref>), and measures of the risk of lethal assault by the partner were the Danger Assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801212453139">Campbell, 2007</xref>) and an adaptation of the DV-Mosaic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801212453139">De Becker &amp; Associates, 2000</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-1077801212453139">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>Thirty-eight percent of participants in the RAVE study were born outside of the United States, from a total of 58 countries. For those born outside of the United States, Mexico was the country of origin most frequently identified by participants, with 127 (25.87%) of the foreign-born participants originating from there, followed by 75 (15.27%) from the Dominican Republic, 37 (7.54%) from Jamaica, 30 (6.11%) from Ecuador, 28 (5.70%) from Puerto Rico, 23 (4.68%) from Guyana, 21 (4.28%) from Trinidad, and 14 (2.85%) from El Salvador. The remaining countries of origin were each represented by less than 10 participants. In addition, 53% of the sample was Latina/Hispanic; 47% of U.S.-born respondents were Latina/Hispanic and 64% of those born outside of the United States were Latina/Hispanic. Significantly more respondents born outside of the United States were Latina/Hispanic (χ<sup>2</sup> = 37.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Participant ages ranged from 18-67 years, with a mean of 31.1 years. Immigrant women were slightly older than nonimmigrant women on average (33.31 years versus 29.75 years). Less than half of the sample (43.8%) was employed full- or part-time. More immigrant women were employed full- or part-time (46.5%) than nonimmigrant respondents (42.3%). The highest education level completed also differed slightly between groups, with higher percentages of immigrant women at both extremes of this measure: More immigrant women had an 8th grade education or less (18.5%) than nonimmigrant women (1.5%), and more immigrant women were college graduates (8%) or had some graduate school (1.8%) than nonimmigrant women (6.8% and 1.4%, respectively). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077801212453139">Table 1</xref> summarizes key characteristics of the sample.</p>

<title>Relationship With Abuser</title>
<p>At the time of their interview, the majority of nonimmigrant (74%) and immigrant (69%) respondents indicated that they were no longer involved with their violent partner, although the proportion of immigrant women no longer involved with their partner was significantly lower for immigrant women (χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). That respondents were no longer involved with their violent partner makes sense given that many respondents were recruited at the family court and emergency domestic violence shelters. The U.S.-born and foreign-born samples also differed significantly in marital status (χ<sup>2</sup> [1] = 85.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); the majority of immigrant women indicated at the time of the interview that they were married (54.6%) and the majority of nonimmigrant women indicated that they were single (60.2%). Finally, the mean number of children in respondents’ households was 1.82 for the total sample, with a nonsignificant mean difference between nonimmigrant (<italic>M</italic> = 1.76) and immigrant women (<italic>M</italic> = 1.90).</p>

<sec id="section8-1077801212453139">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>As a survivor’s perception of risk has a more direct affect on individual decision making than do indicators of risk, risk for physical harm was measured with the question: How likely is it that your partner will be physically abusive with you in the next year? Respondents could answer on a scale of likelihood (ranging from 0 = no chance to 10 = sure it will happen). The risk of harm to others was measured by the question: How frequently in the past six months has your partner threatened to hurt your children, family, or someone you care about? Respondents could answer on scale of frequency (ranging from 1 = <italic>never</italic> to 5 = <italic>very frequently</italic>). Financial risk was measured by partner’s current employment status. If the partner was (1) Employed, the survivor was considered at greater financial risk if she left than if the partner was (0) Unemployed. It should be noted that a survivor’s own employment status was not included in the risk models as it was not conceptualized as a risk (something that she would lose access to in leaving, as with her partner’s employment income and benefits), but rather as a barrier, and thus was included in the barriers model. Social risk was measured by the question: Do you fear that your partner will take the children away from you or gain custody of them? Respondents could answer on a scale of intensity (ranging from 0 = <italic>not afraid</italic>, to 2 = <italic>very afraid</italic>). Legal risk was measured by the question: How often in the past six months has your partner threatened to report you to child protective services, immigration, or other authorities? Again, respondents could answer on a scale of frequency (ranging from 1 = <italic>never</italic> to 5 = <italic>very frequently</italic>).</p>
<p>Legal commitment to the relationship was measured with the question: What is your legal married status? Respondents had the options of married, single, separated or divorced, and this was recoded into low legal commitment (<italic>single, separated, divorced</italic> = 0) and high legal commitment (<italic>married</italic> = 1). Fear of the abuser was measured by the degree of respondents’ agreement with the WEB item: He can scare me without ever laying a hand on me. Respondents could answer on a scale of agreement (ranging from 1 = <italic>strongly agree</italic> to 6 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>); responses were reverse coded with a higher number indicating higher fear. Similarly, feeling controlled by the abuser was measured by respondents’ agreement with the WEB item: He makes me feel like I have no control over my life, no power, no protection. Respondents could again answer on a scale of agreement (ranging from 1 = <italic>strongly agree</italic> to 6= <italic>strongly disagree</italic>), with responses reverse coded so that a higher number indicated higher levels of feeling controlled by an abuser. Age was measured in continuous years. Employment status was measured with the question: What is your current employment situation? It was constructed as a dichotomous variable (0 = <italic>unemployed</italic>; 1 = <italic>employed</italic>). Education level was measured by the question: What is the highest level of education you have completed? Respondents responded on an ordinal (1-6) scale from (1) <italic>eighth grade or less to (6) graduate school</italic>. Finally, social isolation was measured by the question: Has he tried to prevent you from going to school, getting job training, or learning English? This was a dichotomous variable (0 = <italic>no</italic>; 1 = <italic>yes</italic>).</p>
<p>The dependent variable in this study is the act of physical separation. This variable was measured with the question: In the past six months have you gone someplace where he couldn’t find you or see you? This was a dichotomous variable (0 = <italic>no</italic>; 1 = <italic>yes</italic>). The act of physically separating is a behavioral indicator of survivors’ ability or willingness to leave an abusive partner, and may be a stronger indicator of leaving than the intent or desire to leave; however, it has some limitations as a measure of permanently leaving a relationship. Leaving a relationship can be a difficult variable to capture, as research has shown that the process of ending a relationship may include repeated attempts to leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801212453139">Griffing et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801212453139">Johnson, 1992</xref>). It is possible that women decided to return to their relationship after this separation; therefore, this question captures a physical separation at one point in time, and independent variables are factors related to this particular physical separation or attempt to leave the relationship.</p>
<p>Immigrant status was measured by the question: Were you born in the United States? Respondents could answer (0) <italic>no</italic> or (1) <italic>yes</italic> to this question. It is important to note that this dichotomous variable does not allow for variations in immigration experiences based on country of origin, length of time in the United States, or type of immigrant/visa status.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1077801212453139">
<title>Methods of Analysis</title>
<p>Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using SPSS. As previous research with immigrant women has been unable to test the significance of differences between immigrant and nonimmigrant women, the first hypothesis regarding significant differences in risks and barriers between immigrant and nonimmigrant women was tested using <italic>t</italic>-tests and chi-square statistics. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to test hypotheses 2-4 regarding how specific types of risks and barriers predicted immigrant and nonimmigrant women’s decision to separate from an abusive partner. Risks and barriers were investigated in different models because the questions of “Will I be better off?’ and “Can I do it?” were conceived as separate questions. After an initial logistic regression analysis indicated that immigration status was a significant predictor of physical separation, separate models for risks and barriers were constructed for immigrant and nonimmigrant women (four models total).</p>

<title>Differences Between Groups: Will I Be Better Off?</title>
<p>As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077801212453139">Table 2</xref>, immigrant women were significantly less likely to have gone somewhere their partner could not find them in the past six months, and perceived significantly greater risk on the following variables: personal physical harm, social risk, and legal risk. Immigrant women also faced more financial risk than nonimmigrant women, as measured by their partner’s employment status. There were no differences between groups in perceived harm to others. Although effect sizes were small (<italic>r</italic> &lt; .2), these findings support hypothesis 1, that immigrant women face greater financial, social, and legal risks than do nonimmigrant women. In addition, although differences between groups in perceived personal physical harm were not hypothesized, findings also suggest that immigrant women perceived a greater risk in this area than nonimmigrant women.</p>

<p>Also demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077801212453139">Table 2</xref>, there were significant differences between immigrant and nonimmigrant women in their barriers to leaving. On average, compared to nonimmigrant women, immigrant women had a greater legal commitment to their relationship, felt more controlled by their abusive partner, were more afraid of their abusive partner, were older, had completed less education, and were more socially isolated by their abusive partner.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801212453139">Table 3</xref> provides the results of the two logistic regression models predicting the likelihood of leaving for immigrant and nonimmigrant women based on the types of perceived risks, including the risk of personal physical harm, the risk of harm to others, and the financial, social, and legal risks. The regression models were completed in two blocks—the first included only the risk of personal physical harm, and the second included all of the risk variables—to determine whether or not the predictive ability of the model would be improved by the addition of risks over and above the risk of personal physical harm.</p>

<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801212453139">Table 3</xref> shows, for immigrant women, Block 1 appeared to explain none of the variance in the decision to separate from a violent partner. The risk of personal physical harm was not predictive of the likelihood of leaving for immigrant women and the overall percentage of cases classified correctly from Block 0 to Block 1 remained the same (70.5%). When other types of perceived risks were added to the model in Block 2, 5% of the variance in immigrant women’s decision to leave was explained, a significant improvement over the first block (χ<sup>2</sup> (4) = 13.66, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01); however, the overall percentage of cases classified correctly remained at 70.5%. In the second block, the variables that significantly predicted the likelihood of leaving for immigrant women were risk of harm to others (<italic>OR</italic> = 1.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and financial risk (<italic>OR</italic> = 1.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). These results indicated that immigrant women were more likely to separate as the risk of harm to others increased, and as the financial risk of leaving increased.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077801212453139">Table 3</xref> also shows the results for nonimmigrant women, for whom Block 1 explained 3% of the variance in the dependent variable; as the risk of personal physical harm increased, nonimmigrant women were more likely to leave the relationship (<italic>OR</italic> = 1.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The model in the first block correctly classified 60.3% of cases overall, compared to 59.2% for Block 0. This pattern contrasts with the finding for immigrant women, as the risk of personal physical harm was not predictive of their leaving and did not result in any improvement in the percentage of cases classified correctly. As with immigrant women, when the additional perceived risks were added to the model in Block 2, the percentage of variance explained by the model increased significantly to 7% (χ<sup>2</sup> (4) = 20.50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and this model resulted in 62.2% of cases being correctly classified overall. In the second block, the variables that significantly predicted the likelihood of leaving for nonimmigrant women included the risk of personal physical harm (<italic>OR</italic> = 1.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and risk of harm to others (<italic>OR</italic> = 1.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), indicating that nonimmigrant women were more likely to leave as the risk of personal physical harm and harm to others increased; in contrast with immigrant women, other risk variables were not significant.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 2, which proposed that the ability to predict the likelihood of leaving would be significantly improved by the inclusion of additional perceived risks was supported for both immigrant and nonimmigrant women. Hypothesis 3, that the financial, social, and legal risks of leaving would be stronger predictors of leaving for immigrant women than for nonimmigrant women, receives partial support as the financial risk was significantly predictive for immigrant women, although none of these risks was predictive of leaving for nonimmigrant women. In addition, the model in the second block for immigrant women correctly classified 70.5% of cases overall, compared to 62.2% for the model in the second block for nonimmigrant women.</p>

<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1077801212453139">Table 4</xref> shows, for immigrant women, Block 1 explained 10% of the variance in leaving. The personal barriers of legal commitment to the relationship (<italic>OR</italic> = .55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and fear of the abuser (<italic>OR</italic> = 1.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) significantly predicted the likelihood of leaving for immigrant women, indicating that immigrant women with low legal commitment to the relationship and greater fear of their abusive partner were more likely to leave. However, the overall percentage of cases classified correctly remained unchanged from Block 0 to Block 1 at 69.9%. In contrast, Block 2 correctly classified 71.9% of cases overall and explained 17% of the variance in leaving, representing a significant improvement over the first block (χ<sup>2</sup> (4) = 28.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In the second block, variables that significantly predicted the likelihood of leaving for immigrant women were legal commitment (<italic>OR</italic> = .64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), fear of their abusive partner (<italic>OR</italic> = 1.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), age (<italic>OR</italic> = .96, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), education (<italic>OR</italic> = 1.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and employment (<italic>OR</italic> = .50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Immigrant women were more likely to leave an abusive relationship if they were single, more afraid of their abusive partner, younger, had more education, and were unemployed.</p>
<p>For nonimmigrant women, Block 1 explained 11% of the variance in leaving and, in this block, feeling controlled by their abusive partner is predictive of nonimmigrant women’s likelihood of leaving (<italic>OR</italic> = 1.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). This model classified 62.2% of cases correctly overall, compared to 57.3% of cases overall in Block 0. These results are different from the results for immigrant women, for whom legal commitment and fear were predictive; for nonimmigrant women, the likelihood of leaving is increased if they felt more controlled by their abusive partner. As with immigrant women, the percentage of variance explained by the model increased significantly, to 18% of the variance, with the inclusion of structural barriers (χ<sup>2</sup> (4) = 45.47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and the overall percentage of cases classified correctly increased to 67.5%. Once structural barriers were included in the model, variables that were predictive of nonimmigrant women’s likelihood of leaving included feeling controlled by their abusive partner (<italic>OR</italic> = 1.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), age (<italic>OR</italic> = .97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and employment (<italic>OR</italic> =.39, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Nonimmigrant women were more likely to leave an abusive relationship when they felt more controlled by their abusive partner, were younger, and unemployed.</p>
<p>Thus, hypothesis 4, that personal and structural barriers would indeed act as barriers, decreasing women’s likelihood of leaving an abusive relationship, receives only partial support. For immigrant women, legal commitment, age, and education acted as barriers, as survivors with higher legal commitment, who were older and who had less education were less likely to leave. For nonimmigrant women, this was only true for age, as those who were older were less likely to leave. However, this relationship was opposite of what was hypothesized for the remaining significant barriers to leaving, so that immigrant women were more likely to leave when they felt more fear and were unemployed, and nonimmigrant women were more likely to leave when they felt more controlled and were unemployed.</p>

<p>In keeping with previous descriptions of immigrant women’s unique needs and increased vulnerabilities in relationships with violent men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212453139">Abraham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801212453139">Erez &amp; Hartley, 2003</xref>), the current analysis found that immigrant women reported higher perceived risks and barriers to leaving an abusive relationship in comparison to nonimmigrant women. Comparisons between groups in this analysis found that immigrant women reported higher risks in the areas of personal physical harm, social and legal risks, and financial risk (as their partners were more likely to be employed) than did nonimmigrant women. In addition, immigrant women faced higher barriers to leaving a violent relationship in terms of being more likely to be married, reporting higher levels of fear of and feeling controlled by an abuser, were older, had less education, and were more likely to be socially isolated by their abusive partner. Small effect sizes indicated that differences between groups may not translate into large meaningful differences in experiences, and this may help to explain why some of these factors (e.g., social and legal risks, social isolation) did not predict immigrant women’s leaving, despite the higher reported levels of these variables.</p>

<title>Key Findings: Predictors of Leaving</title>
<p>Results of these analyses indicated partial support for a holistic risk assessment, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801212453139">Hamby’s (2008)</xref>, and for examining risks and barriers separately for immigrant and nonimmigrant women’s leaving. Differences between groups may indicate different needs that immigrant and nonimmigrant women have in services for IPV, whereas similarities would suggest that, for both groups, additional risks over and above the risk of personal physical harm, inform women’s decision making. What may be most striking was the finding that immigrant women’s perception of the risk for future physical harm was not predictive of their leaving, whereas nonimmigrant women were more likely to leave their relationship when their perception of this risk was higher. These findings support previous research with nonimmigrant women showing that when women perceived their risk of future harm to be elevated, they took steps to mitigate that risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801212453139">Heckert &amp; Gondolf, 2004</xref>). As previous research with immigrant women has not addressed their perceptions of the likelihood of future harm, the finding in the current study that these perceptions were <italic>not</italic> predictive of the decision to leave is informative.</p>
<p>Both groups of women were more likely to leave when the risk of harm to others was higher. Again, this risk has not been a focus of research with immigrant women, but previous research with nonimmigrant women in domestic violence shelters found that one reason survivors offered for leaving was fear for their children’s physical safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801212453139">Hilton, 1992</xref>). Of the remaining holistic risk assessment factors, only financial risk, measured in terms of partner’s employment status, was significant and only for immigrant women. The findings of this study contrast with previous research with immigrant women, where partner’s employment has been noted as a factor that may keep them in a relationship with a violent man given the difficulty that immigrant women face in finding employment for themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212453139">Abraham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801212453139">Bauer et al., 2000</xref>). This contradiction may be accounted for by the fact that previous research included in-depth qualitative studies that sought to understand women’s experiences of abuse and, even though participants talked of economic dependence, these studies did not treat this variable as a predictor of separation. Moreover, this finding may need to be examined in the context of legal immigration status. For immigrant women in this sample, it may be that partner employment is in some way related to legal immigration status; therefore, being more likely to leave when a partner is employed may be an indication of being more enfranchised, having more access to services, and having less fear of involving outsiders. A relationship between partner employment status and immigration status may explain why this risk was predictive of immigrant women’s leaving, but not predictive of nonimmigrant women’s leaving.</p>
<p>The final risk factors, the social and legal risks to leaving, were not predictive of immigrant or nonimmigrant women’s leaving. Although research with immigrant women has documented their social and legal vulnerabilities when leaving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801212453139">Crandall et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077801212453139">Latta &amp; Goodman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077801212453139">Sullivan et al., 2005</xref>), the findings here did not suggest that these vulnerabilities were significant predictors of leaving. These findings may differ from those of previous studies because the latter did not empirically test these types of risks as predictors of separation. Or it may be that measures of social and legal risks in this analysis did not capture all of the components of these risks, such as stigmatization and loss of cultural identity within the category of social risk, due to the constraints of measurement in secondary analysis.</p>
<p>The results of this analysis further suggested that barriers were more important than risks in predicting women’s decisions to separate from a violent partner, as more variance was explained for both immigrant and nonimmigrant women by barriers than by risks. Consistent with previous research findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212453139">Dasgupta &amp; Warrier, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212453139">Shui-Thornton et al., 2005</xref>), immigrant women in this study were more likely to leave if their legal commitment to the relationship was low. However, legal commitment was not predictive of nonimmigrant women’s leaving in contrast to previous studies that have identified commitment, measured more broadly in terms of emotional commitment, as a barrier to leaving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077801212453139">Rusbult &amp; Martz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212453139">Short et al., 2000</xref>). The finding that legal commitment was a barrier for immigrant women may be indicative of the ways in which social norms or pressures to be “a good wife” keep immigrant women from leaving relationships with violent men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801212453139">Dasgupta &amp; Warrier, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077801212453139">Shiu-Thornton et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>There were other results with respect to barrier variables that contradicted previous research findings. For immigrant women, increased fear of an abuser increased their likelihood of leaving, whereas for nonimmigrant women, increased feelings of being controlled by an abuser predicted a greater likelihood of leaving. Although previous research would suggest that women would be less likely to leave at higher levels of these variables, these contradictions may stem from measurement differences as previous research studied fear of repercussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077801212453139">Short et al., 2000</xref>) and internal locus of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212453139">Kim &amp; Gray, 2008</xref>), rather than general feelings of fear of an abusive partner or feeling controlled by him. The difference between groups is interesting to note here, with increased fear being predictive of immigrant women’s leaving, and increased feelings of being controlled being predictive of nonimmigrant women’s leaving. Previous research has not identified this kind of difference between these two variables, nor suggested any reasons why one of these variables would be more predictive for one group rather than the other. One possibility for this difference between groups may have to do with cultural beliefs surrounding control; it may be that because of cultural beliefs, immigrant women have different expectations regarding control, with control being less important in their decision making. Future research would be helpful to understand the implications of these findings.</p>
<p>In addition, findings from previous research that indicated that social isolation increased immigrant women’s risk of violence and prevented their leaving due to restricted access to employment or educational resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801212453139">Abraham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801212453139">Bhuyan et al., 2005</xref>) were not upheld in this study. Social isolation was not predictive of either immigrant or nonimmigrant women’s leaving. Similarly, immigrant and nonimmigrant women were both more likely to leave if they were unemployed, contradicting some previous research with both groups. This discrepancy could be attributed to measurement differences, as previous studies identified economic dependence as a concern without testing it as a predictor of leaving, or because other measures of economic independence, such as access to informal income or welfare assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077801212453139">Kim &amp; Gray, 2008</xref>) were included. However, this analysis included other structural barriers that may relate to the ability to earn income, and found that women were more likely to leave when these variables indicated a greater possibility of earning income. For instance, findings suggested that both groups were more likely to leave when they were younger, and immigrant women were more likely to leave when they had more education. It may be that younger women are more likely to leave because they have more income earning potential, or more flexibility in looking for employment. Alternatively, age could be related to other factors that would make leaving more likely when women are young, such as being less likely to have children or having more alternatives in forming relationships with other partners. In addition, for immigrant women, increased education could be indicative of more comfort or familiarity with the English language, and this may be one reason why it was significant for immigrant women but not for nonimmigrant women.</p>

<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>Conducting a secondary analysis of a preexisting data set placed constraints on the ways in which some of the components of the holistic risk assessment and the personal and structural barriers could be measured. This was particularly true with the measure of social risk as it did not capture elements such as social stigmatization and affect on social identity; with the measure of immigrant status as it did not account for variations in acculturation, or length of residency; and with the measure of leaving, as it was limited to one act of physical separation at one point in time. An additional limitation is that a large proportion of the sample was Latina/Hispanic and, therefore, these results are not necessarily independent of cultural background. However, Latina/Hispanic immigrant participants were not a homogeneous group, as they came from countries in Mexico, Central and South America, Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, indicating the presence of some diversity of experiences based on countries of origin, or differences in cultural beliefs based on nationality or region.</p>
<p>A final limitation of this study is that the sample was made up of primarily help-seeking survivors, as participants were recruited from courts, law enforcement, and domestic violence shelters. Results may therefore be skewed toward those women who seek help, many of whom were doing so as part of a process of leaving. It may be that such a small amount of variance was explained in each of the regression models because access to information about barriers from women who have not shown a tendency toward seeking help is absent from this data set.</p>
<p>These limitations may be offset by some of the strengths offered by this analysis. One of the strengths of this study is that immigrant and nonimmigrant women were compared with respect to leaving an abusive relationship. Findings suggest that differences do exist between these groups and that it is important to conduct such comparisons to shed light on factors that influence immigrant and nonimmigrant women’s process of leaving. An additional strength was the use of a large data set that allowed for the testing of relationships between risks, barriers, and physical separation. Previous research, particularly with immigrant women, has described these concerns, but has not tested their affect on leaving. For both immigrant and nonimmigrant women, factors previously assumed to be barriers to or risks of leaving did not always prevent women from leaving. A picture of women making choices and taking action based on their own and their children’s best interests emerges and calls into question previous theories or assumptions that may have cast women in a more passive light.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1077801212453139">
<title>Future Research</title>
<p>A number of areas for future research can be identified from the findings of the current study. First, following from the finding that the risk of future physical harm did not predict immigrant women’s leaving, future research should explore perceptions of risk more fully with immigrant women, exploring both the accuracy of their estimation of future risk and their threshold level for when future risk becomes high enough to prompt leaving or other help-seeking behaviors. In addition, future research to investigate the components of a holistic risk assessment would be beneficial, particularly if those studies employed more standardized measures to capture risks and barriers, or used a sample without a bias toward help-seeking. Some components of a holistic risk assessment were predictive of leaving; however, given that the percentage of variance explained by all models remained small, there were clearly many other factors that women considered when making these decisions. Future research to identify other factors, perhaps by adding those factors typically studied with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801212453139">Choice and Lamke’s (1997)</xref> model, would also be helpful. Finally, to further understand some of the contradictions with previous findings, particularly with regard to the barrier variables, longitudinal mixed methods studies to examine the factors that women identify as important in their decision-making process at different points in the leave-taking process would be helpful. The factors that women have identified in qualitative research as important concerns may not be the factors that predict their decision to leave. It would be very interesting to examine more closely the process of leaving to determine what types of supports can be provided based on certain demographic characteristics, and how decisions about leaving—even in the face of difficulty—are made.</p>

<title>Clinical and Policy Implications</title>
<p>The findings of this study indicated that women considered a wide range of factors in separating from a violent partner, and immigrant women may have considered these factors differently than nonimmigrant women. As immigration rates rise and advocates find themselves working with more immigrant women, they might find the need to pay more attention to the specific areas of partner employment status, marital status, fear, and education level, as well as legal immigration status, and the ways in which these factors affect immigrant women’s decision making. In addition, recognizing that immigrant women were not more likely to leave when their perceived risk of personal physical harm was higher is important and may indicate that more safety planning, or a different type of safety planning, is required in advocacy with them.</p>
<p>Findings also indicated that both immigrant and nonimmigrant women left their relationships despite facing high levels of barriers. These findings suggest the need for an expanded view of what women may need once they leave. In addition to needing space that allows them physical safety, women would also benefit from job training programs and employment search assistance; for immigrant women, English language services and immigration help are also important. Both groups of women appeared strongly motivated by an increased risk of harm to others. Women who leave and those who chose to stay would benefit from service providers who were keenly aware of women’s concerns about their children and the way these concerns inform their decisions about leaving their relationship. Although this research found differences between immigrant and nonimmigrant women in regard to some factors, it also points to areas of similarity, and for both groups, it highlights the complexity of the issues involved in the process of separating from a violent partner.</p>
