<abstract>
<p>This analysis of 83 scoring rubrics and grade definitions from writing programs at U.S. public research universities captures the current state of the struggle to define and measure specific writing traits, and it enables an induction of the underlying theoretical construct of “academic writing” present at these writing programs. Findings suggest that writing specialists have managed to permeate U.S. first-year writing assessment with certain progressive assumptions about writing and writing instruction, but they also indicate critical areas for revision, given such documents’ critical gatekeeping role at postsecondary institutions. The study also raises a broader question about the difficulties of rhetorically constructing “writing ability” in a way that is consistent with the contextualist paradigm dominant in contemporary writing studies.</p>

<p>Researchers in writing studies have found writing standards operating in many sites, not just educational institutions: novice social workers internalizing the rules of case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741088312466992">Paré, 1993</xref>), new accountants struggling with the conflicting cultural conventions of the client letter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741088312466992">Devitt, 1991</xref>), an engineer revising an intern’s work while admitting not knowing <italic>why</italic> the standard was the way it was (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0741088312466992">Winsor, 2001</xref>, p. 18), citizens protesting a neighborhood development compelled to take up a genre system that changes the very frame of their protest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0741088312466992">Turner, 2002</xref>, p. 300), among many others. Still, it is in educational institutions that most readers and writers first encounter a version of their language explicitly presented as official and legitimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741088312466992">Bourdieu, 1991</xref>, p. 48); it is also true that those descriptions tend to rhetorically construct as general that which is <italic>particular</italic> and <italic>local</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741088312466992">Balester, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0741088312466992">Poe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0741088312466992">Slevin, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>This study of a corpus of documents used to describe and assess academic writing in first-year composition (FYC) courses at U.S. public research universities maps their descriptions of specific features (or “traits”) of student writing across their descriptions of the ability levels (or “performance categories”) that students can achieve—or fail to achieve—in coursework designed to introduce them to the conventions of academic writing. For FYC teachers and their students, these documents mediate high-stakes moments in the ongoing maintenance of the “standard” in academic writing conventions. As will be seen, there is much to admire in these documents’ attempts to define writing traits and performance categories (especially when compared to scales developed before the emergence of writing studies), and this study finds evidence of progress toward a more valid construct of the complexities of writing than those that circulated during the “preprocess” and “static abstraction” eras. However, this analysis will also lend empirical support to concerns about construct validity in writing assessment, as granular analyses of the nouns, verbs, and modifiers that dominate each performance level of each trait find several questionable operating assumptions in the construction of academic writing ability at all levels (but especially at performances constructed as “below average”). It will also be clear that these documents routinely efface the labor of student writers and the role of readers who use these documents to arrive at consequential decisions about the students who produce that writing.</p>
<p>After some brief historical context, a description of the assembly and coding of the corpus will be explained. Results from analyses of the resulting database are reported, analyses that have made it possible to induce the theoretical construct of academic writing that FYC programs in U.S. public research universities appear to be enacting. This is a baseline empirical analysis that locates and considers recurrent patterns of language choices and is intended to support efforts to design and field-test a critical-descriptive assessment vocabulary that can enable appraisals of student writing in U.S. FYC that are more consistent with the sociocultural/contextualist construct of writing that is dominant in the writing research community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741088312466992">Behizadeh &amp; Englehard, 2011</xref>). On those appraisals rest not only the well-documented social consequences of success or failure in FYC but also the construct of “legitimate” or “standard” writing that students will carry into their future classes, their workplaces, and their private and civic lives.</p>

<title>Writing That Scales Writing</title>
<p>Little is known about how scales themselves are composed, and few field-tested recommendations for scaling performance categories exist as of this writing. In the latest edition of <italic>Educational Measurement</italic>, the authors responsible for the chapter “Setting Performance Standards” concede that the topic has received little attention, and they emphasize the need for thoughtful research on meaningful performance category descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741088312466992">Hambleton &amp; Pitoniak, 2006</xref>, p. 453; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741088312466992">Knoch, 2011</xref>, p. 90). Yet scale design is a critical factor in raters’ perception of writing ability, as evident in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741088312466992">Mills and Jaeger’s (1998)</xref> study of the effect of changing performance category definitions. Raters who used a rubric that was specific about what students had to do to achieve a particular category scored more generously than those who did not, a finding that suggests that the specificity enhanced the raters’ ability to recognize and reward a broader range of approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741088312466992">Mills &amp; Jaeger, 1998</xref>, pp. 82-83).</p>
<p>What <italic>is</italic> well known is that scales tend to rhetorically construct local performance categories as universal descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741088312466992">Brindley, 1998</xref>, p. 144), likely because their function has always been to counteract readers’ varied responses to student writing. Rater-borne variance in scoring (i.e., poor interreader agreement on scores and single-rater “drift” over time) has been a serious concern since the first part of the 20th century (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0741088312466992">Thorndike, 1911</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741088312466992">Hillegas, 1912</xref>). The rise of psychometrics and an increasing awareness of evaluative subjectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741088312466992">Connors, 1997</xref>, p. 152) have left hundreds of scales preserved in the amber of JSTOR that remain useful for throwing current assumptions about text evaluation into sharper relief. For example, the 1940 grade definitions to be found in “English 1: Aims and Methods,” a document recently unearthed<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0741088312466992">1</xref></sup> at the University of Texas, Austin, employ a distinct rhetoric of connoisseurship (e.g., “naturalness of movement,” “doubtful proportions”; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741088312466992">Figure 1</xref>) that grounds the appraisal in the reader’s <italic>taste</italic>.</p>

<p>A thorough history of the long move away from connoisseurship and toward more precise measurement of specific traits such as “organization” is not possible here (but for this, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741088312466992">Elliot, 2005</xref>). Space does permit a few glimpses from landmark studies necessary for context: In <italic>Factors in Judgments of Writing Ability</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741088312466992">Diederich, French, and Carlton (1961)</xref> asked the readers they had assembled to score 300 student papers and “use whatever hunches, intuitions, or preferences you normally use in deciding one piece of writing is better than another” (p. 11). Only 6 years later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741088312466992">Follman and Anderson (1967)</xref> characterized a scale as a means to organize raters’ perceptions and direct their values (pp. 198-199), and by the time of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741088312466992">S. W. Freedman’s (1981)</xref> study of sources of variance in scoring, Freedman could assume that <italic>some</italic> scale would be part of any scoring environment (pp. 250-252, 254). Yet those two decades also saw doubts surface about scales’ operation as independent variables in scoring. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741088312466992">A. Freedman and Pringle (1980)</xref> bluntly characterized their scale as a “rhetorical instrument” (p. 315); two decades later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741088312466992">Lumley (2002)</xref> agreed that scales might help channel raters’ diverse reactions to texts into narrower, more usable statements but disagreed that those statements were necessarily valid (p. 268).</p>
<p>And scales are texts themselves. They are material artifacts of theoretical <italic>constructs</italic>—beliefs about writing and what it should look like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741088312466992">Hamp-Lyons, 2011</xref>, p. 3); as such, they too are subject to competing interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0741088312466992">Rezaei &amp; Lovorn, 2010</xref>) and agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741088312466992">Columbini &amp; McBride, 2012</xref>). As Turley and Gallagher suggest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0741088312466992">2008</xref>), their ubiquity moots many of the more abstract debates over their use, and given the scope of U.S. FYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741088312466992">Crowley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741088312466992">Gere, 2009</xref>), it is critical to identify as precisely as possible the theoretical constructs of academic writing that operate there, a project for which corpus analysis is particularly well suited. Patterns writ large across this collection will reveal the beliefs about writing to which teachers and students are being asked to subscribe in U.S. universities in the first decade of the 21st century.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Corpus analysis examines patterns of language choices in a preferably large collection of texts that have been produced under whatever conditions would be typical of that genre. Ideally, the collection is machine analyzed for consistency and reliability, and any conclusions drawn from the resulting data are grounded in theoretically coherent interpretive judgments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741088312466992">Biber, Conrad, &amp; Reppen, 1998</xref>, pp. 4-5). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741088312466992">Lee’s (2008)</xref> taxonomy of approaches to corpus analysis, this study lies between the purely qualitative and intuitive corpus-<italic>informed</italic> approaches and the purely quantitative corpus-<italic>induced</italic> studies used in, say, machine learning (p. 88). There are fewer preconceptions operating here than in analyses of corpora that rely on close reading alone, but because the corpus was manually rendered analyzable through the coding decisions described below, it is most accurately described as corpus <italic>driven</italic> (pp. 89-91).</p>
<sec id="section3-0741088312466992">
<title>The Corpus</title>
<p>Text corpora are usually delimited by strict genre conventions (e.g., research article abstracts in the <italic>Journal of Pragmatics</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741088312466992">Gillaerts &amp; Van de Velde, 2010</xref>) or controlled-topic undergraduate essays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741088312466992">McNamara, Crossley, &amp; McCarthy, 2010</xref>). But genres are usefully defined not by formal features but by the social actions they accomplish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0741088312466992">Miller, 1984</xref>, p. 151). Though the individual documents in this corpus are diverse in form, each is an institutional response to the belief that readers’ connoisseurship of writing quality requires supplementing (or focusing or channeling, as the case may be) to reliably and fairly categorize first-year undergraduates’ performance of academic writing conventions. As will be seen, this collection contains critical assumptions that, like those of any other genre that has not been studied en masse, have escaped unnoticed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0741088312466992">Römer &amp; Wulff, 2010</xref>, p. 102).</p>
<p>The scales in this corpus currently circulate among hundreds of teachers and thousands of students at many of the 166 U.S. public doctoral research, Research II, and Research I institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0741088312466992">2</xref></sup> The sampling plan is limited to public research universities for three reasons: First, their large FYC programs must accommodate the diverse needs of comparatively heterogeneous cohorts of matriculating students; second, these programs are routinely staffed by contingent and/or novice instructors, necessitating additional guarantees of intersection consistency; third, the writing program administrators of these programs are likely to be trained compositionists. It is therefore assumed that the documents in this corpus represent the best-designed and most extensively field-tested examples of the genre to be found.</p>
<p>A review of these universities’ websites eliminated three institutions without FYC programs and six that did not provide contact information for their programs, if they had them. A personalized, signed letter describing the project was sent via USPS to the writing program administrators of the remaining 157 programs to explain the project, to offer a copy of the University of Maine’s English 101 scoring rubric as a good-faith gesture, and to explain that I would be following up with an e-mail. After two rounds of individualized e-mail, 101 writing program administrators responded (64%), with 72 sending either program definitions of letter grades or descriptions of performance categories for end-term portfolio assessment (or both), resulting in a total of 96 documents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0741088312466992">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>To avoid overrepresentation, if a writing program administrator sent two scales from two writing courses (e.g., 101 and 102), only the former was used; if multiple scales for different assignments from the same course were sent, only the scale for the most heavily weighted assignment was used. These decisions culled the total to 83 documents that concern only <italic>introductory</italic> writing courses (or, in two cases, the most significant deliverable for such a course). Every geographic sector of the United States is represented; more important, the full range of public institutions is present, from the “public ivies” to those that are effectively open admission. Considering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741088312466992">Knoch’s (2011</xref>, p. 82) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741088312466992">Haswell’s (1998</xref>, pp. 237, 245) emphasis on the importance of distinguishing among kinds of scales, it is important to note that the corpus contains no diagnostic scales—that is, those that are used for placement purposes. Instead, each is intended to assess proficiency. With only two exceptions, the entire corpus assumes native speaker status.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0741088312466992">4</xref></sup> Even so, this corpus dramatically expands preliminary attempts to collect and investigate the linguistic construction of writing performance, which have relied on documents freely available on the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741088312466992">Balester, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741088312466992">Jeffrey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0741088312466992">Poe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0741088312466992">Scott, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0741088312466992">
<title>Corpus Coding</title>
<p>The corpus contains 32 documents that define letter grades and 51 scoring rubrics that describe performance categories on a numerical scale or with adjectives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0741088312466992">5</xref></sup> As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741088312466992">Table 1</xref> illustrates, 20 of the grade definition documents have discrete definitions for the typical U.S. practice of evaluating work at an A, B, C, D, or F level; 8 collapse D and F into a single definition of nonpassing work; 4 define only C as a way to set a benchmark for minimum competency.</p>

<p>Like the grade definitions, the scoring rubrics are heavily weighted to pass (note that only two of the 6-point scales and only five of the 4-point scales are equally weighted).</p>
<p>All documents were scrubbed of any information that identified their institutional origin and uploaded to NVivo 9 qualitative research software. While NVivo is not specifically designed for corpus analysis, it does enable electronic markup of documents, a certain level of autocoding, and matrix and word frequency queries, on which much of the following analyses rely. As explained in the next section, each document was coded for the levels (or “performance categories”) at which it was possible to rate students’ writing ability and then again for all the specific <italic>features</italic> (or “traits”) of academic writing that readers were asked to appraise. While much of the coding could be accomplished by simple text captures, some coding required more researcher judgment. The discussion below attempts to account for any sources of error these decisions may have introduced.</p>

<sec id="section5-0741088312466992">
<title>Performance Category Coding</title>
<p>The documents that define grades of A and C or scores of 4 and 2 present few difficulties for reliable and accurate coding. But because not all scoring rubrics break the pass/fail continuum at the same place, they present three problems. First, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0741088312466992">Table 2</xref> indicates, two scoring rubrics distinguish among <italic>three</italic> levels of inability, and six distinguish among <italic>four</italic> levels of ability. The language in this handful of outlier categories proved so similar to that of the adjacent categories that it could be effectively merged into the top and bottom coding nodes, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0741088312466992">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p>Two problems remained: There is no equivalent in the portfolio scoring guides to a D, in the sense of “just passing” (since all that language is necessarily coded as <italic>adequate</italic>), nor is there anything in the grade definitions that will accommodate a “failing but not in the worst way.” In other words, some scoring rubrics ask raters to distinguish between <italic>two</italic> levels of failure, and most grading definitions allow for what might be called a grudging pass. These two problems have been resolved by creating six master performance categories—four passing and two failing:</p>
<list id="list1-0741088312466992" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Superlative</italic>: All grade A definitions and the top-most performance category (or categories, if there are more than three levels of passing work).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Middling good</italic>: All grade B definitions and performance categories characterizing passing work that lies <italic>below</italic> the <italic>superlative</italic> category but above <italic>baseline</italic> or <italic>adequate</italic>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Adequate</italic>: All grade C definitions and all minimal performance categories.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Just passing</italic>: Definitions of the grade D. As explained above, this category cannot be merged with <italic>adequate</italic>, because that language is designed to construct minimally satisfactory outcomes, when the language of D is clearly dissatisfaction. A D is a rebuke, but it is not a final no and cannot be merged with <italic>inadequate</italic>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Inadequate</italic>: This category contains all language from the portfolio scoring guides that describes either single categories of nonpassing work (e.g., a 1 on a 3-point scale) or the first of two layers of nonpassing work (as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0741088312466992">Table 3</xref>). This should sharpen the distinction with the category of <italic>just passing</italic>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Severe fail</italic>: This category contains all definitions of the grade F and the handful of distinctions reserved for performance levels worse than inadequate.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Two examples illustrate these distinctions. First, here are the <italic>superlative</italic> and <italic>just passing</italic> performance categories of Grading Scale 37 (the tightly parallel structure of the paragraphs is typical):
<disp-quote>
<p>The “A” essay demonstrates the writer’s ability to address rhetorical situations in innovative, creative, and perceptive ways. The writing is more than above average; it is exceptional. The purpose is distinguished by some depth or breadth of insight; all support offered is interesting, relevant, and boldly thought-provoking. The organization is not only coherent but marked by appropriateness to the specific rhetorical situation, and the transitions show sophistication and originality. The writing exhibits finesse on the writer’s part in matters of style, diction, and usage. There are no grammatical errors.</p>
<p>The “D” essay indicates the writer’s ability to address rhetorical situations somewhat competently, but the writing contains weaknesses and/or errors that mark it as less than what is expected in one or more of the following ways: The purpose is confused or too general; the support offered is vague, unconvincing, inaccurate, irrelevant or too narrow in focus; the organization is confusing or unsuccessful; the style, voice or tone is inconsistent or inappropriate; the sentence structure is difficult to read or inappropriate. Numerous mechanical and grammatical errors hinder the readers’ ability to understand the text.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The D essay (or in this coding scheme, <italic>just passing</italic>) may be “confused,” “inconsistent,” and/or “inappropriate” but is just “less than what is expected”—not failing and therefore not codable as <italic>inadequate</italic>. As the second example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0741088312466992">Figure 2</xref> contains one of the eight traits that Assessment Rubric 42 asks readers to rate on a 5-point scale. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0741088312466992">Figure 2</xref> should illuminate the distinctions among the coding categories of <italic>adequate, inadequate</italic>, and <italic>severe fail</italic>: Note the verb “lacks,” the adjectives “inappropriate” and “nonexistent,” and the phrases “no awareness” and “do not make sense”—not yet the lowest performance category but clearly not a passing score either.</p>

<p>Apart from directions to readers, almost all the words in the corpus are codable under one of the six performance categories described above—the nine documents that describe only the requirements of minimally passing papers can be coded in their entirety as <italic>adequate</italic>; the definition of the characteristics of a B paper can be coded <italic>middling good</italic> (as can the category of 4 in the excerpt of the scale above), and so on.</p>

<title>Trait Coding</title>
<p>In the tradition of analytic scoring, “traits” are isolable elements of a performance of writing ability (i.e., as distinct from a “holistic” impression). After a list of traits named in each document was compiled, word frequency queries were used to test recurrent synonyms (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0741088312466992">Table 4</xref>). These queries identified clusters of 10 codable master traits, 8 of which appeared in over half the documents in the corpus. There were many traits particular to only a few (or only one) of the documents (e.g., “familiarity with composing technology” or “grasp of the concepts of literary textual analysis”), which have been excluded here. It was also decided to exclude the “creativity” and “process” traits, since they appeared much less frequently than <italic>assignment/engagement</italic>, the rarest of the traits that appeared in at least half the documents in the corpus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0741088312466992">6</xref></sup> Each document was then coded for any description of the 8 remaining traits.</p>

<p>Since most of the 51 scoring rubrics explicitly label traits for raters, they present no difficulties for reliable coding. (The row excerpted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0741088312466992">Figure 2</xref>, for example, can simply be coded in its entirely as <italic>organization</italic>.) Some of the grade definition documents presented more of a challenge, since it was necessary to code those sections of the paragraphs or sentences that describe, for example, B- or D-level performance. To reuse the example from Grade Definition 37,
<disp-quote>
<p>The “A” essay demonstrates the writer’s ability to address rhetorical situations in innovative, creative, and perceptive ways. The writing is more than above average; it is exceptional. The purpose is distinguished by some depth or breadth of insight; all support offered is interesting, relevant, and boldly thought-provoking. The organization is not only coherent but marked by appropriateness to the specific rhetorical situation, and the transitions show sophistication and originality. The writing exhibits finesse on the writer’s part in matters of style, diction, and usage. There are no grammatical errors.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Recall that this paragraph has already been coded in its entirety at the <italic>superlative</italic> performance category: The first sentence is coded <italic>audience</italic> but not <italic>creativity</italic>, since the adjectives “creative” and “innovative” are being used to scale audience <italic>itself</italic>. The second sentence is not coded, since it does not identify a trait of “writing” that is “exceptional.” The third sentence is coded <italic>thesis</italic> before the semicolon, <italic>evidence</italic> afterward. The fourth sentence requires some judgment: The descriptors before the “but” are part of <italic>organization</italic>, but the first half of the sentence that begins “The organization is” must also be coded <italic>audience</italic>, along with the phrase “marked by appropriateness to the specific rhetorical situation.” Descriptors after the conjunction and the fifth sentence are coded <italic>style</italic>; the final sentence is coded <italic>grammar</italic>.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0741088312466992">Table 5</xref> illustrates, these two coding schemas have made it possible to see all of the language that appears in each of the 48 cells—that is, each intersection of the six performance categories and the eight canonical traits (e.g., every instance where <italic>audience awareness</italic> is appraised as <italic>superlative</italic>, where <italic>critical thinking</italic> is appraised as <italic>middling good</italic>, where <italic>style</italic> is appraised as <italic>severe fail</italic>).</p>

<p>The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure the degree of word similarity between any two collections of language coded at the above traits. Since NVivo is not a statistical analysis package and cannot generate <italic>p</italic> values, these correlations must be taken advisedly. Nonetheless, the resulting dendrogram provides a useful framework for ordering the presentation of the findings, and the close looks at the specific language choices found at each trait that follow below help validate the clustering in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0741088312466992">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0741088312466992-fig3.tif"/></fig>
<p>The language collected under <italic>style</italic> and <italic>organization</italic> correlate at .589, <italic>thesis</italic> with <italic>organization</italic> at .527, and <italic>thesis</italic> with <italic>style</italic> at .437, stronger correlations than with any other trait. That the words that appear under <italic>thesis</italic> should be so similar to those codable under <italic>style</italic> and <italic>organization</italic> might help explain long-standing research findings that organization and “ideas” tend to disproportionately affect raters’ scoring decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741088312466992">Breland &amp; Jones, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741088312466992">Huot, 1990</xref>). As the close examination of the language in each trait reveals below, <italic>style</italic> is insufficiently disambiguated from <italic>organization</italic>, and neither has been made adequately distinct from <italic>thesis</italic>, failures that may contribute to widespread logical rating error. The following discussion will also shed some light on the strong linguistic similarity between <italic>critical thinking</italic> and <italic>support</italic> (here measured at .507) and on the reasons why the language grouped under the <italic>assignment, audience</italic>, and <italic>grammar</italic> traits was not as easily grouped with any other trait or subgroup of traits.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741088312466992">Martin and White (2005)</xref> explain, evaluation is not simply a matter of selecting and assigning a value that exists in isolation; rather, it involves complex combinations of meaning (p. 159). In scaling, the relevant subsystem of appraisal is what Martin and White call “graduation”: the linguistic construction of intensity, amount, and prototypicality. To reveal the internal logic by which each trait is scaled, the highest-frequency nouns, modifiers, and verbs present at each cell in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0741088312466992">Table 5</xref> are plotted in the matrixes that follow, using <bold>boldface</bold>, <italic>italics</italic>, and plain roman Calibri to indicate the order of frequency. The ultimate aim is to synthesize these 8 matrices to induce the theoretical construct of writing that operates in U.S. FYC.</p>
<p>While the rhetoric of connoisseurship seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741088312466992">Figure 1</xref> is a decisive (and welcome) retreat, it will be seen that it has been replaced by a rhetoric of self-evidence. With one important exception, each of the following matrices shows that descriptive language diminishes with performance level, a tendency that is especially visible in the way that predicates such as “demonstrates,” “structures,” “establishes,” and “engages” dwindle to simple existential verbs, such as “is,” “are,” and “be.” The category of <italic>middling good</italic> is defined against that of <italic>superlative</italic> and is always grounded in exceptions to top rankings introduced by the word “but.” “But” yields to “may” in the <italic>adequate</italic> category, which is in turn defined against <italic>middling good</italic>. “May” is always displaced by “not” and “no” in <italic>inadequate</italic> and <italic>severe fail</italic> performance categories. In <italic>severe fail</italic>, the key verb in the <italic>superlative</italic> performance category tends to reappear in a “not” or “no” formation, leaving these levels characterized simply by negations of positive traits (lacks engagement, fails to think critically, has no thesis, etc.). <italic>Superlative</italic> and <italic>severe fail</italic> categories are rhetorically constituted by “prototypicality”—that is, the category is usually free of the disclaimers, qualifiers, or quantifiers that hedge midrange appraisals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741088312466992">Martin &amp; White, 2005</xref>, pp. 137-138).</p>
<p>The categories’ consistent top-down reliance on a rhetoric of “presence” explains the instability <italic>of the traits themselves</italic> in the failing performance categories. As will be seen, the two lowest categories typically contain words that refer to the students themselves, as projections of the students themselves fill vacuums left by underrepresented traits. For example, “ideas” become an issue in <italic>organization</italic>; as evident <italic>critical thinking</italic> wanes, readers are directed to assess students’ “understanding”; raters are asked to take “purpose” into consideration when they are contemplating a low score in <italic>audience awareness</italic>, and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0741088312466992">7</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section8-0741088312466992">
<title>Thesis, Organization, Style</title>
<p>Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> likely clustered these traits in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0741088312466992">Figure 3</xref> because they all depend on the rhetorical construction of obviousness. A “thesis” may go by many names, but the data in the modifier row reflect a widespread belief that papers either have a “clear” one or not. Consequently, theses are scaled primarily by verbs—what students do <italic>with</italic> their theses.</p>

<p><italic>Superlative</italic> theses are “demonstrated” and “established”; <italic>middling good</italic> ones are only “presented” or “made.” Synonyms shift as the performance categories struggle to describe papers that “may not have”/“lack”/“have no clear” theses.

<p>Performance category descriptions of <italic>style</italic> direct readers to consider students’ choices. While the verbiage of this trait is atypically sparse (i.e., writers “use” good choices, their structures “are” appropriate, or their paper “is” inappropriate), its modifiers suggest that “clarity” is an <italic>effect</italic> of stylistic decisions. <italic>Superlative</italic> and <italic>middling good</italic> stylistic “choices” are held to result in a text assessed as “clear,” a term that disappears when texts are merely <italic>adequate</italic>, after which a different valence of “appropriateness” emerges to assess poor decisions, some of which threaten to reduce the student’s text to “incoherence.” The close relationship between <italic>style</italic> and <italic>organization</italic> is most evident at these lowest performance categories, where the entire essay being appraised is a synecdoche for the traits themselves.</p>

<p>The <italic>support</italic> trait operates on the assumption that student writers either “use” evidence to support their “ideas” or that the evidence “may” be “irrelevant” (or there is too “little” of it) or it simply “is not” there. Yet the principle verb of “use” is inflected by the distinction between <italic>support</italic> that has been “integrated” and <italic>support</italic> that has only been “presented”—an interesting overlap with <italic>style</italic>. Where all performance categories direct readers to reward “ideas,” high scores in <italic>support</italic> direct the rater to value “details” and “examples.” The two failing performance categories invoke the “writer” as a source of “irrelevant” or “not integrated” ideas or of development that is “insufficient.”</p>

<p><italic>Critical thinking</italic>, perhaps the most speculative and controversial trait measured in this corpus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0741088312466992">Peckham, 2010</xref>), is effectively limited to the verb “demonstrate” to convey whether (and to what degree) a student paper can be said to be thinking critically. Here, synonyms do most of the work of scaling performance. These synonyms show that as performance levels diminish, the materials that the writer is working <italic>on</italic> gradually replace activities that the writer could be said to be <italic>doing</italic>. Superlative critical thinkers, in other words, are able to address “complexities”; <italic>middling good</italic> writers do “convincing” work demonstrating to readers that they have done “some” work with “issues”; and <italic>adequate</italic> critical thinkers’ “limited” critical thinking suggest competent “understanding.” But words for the objects <italic>of</italic> work appear increasingly after <italic>just passing</italic>. “Text” and “paper” displace “awareness” and “reasoning”; an <italic>inadequate</italic> or <italic>severely failing</italic> critical thinker is undone by “positions” and the “text”—which the corpus suggests she or he simply “does not” “understand.”</p>

<title>Engagement</title>
<p>This trait is the first of the three that Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> was unable to definitively group with any other trait, finding <italic>critical thinking</italic> to be a distant rhetorical cousin at only .301. The corpus indicates that measures of student <italic>engagement</italic> are inseparable from the assignment to which they are responding, since the assignment produces the situation in which the student paper is written (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741088312466992">Bawarshi, 2003</xref>, pp. 112-144); accordingly, performance categories in this trait pivot on a narrow set of verbs describing students’ uptake of the prompt. <italic>Adequate engagement</italic> may be “consistent,” this matrix suggests, but such students “follow” assignments rather than “addressing” them. As the synonyms indicate, it therefore follows that all but <italic>superlative</italic> writers are preoccupied with “requirements,” whereas the <italic>superlatively engaged</italic> student writer makes the assignment his or her “own”—that is, something “beyond” the assignment that called for it.</p>

<p>Like <italic>style</italic>, above, students might be interested to see that the corpus regards “length” as an effect rather than a quality to be pursued for its own sake—that is, a <italic>severely failing</italic> paper might be characterized as “short” or, in that characterization, might substitute “length” as a noun for “engagement.” Yet “long” is not the adjectival counterpart in <italic>superlative</italic> assessments; by “address[ing]” the assignment “thoughtfully,” “thoroughly,” or going “beyond” the “requirements” and into “depth,” student writers produce papers that are not short.</p>

<title>Audience</title>
<p>The “reader” (who is strongly present in this trait when she or he assesses it highly) responds well only to formal writing, although the documents in this corpus do not quite put it this directly. This reader will perceive “effective” and “appropriate” writing as <italic>formal</italic> writing, or, to put this one other way, a desire for formal writing should be what the <italic>superlative</italic> student “senses” would fit the rhetorical occasion. As this formality begins to slip (i.e., where writing is “generally appropriate” or “sometimes consistent”), the “but” and “may” open spaces for the adjective “informal” in <italic>middling good</italic> and <italic>adequate</italic> performances. Like the <italic>thesis</italic> trait’s rhetoric of purposeful control, poor writing “shows,” where good writing “demonstrates” and “addresses.” A writer’s informality is thus evidence that one has “little” or “no” sense of the “situation,” a manifestation of one’s “lack” of ability to accommodate this “reader.”</p>

<p>Grammar was probably stranded by Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0741088312466992">Figure 3</xref> because its presence-absence continuum is constructed in reverse.

<title>Discussion: The Contemporary Theoretical Construct of Writing in U.S. FYC</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741088312466992">Behizadeh and Engelhard (2011)</xref> argue that writing theory has had minimal influence on writing assessments, which they find laboring under formalistic constructs of writing that are at odds with the sociocultural/contextualist construct dominant in the contemporary writing research community (p. 206). It is worth pointing out that 25 of the 51 scoring rubrics are explicitly designed to assess portfolios or collections of student work and that many facilitate multiple reviews by different readers and contain protocols for adjudicating discrepant appraisals, evidence of a collective will to distance assessment of student writing from the formalist construct of connoisseurship that obtains, for example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741088312466992">Figure 1</xref>. But Behizadeh and Engelhard’s findings can be put to a closer test: With maps of the lexical frequencies and the internal logic of each canonical trait in this corpus, key words from each trait can be used to articulate the relationships <italic>among</italic> them. That is, it is now possible to induce the theoretical construct of “writing” operating in the FYC programs that contributed documents to this corpus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0741088312466992">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0741088312466992-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>As noted in the introduction, there are several important indicators of progress to be emphasized. First, the language patterns in <italic>style, organization</italic>, and <italic>thesis</italic> indicate that assessors of student writing are encouraged to appraise students’ ideas in a more nuanced and valid way than the 1940 spectrum of “original” to “childish” from the University of Texas, Austin. Second, the corpus reflects (if spottily) the understanding that readers in different contexts have different needs and that part of what makes specific instances of writing <italic>superlative</italic> or <italic>adequate</italic> are the specific conventions and expectations operating in that context, as opposed to suggesting to students and teachers, as was the case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741088312466992">Figure 1</xref>, that these categories stand in for all “good writing” everywhere. Third, significant progress on the historically fraught question of “error” is also evident. Not only is it expected that surface error is inevitable (note that the most frequent modifier in <italic>superlative grammar</italic> is not “none” but “few”), but it is also routinely suggested to students and teachers that there are <italic>kinds</italic> or <italic>degrees</italic> of error. That is, the errors that are “serious” or “significant” are such because they “interfere,” “distract,” or “impede” readers’ understanding and not because they violate some existential category of “correctness.”</p>
<p>However, the only way to articulate the construct mapped in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0741088312466992">Figure 4</xref> in a way that is consistent with the findings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table13-0741088312466992">Tables 6</xref> to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table16-0741088312466992">8</xref> is for “writing” to be the agent of the sentence, with the student/writer deferred and the role of the reader in producing the appraisal largely effaced. Readers produce scores, not papers, but five of the eight canonical traits are left heavily reliant on the modifier “appropriate” to justify appraisals with no explicit reference to or description of the putative addressee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741088312466992">Martin &amp; White, 2005</xref>, p. 95). In all traits, at all performance levels, readers’ experiences of the texts are presented as intrinsic <italic>qualities</italic> of those texts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0741088312466992">9</xref></sup> By suppressing the role of the reader, the documents in this corpus suppress the uncomfortable fact that—outside of a handful of studies on this effect—raters, students, and writing program administrators have no way to compare the appraisal that their scale constructed with a judgment that <italic>might</italic> have been made had a different scale been used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741088312466992">Lumley, 2002</xref> p. 268). Here, Behazideh and Engelhard’s point is well taken: The ubiquitous framing of what is local, temporal, and contingent as if it were generalizable, ahistorical, and definitive is inconsistent with what is generally known to be true about the embeddedness of writing in complex social systems of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0741088312466992">Prior &amp; Shipka, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0741088312466992">Prior, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0741088312466992">Roozen, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0741088312466992">2010</xref>). As the induced construct itself suggests, however, this corpus does not routinely frame the writing conventions it rewards as existing in just such a context. Of 261 instances of the word “writing” in the corpus, only 34 are explicitly modified with words such as “essay” or “academic,” even though it is specifically within an <italic>academic</italic> activity system that these documents require students to produce writing and readers to assess it.</p>
<p>Writers themselves are dynamic parts of those systems. Although “to fail” often means “to be unable to,” it means (at least some of the time) “to choose not to.” Apart from two instances of “ignore” (as in “ignores evidence that contradicts the claim”), however, this corpus contains no agentive verbs of failure; there are no instances, for example, of any version of the verbs “refuse,” “decline,” “object,” “resist,” “oppose,” “subvert,” “parody,” “mock,” or “satirize.” It is questionable that these documents construct students as agents only when they are engaged in the kinds of performances that they guide readers to recognize as conventional. In eliding students’ potential agency in “failing” to meet standards, the documents in this corpus present their criteria and performance categories as uncomplicated means to an ideologically neutral end.</p>
<p>While obviously not the intention of the documents that constitute this corpus, the systematic underrepresentation of students in this corpus denies their intellectual labor; the systematic underrepresentation of teachers’ and raters’ involvement with the scores or grades they produce denies their evaluative expertise and their role in the process. The heavy weighting of the entire corpus toward higher performance categories, both in simple word count and in richness of description, constrains the theoretical construct to an announcement of its most favored conventions. The impoverished language in the lower traits is ironic in this context, since the rhetoric of absence and negation that operate on those levels do little to scaffold teachers’ understanding of the causes and complexities of writing appraised at those levels or to provide opportunities for these readers and writers to recognize themselves as agents able to do things differently next time.</p>
<p>Since the language used to assess these traits and performance categories will inevitably wash back into teachers’ and students’ everyday rhetorical constructions of what counts as good writing and of writing development more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0741088312466992">Rothermel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0741088312466992">Scott, 2005</xref>), the corpus contains at least 227 missed opportunities to emphasize the <italic>situatedness</italic> of the students’ writing (i.e., why they might want to write like this and for what ends), the <italic>local nature</italic> of the scoring and grading (i.e., why the readers make the decisions they do and by what authority), and the <italic>specific construct</italic> of the writing valued by the assessment (i.e., what this kind of writing is, why it matters and to whom, and what it is and is not good for).</p>
<p>These silences have implications beyond the teaching and assessing of FYC. Discoveries of regularity and repetition in a corpus of related texts reveal the socially ratified preferred practice of collectivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741088312466992">Flowerdew, 2008</xref>, p. 115; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741088312466992">Hyland, 2010</xref>, pp. 163-164). The documents in this corpus stabilize uptakes of student papers within local activity systems by constructing operating assumptions about how writing should be valued, both in assessment scenarios and in the language they provide for everyday interactions with students and colleagues as they work toward the values these documents construct (the A, the score of 6; the “pass” decision).</p>
<p>Certainly the corpus, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0741088312466992">Figure 4</xref> suggests, constructs as ideal the conventions of essayistic expository prose. This will not surprise some, given U.S. composition’s typical housing in departments of English literature, but the point is that the corpus’s lack of self-consciousness about the uses, limitations, and site specificity of these conventions may be working against writers’ ability to negotiate transitions to other local genres. It is possible to imagine a student who learns to honor this construct, for example, but is disserved by applying it in a discipline or workplace in which, for example, collaborative and distributed composing practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0741088312466992">Spinuzzi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0741088312466992">Winsor, 2001</xref>) or a deferred thesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741088312466992">Braddock, 1974</xref>) is conventional or in a culture that prefers a tacit organizational scheme with implied transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741088312466992">Englander, 2009</xref>) or citation by allusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741088312466992">Canagarajah, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741088312466992">Pennycook, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The limitations of what a single course in writing instruction can accomplish have been well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741088312466992">North, 2011</xref>); this discussion should not be understood as a call to increase the accountability or the expectations for courses like those that contributed documents to this corpus. But I do suggest that the rhetorical construction of this corpus works against the teaching and learning of academic writing as operating in a specific sociocultural context. Writers’ difficulties in adopting different writing skills and techniques have repeatedly been documented by both educational researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741088312466992">Huang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0741088312466992">Rounsaville, Goldberg, &amp; Bawarshi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0741088312466992">Sperling &amp; Freedman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0741088312466992">Wardle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0741088312466992">Yancey, 2010</xref>) and workplace researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741088312466992">Angouri &amp; Harwood, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741088312466992">Beaufort, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0741088312466992">Schryer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0741088312466992">Smart, 2000</xref>). Such difficulties point to an overgeneralized and brittle theoretical construct of writing that does not easily support adaptive repurposing.</p>
<p>While progressive in many respects, the language patterns in this corpus do not yet consistently scaffold a durable and flexible theoretical construct of “writing” for the writers whose work they help assess. While the designers of the scales in this corpus likely feel that an overt acknowledgment of the contingency of the traits they are mandated to assess would constitute a validity threat to an “objective” appraisal of writing, writers’ experience of shifting standards and rationales for the many appraisals they have already received by the time they enter FYC has likely convinced them of the subjectivity of reader response already. More to the point, this contingency will simply be a fact of life in writing in the disciplines (Abasi, Akbari, &amp; Graves, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0741088312466992">Russell &amp; Yanez, 2003</xref>), postgraduate writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0741088312466992">Paré, Starke-Meyerring, &amp; McAlpine, 2009</xref>), and workplaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741088312466992">Dias, Freedman, Medway, &amp; Paré, 1999</xref>) to come. Scales that rhetorically construct trait descriptions and performance categories in ways that are consistent with (rather than in defiance of) the fact that any reader’s appraisal is embedded in cultural and material contexts could help furnish postsecondary writers with more robust constructs of “writing” for the contradictions and transitions to come. A longitudinal study to empirically test this conjecture on a revised version of any of the 83 documents in this corpus would be complex to administer, control, and measure but is feasible and, given the stakes, overdue.</p>

<p>A list was generated by setting the Carnegie Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org">classifications.carnegiefoundation.org</ext-link>) filters to <italic>public</italic> and <italic>(DRU, R2 and R1)</italic>.</p>

<p>No writing program administrator refused (at least not in writing) to send documents. Seven programs were working on a grading scale or scoring rubric at the time of data collection (or hoped to begin work soon); at 10 institutions, instructors develop their own scales after training; and 12 use neither grading definitions nor scoring rubrics (although it was not always clear whether this was a philosophical position or simply a statement of fact).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0741088312466992">
<label>4.</label>
<p>The two exceptions are Grading Scale 31, which advises assessors that “because certain types of errors persist in L2/English Varieties writing even at an advanced level, some accommodation of L2/English Varieties features is appropriate,” and Scoring Rubric 35, which advises assessors that “papers written by ESL students may be permitted a few additional errors.”</p>
</fn>

<label>5.</label>
<p>For example, “excellent,” “good,” “adequate,” and “poor.” For coding purposes, all adjectival categories have been converted to numbers (e.g., an assessment rubric with four performance categories of <italic>distinctive, skillful, competent</italic>, and <italic>ineffective</italic> is a 4-point scale with three passing categories and one failing).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-0741088312466992">
<label>6.</label>
<p>As one reviewer noted, the frequency and intensity of references to these traits in the corpus roughly reverses the order of importance routinely assigned to these traits by writing teachers.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-0741088312466992">
<label>7.</label>
<p>This finding amplifies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0741088312466992">Poe’s (2006)</xref> close reading of 21 rubrics used in then-current statewide assessments, in which she uncovered an “implicit assumption” operating at the lowest scores that “that there is something wrong with students’ reasoning abilities” (p. 18).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0741088312466992">
<label>8.</label>
<p>Further research is needed to uncover whether the “ideas” that serve as synonyms for <italic>organization</italic> and <italic>structure</italic> are sufficiently differentiated from those “ideas” that readers are being directed to assess <italic>as</italic> the <italic>thesis</italic>.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-0741088312466992">
<label>9.</label>
<p>To be sure, the corpus occasionally directs readers to reward writing that they find “unexpected,” “surprising,” or “risky,” yet these modifiers could as justifiably be applied to, say, <italic>grammar</italic> in the category of <italic>severe fail</italic>. Given what is known about the covariance of surface error with task unfamiliarity or complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741088312466992">Haswell, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741088312466992">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741088312466992">Lunsford &amp; Lunsford, 2008</xref>), errors could well be an effect of an attempt to take just such “risky” or “unexpected” moves. Moreover, this rhetorical reframing of “originality” as “risk” might inadvertently offer middle- and upper-class native speakers an additional advantage in intuiting which “risks” could be safely taken.</p>
