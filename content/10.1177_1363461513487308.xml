<p>From the ritual suicide of honorable <italic>seppuku</italic> by feudal warriors centuries ago to famed writer Yukio Mishima’s well-publicized <italic>hara-kiri</italic> in 1970, Japanese suicide has received much attention in academic and popular literature. Many of these authors have approached the “unique nature” of Japanese suicide and associated traditional social values (e.g., suicide as an honorable act) from historical and cultural perspectives. The tendency to view the Japanese as a monolithic entity has been exemplified in the popular literature of <italic>Nihonjinron</italic>, which claims to explore the “essence” or the uniqueness of Japanese culture and people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363461513487308">Befu, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363461513487308">1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363461513487308">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363461513487308">Umesao, 1984</xref>). The <italic>Nihonjinron</italic> and other culturalist literature ignore the increasing heterogeneity and diversification of individual experiences in postindustrial Japan and the changing nature of suicide. The overemphasis on cultural components of Japanese suicide or on the Western conception of suicide as an individual act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363461513487308">Ozawa-de Silva, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363461513487308">Takahashi, 1997</xref>) may not allow a more complete understanding of individual suffering from a phenomenological perspective.</p>
<p><italic>Nettoshinju</italic> (hereafter referred to as Internet group suicide) is a contemporary form of Japanese suicide where strangers connect on the Internet and make plans to commit suicide together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363461513487308">Shibui, 2004</xref>). In the past decade in Japan, incidents have occurred in which young Japanese, largely in their 20s and 30s, make contact on Internet bulletin boards, exchange tips on how to commit suicide, and make plans to meet offline for group or individual suicide. Some of the characteristics of Internet group suicide include the following: participants are strangers who have no prior relationships; almost all Internet group suicides are committed through the inhalation of carbon monoxide gas resulting from burning charcoal briquettes; there are often more than two people in the pact; and the preferred locations are closed spaces such as apartment rooms or cars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363461513487308">Cho, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Charcoal briquettes or <italic>rentan</italic> are traditional fuel often used with a <italic>shichirin</italic>, a portable clay cooking stove in Japan. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363461513487308">Saito (2005)</xref>, the director of a Japanese suicide hotline program, commented that the use of <italic>rentan</italic> and <italic>shichirin</italic> is an outdated, anachronistic conception, pointing to the traditional aspect of the method. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363461513487308">Sadakane (2008)</xref> argued that the use of charcoal briquettes in Internet suicide might have emerged as the result of people seeking the most effective and lethal suicide method. Because Internet suicide requires participants to observe and supervise each other in the process of committing suicide, the rate of uncompleted suicides is low (11.5%). The choice of method, the burning of charcoal briquettes in a closed space, is not random but is carefully chosen and planned. The method has become ritualized and disseminated by the <italic>Kanzen Jisatsu Manual</italic> (<italic>The Complete Suicide Manual</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363461513487308">Tsurumi, 1993</xref>), via Internet forums, such as online bulletin boards, suicide-related websites, and news coverage of completed incidents. There are several reasons why charcoal briquette burning may be used in Internet suicide, including that many people can share the same method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363461513487308">Lee, 2005</xref>), it is associated with minimal pain, and is less disfiguring than other means of death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363461513487308">Tsurumi, 1993</xref>). Additionally, charcoal briquettes and <italic>shichirin</italic> are affordable and easily accessible.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363461513487308">MHLW, 2005</xref>), the most common suicide method in 2003 in Japan was hanging; however, the inhalation of gas was the second most common method. In addition, the number of deaths caused by hanging has decreased since 1998 (70.9 % for men and 61.3% for women in 1998 vs. 66.4% for men and 58.9 % for women in 2003), while the number of deaths due to the inhalation of gas had been flat for 12 years (approximately 6–7% in men and 2% in women from 1990 to 2002) but increased to 13.3% for men and 4.8% for women in 2003). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363461513487308">Kawano (2004)</xref> speculated that this increase might reflect the recent increase in the Internet group suicide rate.</p>
<p>Although Internet group suicide is often talked about by the Japanese media as a morbid new trend (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363461513487308">“Group suicide,” 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461513487308">Huus, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363461513487308">“Nine dead,” 2006</xref>), the phenomenon of Japanese people committing suicide with others has long existed in the form of <italic>jo-shi</italic> (love-pact suicide) and <italic>ikka-shinju</italic> (family suicide). The term <italic>shinju</italic> in Japanese literally means “heart inside” or “oneness of hearts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363461513487308">Takahashi, Hirasawa, Koyama, Senzaki, &amp; Senzaki, 1998</xref>, p. 279). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363461513487308">Sakuta (1995</xref>, p. 141) states that it derives from the word <italic>shinchu</italic>, “which means the inside of the heart, the inner depth of the heart or mind.” <italic>Koujien</italic>, a Japanese dictionary, defines <italic>shinju</italic> as “social obligation to others…<italic>jo-shi</italic>, or dying together of two or more people” (as cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363461513487308">Cho, 2004</xref>, p. 2). As can be seen from the definitions, the word <italic>shinju</italic> reflects a psychological togetherness, oneness of hearts, and the close relationship among dying people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363461513487308">Sakuta, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363461513487308">Takahashi et al., 1998</xref>). In Internet group suicide, the form of committing suicide in a small group is retained. However, what seems to be different in Internet group suicide is the fact that those who commit or contemplate suicide together are complete strangers. No preexisting relationships exist. Partners are determined solely on the basis of timing, method, and seriousness of intention to commit suicide, rather than by a bond between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363461513487308">Shibui, 2004</xref>). The quality of the group and what constitutes the group seem to depart from traditional <italic>shinju</italic>, at least structurally.</p>
<p>The nature of such relationships online is indeed paradoxical, leading one theorist to propose the concept of the “intimate stranger” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363461513487308">Tomita, 2005</xref>, p. 183), a new kind of social relationship where anonymity becomes the basis for intimacy. According to Tomita:
<disp-quote>
<p>An anonymous other who is not intimate is a complete stranger. A person who is not anonymous but also not intimate is an acquaintance. A person who is not anonymous and who is intimate is a friend or lover…Now, however, we have the intimate stranger, a person who is anonymous but also intimate, a type of relationship that has been made possible by new media. (p. 184)</p></disp-quote>This distant, yet intimate nature of communication characterizes the relationship that is fostered on websites such as suicide bulletin boards. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363461513487308">Shibui (2004)</xref>, individuals who seek suicide partners online are looking for anonymous others to play their roles as “tools” (p. 177) for each other. When individuals start to develop an emotional investment, the Internet suicide pact relationships break down. Strangers are chosen in order to avoid emotional investment but to create a “quasi-community” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363461513487308">Ozawa-de Silva, 2008</xref>, p. 537) in which there is a sense of comfort in making a group rather than an individual decision.</p>
<p>A number of studies have examined individuals who visit suicide message boards and shed light on motives, experiences, and common themes expressed by such individuals. Findings from a German online survey that examined the motives for visiting suicide message boards suggest that most users on the forum sought support and help by communicating with those they thought could understand them and found a significant reduction in suicidal thoughts after the online interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363461513487308">Eichenberg, 2008</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363461513487308">Barak and Miron (2005)</xref> examined online messages posted on a publicly accessible, open-forum support group website. They found that online discussants who contemplate suicide had writing styles that reflected some aspects of a depressogenic thinking style (problems were seen as stable and global) and were more self-focused. They identified themes of unendurable emotional pain, cognitive constriction, and interpersonal relationship problems in the participants’ online communications, consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363461513487308">Shneidman’s (1985)</xref> theories of suicide.</p>
<p>Similar research conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363461513487308">Fekete (2002)</xref>, via analysis of an English language website visited by individuals worldwide, found that suicidal people were characterized by a tendency toward polarized thinking (i.e., cognitive constriction), expressions of emotional states, negation, and self-preoccupation when compared to nonsuicidal people. Some of the themes found in his study were the following: participants seeking and providing support (8%); suicide imitation and pacts (7.5%); asking for suicide methods (7%); the impact of suicide on the survivors (5.4%); and cries for help (1.3%). No systematic studies have examined whether such themes are present in the Japanese context.</p>
<p>One exception, although anecdotal, is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363461513487308">Kawano’s (2004)</xref> research that identified some themes among Japanese Internet group suicide cases. The data consisted of a mixture of newspaper articles, stories on a television show, anecdotal comments online, and related books. The first theme was universality or identification. He argued that people who search for suicide partners online seem to seek shared experiences and desire for their suicide wishes to be accepted by others. Another theme was the confirmation of seriousness of intent. Kawano indicated that not only did prospective suicides test others’ seriousness of suicide online, but they also hoped to share the seriousness of their suicide wish. He explained that this wish for shared experiences and affinity may actually prevent suicides, because communicants may use their bonding experience as a way to support each other in accepting life rather than death.</p>
<p>As a new source of research data, the Internet provides important information about human behaviors in a natural setting without the researcher’s interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363461513487308">Bargh &amp; McKenna, 2004</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363461513487308">Barak and Miron (2005)</xref>, “the ethnographic methodology in Internet research exploits the fact that most online communication takes place through textual channels…which provide a vehicle for studying different psychological and sociological issues” (p. 508). While some researchers have noted the negative impact of computer-mediated communications, such as increased verbal hostility (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363461513487308">Rice &amp; Steinfield, 1994</xref>), other authors have found positive aspects of online relationships, citing the authentic and honest verbal expressions that are facilitated by anonymity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363461513487308">Bargh, McKenna, &amp; Fitzsimons, 2002</xref>). Although there is lack of consensus about the nature of online relationships, researchers have argued that the Internet provides a legitimate social context in which to develop an understanding of online discussants’ mental states through their writings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363461513487308">Barak &amp; Buchanan, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A systematized empirical study of contemporary Internet suicide in postindustrial Japan is lacking in the literature thus far. Comparable ethnographic work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363461513487308">Ozawa-de Silva, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363461513487308">2010</xref>) has reviewed selected postings on Japanese suicide websites and highlighted themes from an anthropological perspective by emphasizing individuals’ subjectivity in a sociocultural context. The present study also attempts to address the subjective experiences of contemporary Japanese who contemplate suicide over the Internet but utilizes a more systematized analytic method, namely qualitative content analysis. While less broad in focus than Ozawa-de Silva’s work, it also provides a detailed microanalysis of a particular bulletin board.</p>
<p>This study by no means tries to overgeneralize its findings to reinforce a perception of contemporary Japanese suicide as a monolithic entity, but instead tries to highlight one subgroup of contemporary Japanese experiences related to suicide. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363461513487308">Shneidman (1993)</xref>, we view “suicide notes are cryptic maps of ill-advised journeys” (p. 102). By accepting online textual postings by youths as personal documents (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363461513487308">Allport, 1951</xref>), we hope to shed some light on what contemporary Japanese were trying to communicate online and get a glimpse of their “journeys.”</p>
<sec id="sec1-1363461513487308" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>In this study, a qualitative content analysis/thematic analysis was used to analyze the bulletin board communications on one of the most popular websites, “Channel-2 Japanese Suicide Bulletin Board.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1363461513487308">1</xref></sup> This qualitative method was chosen as it allows us to explore rich and textured descriptions of people’s “lived experience” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363461513487308">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>, p. 10) but also allows for a systematic, microinvestigation of thematic materials. Channel-2 is Japan’s largest Internet bulletin board with about 5.4 million people visiting it each month. The site was also the first suicide bulletin board that came up when the keywords <italic>jisatsu</italic> (which means “suicide” in Japanese) or <italic>jisatsukeijiban</italic> (“suicide bulletin boards”) were submitted in popular search engines at the time of study<italic>.</italic> The Channel-2 Suicide Bulletin Board is unmoderated, has archives, and can be read by nonsubscribers. In addition to its popularity, the following characteristics made Channel-2 Suicide Bulletin Board attractive to study: discussions occurred in a natural setting without a moderator; the ongoing discussions could be revisited in archives during the coding process; and the postings were available to nonsubscribers (i.e., researchers) in order to avoid interference with ongoing Internet discussions.</p>
<p>All postings on the Channel-2 Suicide Bulletin Board were written in Japanese and those from January and July 2007 were printed out and stored for later analysis. A total of 143 discussions with 3,584 postings (74 discussions with a total of 1,833 postings in January and 69 discussions with a total of 1,751 postings in July) comprised the initial dataset. During the initial immersion phase of content analysis, the primary author read the entire original discussions online in Japanese twice over the period of 1 month in order to become familiar with the material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363461513487308">Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006</xref>). Selection criteria included postings that indicated or referred to the following: (a) suicide wish/wish to die, including a current suicide wish, ambivalent suicide wish, passive/ambiguous suicide wish, or future suicide plan; and (b) circumstances/reasons that might have led the discussant to want to die. Based on these criteria, 307 postings (171 postings from January and 136 postings from July) by 201 individuals were chosen as the dataset for further analysis. All postings that referred to the research interest were identified and postings that were not explicitly related to the research interest were discarded. The dataset was checked by the primary author to identify whether any relevant postings went unidentified. For a further control check, a volunteer coder from a graduate program who was fluent in both Japanese and English was trained in the process of choosing the postings based on the criteria. He was given sample practice discussions in Japanese and was trained by the primary researcher to identify postings based on the given criteria. After the training and practice, he reviewed a set of discussion threads (37 discussions with 770 postings), which comprised 25% of the dataset. The kappa interrater reliability coefficient was 0.89 and the percentage agreement was 98%.</p>
<p>This study utilized a combination of data-driven inductive and theory-driven deductive approaches based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363461513487308">Shneidman’s (1985)</xref> theory. The process of qualitative content analysis does not occur in a clear-cut sequential manner and codes are modified as some codes decay and others develop throughout the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363461513487308">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). As part of the development, revision, and refinement of coding, themes based on Shneidman’s theory of suicide were integrated into the coding scheme of this study. Other related concepts, such as hopelessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363461513487308">Beck, Steer, Kovacs, &amp; Garrison, 1985</xref>), perceived burdensomeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363461513487308">Joiner, 2005</xref>), and belongingness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363461513487308">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363461513487308">Joiner, 2005</xref>) were also found in the thematic materials. Prior to coding, translation of postings from Japanese to English was necessitated, as only two coders, including the primary author, were bilingual. The primary author translated all selected postings. Subsequently, a coding frame, which contained operationalized definitions of all the themes and example postings, was developed in English, and is available upon request.</p>
<p>To enhance consistency and reliability of coding, control measures of revising, checking, and refinement of coding by multiple individuals were implemented. After creating the coding frame, the primary author checked coding by applying established codes on two occasions. Although this process of coding is impacted by subjectivity, as is typical in qualitative methodologies, consistent coding indicates that the distinctions between themes are internally consistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363461513487308">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). In order to enhance consistency and avoid idiosyncrasy, a second coder reviewed the coded themes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1363461513487308" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Numerous themes were identified among the postings on the Channel-2 Suicide Bulletin Board. We will first review themes related to types of suicide wishes, including ambivalent (29%), passive (17%), and group suicide wishes (12%), followed by example postings. Second, we will briefly identify other suicide-related themes that emerged. We will then detail six additional themes that were expressed recurrently by more than 20% of the discussants in order of descending frequency, followed by example postings: psychological pain (41%); seeking connection online (39%); interpersonal conflicts (33%); negative views of self and/or the world (27%); mental health diagnoses/symptoms (23%); and lack of support (21%). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1363461513487308">Figure 1</xref> provides a detailed summary of the codes used in the analysis and their frequency.

Such reasons included the following: “It’s scary to die alone”; “I want to get determination to die” (i.e., he or she would be less likely to back out if there were partners); and “I need someone who can help me organize and prepare to commit suicide.” Two discussants expressed a wish for <italic>oyako–shinju</italic> (parent–child suicide/murder suicide). Of the four discussants who indicated their preference for the group suicide method, three of them expressed a wish to use charcoal briquettes and one mentioned the inhalation of hydrogen sulfide gas, which has recently become a popular suicide method disseminated on the Internet in Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363461513487308">Namiki, 2008</xref>). Of 24 discussants, 15 who expressed the group suicide wish sought Internet group suicide partners, and seven responded to such solicitations.

<p>Out of 201 total discussants, 16 discussants (8%) mentioned past suicide attempts. In terms of how they viewed suicide, 25 discussants (12%) reported negative views, 16 (8%) reported positive views, and two reported neutral views of suicide. The examples of the negative view include comments such as the following: “dying is scary,” “death is meaningless,” “death is ugly,” “death is stupid,” “suicide burdens other people,” and “dying is lonely.” Most discussants who expressed positive views of suicide indicated that they believed death would ease or relieve their pain or rescue them from pain. Seven discussants confessed fantasies about what would happen after they committed suicide. All of them speculated about how other people would react to their suicides. All except for one speculated that other people would be happy if they died. Seven discussants expressed their “ideal ways of dying,” such as having easy, painless, or peaceful deaths. Example postings are the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>(ID 21): <italic>At least at the end of my life, I want to die with peaceful mind.</italic></p>
<p>(ID 71): <italic>Pure death, that’s the rescue. Freedom from everything and nothingness, the world of nothingness is what I long for.</italic></p></disp-quote></p>

<sec id="sec8-1363461513487308"><title>Psychological pain</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363461513487308">Shneidman (1985)</xref> argued that “intolerable psychological pain” (i.e., psychache) is one of the most important common stimuli in suicide (p. 124) and that individuals who contemplate suicide desperately want to escape unbearable feelings of impotence, hopelessness, and helplessness. The psychological pain dimension comprises postings that express the affective (<italic>n</italic> = 82, 41%), behavioral (<italic>n</italic> = 31, 15%), and cognitive (<italic>n</italic> = 27, 13%) components of psychological pain. Within the affective domain, negative emotions such as pain (<italic>n</italic> = 42), tiredness (<italic>n</italic> = 22), feeling trapped (<italic>n</italic> = 11), and loneliness (<italic>n</italic> = 6) were identified. The behavioral aspect of psychological pain includes self-mutilation (<italic>n</italic> = 16), crying (<italic>n</italic> = 11), and faking wellness (<italic>n</italic> = 9).</p>
<p>Faking wellness was defined as being deceptive about one’s wellbeing due to an inability to share pain or thoughts of suicide, which eventually leads to the worsening of psychological pain. The similar theme of being “fake” was also identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363461513487308">Ozawa-de Silva’s ethnographic study (2008)</xref>. She described this theme as fake interactions due to a lack of trust or a fear of being unaccepted. The code of fake-wellness in this study was associated with a combination of themes, including a wish to not become a burden to loved ones, which seems to reflect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363461513487308">Joiner’s (2005)</xref> concept of burdensomeness. Another theme related to fake-wellness was the fear of being rejected, which was similar to the theme identified by Ozawa-de Silva.</p>
<p>The fourth dimension of psychological pain, wish, refers to postings that express the wish to escape current situations. This is similar to the concept of egression, which is one of the 10 commonalities proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363461513487308">Shneidman (1985)</xref>: the common aim of suicide is the ultimate departure and escape from unbearable distress. This idea of “death as an escape from pain” also seems related to the concepts of cognitive constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363461513487308">Barak &amp; Miron, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363461513487308">Fekete, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363461513487308">Shneidman, 1993</xref>) and cognitive deconstruction, leading to a wish to escape from pain as well as painful self-awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363461513487308">Baumeister, 1990</xref>). Baumeister’s concept of cognitive deconstruction refers to a kind of a numb cognitive state that leads to decreased inhibition and impulse control. These researchers concluded that suicide is viewed as the ultimate and <italic>only</italic> way out of painful self-awareness and resulting emotional pain. Seven discussants expressed such wishes to escape.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363461513487308">Shneidman (1985)</xref> indicated that about 80% of suicide completers leave some clues to their intent: “Individuals intent on committing suicide, albeit ambivalently-minded about it, consciously or unconsciously emit signals of distress, indications of helplessness, pleas for response, and opportunities for rescue” (p. 144). Although these clues are ambiguous and in most cases become clear only after the individual dies by suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363461513487308">Maris, Berman, &amp; Silverman, 2000</xref>, Chapter 2), the theme of seeking connection online is crucial in understanding suicide contemplators’ signals for help.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, a substantial number of discussants (79 discussants, 39%) referenced some kind of wish to connect with others online. Twenty-three discussants sought some kind of solution from other discussants, 20 offered and/or received support from other discussants by directly interacting with particular discussants, 17 sought general support online, 14 referenced appreciation for universality or shared experience, and 20 sought suicide methods from other discussants online.</p>
<p>Five discussants clearly appreciated the positive effect of online interaction by stating that they changed their minds and decided to continue to live. Although one discussant definitively stated that he or she was still going to commit suicide despite the interaction, acknowledgement of the positive effect of online interactions on his or her mental state was included.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363461513487308">Shneidman (1985)</xref> indicated that suicidal individuals’ psychological pain is often caused by frustrated interpersonal needs. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363461513487308">Joiner (2005)</xref> addressed how failed belongingness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363461513487308">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>) caused by ruptured relationships leads to increased risk of suicide. According to Shneidman, when mental health professionals can adequately address suicidal patients’ disappointments and frustrated needs, suicide is likely to be prevented.</p>
<p>In this study, 66 discussants (33% of the total) commented on various kinds of interpersonal conflicts. Some of them identified those with whom they were having conflicts and some commented only on the nature of the conflicts. Most discussants (<italic>n</italic> = 51) expressed more than one kind of interpersonal problem. Nineteen discussants commented on conflicts with their parents, 16 at school, 14 with their families, and 11 with their mothers. In terms of the nature of interpersonal conflicts, bullying (<italic>n</italic> = 16), verbal abuse (<italic>n</italic> = 12), and betrayal (<italic>n</italic> = 11) were the most frequently mentioned themes among the discussants.</p>
<p>Related to the concept of belongingness, an interesting theme of “no place” was identified. <italic>Ibasho</italic> literally means a “place to live,” but it also connotes one’s presence in connection to others. In her work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363461513487308">Ozawa-de Silva (2010)</xref> also identified a similar theme of <italic>ibasho</italic> as a sense of belongingness and elaborated the idea in relation to the concept of selfhood embedded in an interpersonal social network. Seven discussants who expressed pain in having no <italic>ibasho</italic> seemed to be struggling to find their place within their social network, be it their family, school, or work.</p>

<p>Fifty-five discussants (27%) made comments that revealed their negative views of self and/or the world/life. Forty-seven discussants (23%) expressed comments related to negative self-view and 20 discussants (10%) made reference to negative world-view. Twelve discussants expressed both types of negative view. The negative view of self consisted of various types, including self-hatred, a lack of confidence and self-worth, and a feeling of being an outcast, useless, or weak. Many discussants expressed their negative view of themselves in relation to other people. Such comments included “I’m useless to others,” “I’m an outcast,” “I’m a burden and trouble to others,” “I’m undutiful,” or “I’m a burden/obstruction to others.” The following examples further reflect the idea of perceived burdensomeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363461513487308">Joiner, 2005</xref>).

<sec id="sec12-1363461513487308"><title>Mental health</title>
<p>Adjustment difficulty and/or lifelong maladaptive coping patterns are one of the characteristics of suicidal individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363461513487308">Leenaars, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363461513487308">Shneidman, 1985</xref>). A comprehensive study of completed suicides in North America and Europe showed that more than 90% of people suffered from at least one mental disorder at the time of death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461513487308">Bertolote, Fleischman, De Leo, &amp; Wasserman, 2004</xref>). Even when suicidal people do not fit into the diagnostic nosology of mental disorders, they are likely to display a pervasive pattern of difficulty in adjusting to negative life events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363461513487308">Leenaars, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, 46 out of 201 discussants indicated either mental health diagnoses or mental health-related symptoms. These two codes are distinguished by whether professionals have clearly indicated formal diagnoses, or whether a word related to an emotional state (e.g., depressed mood as opposed to depressive disorder) is being used. Twelve discussants indicated formal mental health diagnoses and 39 discussants commented on some kind of mental health-related symptoms. Five discussants commented on both formal diagnoses and mental health symptoms. All of the discussants who indicated formal diagnoses glossed the diagnosis as depressive disorder (<italic>utsubyo</italic>). Out of 39 discussants who mentioned mental health-related symptoms, 29 described more than one symptom. Most frequently referenced symptoms in descending order were a lack of energy (<italic>n</italic> = 11), social anxiety (<italic>n</italic> = 7), social withdrawal (including the reclusive <italic>hikikomori</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1363461513487308">2</xref></sup> <bold>(</bold><italic>n</italic> = 7), loss of interest (<italic>n</italic> = 6), depressed mood (<italic>n</italic> = 5) and sleep disturbance (<italic>n</italic> = 5). Six discussants also mentioned a family psychiatric history (<italic>n</italic> = 4) or family history of suicide (<italic>n</italic> = 2).</p>
<p>In terms of mental health treatment, it was not a surprise that only two discussants indicated receiving counseling, as the availability of such services is limited and seeking mental health therapy continues to be stigmatized in Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363461513487308">Naito, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363461513487308">Takahashi, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1363461513487308">2008</xref>). Other respondents indicated treatment such as medication (<italic>n</italic> = 10), seeing a psychiatrist (<italic>n</italic> = 5), or hospitalization (<italic>n</italic> = 1). Because the discussants were not specifically asked about their treatment, we do not know the absolute number of those who were actually seeking mental health services.

<sec id="sec14-1363461513487308" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to understand the diverse subjective experiences of contemporary Japanese who contemplated suicide over the Internet. Of the 201 discussants who expressed suicide wishes, various forms of suicide wish were identified. Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363461513487308">Shneidman’s (1985)</xref> theory of suicide, ambivalence regarding the suicide wish was found among 29% of discussants. Of particular interest to this study is the expression of a group suicide wish. It was notable that there were 24 (12%) discussants who expressed a group suicide wish. Five discussants identified particular suicide methods with a suicide wish and 20 sought suicide methods online. As the method of using charcoal briquettes has been disseminated by the Internet, media, and <italic>The Complete Suicide Manual</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363461513487308">Tsurumi, 1993</xref>), it was no surprise that those who specified a group suicide method mentioned the burning of charcoal briquettes as the preferred method. The expression of group suicide wishes was particularly notable as the Japanese government in 2005 developed official guidelines to prevent overt solicitation of group suicide on the Internet (Denki Tsushin Jigyousha Kyoukai, Telecom Service Kyoukai, Japan Internet Provider Kyoukai, &amp; Japan Cable Television Renmei, 2005). Based on such guidelines, many suicide-related websites began to prohibit and delete messages that expressed overt group suicide solicitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363461513487308">Shibui, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Among various themes identified in this study, the most frequently mentioned was the affective aspect of psychological pain (41%). When combined with cognitive and behavioral aspects, 70% of discussants indicated unbearable psychological pain and suffering. This finding is in agreement with other researchers’ findings that associated psychache with suicidality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363461513487308">Barak &amp; Miron, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363461513487308">DeLisle &amp; Holden, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363461513487308">Holden, Mehta, Cunningham, &amp; Mcleod, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363461513487308">Leenaars, 1996</xref>; Olie, Guillaume, Jaussent, Courtet, &amp; Jollant, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363461513487308">Shneidman, 1985</xref>). The results from this study add to the previous findings that indicated the role of unendurable psychological pain in suicide.</p>
<p>The second most recurring theme was seeking connection online (39%). Consistent with studies that have highlighted positive aspects of Internet-mediated interactions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363461513487308">Joinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363461513487308">Parks &amp; Floyd, 1996</xref>), Japanese discussants who contemplated suicide over the Internet were looking for connections with others. Many of them sought solutions for difficult problems and situations from other discussants, or offered and received support from each other. Some discussants also seemed to find comfort in universality and shared experiences with other discussants, which may have created a feeling of connection with others. This need for connection is in accordance with other findings that highlight the importance of affiliation and belongingness in wellbeing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363461513487308">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363461513487308">Joiner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363461513487308">Ozawa-de Silva, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363461513487308">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363461513487308">Shneidman, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363461513487308">Ozawa-de Silva (2010)</xref> discussed the need for affiliation from a sociocultural perspective when considering the causes of Internet suicide in Japan. In contrast to an often-simplified rhetoric of selfhood which is reduced to a dichotomy between Japanese collectivism and Western individualism, Ozawa-de Silva stressed how shared experience, the need for affiliation, and fear of being left behind play important roles in the phenomenon of Internet group suicide. In Japanese culture, in which the public dimension of self is emphasized and group experience is prioritized, many people may fear rejection or being “left behind” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363461513487308">Ozawa-de Silva, 2010</xref>, p. 409). In accordance with this view, this study found an emphasis on the call for interpersonal connections/affiliation, whether to continue to live or to plan group suicide.</p>
<p>In addition, this study found that discussants online benefited from discussing the otherwise stigmatized topic of suicide without being ostracized. Other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363461513487308">McKenna &amp; Green, 2002</xref>) have found this characteristic to be a unique benefit of online communications. Discussants in this study sought shared experiences with others and the Internet made it easy for them to find strangers, with whom they could be intimate yet anonymous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363461513487308">Tomita, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Interpersonal conflict was the third most frequently mentioned theme in this study. A significant number of discussants (33%) expressed interpersonal conflicts. The wide range of the nature of conflicts and the specificity of people with whom they had conflicts was notable, including parents, friends, lovers, spouses, siblings, coworkers, children, and grandparents. The expression of negative self-view (27%) was the fourth most frequently found theme in this study. This theme was similar in meaning to the concept of burdensomeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363461513487308">Joiner, 2005</xref>), where postings reflected discussants’ sense of self as someone ineffective and burdensome to those around them. Postings that expressed lack of support (21%) also spoke to discussants’ focus on difficulties in their social context. The theme of lack of support relates to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363461513487308">Shneidman’s (1998)</xref> concept of frustrated needs for affiliation, which “involves the needs to draw near and enjoyably cooperate or be reciprocal with an allied person” (p. 246). Themes related to “positive view of suicide,” “ideal deaths,” or “psychological pain leading to a wish to escape,” were also related to the idea of death as escape or eggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363461513487308">Shneidman, 1985</xref>). Such themes, along with those related to interpersonal conflict, negative self-view, and lack of support, are closely associated with concepts proposed by Western theorists.</p>
<p>However, the prevalence of themes that expressed discussants’ concerns about their social network or longing for connections was significant and perhaps may shed some light on the current Japanese sociocultural context. An interesting theme of “no place” was identified within the interpersonal conflict domain. The idea of belongingness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363461513487308">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363461513487308">Joiner, 2005</xref>) was directly reflected by this theme, where discussants expressed their psychological pain in having no place to exist within their social network, be it their family, school, or work. In her work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363461513487308">Ozawa-de Silva (2010)</xref> also identified <italic>ibasho</italic> as a sense of belongingness and explained the idea in relation to the concept of public self, which points to the concept of self in relation to others. The theme of having “no place” to belong seems to contradict the discourse on Japanese society often found in <italic>Nihonjinron</italic> and other culturalist writings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363461513487308">Benedict, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363461513487308">Doi, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363461513487308">Iga, 1986</xref>) that portray the Japanese people as embedded in an interdependent social network.</p>
<p>The terms <italic>Nihonjinron</italic> (theory of Japanese people) and <italic>Nihonbunkaron</italic> (theory of Japanese culture) are often used interchangeably and represent a “reservoir of knowledge [derived from popular to scholarly writings] on characteristics of Japanese culture, people, society, and history” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363461513487308">Befu, 2001</xref>, p. 2). Befu argued that the purpose of <italic>Nihonjinron</italic> is to demonstrate the uniqueness of Japan’s identity and to distinguish that identity from those of other cultures and ethnic groups by highlighting particular characteristics while ignoring others. Examples of such characteristics and concepts that are repeatedly mentioned in <italic>Nihonjinron</italic> as something unique to the Japanese include groupism, collectivism, and <italic>amae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363461513487308">Doi, 1973)</xref>, which refers to psychological interdependence. The need to belong, even in suicide, has been noted in other non-Japanese work as well, including work on cluster suicides among Aboriginal youth in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363461513487308">Neizen, 2009</xref>). The idea of belonging through suicide presents an interesting paradox in that contemplating suicide together with others is a means of fitting in with others even as one simultaneously feels a sense of not belonging in relation to the larger social structure.</p>
<p>Do the findings in this study—which support Western theoretical concepts but also reflect the discussants’ focus on interpersonal relationships and the desire to belong—point to the disintegration of close-knit social networks and the alienation of Japanese youth that some authors have identified? (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363461513487308">Ozawa-de Silva, 2008</xref>). The idea of failed belongingness is seen as particularly problematic for cultures in which people conceive of themselves interdependently in contrast to those in which autonomy is emphasized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363461513487308">Joiner, 2005</xref>). Are discussants looking for a role in their social network and somewhere to belong, contrary to the often-heard view of contemporary Japanese youth’s preference for individualism and materialism that began to emerge in the 1980s? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363461513487308">Möhwald, 2000</xref>). In her ethnographic study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363461513487308">Ozawa-de Silva (2008)</xref> argued that contemporary Japan has rejected “traditional Japanese extended-family structures” (p. 545) and incorporated Western individualism “at a price” (p. 545). Based on her view, the price is Japanese youths’ existential suffering and the loss of meaning, which were reflected in some of her selected online postings as well as in our study. She further argued that individuals who contemplate suicide and struggle with existential suffering find embeddedness or healing in dying together. This idea of existential suffering is differentiated from individual psychopathology or mental illness and is understood as broader form of human suffering in relation to a particular sociocultural context. Similarly, it can also be distinguished from Shneidman’s concept of psychache, which is related to the theme of psychological pain found in this study.</p>
<p>The desire to seek connection and the importance of interpersonal relationships are meaningful when considering suicide prevention measures. Out of 79 discussants who sought connections online, 20 indicated that they were seeking lethal suicide methods, whereas 54 sought some kind of solution to their problems, support, and/or shared experiences. Even though some discussants solicited group suicide partners and sought suicide methods online, this study found that more discussants used the bulletin board to seek connection with others and to share their experiences in a positive manner.</p>
<p>Many suicidal people give some signs to others, even though these signs are often ambiguous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363461513487308">Maris et al., 2000</xref>). Suicide notes can be perceived as communications, and what distinguishes people who leave suicide notes from those who do not is “their wish to communicate with others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363461513487308">Maris et al., 2000</xref>, p. 273). Even though online communications on suicide bulletin boards are not suicide notes per se, many discussants on the Channel-2 Suicide Bulletin Board expressed wishes to communicate with others. However, these communications were characterized by the uncertainty and ambivalence observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363461513487308">Fekete, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363461513487308">Shneidman, 1985</xref>). Clearly, those who contemplate suicide over the Internet are often ambivalent and take their time to surf the net, indicating an opportunity for intervention through appropriate suicide prevention websites. As researchers have noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363461513487308">Barak &amp; Buchanan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363461513487308">Castelnuovo, Gaggioli, Mantovani, &amp; Riva, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363461513487308">Gilat &amp; Shahar, 2007</xref>), the Internet may serve as a helpful medium in implementing suicide prevention measures, and in reaching those who do not seek mental health services otherwise. Internet websites that focus on suicide prevention may reach Japanese who contemplate suicide online and do not seek mental health services otherwise, as we found with participants contemplating suicide in our study.</p>
<p>There are several important limitations to this study. We examined only one suicide bulletin board in depth, and the discussants who logged onto the Channel-2 Suicide Bulletin Board represent a particular subgroup of contemporary Japanese. Therefore, the findings from this particular suicide bulletin board are not generalizable to the Japanese population as a whole or to Western suicide bulletin boards. A second limitation is a lack of information regarding the demographic characteristics of the online discussants. Although many discussants identified themselves as male or female and some discussants’ names were suggestive of their gender, there was no way to confirm gender. Similarly, the ages of discussants went largely unreported. Of the limited number of discussants who did provide their ages and school grades, the youngest discussants were in seventh grade and the oldest were in their 40s. In addition, although recent studies have demonstrated the authenticity of many forms of online communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363461513487308">Bargh et al., 2002</xref>), the question of trustworthiness of the discussants’ comments remains. This is compounded in the area of suicide research because people’s intentions to die are often inconsistent and ambivalent, and thus difficult to measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363461513487308">Maris et al., 2000</xref>, Chapter 2). A related limitation is how to determine the percentage of suicide contemplators who eventually became suicide completers.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the issue of censorship associated with recent suicide bulletin boards. Due to the Japanese government’s efforts in recent years, direct group suicide solicitations have been prohibited. Although it appears to be impossible to censor all interactions, (as this study found a significant number of discussants soliciting group suicide partners), the <italic>kanrinin</italic>, or bulletin board manager, is instructed to erase such solicitations from the archives and ongoing discussions as they come up. It is likely that the climate of censorship has decreased the frequency of such expressions online and affected the findings of this study.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1363461513487308" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Against the backdrop of a Japanese cultural context where suicide has historically occupied an important role, this study of Internet suicide bulletin board postings found various individual themes related to those identified in Shneidman’s (1985) theory of suicide (e.g., psychological pain, hopelessness, and escape) as well as mental health issues. In addition to such intrapsychic themes, the predominant concerns remained interpersonal (e.g., seeking connection online, interpersonal conflict, lack of support, and group suicide wish). On the one hand, the results of this study speak to the universality of suicidal individuals’ emotional suffering in the West and Japan; on the other hand, a closer examination of themes reflects the discussants’ interpersonal concerns, reflective of values deeply embedded in Japanese culture.</p>
<p>The themes found in this study also highlight an interesting combination of traditional and contemporary aspects of Internet suicide. Internet group suicide participants combine a contemporary communication method (the Internet) with traditional tools of <italic>shichirin</italic> and charcoal briquettes to effect death. Though participants were looking for affiliation, connection was sought in a quasi-community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363461513487308">Ozawa-de Silva, 2008</xref>) with intimate strangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363461513487308">Tomita, 2005</xref>). Suicide prevention requires a better grasp of the sociocultural backdrop against which Internet group suicide has arisen, including changes in Japanese culture, diversification of individual experience, and the struggles of contemporary Japanese youth to find interpersonal connection as well as a place where they can belong. Future research also can address the use of the Internet as a way of implementing preventive measures, especially for those individuals who might not seek mental health services otherwise.</p>
