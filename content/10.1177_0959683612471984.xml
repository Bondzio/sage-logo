<abstract>
<p>Omnsbreen is a small (&lt;0.5 km<sup>2</sup>) and degrading glacier situated at the regional lower limit of present-day permafrost distribution and glaciation. At present, the existence of Omnsbreen is mainly dependent on wind-borne snow redistributed by the prevailing westerly winter-wind, and lies in an area of marginal permafrost occurrence. During the ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) both the glacier and the distribution of permafrost in the area reached their maximum late-Holocene areal extents. The first occurrence of Omnsbreen is recorded in sediment cores retrieved from a proglacial lake and dated at <sc>ad</sc> 1425, and marks the onset of the local LIA. Reconstruction of the maximum LIA extent by means of geomorphic indicators revealed a size of 7.1 km<sup>2</sup>, a volume of more than 0.25 km<sup>3</sup> and a maximum glacier thickness of 110 m. Since the LIA Omnsbreen has been reduced by more than 90% in area. Omnsbreen retreated rapidly from its LIA maximum, which we suggest was determined by the shape of the glacier, filling up the valley, and hence being unable to accumulate wind-borne snow. Prominent glacier marginal landforms are absent along the maximum LIA extent of Omnsbreen. We propose that the lack of glacier marginal landforms in this case is indicative of a cold glacier margin, and that the landscape evolution in maritime and marginal permafrost regions is characterised as being closely connected with glacial activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Glacial activity has served as one of the main sources for palaeoclimatic reconstructions of the Late Pleistocene and Holocene in Scandinavia. In addition, permafrost holds a strong climate signal, but this signal is harder to measure and observe, as permafrost is thermally defined and a subsurface phenomenon. Traditionally, landforms and processes related to glaciers and permafrost are treated as separate research fields in the cryospheric literature. However, in nature, these phenomena commonly coexist and have the potential to interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683612471984">Berthling and Etzelmüller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683612471984">Etzelmüller and Hagen, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683612471984">Haeberli, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0959683612471984">Shumskii, 1964</xref>). Most glaciers in Norway disappeared during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM; in Scandinavia at 9000–5000 yr BP), and reappeared following this warm period as a Neoglacial phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959683612471984">Nesje, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0959683612471984">Nesje et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683612471984">2008</xref>). The Holocene history of permafrost is generally less studied in Norway than the glacier variations, which is also the case globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683612471984">Harris and Murton, 2005</xref>). A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683612471984">Lilleøren et al., 2012</xref>) suggests that the Holocene mountain permafrost variation in Norway in many ways resembles the glacial history. However, unlike the glaciers, permafrost at the highest altitudes has presumably existed continuously since deglaciation, and probably also beneath cold-based parts of the Fennoscandian ice sheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683612471984">Kleman and Borgström, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683612471984">Kleman and Hättestrand, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0959683612471984">Sollid and Sørbel, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0959683612471984">1994</xref>). The Holocene permafrost most likely reached both its maximum spatial extent and depth during the ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) underlying areas which are currently thawed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683612471984">Gisnås et al., 2013</xref>), and likewise some glaciers might be looked upon as strictly LIA phenomena.</p>
<p>Whereas glaciers are defined as part of the hydrosphere, permafrost is defined as a part of the lithosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0959683612471984">Shumskii, 1964</xref>), with the thermal regime as the common denominator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683612471984">Berthling and Etzelmüller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683612471984">Etzelmüller and Hagen, 2005</xref>). Permafrost and glaciers commonly coexist and interact in regions where the lower mountain permafrost occurrence is situated well below the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) of glaciers (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683612471984">Etzelmüller and Hagen, 2005</xref>). Hence, glaciers and mountain permafrost coexist in areas that are sufficiently high and thus cold enough for permafrost to occur, while still receiving the necessary amount of precipitation to maintain glaciers (cf. the ‘cryosphere model’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683612471984">Haeberli and Burn, 2002</xref>). In Norway the mountain permafrost altitude (MPA) decreases from west towards east, while the opposite is the case for the ELA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683612471984">Etzelmüller et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683612471984">King, 1986</xref>), and glacier–permafrost interactions occur in central mountain regions such as the Jotunheimen massif, where the two zones overlap. In the outskirts of such zones, where the environment is sensitive to permafrost and/or glacier formation, the simplest relationship is that heavy winter (accumulation season) snowfall produces glaciers whereas low winter snowfall favours permafrost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683612471984">Harris and Corte, 1992</xref>). In this strictest sense, permafrost aggradation and glacier formation and existence are mutually exclusive processes, and should not occur simultaneously whenever any of these phenomena are close to marginal conditions. In warm permafrost environments the distribution of snow can be decisive of the permafrost extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0959683612471984">Smith and Riseborough, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In areas of permafrost, glaciers provide a thermal offset between the ground surface and the atmosphere. Depending on winter air temperatures, glacier dynamics and snow cover over the summer, parts of the glacier will remain cold, frozen to its bed and preserve sub-zero ground temperatures. The thickness of the cold ice may vary from less than 10 m in marginal permafrost areas such as reported from the Finse area (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959683612471984">Liestøl, 2000</xref>), via several tens of meters on glaciers on Svalbard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683612471984">Björnsson et al., 1996</xref>) to hundreds of meters in the large ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland with cold firn accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0959683612471984">Paterson, 1994</xref>). In areas with warm firn and summer melting, typical for most glaciers in Norway and Svalbard, meltwater will penetrate the firn areas and refreeze, leading to temperate conditions in the firn zone. Ice below the ELA will be colder because of meltwater evacuation from the impermeable ice surface, leading to temperature inversions in the glacier (i.e. polythermal glaciers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959683612471984">Liestøl, 1977</xref>). Independent of the climatic situation also small, initially temperate glaciers will become cold or polythermal during retreat owing to energy loss when meltwater escapes the increasing ablation area, and the corresponding firn areas are reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683612471984">Hock, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0959683612471984">Paterson, 1994</xref>). Locally, permafrost will develop in connection to such retreating glaciers. The latter is also the case for small, long-term stable ice patches, which can be considered a permafrost indication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683612471984">Haeberli, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>At present, most of the glaciers in Norway decrease in volume as a response to the ongoing atmospheric warming (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683612471984">Andreassen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683612471984">Dyurgerov, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683612471984">Nesje et al., 2008</xref>), a situation that has lasted since the late-Holocene glacial maximum during the LIA (mid-18th century). Mass loss has accelerated in recent decades (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683612471984">Andreassen et al., 2005</xref>). Several processes are involved in such glacial retreats. In addition to changes in summer temperature and winter precipitation, an important factor is how wind-redistributed snow locally may control the existence and geometry of glaciers. Thus, individual glacier response to climate perturbations can vary considerably even within small geographical regions depending on glacier size, shape, aspect and local topography.</p>
<p>In this paper, we present a new investigation of the age, extent, volume and dynamics of Omnsbreen, a small glacier or glacieret north of Finse in southern Norway. This glacier is situated in an area where the lower glaciation limit and the lower limit of mountain permafrost overlap, located in a snow-rich maritime and relative mild climatic setting. We hypothesize that interactions between glaciers and permafrost provide important constraints for understanding Holocene landscape development in such an environment. The objective was first addressed by mapping and reconstructing the maximum glacier geometry, using geomorphological indicators. Further, the first appearance of the glacier during the late Holocene was constrained by analysing lacustrine sediment cores from a proglacial lake (Omnsvatnet) northeast of Omnsbreen. Finally, a permafrost model was used to examine the probable ground thermal regime in the area during the maximum extent of the glacier and at present.</p>

<title>Study area</title>
<p>The Omnsbreen glacier is situated approximately 5 km north of Finse, at the northwestern rim of the Hardangervidda high mountain plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683612471984">Figure 1</xref>). At present, the glacier is a small (&lt;0.5 km<sup>2</sup>) mountain glacier or glacieret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683612471984">Cogley et al., 2011</xref>) existing close to or a little lower than the regional ELA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683612471984">Andreassen et al., 2010</xref>) at around 1700 m a.s.l. mainly as a result of high local snow accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683612471984">Liestøl and Sollid, 1980</xref>). At present the remnants of Omnsbreen occupy elevations between 1500 and 1700 m a.s.l. Current glacier thickness and hence volume is unknown. During the LIA the glacier was considerable larger, and filled the entire north/south-trending valley where it at present only occupies parts of the western slope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683612471984">Liestøl and Sollid, 1980</xref>). From the LIA maximum until around 1930 the glacier remained relatively stable in shape and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683612471984">Elven, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683612471984">Liestøl and Sollid, 1980</xref>). Between 1930 and 1985, however, the bulk of the glacier disappeared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683612471984">Høgvard, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959683612471984">Messel, 1971</xref>). Since then the glacier has lost mass at a lower rate, until recent years when the glacier apparently has stagnated at a fairly constant size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683612471984">Figure 2</xref>). Most of the western maritime glaciers in Norway stopped retreating and even gained mass during the last part of the 1980s and throughout the 1990s, as a response to higher winter precipitation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959683612471984">Nesje and Matthews, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959683612471984">Nesje et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683612471984">2008</xref>). Omnsbreen is not surrounded by headwalls and neither currently or during its LIA maximum stage was extra-glacial debris added to the glacier surface.</p>

<p>Climatically, the Finse area is situated in a transition zone between the maritime western coast and the more continental eastern parts of Norway, and has a high mountain climate. Precipitation and temperature, and hence glaciers, in these western mountain areas are affected by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), as for example evident by the glacier advances during the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683612471984">Nesje et al., 2008</xref>). At <italic>c</italic>. 1220 m a.s.l., about 300 m lower than Omnsbreen, the mean annual air temperature (MAAT) is −2.1°C (1971–2000), and the mean annual precipitation (MAP) in the same period is 1030 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683612471984">DNMI, 2007</xref>). Maximum snow thickness in the region is between 200 and 400 cm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0959683612471984">SeNorge, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The bedrock in the Omnsbreen catchment is dominated by phyllite of both the dark mica-rich type and the lighter quartz-rich type. Phyllite is a pholiated, easily weathered and erodable metamorphosed slate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0959683612471984">Sigmond and Askvik, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Permafrost in southern Norway is present in high-mountain areas, with a general lower limit of approximately 1500–1600 m a.s.l. and is mainly concentrated in a 50–100 km wide belt from Hallingskarvet as its southern margin and widens following the main mountain range from SW to NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683612471984">Etzelmüller et al., 2003a</xref>). Hence, the Finse mountain area is situated close to the present lower limit of mountain permafrost. Permafrost models for Norway (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683612471984">Etzelmüller et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683612471984">2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683612471984">Gisnås et al., 2013</xref>), suggest permafrost occurrence both in Hallingskarvet and at the margins of Omnsbreen and Hardangerjøkulen. Further, modelling indicates that larger areas were underlain by permafrost during the LIA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683612471984">Figure 3</xref>). Indications of permafrost in the Finse area have been reported from Midtdalsbreen, a northern outlet glacier of Hardangerjøkulen, where cold ice (&lt;0°C) and frozen subglacial till have been observed along the margin of the glacier lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683612471984">Liestøl and Sollid, 1980</xref>). Also, DC-resistivity soundings on mountain areas surrounding Finse at above 1450 m a.s.l. and in front of Midtdalsbreen indicate permafrost at snow-free sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683612471984">Etzelmüller et al., 2003b</xref>). In addition, thermistor strings installed in Omnsbreen in March 1985 showed that the uppermost 2–3 m of ice never reached temperatures at the pressure melting point, while a positive temperature gradient into the ice indicated pressure melting point conditions at the glacier bed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683612471984">Høgvard, 1987</xref>).</p>

<p>Air, ground and surface temperatures were measured hourly using TinyTag© miniature temperature loggers (MTDs) with an accuracy of ±0.1°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683612471984">Figure 1</xref>). The loggers measuring air temperature were installed in ventilated stone cairns at snow free locations, and up to 50 cm above ground. Ground sensors were placed down to 100 cm. Meteorological data were otherwise obtained from the Norwegian Meteorological Office (DNMI), mainly from two different meteorological stations situated at Finse (‘Finse’, 1904–1924 and 1969–1994, and ‘Finsevatn’, 2002–present). Because of the poor temporal coverage of the data, records from three different meteorological stations in Bergen were used to interpolate the data sets from Finse. The Bergen data sets contain temperature data from 1861 and precipitation data from 1904.</p>

<p>Landforms observed in the glacial zone that are indicative of glacier movement include striae, crag-and-tails, boulder tracks in the till, drumlins, flutings and eskers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683612471984">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, several recession stages of Omnsbreen produced glacier-dammed lakes and associated shorelines and spillways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683612471984">Høgvard, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683612471984">Liestøl and Sollid, 1980</xref>). Finally, ‘domino’-structures of bedrock piles were interpreted as ice-marginal or glacier-overridden features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683612471984">Figures 6e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683612471984">f</xref>). The ‘domino’-structures are caused by glacier ice movement against exposed slabs of layered phyllite bedrock. The phyllite dip 5–10° towards the east and at places where the LIA Omnsbreen had an easterly ice flow component, protruding slabs of phyllite were broken off and rotated in the direction of ice flow. This process produced a landform pattern that visually resembles a collapsed row of domino bricks. These rotated slabs of phyllite are difficult to explain other than by glacier overriding, especially where they have been rotated upslope. They are especially frequent along the eastern slope of the main valley Omnsdalen, and in the absence of moraines we have used the outermost occurrences of ‘domino’-structures to delimit the maximum LIA extension of Omnsbreen. Related landforms have been observed in the Scottish Cairngorm Mountains where toppling of tors is interpreted as an erosional effect of cold-based ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0959683612471984">Phillips et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Reconstruction of the glacier geometry and associated parameters</title>
<p>Based on landform mapping the outer limits of the LIA glacier geometry were established. First, we limited the previously glacierized zone based on the geomorphological map and in field. The rest of the procedure were performed in the ESRI software ArcMap©, first by digitizing surface contour lines at 25 m spacing based on the assumption that the steepest surface slope is aligned parallel to the direction of the glacier movement, thus the contour lines are oriented perpendicular to the direction of the striae, crag-and-tails and boulder tracks. The glacier surface was interpolated from elevation points at the glacier margin and the interpreted contour lines, using the ArcGIS-inbuilt ‘Topo to raster’-tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683612471984">Hutchinson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683612471984">Hutchinson and Dowling, 1991</xref>).

The volume between the LIA glacier surface and the terrain was calculated subtracting the LIA surface from the current DEM.

CryoGRID1.0 operates as a three-layer system: (1) the mean annual air temperature (MAAT), (2) the mean annual ground surface temperature (MAGST), and (3) the mean annual temperature at the top of the permafrost/base of the seasonal frozen layer (TTOP/MAGT), and requires scaling factors (<italic>n</italic>-factors) dependent on snow depth in winter and vegetation in summer to adjust air temperatures to ground temperatures. The climatic input data for CryoGRID1.0 is average degree-days over a chosen climatic period and the average snow depth.

<title>Observations on temperature, lapse rates, wind and snow cover</title>
<p>The regressions between temperatures measured in Bergen and at Omnsbreen are slightly better than between Finse and Omnsbreen (<italic>r<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.91 and <italic>r<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.88 (<italic>N</italic> = 1475), respectively), in spite of the much closer distance. This is due to winter temperature inversions local to the Finse area, as the meteorological station at Finse measures lower air temperatures than the MTDs at Omnsbreen. Omnsbreen is freely exposed to circulating air masses, and the largest temperature inversions occur on cold and calm winter days. The average annual lapse rate is 0.0067°C/m both between Bergen and Omnsbreen and between Finse and Omnsbreen for the years of observations from Omnsbreen. The extrapolated MAAT series of Omnsbreen since 1862 shows a warming tendency towards modern time, however, 2010 is the sixth coldest year in the temperature data set, and the coldest year since 1919 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0959683612471984">Figure 7</xref>).

<p>Mapping of snow-cover surface forms as an indicator for wind direction demonstrated that the prevailing winter wind direction in the area is from west or slightly southwest, which is consistent with the most recent measurements in the Finse valley (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683612471984">Figure 4c</xref>). Here, a second component of the wind direction comes from the southeast, reproducing the orientation of the valley axis. In Bergen the same two dominant wind directions are present, i.e. northwesterly and east-southeasterly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683612471984">Figure 4a</xref>). The valley where Omnsbreen is situated has a north–south orientation and snow transported by westerly winds today effectively accumulates on the valley’s east-facing slope. Wind directions measured at the meteorological station in the Finse valley show a shift in the dominating wind direction since the 1970s to present, from a wide directional spread during winter to a more consistent westerly wind flow since the early 1980s. This shift also coincides with the decelerating mass loss from the Omnsbreen glacier.</p>

This can be due to the general higher winter precipitation recorded in western Norway in the same period. Hence, there is no clear relationship between mass loss at Omnsbreen and the ablation rate from the degree-day model used here.</p>

<title>Glacial geomorphology at Omnsbreen</title>
<p>The LIA glaciated zone is characterized by apparently thick sediment depositions in topographic depressions surrounded by exposed bedrock. Sediments are both till and in situ weathered material from the highly pholiated phyllitic bedrock in the area. The general appearance is that of a recently deglaciated area, with typical glacial landforms such as striae, eskers, crag-and-tails, moraines, flutings and plough marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683612471984">Figure 5</xref>). The mentioned landforms occur frequently throughout the area (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683612471984">Figure 6</xref> for pictures of landforms). Terminal moraines were observed, though do not mark the maximum extent of the glacier, but rather re-advances within the glacial zone at later stages; which stages, however, are unclear. Relict shorelines at different levels were observed above Lake Omnstjern, indicating several former lake levels. Lateral meltwater channels were observed in a limited amount. Erosional landforms such as roche moutonnées occur in the area, and striations very frequently occur on exposed bedrock sites, and often with more than one direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683612471984">Figure 5c</xref>). ‘Domino’-structures occur frequently close to the current glacier margin and in the eastern LIA glacier zone.</p>

<sec id="section12-0959683612471984">
<title>Reconstruction of LIA glacier geometry and extent</title>
<p>The extent of Omnsbreen during the LIA is estimated from mapping of the geomorphological features previously listed. In the absence of a well-developed system of terminal moraines, we delimited the maximum glacier extent using other landforms, in particular radial striae and ‘domino’-structures. Thus, the extent of the glacier was interpreted based on dynamical criteria, where only zones with a clear indication of glacier movement were considered as formerly glaciated. It is likely that the margins of the dynamically active glacier were connected to firn areas that never underwent significant deformation, as the vegetation appearance of the two zones is not very different. Based on crossing directions of striae and tentative identification of striae pre-dating LIA at Omnsbreen, the initiation area of the glacier is interpreted to have been on the western slope of the valley, close to where the remnants of the glacier is situated today, and with initial movement towards the east more or less across the main valley orientation. However, when the glacier reached the eastern valley slope it was forced to diverge and flow south- and northwards and an ice divide developed. In the northern zone the valley slopes are steep and terminate in a flat plain leading into Lake Omnsvatn. In the steep part of the valley the glacier velocity was presumably high, resulting in correspondingly high shear stress on the substrata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0959683612471984">Figure 8</xref>). The glacier itself might have terminated into the lake, or close to the present shoreline. In this area, the potential mapping error of the glacier extent is particularly high, as most ice marginal landforms probably have been removed by later fluvial erosion. In the southern zone of the main valley, the glacier terminated on a gentle slope towards the larger Finse valley, but did not reach all the way down. As the glacier grew, an ice divide that extended obliquely across the valley developed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0959683612471984">Figure 8</xref>). At this maximum stage the glacier behaved more like a plateau glacier than a valley glacier.</p>

<p>Based on our estimation this maximum area covered by the LIA glacier was <italic>c</italic>. 7.1 km<sup>2</sup>, with an estimated maximum LIA thickness of 110 m. The interpreted LIA glacier surface has a maximum elevation of <italic>c</italic>. 1610 m a.s.l. and a minimum elevation of 1320 m a.s.l. The estimated ELA was then at <italic>c</italic>. 1530 m a.s.l. assuming a 60/40 relationship between area above and below the ELA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683612471984">Haeberli et al., 2005</xref>). The total length of the glacier was <italic>c</italic>. 5 km, while the southern flowlines are <italic>c</italic>. 1.5 km and the northern flowlines <italic>c</italic>. 2.4 km dispersed from a fairly flat summit area (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683612471984">Table 1</xref>). The maximum calculated shear stress occurs in the northern zone of the LIA glacier, where the surface slope is high, close to where the northern remnant of Omnsbreen currently is situated. The values range up to 70 kPa, while the average values are around 25 kPa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0959683612471984">Figure 8c</xref>). The annual deformation velocity is low, with maximum values at 3 m/yr, while major parts of the glacier deformed less than 1 m/yr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0959683612471984">Figure 8d</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683612471984">Haeberli and Hoelzle (1995)</xref> the annual ablation of LIA Omnsbreen was 1.1 m w.e., however based on modern mass balance gradients. This value is in accordance with values measured at Midtdalsbreen. The response time of LIA Omnsbreen was estimated to <italic>c</italic>. 100 years. In Norway the maximum Holocene position of glaciers occurred during the LIA, and is usually dated to the mid-18th century. According to interpretations of the lake sediment record in Omnsvatnet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0959683612471984">Sægrov, 2006</xref>), Omnsbreen reached its maximum LIA extent at around <sc>ad</sc> 1580, which is significantly earlier than other glaciers where such data exist, and following a period of retreat, reached another maxima at <sc>ad</sc> 1820, however, slightly less extensive than the first.</p>

<title>Changes of Omnsbreen between the LIA and the present</title>
<p>Comparison of maps from the reconstructed LIA situation with the current (2007) situation makes it possible to quantify glacier changes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683612471984">Table 1</xref>). In total the area of Omnsbreen has been reduced by <italic>c</italic>. 6.5 km<sup>2</sup>, which is more than 90% of the maximum size during the LIA. In the same period the volume has been reduced by 0.25 km<sup>3</sup>. Most of the glacier change occurred between 1930 and 1985 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683612471984">Figure 2</xref>), to our knowledge representing a glacier mass loss rate unknown from elsewhere in Norway. Between 1955 and 2007, the glacier decreased spatially from 3 km<sup>2</sup> to 0.5 km<sup>2</sup>, an area reduction of more than 80%. The glacieret or even ice patches that constitute Omnsbreen at present is a type of accumulation often connected with permafrost areas, based on the assumption that they by definition are thin and the surface temperature does not exceed 0°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683612471984">Haeberli, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0959683612471984">Nesje et al., 2012</xref>).

<title>Stratigraphy and datings</title>
<p>In the lake record a distinct change in the sedimentation rate in Omnsvatnet is observed, from ~0.27 to ~1.47 mm/yr combined with a decrease in the organic content and an increase in the silt content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0959683612471984">Figure 9</xref>). This event was dated to <sc>ad</sc> 1425 ± 85 yr and interpreted to represent the formation of Omnsbreen in the lake catchment. This date is in close agreement with radiocarbon-dated terrestrial plant remains that were covered when Omnsbreen was formed, dated at <sc>ad</sc> 1430 ± 100 yr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683612471984">Elven, 1978</xref>). In addition, based on the analyses of the sediments in Lake Omnsvatnet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0959683612471984">Sægrov (2006)</xref> inferred significant glacier advances of Omnsbreen around <sc>ad</sc> 1580, 1630 and 1820, at 47 cm, 38 cm and 12 cm depth, respectively. Based on this we assume an initial LIA glacier formation in the Omnsbreen area during the 15th century, which roughly corresponds to the onset of the LIA period in northern Europe (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683612471984">Grove, 1988</xref>).</p>

<title>Ground thermal regime and permafrost modelling</title>
<p>At the three sites at Omnsbreen where air temperatures are recorded, the mean temperatures are negative for each of the four full years of measurements, whereas the mean ground surface and ground temperatures at different depths, with one exception, are positive, indicating a positive temperature gradient from the surface into the ground (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0959683612471984">Table 2</xref> for all ground temperature characteristics). From these observations, permafrost is not widely expected in the area today. However, at 100 cm depth at site 4 a large year-to-year variation in the period of measurements is observed, from positive temperatures the first years (2007–2010) of measurements to prevailing negative temperatures in 2010–2011 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0959683612471984">Figure 10</xref>). Observations on snow and meteorology show that the first two years of measurements were characterized by a thick snow cover at site 4, while the last two years both were characterized by low winter temperatures in combination with a shallow snow cover. In 2010 temperatures at site 4 were distinctly lower than the previous years, especially at 100 cm depth, and the temperature during the summer 2011 was never positive. Indeed, an attempt to change a malfunctioning sensor at 50 cm depth in early September 2011 revealed frozen ground at 30 cm depth. The MAAT is presumably too high to allow for widespread permafrost, but discontinuous to more sporadic permafrost patches may exist at this elevation today, especially at wind-exposed sites.</p>

<title>The temporal constraint of Omnsbreen</title>
<p>The formation of Omnsbreen in the 15th century was considerably later than other Norwegian glaciers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959683612471984">Nesje, 2009</xref>), including the adjacent Hardangerjøkulen to the south. There, stratigraphic studies in proglacial terrestrial sites and downstream lakes in the Finse area show that the glacier reformed around 3800 cal. yr BP after having been periodically totally melted away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683612471984">Dahl and Nesje, 1996</xref>). Before the onset of the LIA glacier advance of Blåisen, a northern outlet glacier of Hardangerjøkulen, at approximately <sc>ad</sc> 1400, the glacier was in advanced position around <sc>ad</sc> 1050–1100 and <sc>ad</sc> 1200–1250.</p>
<p>The topographical setting of Omnsbreen makes this glacier sensitive to changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), influencing winter precipitation. The times of significant glacier advances of Omnsbreen may indicate a predominantly positive NAO weather mode during the LIA, in close agreement with the evidence presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959683612471984">Nesje et al. (2007)</xref>. Mass balance measurements at Rembesdalsskåka, a SW outlet glacier from Hardangerjøkulen located about 15 km SSW of Omnsbreen, show that the net mass balance is related to the NAO index (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.5).</p>

<sec id="section18-0959683612471984">
<title>Development of Omnsbreen</title>
<p>Westerly and southwesterly winds presently reaching the western coast of Norway channels through the fjord branches and, when reaching the high-altitude paleic surface at the end of the fjord, snow will be transported across the plateau, until reaching the valley where Omnsbreen is located. This situation, in combination with the mapped snow cover surface forms and the measured wind directions at Finse, indicates that the topographical location in the landscape makes Omnsbreen an almost ideal example of a glacier nurtured mainly by wind-transported snow. The combination of higher wind velocities and lower temperatures at the onset of the LIA around <sc>ad</sc> 1400 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683612471984">Kreutz et al., 1997</xref>), led to the formation of Omnsbreen in the western slope of a valley where permafrost was probably under development given the currently very sensitive ground thermal regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0959683612471984">Figure 11</xref>). At its maximum LIA position, the geometry of the glacier made accumulation of snow redistributed by wind less efficient, and it is likely that the summit areas of the glacier were subjected to deflation by the westerly winds, thus limiting the glacier from further vertical growth. However, the thickness of the glacier led to temperate basal conditions and talik formation. As the glacier retreated, it once again became possible for wind-redistributed snow to accumulate efficiently in lee areas, and the presently small glacier is probably entirely dependent on this accumulation of wind-transported snow for its continued existence. One cannot rule out the possibility that similar wind- and topography-induced changes between these two semi-stable glacier situations have occurred several times during the Holocene history of Omnsbreen glacier. Also the permafrost is sensitive to the distribution of snow. Thick and stable snow cover early in the season protects the ground from heat loss during winter, while a thin snow cover leads to directly linked ground and air temperatures. Thus, the wind-distributed snow that sustains the presence of Omnsbreen in turn reduces the potential of perennial frozen ground conditions.</p>

<title>The spatial constraint of Omnsbreen</title>
<p>Previous mapping of the glacier’s maximum extent during the LIA suggested an area of 12–14 km<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683612471984">Elven, 1978</xref>). This study, however, probably included perennial firn and snow patches and combined these with other glaciers further northwest, which, according to the present study, was not dynamically connected to Omnsbreen during the LIA. The present study suggests a maximum area of Omnsbreen of around 7.1 km<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683612471984">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, by calculating the area of Omnsbreen as interpreted from maps drawn in 1927 the result is 5.8 km<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683612471984">Elven, 1978</xref>) or 6.8 km<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683612471984">Liestøl and Sollid, 1980</xref>). If this is correct, the bulk of the glacier disappeared during a period of only 55 years, from 1930 to 1985, until it reached its current size of less than 0.5 km<sup>2</sup>. In the same period, the total glacier area in Jotunheimen was reduced by 23%, with an area loss of up to 60% for a few individual glaciers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683612471984">Andreassen et al., 2008</xref>). To our knowledge, the rate of mass loss observed at Omnsbreen is unparalleled in observations elsewhere.</p>
<p>Lack of glacier marginal landforms indicative of an active glacier terminus such as terminal moraines can be due to at least four different and mutually inclusive explanations; (1) lack of surrounding headwalls where extra-glacial debris input could be formed, which is a common feature where glaciers e.g. form large, and sometimes ice-cored moraines (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0959683612471984">Zemp et al., 2005</xref>), (2) little erosion of the substrata, and as a consequence little mobilization of debris available for moraine formation, (3) gradual transition from a dynamically active glacier to non-active perennial firn- and ice-fields, and (4) low landforming potential because of cold glacier margins terminating in a permafrost environment. Explanations (1), (3) and (4) are all plausible in this area, whereas explanation (2) does not seem valid. Below the central parts of the former glacier and in the areas with maximum shear stress landforms and sediment cover rather indicate that the subglacial activity has been high. Explanation (4) is supported by our CryoGRID1.0 results of the LIA, independent of glacier presence.</p>
<p>Both the calculated deformation velocity and shear stress of the maximum LIA Omnsbreen are low, and reflect the limited thickness over large parts of the glacier. However, the values are comparable with those of small polythermal glaciers in Spitsbergen (Longyearbreen and Larsbreen; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683612471984">Etzelmüller et al., 2000</xref>). The basal sliding was not considered here, but the large assemblage of subglacial landforms suggests considerable basal movement. The distribution of striae and flutes largely corresponds to areas of maximum deformation velocity and shear stresses, while the distribution of ‘domino’-structures seems partly associated with transition areas between high and low glacier activity. The glaciers response time was estimated to 100 years, however based on a modern mass balance gradient. Compared with glacier inventories of the present-day European Alps, the LIA Omnsbreen fits well into the parameter schemes provided in e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683612471984">Haeberli and Hoelzle (1995)</xref>.</p>

<title>Climate, glaciers and permafrost duringthe ‘Little Ice Age’</title>
<p>During the LIA, the northwestern areas of Europe cooled to a larger degree than central Europe, and an increased temperature gradient between the two regions developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683612471984">Bradley and Jones, 1993</xref>). As a result of this enhanced temperature gradient the cyclonic activity increased, especially resulting in intense winter storms of strengths that are not recorded since 1850 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683612471984">Lamb, 1979</xref>). The concentration of sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) in Greenland ice core records (GISP2) is commonly used as proxy data for the intensity and frequency of storm activity in the north Atlantic, when salt from seawater is deposited on the Greenland ice sheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683612471984">Dawson et al., 2007</xref>). From <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1400 the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration in this record increases by 20–30% over a period of only 20 years, which corresponds to the onset of the LIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683612471984">Fischer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683612471984">Kreutz et al., 1997</xref>). Within the LIA this record shows significant variability at decadal scales, but is particularly high from 1680 to 1730. This period also corresponds to a minimum stage in the general low solar activity during the LIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959683612471984">Mauquoy et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, during the LIA several observations and records of increased storm activity in the north Atlantic region exist, and in Norway these storms are likely to have reached land from west or southwest, not unlike the present situation, however enhanced. The implications of enhanced storm frequency especially during winter are twofold: (1) precipitation as snow will increase and (2) higher potential of snow redistribution by wind. In high-mountain areas where snow has the potential to survive summers, many perennial snow patches probably built up in this way during the LIA. Perennial snow-patches in areas that today are snow free in summer are known from for example the Cairngorm Mountains in Scotland during the LIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683612471984">Lamb, 1979</xref>). It is likely that the situation in Norway was similar to that in Scotland; many perennial snow or ice patches must have built up in areas that are today snow free. In this climatic setting Omnsbreen stands out as an example of one of these initially perennial ice patches formed in a lee position that eventually grew into a glacier.</p>
<p>From modelling of the ground thermal regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683612471984">Gisnås et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683612471984">Lilleøren et al., 2012</xref>) we conclude that permafrost has played a major role in the Holocene landscape development, and during the LIA much larger areas than at present were underlain by permafrost. In this respect, the Omnsbreen area represents the lowermost and westernmost area that was affected by permafrost during the LIA in Scandinavia, in areas that seemingly were permafrost free since the regional deglaciation. Owing to limitations on growth by the local topography, thin glacier marginal zones are expected and also modelled based on the interpreted LIA size of the glacier, and cold glacier margins were likely to form. The sediment availability and glacier dynamics are decisive of what kind of marginal landforms that can develop under such conditions, and both ice-cored moraines and moraine-derived rock glaciers need a high amount of material added to the glacier surface and most often occur where a weathering headwall is present above the glacier. Omnsbreen more or less filled its valley entirely, and no such external sediment source was then available. There has, however, been partly high subglacial activity and in many places in the glacier marginal zone thick sediment cover is present. Shearing processes bringing material to the glacier surface are expected in such an environment and these processes alone do not necessarily produce pronounced moraine ridges. In the Omnsbreen case a cold glacier margin is likely seen in the light of our interpretations of the ‘domino’-structures. Since the ‘domino’-structures are site-specific landforms, it is not easy to directly relate the suite of landforms present at Omnsbreen to other regions, but we still suggest that the mere lack of glacier-marginal landforms encompassing the former glacierized zone, in combination with recent regional permafrost modelling of the LIA, might provide a tool to recognize former cold or polythermal glaciers. Further, observations from Norway and Iceland show that in maritime permafrost environments, the most frequently occurring type of permafrost landforms are those formed in connection with glacial activity, such as moraine-derived rock glaciers and ice-cored moraines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683612471984">Lilleøren and Etzelmüller, 2011</xref>). The geomorphic potential of interacting processes between glaciers and permafrost is significant, and the acknowledgement of glacier–permafrost systems as important landscape elements, and not just as individual processes, will increase the understanding of the development and processes involved in a cryo-conditioned landscape.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Since the ‘Little Ice Age’ Omnsbreen has been reduced by an area of 6.5 km<sup>2</sup> (90%) and a volume of 0.25 km<sup>3</sup>, with most of the reduction occurring between <sc>ad</sc> 1930 and 1985. The observed retreat rate is greater than any other known glacier retreat rates in Norway at the same period.</p>
<p>Analyses and dating of lake sediments from Omnsvatnet indicate an initial ‘Little Ice Age’ formation of Omnsbreen at <sc>ad</sc> 1425 ± 85, thus a later formation than the main glacier reappearance in Norway, mainly occurring as Neoglaciation phenomena in Norway from <italic>c</italic>. 6000 to 5000 yr BP. Studies of the lake sediments in Omnsvatnet indicate that Omnsbreen was in advanced positions around <sc>ad</sc> 1580, 1630 and 1820.</p>
<p>The topographical setting of Omnsbreen, situated along the east-facing slope of a north–south trending valley, makes the glacier sensitive to changes in the prevailing westerly winds for mass accumulation. Both glacier and permafrost exist as marginal phenomena in the Omnsbreen area. While the glaciers depend on lee side accumulation of snow, the permafrost is sensitive to snow deflation causing heat loss from the ground during winter. This observation confirms the mutual exclusive nature of permafrost and glacier presence in marginal zones of either phenomenon.</p>
<p>The lack of terminal moraine systems and the modelled occurrence of permafrost suggest that Omnsbreen had cold margins during the LIA when it terminated in a permafrost environment. Here, we hypothesize that ice-cored moraines, moraine-derived rock glaciers and push moraines may not be the only results of such interaction. Instead, we propose that also the lack of clear marginal landforms like observed at Omnsbreen can be indicative of cold glacier margins.</p>
