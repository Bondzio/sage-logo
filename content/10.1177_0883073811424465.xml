<abstract>
<p>Epilepsy in adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency may be difficult to treat, and there is no standardized therapy. The authors describe a case of severe adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency resulting from a heterozygous mutation of the <italic>ADSL </italic>gene (p.D215H/p.I351T). The patient presented with tonic-clonic seizures, opisthotonus, tremor, and myoclonus in the 4th day of life. The seizures were refractory on various combinations of antiepileptic treatment. A ketogenic diet was introduced at the age of 2 resulting in a seizure-free period. The patient, however, developed a metabolic hyperchloremic acidosis with Fanconi syndrome, which disappeared a month after cessation of the diet at the age of 5. Since the withdrawal of the ketogenic diet, seizures have returned to a frequency of several times a day. In conclusion, a ketogenic diet could be considered a valid therapeutic option in patients with intractable seizures in a course of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency; however, it requires a formal study.</p>

<p>Adenylosuccinate lyase (adenylosuccinase, ADSL, EC 4.3.2.2) deficiency (MIM 103050) is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of purine metabolism caused by a mutation in the adenylosuccinate lyase gene (<italic>ADSL</italic>) leading to the accumulation of succinylnucleosides.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811424465">1</xref>
</sup> A wide spectrum of clinical presentations can be described by 3 distinct clinical phenotypes based on the onset and severity of symptoms—fatal neonatal form, severe type I form, and milder type II form.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811424465">2</xref>
</sup> Recent studies have shown that the ratio of the accumulating succinyladenosine (S-Ado) and succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide riboside (SAICAr) in body fluids is probably not predictive of phenotype severity; rather, it may be secondary to the degree of the patient’s development (ie, to the age of the patient at the time of a sample collection).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811424465">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Corresponding to the clinical diversity, the epileptic phenotypes associated with adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency are also highly variable, comprising myoclonus, partial seizures, infantile spasms, and status epilepticus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811424465">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811424465">5</xref>
</sup> Seizures usually start either early in the neonatal period or after the first year of life.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811424465">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811424465">7</xref>
</sup> Approximately half of the patients with adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency suffer from epilepsy, which is often intractable, but not always associated with status epilepticus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811424465">4</xref>
</sup> A clinical presentation of the adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency is usually marked by the above-mentioned seizures associated with psychomotor delay, hypotonia, and behavioral changes, such as autistic features and hyperactivity.</p>
<p>The wide clinical spectrum of the disease accounts for possible difficulties in differential diagnosis with neurologic disorders, especially those with intractable seizures and encephalopathy. For this reason, it would be important to develop protocols for adenylosuccinate lyase suspects and diagnosis to avoid useless investigations and treatments. Once a diagnosis has been made, the therapeutic issues are not simple as currently there is no effective treatment for adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency.</p>
<p>Here we describe a case of severe adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency with intractable seizures resulting from a heterozygous mutation in the <italic>ADSL</italic> gene. It is the first report of treatment with ketogenic diet in patients with adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073811424465">
<title>Case Presentation</title>
<p>A female patient was the first child of unrelated parents. Pregnancy was uneventful and delivery occurred at 42 weeks of gestation. The child was born by caesarian section with a 9 Apgar score. Early postnatal adaptation was complicated by respiratory distress, muscle hypotonia, and poor ineffective sucking. Refractory seizures developed soon thereafter (4th day); she presented tonic-clonic seizures, opisthotonus, tremor, and myoclonus—the patient received phenobarbital.</p>
<p>The newborn was diagnosed and treated as a result of these seizures in the neonatal unit for the first 4 weeks of life. Cerebral seizures (anxiety, spasms, bending the trunk forward and back, trembling upper and lower limbs, and nystagmus) lasting from several seconds to 1 minute were observed during hospitalization. Electroencephalography (EEG) showed burst-suppression pattern (spike and wave discharges). Phenobarbital and diazepam were used in the treatment. Seizure reduction was achieved. The results of basic laboratory tests showed no signs of hypoglycemia, hypomagnesemia, or hypocalcemia. The laboratory metabolic investigations such as liver function tests, plasma lactate and pyruvate, ceruloplasmin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, amino acids, and organic acids were normal. The child was discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of epilepsy.</p>
<p>The child was hospitalized again at the age of 5 months because of the severity of seizures (cyanosis around the mouth and nose, blinking eyes, and tremors of the head). The main results of basic blood tests, including biochemical tests, again did not show any abnormalities. Treatment of epilepsy was modified: phenobarbital was discontinued and valproic acid was included in the treatment. As improvement did not occur, drug-refractory epilepsy was diagnosed.</p>
<p>From 6 months of age, the girl was repeatedly hospitalized at our institute because of epilepsy. Myoclonic seizures, periodic tremor, and myoclonus were still observed. The seizures were refractory on various combinations of treatment. Despite anticonvulsant complex therapy (vigabatrin, valproic acid, tetracosactide) only reduction in seizure frequency was achieved. Delayed physical development and microcephaly were observed in the patient; she was unresponsive, profoundly retarded, and hypotonic. Because of poor results in seizure control, the ketogenic diet was introduced at the age of 2 years. After the introduction of the diet, the patient remained seizure-free. From the age of 4 years, the child developed new neurologic symptoms—paroxysmal extrapyramidal disorders appeared in the form of dystonic movement. Additionally, the girl developed a metabolic hyperchloremic acidosis with Fanconi syndrome, which disappeared a month after the cessation of a ketogenic diet. Since the withdrawal of the ketogenic diet, seizures have returned to a frequency of several times a day. These symptoms are partly controlled by valproic acid and phenobarbital.</p>
<p>With the intention of finding a metabolic background to the patient’s disorder, adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency was considered as a possible cause among many other possibilities that were screened for. Her urinary succinylpurines were elevated, and the ratio of succinyladenosine to succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide riboside (S-AdO/SAICAr) was 1.4. A genetic analysis revealed a heterozygous mutation (c.643G→C leading to D215H and c.1052T→C leading to I351T), which confirmed the diagnosis of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency. Succinylpurines were screened by the thin-layer chromatography method with Pauly’s reagent (sodium diazobenzenesulphate), which revealed accumulation of SAICAr in body fluids.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811424465">8</xref>
</sup> Urinary succinylpurines were dosed by means of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography as described previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811424465">9</xref>
</sup> Mutation analysis was performed on DNA extracted from peripheral blood cells as previously described.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811424465">2</xref>
</sup> Informed consent was obtained from the parents of the patient at the time of admission to the hospital.</p>
<p>A magnetic resonance imaging of the brain at 5.5 years showed cerebral volume loss with wide sylvian fissures, enlarged subarachnoid spaces and a thin corpus callosum, delayed myelination, and cerebellar atrophy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811424465">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>At the age of 6 years, the patient began a clinical trial with a dietary supplementation of <sc>d</sc>-ribose. A 12-month trial of the <sc>d</sc>-ribose treatment did not present any benefits to our patient.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811424465">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>At this time, the girl is 8 years old, and she is profoundly psycho-physically retarded. A physical examination of the child found microcephaly, increased muscle tension due to quadriplegia with predominance in the lower limbs, and a lack of emotional contact with the patient. The girl is treated with antiepileptic drugs; she requires the constant care of another person.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency is known to be responsible for intractable seizures. It has, in fact, a wider spectrum of clinical manifestations, and many cases could remain undiagnosed. Although it is a rare disorder, knowledge of it is very important for avoiding investigations that will not prove effective and for providing genetic counseling. The nonspecific nature of the neurologic symptoms results in the diagnosis relying on biochemical detection of dephosphorylated substrates of adenylosuccinate lyase: succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide riboside and succinyladenosine in body fluids. For systematic screening, a modified Bratton-Marshall test,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811424465">12</xref>
</sup> thin-layer chromatography with staining of imidazole compounds,<sup>

</sup> or capillary electrophoresis<sup>14</sup> can be used. High-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection or mass spectrometry is a method of choice for final diagnosis,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811424465">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811424465">15</xref>

</sup> followed by enzyme activity measurement and/or molecular investigation. Our case, along with previous studies, emphasizes the importance of simple screening techniques that should be available in general hospitals and are proven to be highly successful in the diagnosis of new patients.<sup>2,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073811424465">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Adenylosuccinate lyase is an enzyme involved in 2 pathways of purine nucleotide metabolism. It catalyzes cleavage of succinyl groups to yield fumarate: the conversion of succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) into aminoimidazolecarboxamide ribotide (AICAR) along the de novo pathway and formation of adenylate (AMP) from adenylosuccinate (S-AMP) in the conversion of inosine monophosphate (IMP) into adenine nucleotides in the purine nucleotide cycle. It is unclear whether the pathological mechanism of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency results from deficiency of purines, a toxicity of intermediates, or perturbation of another pathway or system.</p>
<p>The case we have described presents new insights into therapeutics of this disorder. There are few existing reports on different treatments to prevent and to cure intractable seizures in adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency. Among them, only 2 showed some beneficial effects (<sc>d</sc>-ribose and uridine administration)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073811424465">19</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811424465">20</xref>
</sup>; however, they were not confirmed in further studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811424465">11</xref>
</sup> Currently, no effective treatment is available for adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency, and prognosis is still very poor especially in profoundly retarded patients. In the second year of our patient’s life, because of poor results in seizures control, the ketogenic diet was introduced and was applied till the age of 5. The ketogenic diet turned out to be effective; however, during this diet the patient developed a metabolic hyperchloremic acidosis with Fanconi syndrome, which disappeared a month after a cessation of the ketogenic diet. Since the withdrawal of the ketogenic diet, seizures have returned to a frequency of several times a day.</p>
<p>Numerous reports show the efficacy of ketogenic diet in children with refractory epilepsy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073811424465">21</xref>
</sup> Physiological consequences of a ketogenic diet are similar to fasting and include hypoglycemia and increased levels of ketone bodies and fatty acids. Various mechanisms have been hypothesized for the anticonvulsant effect of the ketogenic diet, differing in their focus on one or another of the many metabolic changes likely to occur in patients on the diet. Some of these hypotheses focus on ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone) as crucial mediators of the beneficial effects of the ketogenic diet. Acetone shows the best anticonvulsant effects in both in vivo and in vitro models, though there is not necessarily a correlation between the level of ketone bodies and the degree of seizure control, and a direct neuronal mechanism underlying the effects is unclear.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073811424465">22</xref>
</sup> The mechanisms that explain the therapeutic effect of the ketogenic diet are not completely understood. Evidence points to an effect on brain handling of amino acids, especially glutamic acid, the major excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. As a result of the diet, more glutamate becomes accessible to the glutamate decarboxylase reaction to yield γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter and an important antiseizure agent. In addition, the ketogenic diet appears to favor the synthesis of glutamine, an essential precursor to GABA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073811424465">23</xref>
</sup> Both hypoglycemia and decreased pH are physiological changes that have been shown to increase adenosine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. A purinergic signaling hypothesis assumes neuroprotective and antiseizure actions of a ketogenic diet. While on a ketogenic diet, increased mitochondrial biogenesis, brain energetics and brain ATP are observed. Increased intracellular ATP enhances brain energy stores and homeostasis, and increased extracellular ATP levels is rapidly dephosphorylated into extracellular adenosine with subsequent signaling through adenosine receptors. Adenosine, acting at adenosine A1 receptors, exerts an inhibitory and anticonvulsant influence, thereby providing neuroprotection and antiseizure effects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073811424465">22</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Current therapies for epilepsy are largely symptomatic and do not affect underlying mechanisms of disease progression. Recent findings indicate that epilepsy might be a disease of astrocyte dysfunction and support the adenosine kinase hypothesis of epileptogenesis. Adenosine is best known as a sleep-promoting and neuroprotective molecule, consequently released to any type of mechanical brain injury, hypoxia, seizures, or hypoglycemia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073811424465">24</xref>
</sup> Basal endogenous extracellular adenosine is derived mainly from ATP released from neurons and astrocytes, and adenosine levels are regulated by various enzymes. Intracellularly, adenosine is rapidly metabolized by phosphorylation to adenosine monophosphate via adenosine kinase, a key enzyme of the adenosine metabolism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073811424465">25</xref>
</sup> Owing to the resemblance of both succinylpurines to adenosine and to their accumulation in the cerebrospinal fluid of the patients, the possibility was explored that they might interfere with cerebral adenosine receptors and therefore with the numerous physiologic functions of adenosine. Current data indicate that neither succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide riboside nor succinyladenosine are able to interfere with binding and uptake of adenosine by crude membrane fractions of a rat's cerebral cortex<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883073811424465">26</xref>
</sup> to modify the effect of adenosine on the transmission at glutamatergic synapses between the Schaffer collateral and commissural axons and the CA1 pyramidal neurons in a rat's brain; or to modify the response of single hippocampal neurons to the application of glutamate, <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA), or kainate by microionophoresis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883073811424465">27</xref>
</sup> Moreover, it has been shown that the regional pattern of the impairment of the uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in the patients did not correspond to the regional distribution of adenosine A1 receptors and of adenosine uptake sites.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883073811424465">28</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073811424465"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883073811424465">30</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Any possible treatment for adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency presents an exciting new advance, and the ketogenic diet is an open question. Children with epilepsy whose seizures become intractable, failing to be controlled with 3 or more medications used appropriately in adequate doses, should be referred to a comprehensive epilepsy center for consideration of other treatments that may include the ketogenic diet.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0883073811424465">31</xref>
</sup> At this time, until a better pharmacologic approach is developed, a testable, inexpensive, and nontoxic diet modification to avoid glucose and administer an alternate energy source should be considered. This approach would capitalize on the relationships between metabolism and neuronal signaling, probably augment endogenous levels of purines and thus enhance their endogenous anticonvulsant and neuroprotective potential.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073811424465">22</xref>
</sup> Although the ketogenic diet is considered to be safe, the diet should be used with a precise level of control, because of possible adverse events.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0883073811424465">32</xref>
</sup>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0883073811424465">33</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Our patient, in the course of the diet, developed severe hyperchloremic acidosis with Fanconi syndrome. Adverse reactions during treatment with a ketogenic diet are relatively infrequent; among them are vomiting, elevated serum lipid levels, persistent metabolic acidosis, increased serum uric acid, and hypoglycemia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0883073811424465">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0883073811424465">33</xref>
</sup> Secondary Fanconi syndrome has been reported in patients with epilepsy treated with valproic acid or other antiepileptic drugs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0883073811424465">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0883073811424465">35</xref>
</sup> and in one patient treated with a ketogenic diet and valproic acid together.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0883073811424465">36</xref>
</sup> The pathophysiology of this disorder as well as a valproic acid–associated complication is not yet fully understood. Valproic acid is known to produce subclinical defects for the renal tubular function.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0883073811424465">35</xref>
</sup> Fanconi syndrome in our patient resolved after cessation of the ketogenic diet and did not return despite further treatment with valproic acid; therefore, its relationship should be considered with this diet. The mechanisms of the ketogenic diet and how it affects the functions of the proximal renal tubules remain unclear.</p>
<p>In the absence of improvement after the use of antiepileptic drugs and because of the ketogenic diet complications, attempts were made to treat the patient with <sc>d</sc>-ribose in the sixth year of life. There have been isolated reports of promising results when using <sc>d</sc>-ribose as a treatment for patients with a deficiency of adenylosuccinate lyase.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073811424465">19</xref>
</sup> The rationale of this therapeutic approach is that <sc>d</sc>-ribose is immediately phosphorylated to ribose 5-phosphate and then converted to glucose and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, a key regulatory substrate in purine metabolism<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0883073811424465">37</xref>
</sup> that therefore stimulates de novo purine synthesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0883073811424465">38</xref>
</sup> The study showed minor changes in succinylpurine levels, a slight improvement of behavior, and a progressive reduction of seizure frequency. Unfortunately, the 12-month trial of treatment with <sc>d</sc>-ribose did not deliver any benefits to our patient. Therefore, it seems that this treatment cannot be recommended for patients with adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency.<sup>
