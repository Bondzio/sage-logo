<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recent studies show that ethnic minorities in Denmark report poorer health than ethnic Danes, just as they more frequently experience stress. These findings are most striking among women and elderly immigrants and are explained by cultural differences and different life styles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812449522">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812449522">2</xref>]. Other factors such as language barriers, limited education, and different ethno-cultural norms and traditions, as well as limited cultural competence among social and healthcare professionals, were previously identified as risk factors for poor health and quality of life and obstacles to optimum collaboration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812449522">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812449522">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Health promotion aims at creating equal conditions for health for the entire population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812449522">5</xref>]. Vulnerable groups may have limited opportunities for accessing and profiting from general health- promotion initiatives, with the consequence of increased inequity and inequality in health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812449522">6</xref>]. To ensure health for all citizens, the preconditions and needs of specific groups should therefore be explored and taken into consideration so that targeted and holistic initiatives can be applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812449522">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812449522">5</xref>]. It is known that social networks can lead to building of social capital and to perceived health and wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812449522">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812449522"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812449522">9</xref>]. Also, organised groups for people with similar problems and backgrounds can provide support and act as a buffering factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812449522">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812449522">11</xref>].</p>

<title>The women’s club</title>
<p>This study focused on a club established in the central Copenhagen area in November 2006 as a municipal association aiming at integration. In principle, the club was open to everyone, but in reality mostly Arabic-speaking women attended the meetings. The club had around 35 members at the time of the study. Meetings were held in a community centre for 4–5 hours each Friday and Sunday afternoon. On Fridays, the women normally cooked and had dinner together; on Sundays, they had tea, coffee, and whatever food the members brought along. Other activities included access to a swimming pool on Mondays. In addition, information about health-related topics, such as screening for breast cancer, healthy eating, and the importance of physical activity (inclusive of exercises), was regularly provided during the meetings by various health professionals. Sometimes the women made excursions to cafés, restaurants, and museums, and on three occasions they spent the weekend together in rented holiday cottages. Members paid an annual sum for their membership and additional money for expenses related to excursions and weekend trips. Extra funding was provided from various funds.</p>

<title>Aim</title>
<p>The aim of the study was to gain a deeper understanding of the conditions for and perceived benefits of regular participation in an immigrant women’s club, with special focus on the women’s wellbeing and the club’s potential for health promotion.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section9-1403494812449522">
<title>Design</title>
<p>Qualitative research is explorative, descriptive, and inductive. It attempts to unfold the meaning of peoples’ experiences and how they understand their world and their life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812449522">12</xref>]. A qualitative design was therefore considered appropriate for the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1403494812449522">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 15 women between 40 and 59 years old participated in the study. Five informants were married, one was a widow, and nine were divorced. Most no longer had children living at home. Twelve informants had been members of the club in focus from 3 months to 4 years. One was an ethnic Dane but married to an immigrant for many years; the others had come to Denmark as tourists, immigrants, or refugees between 14 and 39 years ago from various Arabic and African countries. All spoke Arabic. Four of the members worked, while the others were either unemployed, off sick, or received supplementary benefits.</p>
<p>Three additional informants, who were not members of the club in focus, included one Somali and two Turkish women. All three had personal experiences from other immigrant women’s clubs in Denmark.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1403494812449522">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2010/2011. A professional Arabic interpreter assisted in getting access to the club. The author attended a total of seven meetings during the data collection. This was done to allow the informants to get to know and be more comfortable with her, and thereby promote optimum interaction during the interviews. The informants were offered assistance from a professional interpreter but wanted to, and were able to, give the interviews in Danish. All interviews in the club were conducted in a separate room during ordinary club meetings. The three interviews of non-members were conducted in the informant’s home or workplace as desired. The interviews explored the conditions for and effect of being a member of a club and included follow-up questions to ensure a correct comprehension of the informants’ statements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812449522">12</xref>]. The opening question was: “Please tell me what it means to you to be a member of the club”. The interviews lasted for 30–75 minutes and were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1403494812449522">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The constructivist Grounded Theory method as described by Charmaz was applied in the analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812449522">13</xref>]. This approach emphasises that both the data and the analysis are created from shared experiences and relationships between the informants and the researcher. Grounded Theory aims at generating models or theories in order to gain a deeper understanding of a social phenomenon. All versions of the method include the same fundamental principles: theoretical sampling, a parallel collection and analysis of data, constant comparison of data and emerging categories, memo-writing, and theoretical sensitivity during the entire process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812449522">14</xref>]. The emerging codes are grouped together into more and more abstract categories, which are subsequently further developed and saturated. Finally, a core category describing “what this is all about” and its related categories are identified.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1403494812449522">
<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>The members of the club were informed verbally about the study on two occasions. It was emphasised that participation was voluntary, that no personal data was collected, and that interview data was handled confidentially and personal identifiers disguised prior to publication. According to Danish regulations, qualitative research studies do not need approval from an ethics committee. Since no identification data were collected, the Data Protection Agency was likewise not informed.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1403494812449522">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Four categories were identified and labelled “Forming a place for coping with loneliness” (core category), “Learning the rules”, “Social bonding and support”, and “A space for wellbeing and health”. Each category is described below, including a few quotations. The core category was related to the other categories, which describe the conditions for and effect of regular meetings in the club. “Learning the rules” describes how the members, in order to transform their ideas into action, must learn to deal with the club’s status as a municipal association. “Social bonding and support” describes the structure of the meetings and the informants’ perceptions of being members, while “A space for wellbeing and health” describes the perceived effects of the membership.</p>
<sec id="section15-1403494812449522">
<title>The central theme – forming a place for coping with loneliness</title>
<p>The members of the club had spent a large part of their time in Denmark at home, taking care of husbands and children. At the time of the study, however, the women experienced increasing loneliness since most no longer had children living at home and some had divorced and/or were not working any longer. According to the informants, many immigrant women mainly stayed at home and did not go out alone, but a club such as the one studied might be seen as attractive because of its women only status and because membership did not require fluency in Danish. The women emphasised the need for being with others from a similar background in order to maintain their ethnic identity, while at the same time having the chance to become more acquainted with Danish society.</p>
<p>The club was perceived as a place of freedom and an opportunity to avoid sitting alone and to get problems at a distance. Some were encouraged to go to the meetings by their husbands and/or children who could see that it was good for them. Despite years in Denmark, some had limited knowledge and experiences of Danish society and perceived the club as a means to do things they had never known about or been able to do before: “Our lives are enriched (by the club). If we sit alone, our lives are very monotonous. Now we are suddenly going out, swimming, spending the weekend together – and getting closer to Danish society.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1403494812449522">
<title>Learning the rules</title>
<p>Since the members had limited financial means themselves, it was essential to establish the club as a municipal association in order to get access to public rooms and funding. Being a municipal association, however, meant that an executive committee had to be formed, regular meetings held, accounts kept, and minutes written. Women with adequate resources and qualifications were needed for this, but also people who were able to understand the conditions, keep arrangements, appointments, and deadlines, and take responsibility. There appeared to be a gap between those who were assigned to do a job and those who actually did it. For example, agreed-upon tasks were often not carried out by the people assigned to them unless the leader reminded them. Informants related this to the role of women in their native countries, but also to the way the women perceived the membership of the club: “They don’t feel responsible, they don’t take initiative, and they don’t propose any ideas or suggestions. To many, the club is just a place where you come and have a cup of coffee, spend time with others, and leave again.”</p>
<p>A smaller group, normally constituting an executive committee, therefore had to take initiative, apply for funding, and make the various arrangements, while most members were described as passive. One informant compared the situation to a wedding: a few people were taking responsibility for the planning while the majority perceived themselves as guests. The leader of the club was seen as essential to its functioning and should be a warm, kind, and dedicated person who cared for the members and contacted them if they did not show up. She was also expected to take action if the rules were not followed or other problems occurred. In short, being the leader or a member of the executive committee was described as a challenging but also short-lived task: “Many immigrant clubs are shut down – and then others take over. But at some point they always close because of the fact that you stand there all alone and there are only a few to do the hard work.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1403494812449522">
<title>Social bonding and support</title>
<p>Informants constantly repeated how much they enjoyed meeting, talking, eating, and going out together, and how they felt welcome and like being part of a family when attending the meetings. For some, it also meant being able to provide help to others who experienced problems and/or failed to understand the Danish social/health/welfare systems. This included, for example, reading official letters, informing about regulations, and sharing information regarding laws. The conversation during club meetings normally did not focus on any deeper personal or emotional issues; meetings were primarily perceived as a chance to spend a good time and forget about problems. If someone had a specific problem, this was often discussed with only a few others in a separate room.</p>
<p>As a municipal association, the club was in principle open to everyone, but mostly Arabic-speaking women attended the meetings. The women preferred to speak their native language and were reluctant to speak Danish for a longer period of time if someone from another background was present, even though most were able to do so. This was perceived as discriminating by some, while others described it as a natural tendency: “My Danish will never be 100% (correct). Naturally, I am able to communicate, but when I speak (my native language) I’m a totally different person; much more free.”</p>
<p>There was also a tendency for some women to gather in ethnic-focused groups and to separate themselves physically from the others during part of the meetings. Some found this annoying while others perceived it as a natural need to have a space in which you could sit and relax and talk with people you knew in your own dialect. And clearly, the women’s differences were not perceived as an obstacle for joining the club: “There must be something, despite our differences, that keeps us together. I think it is loneliness – loneliness even though we have a family. It’s that sisterhood which keeps us together. A community … I believe we support each other in some way; that you find support.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1403494812449522">
<title>A space for health and wellbeing</title>
<p>Various chronic conditions were prevalent among the members of the club in focus. Informants described how spending too much time on their own made them think too much and feel even worse, and how attending club meetings made them feel better. Activities such as swimming and information provided by health professionals, including exercise, were perceived as very helpful. In contrast, only a single informant participated in physical activities outside the club. The members also described how they, for example, tried to support women with diabetes by “reminding” those in question when they were eating too many sweets or by borrowing books about diabetes in Arabic for them from the library.</p>
<p>The club’s influence on the women’s social and mental wellbeing was constantly emphasised. Informants described how they looked forward to the meetings and were unhappy if they were cancelled. Some gathered during holidays, when no meetings were normally held, to avoid sitting alone at home. A member of the club, who was working in a community health centre, described poor mental health among immigrant women as common and membership of a club as health promotive: “I didn’t think there were so many (immigrant) women with depression, but there are really many. They sit and eat and speculate all the time. So if they get the opportunity to get out, it’s very big. They don’t have to save the world, but they can get out and be part of the small society, you know. They don’t learn anything; they don’t learn to speak Danish; but they can sit with women of the same age who have the same problems. And that’s health promotive without saying.”</p>
<p>Even informants who worked and spoke Danish had limited social contacts outside the family. This made them vulnerable to isolation if they divorced/became widows, and when their children left home. Some also related this to a traditional upbringing and limited educational background, which made it difficult for the women to benefit from opportunities in Denmark on their own. Therefore, they were happy and proud of the club and the possibilities and prospects it provided, just as they expressed feelings of empowerment: “We talk and do all kinds of things. We can take a walk, sometimes in the summer a long walk, and go to a museum or whatever. If somebody wants to see or do something, we can just plan it. What can I say? I am OK, but it’s good to come here and talk to each other, yes.”</p>

<sec id="section19-1403494812449522" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The members of the club in focus of the present study had lived in Denmark for many years. The findings have demonstrated that some experienced loneliness, were isolated, and/or appeared to participate minimally in Danish society. They were therefore in a situation that could have a negative impact on their health and wellbeing. This is in accordance to other studies that have identified immigrant women as a potentially vulnerable group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812449522">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812449522">2</xref>]. In the same way, indicators including educational level and language acquisition were linked to feelings of depression and less life satisfaction in first generation Arab-American elders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812449522">15</xref>].</p>
<p>From a psycho-social perspective the study shows that a club may constitute a useful forum for immigrant women to gather with others from a similar background and thereby have access to company and distraction, as well as the potential to build up social and cultural capital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812449522">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812449522">9</xref>]. The study indicates that the members are most likely to build up bonding capital, i.e. networks focusing on people inside a group and with a clear demarcation from the outside world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812449522">7</xref>]. Halpern argues, however, that strong bonds with a clear perception of identity may even make the members feel safe and thereby facilitate linking capital and, in this case, the opportunity for the women to become more familiar with Danish society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812449522">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Bartley argues that social support can affect health and reduce stress by acting as a buffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812449522">11</xref>]. From a public health perspective, the study indicates that clubs for immigrant women may provide access to a group otherwise difficult to reach and establish a forum for health promotion. Abel describes values and norms as key elements of health-relevant cultural capital and important factors to consider when addressing social inequalities in health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812449522">9</xref>]. The wishes and needs of the members must therefore be a priority when decisions on relevant topics for health education are made, just as adapted initiatives addressing health literacy aspects must be applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812449522">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812449522">17</xref>].</p>
<p>It is even argued that building up social capital in informal voluntary networks may make way for empowerment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812449522">18</xref>]. This implies, however, that municipalities support both the leaders and clubs for immigrants financially and facilitate access to adapted health-promotion initiatives.</p>
<sec id="section20-1403494812449522">
<title>Methodological considerations</title>
<p>Only women who were able to perform the interview in Danish agreed to be interviewed. It is therefore possible that women less integrated in Danish society were not included in the study. Otherwise, the informants formed a heterogeneous group when considering age, social, and employment status, as well as years of stay in Denmark and the duration of their membership in the club. Despite a limited number, the interviews provided rich data that made it possible both to capture variability in experiences and reach saturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812449522">14</xref>]. The three additional interviews were primarily aimed to saturate the identified categories and establish trustworthiness. Other measures taken to establish trustworthiness included an accurate description of the design and a continuous discussion of the findings with colleagues and other researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812449522">19</xref>]. As is the case with all qualitative studies, the findings may provide healthcare professionals, social workers, and other practitioners with a deeper understanding of the phenomenon under study, but cannot be transferred to apply to immigrant women in general.</p>

<sec id="section21-1403494812449522" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The study suggests that immigrant women who have difficulties getting on in Danish society on their own may find support and perceive increased wellbeing from gathering in clubs with women from a similar background. In addition, the clubs may provide society an opportunity and a space for adapted health-promotion initiatives.</p>
