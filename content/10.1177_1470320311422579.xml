<p><italic>Background and objective</italic>: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) gene polymorphism correlates with circulating and cellular ACE concentration. Association between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) risk in children is still controversial. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the relation between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and SSNS susceptibility in children.</p>
<p><italic>Methods</italic>: The relevant investigations were screened from the search engines of PubMed, Cochrane Library and CBM-disc (China Biological Medicine Database) as of 1 March 2011, and eligible studies were synthesized using meta-analysis methods.</p>
<p><italic>Results</italic>: Ten studies were identified for the analysis of association between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and SSNS risk in children, including seven in Asians, one for Caucasians and two in Africans. There was no markedly positive association between D allele or DD genotype and SSNS susceptibility in Asians, Caucasians and Africans (D: Asians OR = 1.24, <italic>p</italic> = 0.28; Caucasians OR = 1.61, <italic>p</italic> = 0.15; Africans OR = 1.61, <italic>p</italic> = 0.53; DD: Asians OR = 1.72, <italic>p</italic> = 0.15; Caucasians OR = 1.39, <italic>p</italic> = 0.48; Africans OR = 1.80, <italic>p</italic> = 0.56). Furthermore, II homozygous seemed not to play a protective role against SSNS onset for Asians, Caucasians and Africans (Asians OR = 0.95, <italic>p</italic> = 0.85; Caucasians OR = 0.30, <italic>p</italic> = 0.11; Africans OR = 0.60, <italic>p</italic> = 0.65).</p>
<p><italic>Conclusions</italic>: There was no association between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and SSNS susceptibility in Asians, Caucasians and Africans. However, the conclusions for Caucasians and Africans were less powerful.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS), one of the commonest renal problems in children, is characterized by oedema, massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia and hyperlipidaemia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320311422579">1</xref></sup> and leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). With a benign prognosis, most INS patients have a satisfactory response to steroid therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320311422579">2</xref></sup> According to the clinical response to steroids, INS cases are divided into steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) and non-steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (non-SSNS), and non-SSNS is further divided into steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (SDNS) and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320311422579">3</xref></sup> Age of initial presentation has an important impact on the disease distribution and the response to steroid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311422579">4</xref></sup> Most children with INS respond to corticosteroid treatment (SSNS), and about 10% of children with INS are mainly steroid-resistant (SRNS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320311422579">5</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) gene polymorphism, correlating with circulating and cellular ACE concentration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320311422579">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311422579">7</xref></sup> has been implicated in the aetiology of SSNS and has been investigated in numerous epidemiological studies. However, the available evidence reported to date is weak, due to the sparseness of data or disagreements among the reported investigations. There was rare meta-analysis to explore the association of ACE I/D gene polymorphism with SSNS susceptibility in children. We performed this meta-analysis to investigate the association of ACE I/D gene polymorphism with SSNS risk, with the intention to provide a much more reliable finding on the significance of the association.</p>
<p>The definitions of INS, SSNS, SDNS and SRNS were as follows. For INS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311422579">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320311422579">8</xref></sup> NS was diagnosed by oedema, serum albumin below 2.5 g/dl, and urinary protein excretion greater than 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/h. Patients with mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, membranous glomerulopathy, congenital NS, systemic diseases including amyloidosis and vasculitis or other known secondary NS were excluded for INS. For SSNS, SDNS and SRNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320311422579">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320311422579">9</xref></sup> the patients with INS were categorized according to their response to steroids as SSNS, SRNS and SDNS. SSNS was defined as the disappearance of proteinuria (i.e. urinary protein &lt;4 mg/h/m<sup>2</sup> or negative protein on dipstick examination) for at least three consecutive days, after prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day (maximum 60 mg/day) for 4 or 6 weeks. SRNS was defined as persistence of proteinuria in spite of a 4- or 6-week course of full dose of prenisolone i.e. 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day and SDNS was defined as the tendency to relapse while on or during tapering of the steroid dose or within 14 days of steroid withdrawal.</p>

<title>Search strategy</title>
<p>The relevant studies were searched from the electronic database of PubMed, Cochrane Library and CBM-disc (China Biological Medicine Database) on 1 March 2011. (steroid sensitive) AND (angiotensin converting enzyme OR ACE) was entered into PubMed, Cochrane Library and CBM-disc for search. The search in PubMed was limited to humans and English language. We also extended search spectrum to the ârelated articleââ and the bibliographies of all recruited studies. If multiple publications from the same study group occurred, we only recruited the most complete paper for our analysis.</p>

<title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title>
<sec id="section5-1470320311422579">
<title>Inclusion criteria</title>
<p>Inclusion critera were: (i) a caseâcontrol study; (ii) the outcome had to be SSNS; (iii) there had to be at least two comparison groups (SSNS group vs. control group); and (iv) the study was performed in children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1470320311422579">
<title>Exclusion criteria</title>
<p>Articles were excluded if they were (i) review articles or editorials; or (ii) case reports; or (iii) they did not provide the detail genotype data; or (iv) they investigated the association of other genes with SSNS or the relation between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and other diseases such as IgA nephropathy.</p>

<sec id="section7-1470320311422579">
<title>Data extraction and synthesis</title>
<p>The information was independently extracted from each study by at least two investigators as follows: first authorâs surname, year of publication, ethnicity of study population, and the number of cases and controls for ACE genotypes. Frequencies of alleles were calculated for case group and control group, from the corresponding genotype distribution. The results were compared and disagreements were resolved by discussion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1470320311422579">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Cochrane Review Manager Version 5 (Cochrane Library, UK) was used to calculate the available data from each investigation. The pooled statistic was counted using the fixed effects model, but a random effects model was performed when the <italic>p</italic> value of heterogeneity test was less than 0.1. Results were expressed with odds ratios (OR) for dichotomous data, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were also calculated. <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was required for the pooled OR to be statistically significant. <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> was used to test the heterogeneity between the included studies. We classified the investigations into studies in Caucasians, for Asians and in Africans because genotype frequencies and prevalence of SSNS were different between different races. A chi-square test using a web-based program was applied to determine if genotype distribution of the control population reported conformed to HardyâWeinberg equilibrium (HWE; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered significant). Sensitivity analysis was performed if HWE disequilibrium existed. All descriptive data were expressed as mean Â± SD.</p>

These 10 investigations contained 417 case series and 1056 controls. The average distribution frequency of D allele in Asian children with SSNS was 50.97%, and the average frequency in controls was 46.68%. Furthermore, the average distributions of D allele frequency in Caucasians were 63.64% in cases and 52.01% for controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470320311422579">Table 1</xref>). In Africans, the average gene frequencies for D allele were 54.01% in SSNS group, and 42.00% for control group. The ratio of INS/control for the average distribution frequency of D allele in Africans or Caucasians was notably higher than that in Asians (Asians: SSNS/control = 1.09; Caucasians: SSNS/control = 1.22; Africans: SSNS/control = 1.29).</p>

<p>True race-specific genetic effects might affect the results of our analyses for the association of ACE I/D gene polymorphism with SSNS susceptibility.

Furthermore, angiotensin II promotes the expression of growth factors, including transforming growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, in glomerular mesangial cells, and these growth factors promote accumulation of collagen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311422579">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320311422579">9</xref></sup> Moon et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470320311422579">31</xref></sup> found that angiotensin II could mediate the reactive oxygen species production in diabetic glomeruli and mesangial cells in type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Lee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470320311422579">32</xref></sup> reported that angiotensin II could activate the expression of NF-ÎºB, which took part in the pathogenesis of early renal macrophage infiltration in experimental diabetes. There were also some other investigations observed that the elevated angiotensin II was associated with the risk of renal diseases, such as IgA nephropathy, human immunodeficiency virus associated nephropathy and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470320311422579">33</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470320311422579">35</xref></sup> Genetic factors, in particular ACE I/D gene polymorphism, have been suggested to be important in determining the development of SSNS. SSNS is the most common renal disease in children. Data on the risk factors for the pathogenesis of SSNS are insufficient. Furthermore, findings on the association of ACE I/D gene polymorphism with SSNS susceptibility have been controversial since the first investigation was reported. In order to draw a more convincing conclusion, this meta-analysis was performed to explore the association between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and SSNS risk.</p>
<p>To achieve a satisfactory power, meta-analysis of multiple studies clearly has an important role in offering an association with such potentials. In our meta-analysis, we found that the difference of association of D allele or DD homozygous with the risk of SSNS between case group and control group was not statistically different in overall populations, and II genotype seemed not to play a protective role against SSNS onset. However, there were notable heterogeneities among the included studies. When we took the fixed effects model to calculate the pooled OR for D allele in overall populations, the difference of association of D allele with SSNS onset between case group and control group had statistical significance (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.03 â 1.74, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03). It was inconsistent with the result when we performed the random effects model. We speculated the disequilibrium of gene distributions among three races might be responsible for the occurrence of heterogeneity. The ethnicity plays an important role in the epidemiology of INS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311422579">4</xref></sup> and it might also affect the association of ACE I/D gene polymorphism with SSNS susceptibility. In our investigation, the average distribution frequency of D allele for controls in Caucasians was marked elevation when compared with that in Asians or Africans, suggesting a discrepant role of continental differences in gene background and the living environment. The results of overall populations were less powerful and it was difficult to draw a convincing conclusion. Therefore, the subgroup analysis according to ethnicity was very important in this meta-analysis.</p>
<p>Differences in racial descent of the population studied might cause different results. In order to draw a stable conclusion, subgroup analysis according to racial descent was performed. In our analysis, there was no association between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and SSNS risk in three races. When the sensitive analysis was performed, we found that there was also no relation between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and SSNS onset, but there was a significant association of D allele with SSNS risk for Africans (<italic>p</italic> = 0.008), and the II homozygous seemed to play a protective role against SSNS susceptibility (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03). The number of included studies was small, which is a key factor to be responsible for that. Furthermore, it was difficult to draw a precise conclusion for Caucasians (only including one investigation for analysis). However, for Asians, the results of subgroup analysis in our investigation might be stable.</p>
<p>Ethnicity and age play important roles in the epidemiology of INS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320311422579">4</xref></sup> In Asian children, Serdaroglu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320311422579">7</xref></sup> conducted a study to investigate the association of ACE I/D gene polymorphism with INS risk in Turkey and found that the distributions of ACE I/D gene polymorphism and the D allele were significantly different between children with INS and controls. The distributions of ACE I/D gene polymorphism in the SSNS and SRNS groups were similar and the level of D allele was found to be 0.69 in SSNS and 0.64 in SRNS. The D allele might be associated with the risk of SSNS in the investigation of Serdaroglu et al. Oktem et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320311422579">8</xref></sup> found that the DD genotype was more frequent in the SSNS group than that in normal control group in Turkish children. Al-Eisa et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320311422579">9</xref></sup> conducted a study in Kuwaiti Arab Children and observed that the INS cases with DD genotype also showed a significantly higher incidence of steroid sensitivity. Tsai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320311422579">3</xref></sup> conducted an investigation in Taiwan and found that patients with INS had a significantly higher percentage of DD genotype than the control group, and this higher incidence of the DD homozygous was observed in SSNS. Celik et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320311422579">14</xref></sup> observed that the distributions of ACE I/D gene polymorphism were significantly different between INS group and normal control group and the distributions of ACE I/D gene polymorphism in the SSNS group were similar to those in SRNS group in Turkish children. The ACE I/D gene polymorphism were associated with the onset of SSNS in the study of Celik et al. However, Dang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470320311422579">11</xref></sup> conducted a study in Chinese children and found that the distributions of ACE I/D gene polymorphism were not significantly different between INS group and normal control group, but, patients with SSNS had a significantly lower percentage of DD genotype than the SRNS group. DD genotype might be not associated with SSNS risk in the study of Dang et al. Yang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320311422579">15</xref></sup> observed that the distributions of ACE I/D gene polymorphism in Chinese children with INS were similar to those in the normal control group, and the differences of ACE I/D gene polymorphism between SSNS group and non-SSNS group were not statistically significant. The ACE I/D gene polymorphism were not associated with the onset of SSNS in the investigation of Yang et al.</p>
<p>In Caucasians, Sasse et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320311422579">5</xref></sup> found that the distributions of ACE I/D gene polymorphism in INS children were not significantly different from those in normal Swiss population, and the frequency of ACE genotype did not significantly differ between SSNS and SRNS patients. ACE I/D gene polymorphism might be not associated with the onset of SSNS in Caucasian children. In Africans, Saber-Ayad et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320311422579">12</xref></sup> performed an investigation in Egyptian children and observed that the differences of ACE I/D gene polymorphism between controls and SSNS group were not statistically significant. Fahmy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320311422579">13</xref></sup> performed a study to investigate the distributions of ACE I/D gene polymorphism in Egyptian children with INS and found that there was no significant difference for DD genotype between the SSNS versus the normal control group and there was a significant difference for D allele between the normal control group versus SSNS group. The result of Saber-Ayad et al. was different from that in Fahmy et al. More studies should be performed in Caucasians or African children.</p>
<p>In our investigation, we only recruited the studies conducted in children and found that DD genotype or D allele was not associated with SSNS susceptibility in Asians, for Caucasians and in Africans. We speculated that DD genotype or D allele might not sensitively affect for SSNS susceptibility. II genotype seemed also not to play a protective role against SSNS onset for three races. Together with our opinion, ACE I/D gene polymorphism was not likely involved in the mechanism of INS occurrence. However, those findings mentioned above should be regarded cautiously because many other ingredients, such as heterogeneity of enrolled cases, limited statistical power, variable study designs and different interventions, were closely related to affect the results. Furthermore, whether the ACE I/D gene polymorphism is just linked with other discrete loci involved in the occurrence of SSNS is not clear at the moment. In order to explore whether there is an association between ACE I/D gene polymorphism and SSNS risk, further study is required.</p>
<sec id="section14-1470320311422579">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Some limitations should be discussed in this meta-analysis. First, heterogeneities might be present, affecting the results of our meta-analysis, although a random effects model has been performed. Second, an important threat to any literature-based review and meta-analysis is that of reporting bias (only recruit published literatures in English and Chinese). Last but not least, the sample sizes in some studies are relatively small. Undoubtedly, the limitations mentioned above might affect our final conclusions.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In conclusion, the results in our study supported that DD genotype or D allele was not associated with SSNS susceptibility in Asians, Caucasians or Africans. Furthermore, II genotype seemed not to play a protective role against SSNS onset in three races. However, more caseâcontrol association investigations on larger, stratified populations are required to further clarify the role of this ACE I/D gene polymorphism in SSNS susceptibility in children.</p>
