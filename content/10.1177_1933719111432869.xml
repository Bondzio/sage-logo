<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A growing body of evidence indicates that the maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with pregnancies complicated by intra-amniotic inflammation, but a negative amniotic fluid (AF) culture, is similar to that of pregnancies with a positive AF culture in the context of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROMs).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111432869">1</xref>
</sup> Thus, early and accurate detection of intra-amniotic inflammation, as well as microbiologically proven intra-amniotic inflammation in women presenting with PPROMs has important clinical and prognostic implications. The only method which has been demonstrated to reliably detect intra-amniotic infection/inflammation (IAI) is to sample the AF by amniocentesis. However, amniocentesis is an invasive procedure with risks<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719111432869">2</xref>
</sup> and the results of AF culture may require days. Consequently, alternative approaches for noninvasive and rapid identification of IAI are needed for women with PPROMs.</p>
<p>Several studies have shown that measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) level or the white blood cell (WBC) count in maternal blood may be clinically useful biochemical noninvasive approaches to discriminate women with PPROMs who are at high risk for microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity, histologic chorioamnionitis, and short latency,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719111432869">3</xref>
</sup> <sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719111432869">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719111432869"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719111432869">6</xref>
</sup> although these parameters are not specific. Nonetheless, there are no data regarding the association between these parameters and intra-amniotic inflammation in women with PPROMs. It has also been reported that parity is a significant risk factor for intra-amniotic infection<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111432869">7</xref>
</sup> and that the lower the gestational age at presentation, the higher the frequency of IAI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111432869">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719111432869">8</xref>
</sup> Unfortunately, the extant literature does not support the use of the currently available noninvasive markers on an individual basis. One way to improve the predictive value of individual biomarkers is to combine different tests. In the setting of preterm labor and intact membranes, we have previously reported that gestational age, cervical length, and maternal blood WBC count,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111432869">9</xref>
</sup> as noninvasive markers, can be combined in a simple risk score that shows promising predictive value in pregnancies with intra-amniotic inflammation. However, there are no such data on this issue for women with PPROMs. Indeed, such information is clinically relevant, because it may decrease unnecessary invasive procedures (eg, amniocentesis) for women with PPROMs and noninvasively identify women who would benefit from targeted interventions, such as transfer to a tertiary care center and antibiotics or corticosteroid administration. The purpose of the current study was to develop a model based on noninvasive clinical parameters to predict the probability of IAI in women with PPROMs.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This retrospective cohort study consisted of consecutive women admitted to Seoul National University Bundang Hospital between June 2004 and May 2010, with the diagnosis of PPROMs, who met the following criteria: (1) singleton gestation; (2) transabdominal amniocentesis performed for microbiologic studies of the amniotic cavity; (3) maternal blood drawn for determination of the WBC count and CRP level at the time of amniocentesis; (4) a live fetus with a gestational age between 20 + 0 and 34 + 6 weeks’ gestation; (5) absence of active labor, defined by the presence of cervical dilatation &gt;3 cm by a sterile speculum examination; and (6) absence of a major congenital anomaly. The noninvasive clinical parameters that were collected at the time of enrollment included demographic variables (maternal age, parity, and previous preterm delivery), gestational age at assessment, CRP level, and maternal WBC count. Clinical and laboratory data were collected prospectively. Rupture of membranes was diagnosed by a sterile speculum examination confirming pooling of AF in the vagina and a positive nitrazine test. Digital examinations were not performed until the onset of labor (defined by the presence of regular and painful uterine contractions). Amniocentesis was immediately offered to all patients who were admitted with the diagnosis of PPROMs at our institution for microbiologic assessment of the amniotic cavity. Tocolytic therapy and corticosteroids were administered at the discretion of the attending obstetrician. Whenever possible, prophylactic antibiotics were given, but the type of antibiotics were left to the discretion of the attending obstetrician. Tocolytic therapy, corticosteroids, and antibiotics were started after amniocentesis. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, and informed consent was obtained from all study participants for the amniocentesis procedure and the use of AF samples for research purposes.</p>
<p>Amniotic fluid was obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis under ultrasonographic guidance. Microbiologic evaluation included cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and mycoplasmas (<italic>Ureaplasma urealyticum</italic> and <italic>Mycoplasma hominis</italic>), according to the methods previously described.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719111432869">10</xref>
</sup> An aliquot of AF was transferred to the hematology laboratory and examined in a hemocytometer chamber for the presence of WBCs. The absolute WBC count was calculated by multiplying the area examined by a factor of 10 per area and was expressed as the number of cells per cubic millimeter. Amniotic fluid that was not required for clinical assessment was centrifuged, and the supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −70°C until assayed for interleukin 6 (IL-6). Samples were not subjected to freeze–thaw cycles before being assayed. Interleukin 6 levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (human IL-6 DuoSet Kit; R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota). The range of the IL-6 standard curve is 7.8 to 600 pg/mL. The assay was carried out by strictly following the instructions provided by the manufacturer and all samples were measured in duplicate. The calculated intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were &lt;10%. Amniotic fluid samples were diluted at 1:10 with duoset assay diluent (1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2-7.4; R&amp;D Systems) for preliminary analysis. Amniotic fluid samples that contained greater than 6 ng/mL were diluted at 1:100 for final analysis. Interleukin 6 in AF was used to assess the presence of intra-amniotic inflammation since previous studies indicated that this was a sensitive and specific index of inflammation.<sup>

</sup> The maternal blood WBC count was determined using an automated hemocytometer (XE<italic>-</italic>2100, Sysmex, Tokyo, Japan). The CRP level was measured with a latex<italic>-</italic>enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) using an automated analyzer (Toshiba 200FR; Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
<p>IAI was defined as a positive AF culture for microorganisms and/or the presence of high levels of IL-6 in AF. Histologic chorioamnionitis was defined as the presence of acute inflammatory change in any of the tissue samples (amnion, chorion-decidua, umbilical cord, and chorionic plate) using criteria published previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719111432869">10</xref>
</sup> Clinical chorioamnionitis was diagnosed according to the criteria of Gibbs et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111432869">13</xref>
</sup> Composite neonatal morbidity was defined as the presence of one or more of the following, which were diagnosed according to the definitions previously described in detail: respiratory distress syndrome<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719111432869">10</xref>
</sup>; bronchopulmonary dysplasia<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719111432869">14</xref>
</sup>; congenital sepsis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719111432869">15</xref>
</sup>; periventricular leukomalacia<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719111432869">16</xref>
</sup>; and necrotizing enterocolitis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719111432869">17</xref>
</sup> Women with preterm birth (ie, from 20 +0 to 36 +6 weeks of gestation) caused by preterm labor or PPROMs in a previous pregnancy were defined to have had a spontaneous preterm delivery.</p>
<p>Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to test for normal distribution of the data. Univariate analysis was conducted with the 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Student <italic>t</italic> test, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, χ<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719111432869">2</xref>
</sup> test, or Fisher exact test. The Bonferroni correction was applied to correct for multiple comparisons among groups. A receiver–operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to display the relationship between the sensitivity (true-positive rate) and the false-positive rate and to select the best cutoff value for AF IL-6 in the identification of a positive AF culture. This value was then used as the basis for determining the cutoff of AF IL-6 for defining intra-amniotic inflammation. The amniocentesis-to-delivery interval according to the inflammatory and infectious status of the AF was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and was compared between groups by means of the log-rank test. Women who were delivered preterm for maternal or fetal indications were included in this analysis, with a censoring time equal to the amniocentesis-to-delivery interval. Cox’s proportional hazard modeling was used to compare the interval to delivery between groups, adjusting for gestational age associated with IAI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111432869">1</xref>
</sup> Logistic regression was used to investigate the regression relationship between various predictors and IAI. To develop a noninvasive model to predict IAI, noninvasive clinical and laboratory parameters that presented a significant correlation or a tendency toward an association with IAI in univariate analysis (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .25) were subjected to a stepwise backward logistic regression analysis. The linearity of continuous variables was assessed using fractional polynomials.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719111432869">18</xref>
</sup> The goodness of fit of a logistic regression model was assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Factors included in the final logistic regression model were used to set up the scores for the probability of IAI. Using the constant of the logistic regression analysis and the beta coefficients for the identified predictive factors in the final risk scoring model, the individual probability of having an IAI for each woman in preterm PROMs was calculated. Tests for interaction were performed by including cross-product terms in the logistic models and conducting the Wald test. Discriminatory ability of this model was measured by the area under the ROC curve (AUC).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719111432869">19</xref>
</sup> The model’s value that maximized the sum of the sensitivity and specificity was considered the best cutoff. A univariate <italic>z</italic> score test was used to estimate the statistical significance of the difference in the AUC between the AF WBC count and the final risk scoring model.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719111432869">20</xref>
</sup> All reported <italic>P</italic> values are 2-sided, and <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.05 were considered statistically significant. SPSS 15.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) was used for statistical analyses.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the study period, 178 consecutive women with PPROMs who met the entry criteria were recruited for this study. Of the 178 women, AF was not available in 7 for IL-6 determinations (4 women with negative AF cultures and 3 women with positive AF cultures). These 7 women were excluded from the study, leaving 171 women suitable for evaluation. The gestational age of the women included in our study at the time of amniocentesis ranged from 21 + 3 to 34 + 6 weeks’ gestation. All participants were of Korean ethnicity.</p>
<p>Receiver–operating characteristic curve analysis of the diagnostic value of AF IL-6 with respect to a positive AF culture showed an AUC of 0.901 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.852-0.950; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719111432869">Figure 1</xref>). The best cutoff value for AF IL-6 in predicting the presence of intra-amniotic infection was ≥2.6 ng/mL (sensitivity, 89%; specificity, 85%) and was thus used to diagnose the presence of intra-amniotic inflammation. The overall rate of intra-amniotic inflammation was 34% (58 of 171). The prevalence of a positive AF culture was 26% (44 of 171). The microorganisms isolated from the amniotic cavity included <italic>Ureaplasma urealyticum </italic>(n = 40), <italic>Mycoplasma hominis </italic>(n = 27), <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>(n = 2),<italic> Peptostreptococcus </italic>sp (n = 1), <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> (n = 1), <italic>Streptococcus mitis</italic> (n = 1), <italic>Lactobacillus </italic>sp (n = 1), and mixed gram-positive bacteria (n = 1). Polymicrobial invasion was present in 28 cases (64% [28/44]). Intra-amniotic inflammation was present in 89% (39 of 44) of the cases with a positive AF culture. Intra-amniotic inflammation with a negative AF culture for microorganisms was found in 15% (19 of 127) of those with a negative AF culture.</p>

Women with a negative AF culture, but with intra-amniotic inflammation (group 2), had a significantly lower mean gestational age at amniocentesis and a higher mean AF WBC count than women with a negative AF culture and without intra-amniotic inflammation (group 1). Moreover, women in group 2 had a significantly lower mean gestational age at delivery and mean birth weight and higher rates of preterm delivery at &lt;34 weeks and histologic chorioamnionitis than women in group 1. The rates of composite neonatal morbidity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, and Apgar scores &lt;7 at 5 minutes were significantly higher in neonates born to women in group 2 than women in group 1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1933719111432869">Table 2</xref>). However, there were no significant differences in maternal and neonatal outcomes between women with intra-amniotic inflammation and a negative AF culture and women with a positive AF culture (group 3). Sixty-four women were delivered for maternal or fetal indications. In these cases, the amniocentesis-to-delivery interval was censored. There was no difference in the median amniocentesis-to-delivery interval among the 3 groups of women (<italic>P</italic> = .08). However, multivariate survival analysis demonstrated that the amniocentesis-to-delivery interval in women in group 2 was significantly shorter than women in group 1 after adjustment for gestational age at amniocentesis (hazard ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.04-3.82, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 [Cox proportional hazard model analysis]); there was no difference in the interval to delivery between women in groups 2 and 3 after adjusting for gestational age at amniocentesis.</p>

<p>To identify the final noninvasive predictors of IAI, we performed multivariate analysis using a stepwise logistic regression model. After the exclusion of 1 variable (AF WBC count) using invasive amniocentesis, 5 variables with a significant correlation or a tendency toward an association with IAI based on univariate analysis (<italic>P </italic>&lt; .25) were entered into the multivariate model (age, parity, gestational age at assessment, serum CRP level, and maternal blood WBC count). The final variables retained in the noninvasive model were parity, gestational age at assessment, serum CRP level, and maternal blood WBC count (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1933719111432869">Table 4</xref>). There were no statistically significant interactions between predictors selected in the multivariate model. Because fractional polynomial analysis yielded significant linear functions for gestational age at assessment, serum CRP level, and maternal blood WBC count, we used these variables as continuous variables. A risk score for each individual woman with PPROMs can be calculated by adding up the beta coefficient for the constant and each predictor. The formula that was generated to predict IAI is as follows: Y = log<sub>e</sub> (<italic>Z</italic>) = 1.944 + 1.334 × (CRP [in mg/dL]) + 0.122 × (WBC count [in thousand cells per cubic milliliter]) − 0.141 × (gestational age [in weeks] − 1.016 × (1 for nullipara, 0 for parous women). Z = e<sup>Y</sup> and risk (%) = [(Z/(1 + Z)] × 100.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of our study clearly demonstrate that the risk of IAI among women with PPROMs can be predicted by the following 4 noninvasive clinical and laboratory parameters: serum CRP level; maternal blood WBC count; gestational age at the time of assessment; and parity. Moreover, a model obtained by combining these parameters has a high discriminating power in the prediction of IAI (similar to the AF WBC count) and may potentially be useful to select the subset of women with PPROMs requiring invasive amniocentesis. Similar observations have been reported in studies involving clinical infections and intra-amniotic inflammation in women with preterm labor and intact membranes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111432869">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719111432869">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719111432869">23</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>From a practical point of view, this noninvasive model can be used as a screening test for IAI rather than a diagnostic test. Specifically, screening for IAI would begin with this noninvasive model which can classify women with PPROMs into high- and low-risk groups, and women at high risk could then be targeted for invasive amniocentesis. Based on our suggested risk-score threshold (≥0.3), using this model would safely avoid amniocentesis in 87% of women with clinical and laboratory data, indicating the absence of IAI and thereby reduce the number of amniocentesis by approximately one half (47.8% [87×55%]). A lower score threshold (≥0.1) would reduce the number of amniocentesis by 13%, while having the greatest sensitivity (98.4%) and negative predictive value (95.5%), which would make this model an excellent tool for the exclusion of IAI. A precise cutoff to undergo amniocentesis is difficult to generate; accordingly, we believe it is preferable to utilize a risk score threshold that is not fixed and can vary based on the patient’s or obstetrician’s tolerance of risk and gestational age at the time of presentation. Some obstetricians may prefer to select a lower risk threshold to ensure that women truly at high risk for IAI are not missed, whereas other obstetricians may prefer to choose a higher threshold value to minimize the false-positive error rate. In addition, for women near term, incorrectly missing the diagnosis of IAI would have serious consequences, and the risk score threshold would be lower to obtain maximum negative predictive value (sensitivity). As a result, this noninvasive model can play a significant role in patients’ counseling and clinical decision making in advance of amniocentesis.</p>
<p>The finding that the earlier in gestation that PROM occurs, the greater the risk of IAI is consistent with the results of a previous study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719111432869">1</xref>
</sup> Similarly, in the setting of preterm labor and intact membranes, an inverse relationship has been demonstrated between gestational age at the time of presentation and IAI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111432869">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719111432869">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719111432869">24</xref>
</sup> The reason for the excess rate of IAI in women who are diagnosed with PPROMs at an earlier gestational age has not been determined. However, it should be noted that fetal injury leading to cerebral palsy and chronic lung disease depends on the gestational age of the fetus at the time of the insult (IAI and hypoxia)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719111432869">25</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719111432869">26</xref>
</sup> and of all clinical and laboratory tests available before delivery, direct analysis of the AF obtained by amniocentesis is the only method to detect microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity and/or intra-amniotic inflammation during pregnancy. Such information can be useful in counseling patients antenatally.</p>
<p>In the present study, we demonstrated that the prevalence of IAI is significantly higher in parous women than nulliparous women with PPROMs. The explanation for this finding is not readily apparent. We explored the possibility that a difference in a history of a previous preterm birth might be responsible for this finding because several studies have shown a significant association between a history of a previous preterm birth, a short cervix, and intra-amniotic inflammation in the mid-trimester.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719111432869">27</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719111432869"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719111432869">29</xref>
</sup> However, the rate of IAI was not different between parous women with and without a history of a previous preterm birth. An alternative view is that multiparous women might be at an increased risk for preexisting infection of the uterine cavity as a predisposing factor in PPROMs<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719111432869">30</xref>
</sup> because both a history of pelvic inflammatory disease and intrauterine contraceptive device use, which suggest infection of the uterine cavity before delivery, have been shown to be independently associated with parity &gt;0.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719111432869">31</xref>
</sup> Of interest, similar differences in parity and intra-amniotic inflammation have also been found in women with preterm labor and intact membranes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719111432869">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Our results extend previous findings<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719111432869">4</xref>
</sup> by showing that the serum CRP level contributes significantly and independently to the prediction of IAI and carried the most weight in our noninvasive model. In fact, serum CRP levels have been incorporated into several noninvasive algorithms of clinical infection and intra-amniotic inflammation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111432869">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719111432869">23</xref>
</sup> These findings are in agreement with the evidence on the role of IL-6, the predominant deriver of CRP release,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719111432869">32</xref>
</sup> and a significant association between maternal serum IL-6, histologic chorioamnionitis, and intra-amniotic inflammation in the setting of PPROMs.<sup>

</p>
<p>The present study had several limitations. First, it was a retrospective study; however, most data (ie, maternal and perinatal parameters, except for AF IL-6 level) were collected prior to inclusion in the study by means of an electronically prepared Excel-based (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) data collection tool. Thus, each data element was accurately documented and verified. Second, the data were obtained from only 1 hospital and there may be concern in applying this model to other populations of women. Further studies are needed to validate this proposed model in other study populations. Third, we lacked data on other important noninvasive parameters that might be predictive of the risk of IAI, such as cervicovaginal IL-6 levels.<sup>

</sup> Fourth, our study used stored samples to measure AF IL-6 levels. This could lead to potential bias to interpret findings from our study, because IL-6 levels in AF appeared to decrease with time despite optimal freezing conditions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719111432869">36</xref>
</sup> The strength of our study was that the value of markers of intra-amniotic inflammation, such as AF IL-6 levels, was specifically evaluated on the same patients that were participants in the development of the risk score model. Choosing an arbitrarily defined intra-amniotic inflammation cutoff yields biased estimates of the risk score, particularly in the sample of patients that have a different intra-amniotic inflammation distribution. Another strength of the present study was that all medications, such as antibiotics, corticosteroids, and tocolytics, were started after amniocentesis according to the study protocol, and thus the effect of therapy on IAI was well controlled.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study was the first to demonstrate that a model consisting of widely available, noninvasive clinical and laboratory parameters is highly predictive of identifying IAI in women with PPROMs. Overall, the model performed as well as the AF WBC count for predicting IAI. These findings may be useful for clinicians in predicting individual risk probability and directing targeted therapy and to researchers for designing and interpreting clinical trials.</p>
