<p>From the outset this book’s author is explicit in stating her contention that, despite the recognition of the harmful effects on children of domestic violence, policy and practice is still heavily skewed toward the abused mothers’ parenting capacity and failure to protect. It is argued that this has perpetuated ‘gendered discourses of parenting’ and overlooked the more direct link between violent fathering and significant harm to children. The book’s aim is to highlight the changes needed in policy and practice to improve the safety of children and it utilizes findings from qualitative research to achieve this.</p>
<p>Throughout its six chapters there is a clear emphasis on the proposition that violent and abusive fathers should not be considered ’good enough’ fathers and that the discourse which promotes fathers’ rights to a relationship with their children needs to be more effectively challenged. The first chapter takes the child’s perspective and it suggests that policy continually undermines a child’s right to reject a relationship with a violent father. The review of research presents a powerful message that children are often clear that they have no affectionate bond with fathers who have harmed them and their mother and want no more to do with them; others will only contemplate a relationship where a father can demonstrate that his violent behavior has ceased. Chapter 2 looks at the way that fatherhood is constructed through law and policy and it provides a useful historical overview.  This again concludes that, despite a strong emphasis in statute and practice guidance that the child’s view should be central to decisions made about them, practice continues to be ’unsafe’ in that ‘pro-father policies continue to be promoted at the expense of children’s safety’ (p. 79).</p>
<p>Chapter 3 briefly examines theoretical approaches to explaining a father’s violence toward their family and it goes on to look at research undertaken with perpetrators attending offender programmes. I found this chapter to be the most useful in stimulating some understanding of how such fathers might rationalize their continuing relationship with their children and it enabled me to contextualize the meaning of parenting within a masculine discourse.  The association between the father’s sense of ownership and entitlement to have their own needs met with their perceptions and treatment of children caused me to reconsider my own approaches to assessment. However, in addition to this, the author’s persistent focus on violent fathers with little reference to the majority of fathers who are not violent caused me to question how such evidence might latently undermine the role of a ’good’ father. In Chapter 4 the author discusses her own research with domestically violent fathers and it focuses on the issue of post separation contact. This research shows how fathers can continue to abuse their children despite their desire to have a loving relationship with them; it re-emphasizes that this failure to prioritize children’s feelings and needs is situated in the fathers’ view of their children as their possessions. The author also goes on to suggest that in many cases the desire for contact was connected with a desire to revenge the mother.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 discusses the impact of perpetrator programmes from the perspectives of the fathers that attend. It is suggested that the fathers’ accounts lack empathy for their children, which reflect their attitudes toward children and parenting in general. Their views on parenting skills and discipline failed to respect their children’s rights and they prioritized their own feelings and needs. This caused the author to question the content of such programmes and whether they can adequately assess the likelihood of further harm to children. The final chapter makes some recommendations of how policy and practice can change, particularly in social care, family law and criminal justice. The theme of these recommendations reflects the book’s contention and the author acknowledges the controversial nature of proposals that challenge inequality and impinge on fathers’ rights. I agree wholeheartedly with the need for practice to be truly child centred and this book will stimulate a lot of personal reflection in practitioners who strive to protect children from harm. Personally it provoked the question of what the alternative explanations might be and I would tentatively suggest that a more critically balanced analysis would acknowledge some merit in promoting a father’s right to maintain a relationship with his child. This might also provide a more positive perspective to inform practice on the role of the father in safeguarding and promoting the needs of vulnerable children.</p>
