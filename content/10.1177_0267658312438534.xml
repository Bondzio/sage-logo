<p>Although thoroughly analysed in adult second language acquisition (L2A), the acquisition of subject properties in child L2A has not received so much attention and the majority of studies deal with longitudinal data or only with a single subject property. This study contributes new cross-sectional data from 5-year-old Spanish children acquiring second language (L2) English in an immersion bilingual context with age of onset three and analyses the acquisition of all the subject properties traditionally associated as a cluster in comparison to a monolingual control group of the same age. The data were obtained by means of an orally elicited judgement/correction experimental task and enabled us to explore the children’s awareness of grammaticality contrasts in their L2, the influence of their L1 after two years of exposure and the extent to which the cluster of subject properties traditionally associated and studied together develop similarly in acquisitional terms. Results suggest that 5-year-old children show sensitivity to grammaticality contrasts in their L2 English and indicate that even after two years of exposure and although the age of onset of acquisition was only three, their L2 is influenced by their first language (L1) subject properties, although developmental effects also need to be taken into account when explaining the results.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>The status of child second language acquisition (L2A) in itself and the importance of age of onset of acquisition in comparison to adult L2A and monolingual and bilingual first language acquisition (L1A) is now a research focus in a variety of languages and linguistic phenomena (see, among others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267658312438534">Blom, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267658312438534">Haznedar and Gavruseva, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267658312438534">Ionin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0267658312438534">Meisel, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0267658312438534">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267658312438534">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0267658312438534">Pladevall-Ballester, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0267658312438534">Schwartz, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0267658312438534">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0267658312438534">Unsworth, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0267658312438534">2005b</xref>). The present study focuses on a group of 5-year-old child second language (L2) English learners whose first language (L1) is Spanish, who live in Spain and whose age of first exposure to L2 English in an immersion bilingual context was three. More specifically, the study explores the children’s awareness of grammaticality and ungrammaticality with respect to L2 English subject properties in comparison to native monolingual controls of the same age. The linguistic items to be analysed include the cluster of properties associated with the traditional pro-drop parameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267658312438534">Jaeggli, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267658312438534">Jaeggli and Safir, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0267658312438534">Rizzi, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0267658312438534">1986</xref>) (i.e. null and overt pronominal and expletive subjects, preverbal and postverbal subjects and <italic>that</italic>-trace effects) and inflectional morphology, although results will be discussed according to more recent theoretical proposals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0267658312438534">Platzack, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0267658312438534">Rizzi, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0267658312438534">2005</xref>). The acquisition of subject properties in child L2 English has not been extensively analysed and the majority of studies dealing with it explore longitudinal data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267658312438534">Hilles, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267658312438534">Lakshmanan, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267658312438534">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0267658312438534">Mobaraki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267658312438534">Park, 2004</xref>). This study contributes new cross-sectional data from Spanish children acquiring L2 English in an immersion bilingual context. The data were obtained by means of an orally elicited judgement/correction experimental task, where children were presented with grammatical and ungrammatical sentences uttered by puppets and were prompted to judge whether the sentences sounded strange and whether to change or repeat them as originally said. The data obtained will enable us to delve into the children’s awareness of grammaticality contrasts in their L2, the influence of the L1 on the children’s L2 after two years of exposure and the extent to which the cluster of subject properties traditionally associated and studied together develop in a similar way. Results suggest that 5-year-old children are indeed sensitive to grammaticality contrasts in their L2 English as they were capable of making correct and incorrect judgements about the sentences, and there is a clear difference in their judgements of grammatical sentences (which were extremely accurate) and their judgements of ungrammatical sentences, whose rejection was significantly lower than in the native control group. Yet, some incorrect judgements and repetitions of sentences included hesitations, which indicate the children’s awareness of ungrammaticality but incapacity to positively discern and correct the target ungrammatical element. In spite of the children’s linguistic sensitivity in their L2, results point towards the existence of a certain influence of L1 subject properties – but not structural transfer – on child English L2A still after two years of exposure, with <italic>that</italic>-trace effects patterning differently from the rest of subject properties, as expected. Yet developmental effects are also contemplated when discussing the results.</p>
<p>This article is organized as follows: Section II focuses on the theoretical framework adopted in the study; studies related to subjects in adult and child L2 English are briefly presented in Section III; Section IV deals with the study of child L2A; Section V presents the research questions and hypothesis of the present study and its methodological aspects; Section VI analyses the results, Section VII discusses the results and, finally, Section VIII draws essential concluding remarks.</p>

<title>II English and Spanish subject properties</title>
<p>Early research on the L2A of English subjects adopts the traditional version of the Null Subject Parameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267658312438534">Chomsky, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267658312438534">Jaeggli, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267658312438534">Jaeggli and Safir, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0267658312438534">Rizzi, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0267658312438534">1986</xref>) as originally proposed within the Government and Binding framework, which provided an account of a cluster of phenomena present in null subject languages but absent in overt subject languages, on the basis of parametric variation related to richness of inflection and identification properties and so by which languages with a positive null subject value (i.e. Spanish and Italian but not English or French) share a number of properties which include null subjects, the absence of expletive pronouns, subject-verb inversion, <italic>that</italic>-trace sequences and rich verbal agreement.</p>
<p>The Null Subject Parameter is accounted for differently within Minimalism and hence the related presumably clustered properties of subjects in English and Spanish are analysed differently. The present research follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0267658312438534">Platzack’s (2004)</xref> syntactic account of subjects: The Person Phrase Hypothesis, which provides a unified way of accounting for subjects and agreement in both null and non-null subject languages according to a minimalist view of parameters and the EPP.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0267658312438534">1</xref></sup> Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0267658312438534">Ritter (1995)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0267658312438534">Platzack (2004)</xref> argues that agreement (Agr) originates as the head of a Person Phrase (PersP), which can take a DP as a complement and which is merged in a theta position, as the subject in Spec-vP. Depending on the element taken from the lexicon to express Pers° several possibilities arise. If the element expressing Pers° has grammatical but not phonological features, PersP will appear as a DP. If the element merged as Pers° has grammatical as well as phonological features, this element can either be a free morpheme – in English and Spanish – or a bound morpheme – only in Spanish. If it is a free morpheme, it will be a pronoun with or without a DP complement. If it is a bound morpheme (Agr), as it happens in languages with rich agreement, such as Spanish or Italian, it should find a host outside PersP. T will assign Case to PersP and the EPP feature in T will attract Pers° (Agr) to T, projecting a new PersP. V will also be attracted to T and then internally merged to PersP without projecting. Finally, morphological merger will take place and Pers°+T will be realized as an affix on V. In languages without V-raising, such as English, agreement is not an argumental affix and Pers° is either a free morpheme (i.e. a pronoun) or it is not phonologically realized and PersP is represented as an ordinary DP. In those languages, PersP (i.e. the subject) would subsequently raise to Spec-T attracted by the EPP feature in T.</p>
<p><italic>That-</italic>trace effects were also traditionally linked to the Null Subject Parameter and more specifically to the ECP and the availability vs. non-availability of postverbal subjects in a language. More recent syntactic accounts have dissociated <italic>that-</italic>trace effects from the Null Subject Parameter, such as that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0267658312438534">Pesetsky and Torrego (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0267658312438534">2004)</xref>, which considers <italic>that-</italic>trace effects an instance of the T-to-C movement asymmetry similar to that found in English matrix <italic>wh</italic>-questions. Both phenomena involve the absence of an element in C, an auxiliary verb or the complementizers <italic>that</italic>, when there is subject <italic>wh</italic>-extraction. The authors propose that, in <italic>that-</italic>trace effects constructions, <italic>that</italic> is not C but ‘an instance of T that has moved to C’ (2001: 371). When the <italic>wh</italic>-phrase is a non-subject, <italic>that</italic> will move from T to C. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0267658312438534">Pesetsky and Torrego’s (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0267658312438534">2004)</xref> account of <italic>that</italic>-trace effects, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267658312438534">Gallego (2006)</xref> observes that Romance languages cannot make use of subject DPs to delete <italic>u</italic>T on C and therefore, <italic>that</italic>-trace effects are not attested. The present study will depart from the traditional concept of clustered null subject properties, which in the light of the results will be discussed under more recent theoretical claims.</p>

<title>III Subjects in L2 English</title>
<p>The study of subjects being omitted and all their related properties in early child languages irrespectively of whether the target grammar allows them or not has been a focus of research within the study of first language acquisition from the traditional Principles and Parameters framework to more recent accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267658312438534">Hyams, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267658312438534">1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267658312438534">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267658312438534">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0267658312438534">Radford, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0267658312438534">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0267658312438534">Rizzi, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0267658312438534">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0267658312438534">1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0267658312438534">1994b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0267658312438534">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0267658312438534">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0267658312438534">Roeper and Rohrbacher, 1995</xref>, among others) and has inevitably influenced the study of subject properties in L2A. Although the acquisition of subjects in adult L2 English has been extensively studied in a variety of L1s and mainly using cross-sectional experimental methodology in instruction acquisition settings in both English and non-English speaking countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0267658312438534">Phinney, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0267658312438534">Tsimpli and Roussou, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0267658312438534">Wakabayashi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0267658312438534">White, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0267658312438534">1986</xref>, among others) child L2 English subjects have been less widely explored and only using longitudinal data collection methods in naturalistic acquisition settings in English-speaking countries and mainly focusing on the production of null/overt subjects and inflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267658312438534">Hilles, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267658312438534">Lakshmanan, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267658312438534">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0267658312438534">Mobaraki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267658312438534">Park, 2004</xref>). Early research on the L2A of English subjects adopts the traditional version of the Null Subject Parameter outlined above. This is the case in three of the most relevant accounts of adult English L2 subjects, namely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0267658312438534">White (1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0267658312438534">1986)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0267658312438534">Phinney (1987)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0267658312438534">Tsimpli and Roussou (1991)</xref>, which followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0267658312438534">Rizzi (1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0267658312438534">1986)</xref>.</p>
<p>As for subjects in child L2 English, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267658312438534">Hilles (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267658312438534">Lakshmanan (1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267658312438534">1994)</xref> study them on the basis of the Morphological Uniformity Principle (MUP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267658312438534">Jaeggli and Safir, 1989</xref>), which states that null subjects are only licensed in languages with uniform verb paradigms and that the acquisition of the Null Subject Parameter should be related to the emergence of verbal inflection. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0267658312438534">Wakabayashi (2002)</xref>, for adult L2 English, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0267658312438534">Park (2004)</xref> for child L2 English, which compare the L2A of the non-allowed null subjects in English by Japanese and Spanish native speakers, adopt the Minimalist Program framework and its claim that language acquisition involves the learning of formal features and finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0267658312438534">Mobaraki et al. (2008)</xref> discuss in relatively traditional terms whether child L2 English subject use indicates presence/absence of functional projections in early child grammars in comparison to child L1A.</p>
<p>Research on child L2 English subjects has mainly dealt with longitudinal data and the observation of null/pronominal subjects and their relationship with inflection. There is thus a clear need for cross-sectional data and the analysis of the ‘traditional’ cluster of subject properties as a whole in child L2 English, as was done in adult L2A earlier studies.</p>

<sec id="section4-0267658312438534">
<title>IV The importance of child L2A</title>
<p>The study of child L2A is now a focus of research, particularly regarding its similarities and differences in different grammatical areas with respect to child L1A and adult L2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267658312438534">Blom, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267658312438534">Ionin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0267658312438534">Meisel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0267658312438534">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267658312438534">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0267658312438534">Pladevall-Ballester, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0267658312438534">Schwartz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0267658312438534">Unsworth, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0267658312438534">Whong-Barr and Schwartz, 2002</xref>, among others). Child L2A shares representational and developmental properties of both L1A and adult L2A and hence it is a valuable tool in the general picture of language acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267658312438534">Lakshmanan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0267658312438534">Schwartz, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0267658312438534">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0267658312438534">2004</xref>). The child L2 learner is cognitively more mature than the child L1 acquirer but less mature than the adult L2 learner, she is affected by the existence of the L1 grammar and she is remarkably successful in ultimate attainment studies. It is also important to distinguish child L2A from bilingual L1A. The former is defined as successive child bilingualism, whereas the latter is defined as simultaneous child bilingualism, which refers to the acquisition of two languages from birth. Child L2A implies acquiring an L1 and starting L2 exposure at least when most grammatical principles of the native language are assumed to have been acquired, around the age of four (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267658312438534">Guasti, 2002</xref>). Yet, and on the basis of maturational effects on successful ultimate attainment, another age of onset needs to be established as the limit after which native-like ultimate attainment is no longer possible, namely around the age of seven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267658312438534">DeKeyser, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0267658312438534">Schwartz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0267658312438534">Unsworth, 2005a</xref>). Non-native acquirers who are first exposed to an L2 between the ages of 4 and 7 are thus child L2 acquirers. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267658312438534">Haznedar and Gavruseva’s (2008)</xref> words, child L2 learners are ‘successive bilinguals who have acquired the basic fundamentals of their native language (L1) and who are exposed to a second language (L2) between the ages of 4 to 8’ (p. 3). Therefore, age of onset of acquisition, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267658312438534">Meisel (2009)</xref> points out, is essential in order to distinguish child L2A from monolingual and bilingual L1A. However, as the author indicates, a range of variation with respect to age of onset is to be expected and hence research in this area should also include children with age of onset of three, as is the case of the present study. In fact, other proposals had also been made with regards to a lower cut off point, namely around the age of three (for discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0267658312438534">McLaughlin, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0267658312438534">Lakshmanan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0267658312438534">Lakshmanan, 2009</xref>).</p>

The main aim of this experimental study is to explore the children’s sensitivity to grammaticality contrasts with respect to L2 English subject properties in comparison to a control group of monolingual English-speaking 5-year-old children. The lack of cross-linguistic studies on child L2 English subjects and the fact that the existing longitudinal studies mainly focused on the presence vs. absence of pronominal subjects and their relationship with inflection makes the study of all L1 Spanish-L2 English subject properties (i.e. null and overt pronominal and expletive subjects, preverbal and postverbal subjects and <italic>that</italic>-trace effects) even more relevant, particularly because subject properties have been the target of some studies on L2 English in adult L2A.</p>
<p>Three research questions guide this piece of research:</p>
<list id="list1-0267658312438534" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Are 5-year-old children able to discern grammatical and ungrammatical subject properties in their L2 English after two years of exposure?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What is the role of the L1 in the children’s L2 (with respect to subject properties) after two years of exposure?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do the subject properties traditionally associated (Null Subject Parameter) and studied together develop in a similar way in child L2 English?</p></list-item></list>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0267658312438534">Schwartz (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0267658312438534">2004</xref>), we assume that child L2A grants full access to UG and the principles that guide acquisition. Children in this study should hence show awareness of grammaticality contrasts in their L2 English as their L2 acquisition process not only relies on general learning skills but also on internal mechanisms as in L1A given that maturational constraints are assumed not to have had important effects at the time of first exposure yet. However, L1 Transfer is also assumed to be present in early stages, but since the children under study have been exposed to the L2 for two years in an immersion setting and their age of onset of acquisition is below four, L1 Transfer effects are predicted to be minimal, although we need to bear in mind that the children under study do not live in an English-speaking country and hence their exposure to their L1 is greater and certain L1 influence on the children’s L2 performance is indeed expected. As compared to the control group under study, the experimental children will have had fewer years of exposure to English by virtue of starting their exposure at the age of three and not from birth. Hence, developmental effects may be also present in that L2 children may undergo the same developmental stages as L1 children but some years later. As for the cluster of subject properties and except for <italic>that</italic>-trace effects which, as shown in Section II, have been dissociated from the subject properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0267658312438534">Pesetsky and Torrego, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0267658312438534">2004</xref>), they should develop similarly in child L2A, assuming the theoretical framework adopted here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0267658312438534">Platzack, 2004</xref>) by which the presence/absence of null subjects and the possibility/impossibility of postverbal subjects are accounted for by the way the EPP feature in T is checked and if we assume that UG is at least partly operative. In other words, subject properties should display statistically similar results in the data. However, showing that the children’s levels of non-target L2 performance are similar across the different phenomena tested will not enable us to postulate clustering effects in child L2, since this could be due to other factors and hence our contribution will be largely descriptive in this respect.</p>

<title>2 Method</title>
<p>An elicited oral judgement/correction experiment (<italic>Johnny Lion and Susie Cow</italic>) was designed to elicit judgements and corrections of ungrammaticality from the children. Children were presented with grammatical and ungrammatical sentences uttered by puppets and were prompted to judge and indicate whether the sentences sounded right or wrong. However, 5-year-old children are not particularly familiar with the concept of a sentence sounding right or wrong. That is why the experimenter sometimes used the words ‘strange’ or ‘funny’ to exemplify what we meant or paraphrased what they were to do telling children to decide if they would say the sentence as such or not. This might have been problematic in that a given structure can sound strange but still be grammatical, although this would possibly create more problems when judging semantic or pragmatic alternatives and not so much when judging syntactic structures, as is the case in this study. It should be mentioned that the children were not assessed in their L1 to find out how they would have judged the sentences in Catalan/Spanish. This would have given us more information as to how the children were judging the sentences and would have provided more insights into the L1 transfer issue.</p>
<p>Once the sentence was judged, children had to decide whether to change the sentence or repeat it as it was originally said. Twenty ungrammatical and eight grammatical sentences were designed according to the properties to be tested and taking vocabulary items from previous class activities. The 28 sentences were divided into two blocks (14 each) which were presented to the child on two different sessions, depending on the children’s attitude and tiredness. The specific items to be tested in the sentences included four pronominal null subjects in main (with and without previous reference) and embedded clauses, two null expletive subjects, three postverbal subjects in main and embedded clauses, two instances of <italic>that</italic>-trace effects, three third person singular morphemes <italic>-s</italic>, two regular past morphemes <italic>-ed</italic>, two irregular past and two inflected forms in non-inflected positions. The grammatical sentences were designed to act as counterparts of each ungrammatical type of sentence and at the same time served as fillers and enabled us to see whether children were paying attention to the task. The number of sentences was kept to a minimum considering the linguistic items to be tested and the grammatical sentences were only restricted to eight to represent the number of properties to be tested. In the same vein, and as indicated, the grammatical sentences also served as fillers to ensure that children were paying attention. The restricted number of sentences was also motivated by the fact that 5-year-old children’s span of attention is relatively short and the experiment was already conducted in two sessions. Yet there were probably too few items relating to verb inflection and including grammatical and ungrammatical <italic>that-</italic>trace sentences with <italic>wh</italic>-extraction from the object position would have helped the author identify if <italic>wh</italic>-extraction, not only subject extraction, is too complex for children at this age. However and as already mentioned, including more sentences in the experiment was not considered given the age and attention capacity of the children.</p>
<p>The presentation of the 28 sentences was ordered in a way that could not create a pattern for the child. That is to say, sentences that tested the same properties were not presented together and grammatical counterpart sentences were carefully inserted among the ungrammatical ones. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267658312438534">Table 1</xref> illustrates the sentences and their target linguistic items.</p>

<title>a Experimental data</title>
<p>Data from child L2 English were collected in an American immersion school in Barcelona. Children from all over the world as well as Spanish children attend the school from nursery class (three years) to 12th grade (seventeen years). Children are taught entirely in English and only hear Spanish in their Spanish Language classes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0267658312438534">3</xref></sup> The school was chosen as it proved to be the school which best suited the requirements of the study, namely it provided the most intensive English immersion programme as compared to other similar schools in the area of Barcelona.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0267658312438534">4</xref></sup> The study aimed at Kindergarten class (5-year-olds), who had started attending the school, and hence being exposed to L2 English, at the age of 3 in nursery class. About half of the class had Spanish/Catalan parents, whereas the other half had American parents, mixed American-Spanish parents or parents with other nationalities. Though all family situations were worth studying, the study obviously focused on Spanish/Catalan children, whose home languages were both Spanish and Catalan and who were only exposed to English as an L2 at school. At the time of testing, the children had been exposed to English for about 2,362 hours during two and a half school years, so the group is clearly beyond the initial state of acquisition.</p>
<p>In order to familiarize with the children, I visited the class two days a week for a month and a half before the actual experimental tasks took place and I took part in all class activities with the children. I was introduced as a visiting American teacher who had to write a book about children. I therefore pretended not to understand any Spanish or Catalan so that target children would only communicate in English with me. The class had a tutor and one assistant, who were both American. Thus all communication between them and the children was expected to be in English, though the tutor could understand Spanish and Catalan. All class activities and games were held in English and other school staff such as secretaries, lunchtime teachers or assistants addressed the children in English. Only forty minutes a day of Spanish language class was given but Spanish children tended to address each other in Spanish in the playground, but not inside the classroom, unless there was any other international student around. No questionnaire could be used to find out the extent to which the children used their L1s and the L2: neither the children, who obviously cannot reflect on this being 5-year-olds nor the parents who rarely bring or pick up their children from this type of school. That is why we spent a month observing the children who took part in the experiment.</p>
<p>Fifteen Spanish/Catalan children were selected to participate in the study. Two students were left out as permission was not obtained to carry out the study with one of them and the other had severe difficulties in understanding the task and English in general as he had just started attending the school that same year. Children were individually taken to a classroom where a puppet theatre was set up. Two experimenters were involved in the task; Experimenter 1 (EXP1), who sat by the child, explained the task and prompted the child to judge the sentences uttered by the puppets, and Experimenter 2 (EXP2), a volunteer undergraduate student, who did the puppets show behind the theatre and uttered the sentences.</p>
<p>EXP1 told the child a brief story about Johnny Lion and Susie Cow (the two puppets), which acted as a prompt for children to judge the sentences: ‘Johnny Lion and Susie Cow are best friends. They go to the same school but Johnny has had a bit of an ear infection for some days and has stayed at home. Susie Cow is visiting him and is telling him several things about school. The problem is that Johnny’s ear is not totally recovered and cannot hear very well and on top of that, Susie Cow sometimes speaks funny. And this is why they need your help’. Susie Cow needed the child to repeat what she was saying to Johnny Lion but since she sometimes spoke funny, the child was told to decide whether the sentence uttered sounded right or funny and then repeat it to Johnny Lion or change it so that Johnny Lion could understand better. It was emphasized that what Susie Cow was saying was right and that they had to pay attention to the way she said it. As Susie Cow uttered every sentence, Johnny Lion pretended not to hear or understand well the sentence. EXP1 reminded the child that he/she had to help Susie Cow repeat the sentence for Johnny Lion and Susie Cow talked directly to the child, asked for his/her help and thanked him/her after every sentence. Sentences could be repeated twice, either by the puppet or by EXP1, if the child did not understand or hear them. At the same time, if the child repeated the sentence without paying attention or analysing whether it sounded right or funny, the task was stopped or the response was not given any score and counted as a drop-out. The task was originally designed to take place in two sessions of 14 sentences each. However, depending on the child’s attitude and tiredness, the whole task was carried out in one only session or in more than two sessions.</p>

<sec id="section9-0267658312438534">
<title>b Control data</title>
<p>English children control data were collected in a community primary school in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom, which offers education to children from Early Years (4–5 years old) to Year 7 (eleven-twelve years old). In order to collect parallel data to the experimental data, research focused on the Early Years class (Tadpoles Class: 5-year-olds). The general procedure of the task, the structure of the sentences, the linguistic items to be tested, the order of presentation and the number of informants (i.e. fifteen) remained exactly the same. Experimenter 2 (EXP2) (i.e. the experimenter who did the puppets at the experimental school) was a Teaching Assistant from the Tadpoles class here, who knew the children well. The prompt story about <italic>Johnny Lion and Susie Cow</italic> remained the same. As for the timing of the experiment, although it was initially planned that children would carry it out in two different sessions, as it had been the case at the experimental school, all of them proved to be capable of listening and judging the 28 sentences in only one session.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0267658312438534">
<title>c Data analysis</title>
<p>Experimental and control children’s responses were first transcribed and then coded and analysed according to instances of correct judgements (i.e. acceptance of grammatical sentences and rejection/correction of ungrammatical sentences) and incorrect judgments. Then, instances of hesitations, irrespectively of whether the judgement was analysed as correct or incorrect, were coded. Hesitations were taken to indicate that the child perceived the oddness of the sentence though s/he was not able to produce the target corrected grammatical construction and were considered to be those instances of filled or unfilled pauses with a cut-off point of 0.5 seconds and that could clearly be identified by the experimenter. In order for the analysis of hesitations to be more objective, there should have been two raters noting each instance of hesitation and hence a check of inter-rater reliability, which was at the time of the experiment not possible. Yet hesitations were still included in the analysis since they contribute valuable information on how the children perceived and reacted to the sentences.</p>
<p>Ungrammatical sentences were grouped into six variable conditions representing ‘Verbal Inflection’, ‘Null Subjects in Main Clauses’, ‘Null Subjects in Subordinate Clauses’, ‘Null Expletives’, ‘Postverbal subjects’ and ‘<italic>That</italic>-trace sequences’. Grammatical sentences were grouped into the same variable conditions representing ‘Verbal Inflection’, ‘Overt Subjects’, grouping null subjects in main and subordinate clauses under the same variable, ‘Overt Expletives’, ‘Preverbal Subjects’ and ‘<italic>That</italic>-trace sequences’.</p>
<p>In order to provide an explanation to our research questions, the statistical analysis focused on the two following objectives:</p>
<list id="list2-0267658312438534" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>compare control native and non-native data for each condition examined in the task; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>compare the results on the traditionally associated subject properties among themselves to see if they develop in a similar way.</p></list-item>

<title>VI Results</title>
<sec id="section12-0267658312438534">
<title>1 Non-native and native control data</title>
<p>Bearing in mind that the sample size was relatively small (i.e. fifteen informants in the experimental and the control groups) and in order to verify that the appropriate statistical tests were applied, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test of normality of distribution with the Lilliefors significance correction was applied to all variables. Results indicated that the data are not normally distributed (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), which implies that non-parametric statistical tests had to be applied. Mann–Whitney U test and a Wilcoxon Z test were used in this data analysis and therefore <italic>medians</italic> and not <italic>means</italic> are compared, although means will also be included in the tables for clarity purposes. The level of significance will be α = .05 all throughout the analysis.</p>
<p>Our first comparative analysis contrasts non-native and native control results of rejection/correction of ungrammatical sentences variables. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267658312438534">Table 2</xref> illustrates, native and non-native results differ significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) in all variables, except in ‘<italic>That</italic>-trace sequences’. Whereas the control group obtains constant rejection medians of 100.00% in ‘Verb inflection’, ‘Null Expletives’ and ‘Null Subjects in Main and Subordinate Clauses’, non-native percentages are significantly lower. In the case of ‘Postverbal Subjects’, the control median is not so high (i.e. 66.66%) but still significantly higher than that of the experimental group (i.e. 33.33%; U 3.000, p = .005). ‘<italic>That</italic>-trace sequences’ behave differently from the other variables and prove rather difficult to correct for both groups, whose difference of results is not significant. The two medians seem to differ notably (i.e. 0.00% in the experimental group and 50% in the control group), although the results from the control group show a remarkable deal of variability ranging from 0.00% to 100.00%, hence causing the non-significant difference.</p>

<p>No hesitations in the children’s judgements and corrections occurred with grammatical sentences either in the control or the experimental groups, whereas they were (minimally) present in ungrammatical sentences, particularly among the non-native children. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0267658312438534">Table 4</xref> shows, experimental children mostly hesitated when judging ungrammatical null subjects in main clauses, where a significant difference emerges with respect to the control group (i.e. U 7.000, p = .008), and presented very low percentages of hesitations in the other variables, except in ‘<italic>That</italic>-trace sequences’ where no hesitations occurred. Control children displayed practically no hesitations in their results, except in ungrammatical ‘Postverbal Subjects’, where they hesitated even more than experimental children.</p>

<title>2 Non-native data on subject properties</title>
<p>In order to examine whether the different subject properties tested in the task display similar behaviour in acquisitional terms, rejection/correction of ungrammaticality variables were statistically compared to one another by means of paired comparisons of related samples (Wilcoxon Z test with the Bonferroni correction). Acceptance of grammaticality variables were not compared among themselves since, as seen above, they display similarly accurate results. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0267658312438534">Table 5</xref> shows that all subject variables, including ‘<italic>That</italic>-trace sequences’, pattern alike in the experimental group, as the null hypothesis of equal medians is maintained for all variables (i.e. p&gt; .05). An almost significant difference is observed between ‘Null Subjects in Subordinate Clauses’ and ‘Null Expletive Subjects’ both with a median of 50.00% but with a very different distribution of results, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267658312438534">Figure 1</xref> illustrates.

<title>VII Discussion</title>
<p>Having presented the results, this section discusses the data obtained in relation to the key issues addressed in the study, namely children’s awareness of grammaticality contrasts in L2 English and the kind of errors they make, influence of the children’s L1 on their L2 performance and L1-independent development, and whether the different subject properties tested show similar results.</p>
<p>The fact that children in this study can and indeed do make judgements of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences in their L2 English already shows a certain degree of awareness of linguistic properties in their L2. More importantly, children obtained extremely accurate results in their judgement of grammatical sentences where no significant differences emerged with respect to the control monolingual group in any variables except for ‘<italic>That</italic>-trace sequences’, whose grammatical examples are still too difficult to judge by non-native 5-year-olds. Yet their judgements of ungrammatical subject properties were not so accurate and the children’s rejection of ungrammaticality was significantly lower than in the native control group in all variables, except for ‘<italic>That</italic>-trace sequences’, whose ungrammatical examples are still too difficult to be correctly judged even by native monolingual children. This shows that experimental children in this study are indeed sensitive to grammaticality contrasts in their L2 English, as their judgements of sentences are clearly not randomly made but respond to the well-formedness of sentences. In fact, some incorrect judgements included hesitations, which indicate the children’s awareness of ungrammaticality but incapacity to positively discern and correct the target ungrammatical element. As specified above, hesitations were analysed as such irrespectively of whether the repetitions were coded as correct or incorrect. Thus, when judging and repeating the sentences, some of the children correctly changed the ungrammatical elements but they remained hesitant about it. This was analysed as correct and also as a hesitation. Others hesitated but did not change anything and others changed the ungrammatical elements but in an incorrect way or even changed other elements which were not originally ungrammatical, thus showing that they are conscious of the fact that something is not appropriate even if they cannot work out exactly what it is. These cases were coded as incorrect or correct and also as hesitations. More specifically, where an omitted subject had to be provided or a postverbal subject had to be preverbal, if the child made errors in correctly choosing the appropriate lexical item (i.e. ‘he’ instead of ‘she’ or ‘my mother’ instead of ‘my sister’) these instances were counted as correct, as the child has realized a pronoun is needed there even if s/he cannot figure out which one is needed, since what is being tested is the impossibility of having a null element as a subject (see the examples from Lara, Guillermo and Lisa in (1)). However, if the child provided the wrong verb inflection in sentences testing inflection (i.e. ‘plays’ instead of ‘played’) the item was considered incorrect, as in the inflection sentences what is tested is precisely whether the child is able to provide the correct inflection (see the examples from Maria and Alvaro in (2)). It should be mentioned that sometimes the child correctly changes other elements in the sentence to accommodate the sentence to the type of inflection provided hence showing awareness of grammaticality (see the example from Maria in (2)). If the child provides the right pronoun or makes the lexical subject preverbal and changes the inflection – even if the original one was already correct – the item is considered correct as well, since the target is the pronoun/lexical subject (see the examples from Guillermo in (1) and in (4) and the example from Maria in (4)). Cases where the child had to provide a subject pronoun that were solved using other strategies that render the sentence grammatical were also coded as correct (see the example from Maria in (3) where she creates coordination so as to allow the null subject pronoun). Some examples of hesitations, changes and correct judgements/repetitions and the way they were coded are included below:</p>

<p>The children’s capacity to make judgements, even if incorrect, and their use of hesitations indicate that the children are not merely relying on imitation or general learning mechanisms but that they are linguistically sensitive and use (at least part of) the internal language mechanisms which are operative in L1A, as was predicted by the assumption that true child L2A grants access to UG and the principles that guide acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0267658312438534">Schwartz, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0267658312438534">2004</xref>). Age of onset of acquisition of the children under study was three, and considering that, in spite of individual variation, maturational constraints are assumed to start affecting language acquisition around age four (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267658312438534">Haznedar and Gavruseva, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0267658312438534">Meisel, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267658312438534">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0267658312438534">Schwartz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0267658312438534">Unsworth, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0267658312438534">2005b</xref>, among others), the fact that these children are linguistically sensitive is well accounted for. Indeed we will see below that their acquisition of subject properties resembles L1A in some respects and that they seem to know that English is not a <italic>prop-drop</italic> language, particularly when dealing with subjects of subordinate clauses. However, we need to bear in mind that there are still significant differences with respect to the control group in ungrammatical sentences and that these children still present some L1 influence on their L2 performance after two years of exposure to L2 English in an immersion environment and with a low age of onset of acquisition. To what extent this influence is due to structural L2 Transfer or is just due to L2 performance-related effects cannot be shown with the present data.</p>
<p>Focusing on the comparison of results between experimental and control 5-year-old children in their judgement of ungrammatical sentences, we can observe that percentages of correct judgements are significantly lower than those of the control group in all subject variables except for ‘<italic>That</italic>-trace Sequences’ in which the control group obtained lower and hence more similar results to the experimental group (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267658312438534">Table 2</xref>). Results on ‘<italic>That</italic>-trace sequences’ in both the experimental and control groups were much lower than the other subject variables, thus showing the different developmental path of this property with respect to the other properties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0267658312438534">5</xref></sup> Results on ‘Verb Inflection’ were also significantly lower than those of the control group, thus keeping a parallel development to subject variables. After two years of being exposed to L2 English in an immersion context, the children under study allow a statistically significant percentage of mainly null expletive and postverbal subjects and also (but to a lesser extent) null referential subjects in main and subordinate clauses, which are the L1 properties related to the strong pronominal [+interpretable] Agreement features on the verb of the children’s L1 Spanish (as outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0267658312438534">Platzack, 2004</xref>; see also Section II). The influence of the L1 was initially expected to be minimal given that these children have already been exposed to L2 English for two years in an immersion setting, which means that they are not in their initial stages of acquisition any longer, and given that their age of onset of acquisition was three, which means that in theory the first critical period (i.e. around age four) has not started and the children’s L2 should not be so much affected by their L1. In fact, a number of studies have recently explored the relationship between L1 Transfer and age of onset, pointing out that L1 Transfer increases as age of first exposure is delayed (approaching puberty) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267658312438534">Ionin, 2008</xref>), and that L1 Transfer is clearly more present in adult L2A than in child L2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267658312438534">Blom, 2008</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0267658312438534">Lakshmanan and Selinker (1994)</xref>, the development of the complementizers <italic>that</italic> in two child L2 English learners (one having Spanish as his L1) and two Spanish-speaking adolescent L2 English learners is explored and compared and results suggest that transfer effects are overridden in the case of the child L2 learners but not in the case of the adolescents. It seems to be the case that children in the present study, and as far as subject properties are concerned, are somehow affected by their L1 and thus differ from L1A. However, another factor needs to be taken into account when addressing the presence of L1 influence, which is the extent to which the L1 and the L2 are used in the context under analysis. Although the children were exposed to L2 English in an immersion context, they continued using their L1 at home and in the community, and even at school in some occasions and hence the influence of their L1 is inevitably greater than in other studies where the L2 is the language of the community. Given that the children prove to be linguistically sensitive, that their age of onset of acquisition is three and that they do not seem to be treating all English sentences as if they were Spanish (especially the subjects of embedded clauses) it would be too strong a claim to state that L1 structural Transfer is at work here. As there is not enough evidence to postulate L1 Transfer, the present results could also be explained through L1 influence on the children’s L2 performance, which results from the fact that they live in a Spanish/Catalan community and are hence inevitably influenced by their L1. This ‘borrowing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267658312438534">Corder, 1992</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267658312438534">Lakshmanan and Selinker, 2001</xref>), is a ‘communicative strategy during which speakers use certain aspects of their mother tongue to ‘express meanings’, on-line as it were, because their interlanguage simply lacks the means to do it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0267658312438534">Lakshmanan and Selinker, 2001</xref>) and is a characteristic of language use which does not imply that children are affected by structural transfer.</p>
<p>A further objective of the study was to determine whether all subject properties traditionally associated with the Null Subject Parameter develop in a similar way, although this cannot give us evidence for clustering effects. In other words, we analysed whether all subject properties display similar results in acquisitional terms, that is to say, if the children’s results on the different variables are significantly different from each other or not. As mentioned before, the study of the whole cluster of subject properties has not been carried out in child L2 English and was done for adult L2 English, determining that there is no cluster, but without statistical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0267658312438534">Tsimpli and Roussou, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0267658312438534">White, 1985</xref>). Statistical analysis is provided here but no causation can be derived from it, so clustering cannot be posited. As seen in Section V, the null hypothesis of equal medians could not be rejected for any variables, which implies that the children’s results in all subject variables are not significantly different from each other, which, together with the fact that they significantly diverge from the control group and considering the theoretical syntactic framework adopted here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0267658312438534">Platzack, 2004</xref>) and its predictions, indicate that at least null and postverbal subjects develop similarly. Contrary to what was expected, results of ‘<italic>That</italic>-trace Sequences’ were also non-significantly different from those of the other properties, given the variability in the results of the other variables. Yet the fact that their percentages are so low compared to the other variables and that they remain similarly problematic in grammatical and ungrammatical sentences and in ungrammatical sentences even for the control native children sets them apart from the occurrence of missing and postverbal subjects. Although clustering cannot be statistically demonstrated here, the notion of cluster can be at least theoretically maintained for the subject properties if we assume that missing and postverbal subjects<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0267658312438534">6</xref></sup> are derived from the pronominal/non-pronominal verbal agreement feature and hence the way the EPP is checked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0267658312438534">Platzack, 2004</xref>). As for ‘<italic>That</italic>-trace sequences’, although they were long associated with the rest of subject properties and in fact their occurrence or non-occurrence coincides with whether languages accept null and postverbal subjects or not, they have been recently given different syntactic accounts (see Section II; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267658312438534">Gallego, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0267658312438534">Pesetsky and Torrego, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0267658312438534">2004</xref>), which clearly set them apart from the other subject properties.</p>
<p>As has already been mentioned, ‘Postverbal Subjects’ and ‘Null Expletives’ obtained lower percentages than ‘Null Subjects’, especially ‘Null Subjects in Subordinate Clauses’, namely mean values of 28.47% and 28.57%, respectively versus 42.85% and 71.42% (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267658312438534">Table 2</xref>). This implies that children in this study found it more difficult to judge and correct ungrammatical null expletives and postverbal subjects than missing referential subjects. The fact that L1 Spanish children accepted more ungrammatical null expletives than null referential subjects in L2 English confirms the results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0267658312438534">Phinney (1987)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0267658312438534">Tsimpli and Roussou (1991)</xref>, although these studies examined adult L2 learners and used different methodologies and hence are hardly comparable. These results also confirm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267658312438534">Lakshmanan’s (1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0267658312438534">1994)</xref> longitudinal study on child L2 English, whose L1 Spanish-speaking child, Marta, produced significantly more null expletives than null referential subjects, although they only involved <italic>it is</italic> contexts. Unfortunately, no comparable cross-sectional (Spanish) child L2 English studies are reported in the literature as far as we know. The low rejection of ungrammatical postverbal subjects observed in this study contrasts to their low acceptance in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0267658312438534">White (1985</xref>) and rejection in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0267658312438534">Tsimpli and Roussou (1991)</xref>, although again these studies deal with adult L2 speakers of English.</p>
<p>Some of the results presented set a parallelism to L1A and might well be explained through developmental effects and not only through L1 influence. Since the two groups under study have not had the same exposure to English, as the control group was exposed to English from birth, it is plausible that the L2 children are going through the same developmental stages as the L1 children but only some years later. Apart from a similar behaviour with respect to <italic>that</italic>-trace effects, which can also be the result of processing difficulties, there are two other aspects which seem parallel to L1A, namely the correctly high rejection of ‘Null Subjects in Subordinate Clauses’ in comparison to the other variables and the high percentage of hesitations in ‘Null Subjects in Main Clauses’. Null subjects in early child language display a different distribution and acquisition pattern in the L1 acquisition of null subject languages and in non-null subject languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0267658312438534">Rizzi, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0267658312438534">2005</xref>) and this might indicate the possible existence of two subject UG parameters, namely the traditional Null Subject Parameter and the Root Subject Drop Parameter. The former is quickly fixed on the target value whereas the latter is delayed with respect to the negative value.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0267658312438534">7</xref></sup> In other words, children rapidly acquire the setting of the Null Subject Parameter. Children acquiring null subject languages like Italian or Spanish produce null subjects in all syntactic environments from very early on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267658312438534">Bel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267658312438534">Guasti, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0267658312438534">Rizzi, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0267658312438534">2000</xref>) and children acquiring a non-null subject language, such as English or French, never allow null subjects in non-initial positions (i.e. subordinate clauses or <italic>wh</italic>-environments) but continue dropping subjects in the specifier position of the root for a much longer period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267658312438534">Clahsen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267658312438534">Haegeman, 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267658312438534">1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0267658312438534">Rizzi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0267658312438534">Roeper and Rohrbacher, 1995</xref>). Children in this study reject many more null subjects in subordinate clauses than in root main clauses and null expletive subjects also in root positions and present a significant level of hesitation in their judgements of null subjects in main clauses in their L2 English as L1 English children do in early child English. Yet this occurs much later than in L1A, given that we are obviously dealing with a different process of acquisition in L2A, which is mainly affected by the children’s L1 and other external factors inevitably leading to lack of uniformity and slower rate of acquisition. Interestingly enough, in her study of child L2A acquisition of Spanish subject properties, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0267658312438534">Pladevall Ballester (2010)</xref> found that L1 English 5-year-old children acquiring L2 Spanish found it hard to correctly judge null/overt subjects in subordinate clauses in L2 Spanish and obtained much more accurate results in judging null/overt subjects in root positions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0267658312438534">8</xref></sup> In order to test whether the differences between L1 and L2 children are due to L1 Transfer or developmental effects a comparison between L2 English children from a null subject L1 language and a non-null subject L1 language would have to be made, which is beyond the aims of the present study. Another possibility would be to control amount of exposure between L1 and L2 children. However, this would imply cognitive differences which might clearly influence the results and the issue of age of onset would not be at play.</p>
<p>A last word should be mentioned about results on the inflection variable, which as mentioned above, are also significantly lower than those of the control native group. L2 English children significantly accepted non-inflected third person singular present tense or regular and irregular past tense verb forms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0267658312438534">9</xref></sup> Yet we do not know at this point whether L1 and L2 children follow the same developmental patterns with the only difference that L2 children are three years (i.e. age of onset) behind L1 children or if their process of L2 acquisition of inflectional verbal properties certainly follows a different path from child L1A, although their age of onset was as early as three and contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0267658312438534">Schwartz (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0267658312438534">2004)</xref> and the Domain-by-age model where in the domain of inflection, child L2A is claimed to be similar to L1A. Positing different paths is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0267658312438534">Meisel (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267658312438534">2009)</xref>, where the author corroborates that the acquisition of verb morphology in L2A children with ages of onset between ages three and four differ significantly from L1A children.</p>

<title>VIII Concluding remarks</title>
<p>This study contributes new cross-sectional data on child L2A of English subject properties as compared to a monolingual control group in an immersion bilingual setting. All in all, the findings suggest that 5-year-old children show sensitivity to grammatical/ungrammatical contrasts in L2 English subject properties, which does not mean that their judgements are native-like, and that results exhibit L1 influence on the children’s L2 performance for the subject properties traditionally associated as the Null Subject Parameter (except inflectional development and <italic>that</italic>-trace sequences), although results cannot really provide evidence for structural L1 Transfer.</p>
<p>Parallel development to L1A in the children’s acquisition of subjects in subordinate and main clauses has been observed and it has also been acknowledged that results may also be due to the effects of development and to the fact that L1 children have had more exposure than L2 children at the time of testing and may have already gone through the same stages. <italic>That</italic>-trace sequences were shown to develop differently from the other properties, as expected, and to present many more difficulties of understanding and acquisition even for the control monolingual group.</p>
<p>In fact, considering that the children under study had been exposed to L2 English for two years in an immersion setting and that their age of onset was three, we would have expected less L1 influence and more accurate results in the ungrammatical sentences. This adds evidence to the distinction between the L1A and L2A processes even in the case of child L2A and that, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0267658312438534">Meisel (2009)</xref> posits:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>evidence strongly supports the claim that fundamental differences are likely to emerge already in early childhood and that the FDH (Fundamental Difference Hypothesis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267658312438534">Bley-Vroman, 1990</xref>) can therefore be assumed to apply to cL2 as well as to aL2 acquisition. (p. 13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We would like to point out, however, that the fact that L1A and child L2A are different processes does not entail that child L2A and adult L2A are alike. Maturational constraints do exist in child L2A but not so strongly as in adult L2A, and we still assume that, at least partly, child L2 language is constrained by internal universal mechanisms that are clearly not available in adult L2A any more and that this is what makes children’s linguistic sensitivity to grammaticality and ungrammaticality possible and what makes successful ultimate attainment not inevitable, but possible, contrary to adult L2A. Further research should therefore compare data from this study to later age groups whose age of onset of acquisition was the same. This would enable us to see whether successful ultimate attainment of the specific constructions tested with age of first exposure being three is possible. Other possibilities of future research could involve a comparison with older learners with the same length of exposure or children of the same age with different lengths of exposure in order to test whether it is age and cognitive maturity or length of exposure that facilitates acquisition.</p>

<p>The fact that the school was American whereas, as will be seen in the next sections, data from control groups and from adults come from British English was not taken into account since the grammatical subject properties do not differ in both varieties.

<p>An anonymous reviewer pointed to the fact that pragmatic factors, such as given vs. new information can make VS orders possible in English (e.g. <italic>In the corner of the room is a desk</italic>) as well as the lexically restricted V2 constraint that appears in quotatives (e.g. <italic>‘No!’, cried the wizard</italic>).
