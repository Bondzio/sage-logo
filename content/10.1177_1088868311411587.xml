<abstract>
<p>Individualism–collectivism is one of the best researched dimensions of culture in psychology. One frequently asked but underexamined question regards its cross-temporal changes: Are cultures becoming individualistic? One influential theory of cultural change, modernization theory, predicts the rise of individualism as a consequence of economic growth. Findings from past research are generally consistent with this theory, but there is also a body of evidence suggesting its limitations. To examine these issues, cross-temporal analyses of individualism–collectivism in the United States and Japan were conducted. Diverging patterns of cultural changes were found across indices: In both countries, some of the obtained indices showed rising individualism over the past several decades, supporting the modernization theory. However, other indices showed patterns that are best understood within the frameworks of a shifting focus of social relationships and a persisting cultural heritage. A comprehensive theory of cultural change requires considerations of these factors in addition to the modernization effect.</p>

<p>A pattern of culture can persist for centuries. Nisbett and colleagues have suggested that cultural differences in perception, attention, and reasoning reflect differences in intellectual heritages: Daoism and Confucianism in East Asia and Greek philosophy in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1088868311411587">Nisbett, Peng, Choi, &amp; Norenzayan, 2001</xref>). However, sometimes a pattern of culture can transform itself in a matter of a few decades, as seen in post–cold war Eastern European societies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1088868311411587">Putnam (2000)</xref> amassed substantial evidence documenting the decline of social engagement and civic participation in American society within the past several decades. This consideration illustrates two intuitive but seemingly contradictory aspects of culture: Culture can persist for centuries, but it can change in a matter of a few decades. To the extent that culture and mind are mutually constitutive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1088868311411587">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>), understanding the ways in which culture changes and continues is important for psychological research. The current research takes on this challenging question by focusing on one specific aspect of culture, the dimension of individualism–collectivism.</p>
<sec id="section1-1088868311411587">
<title>Individualism–Collectivism in Psychological Research</title>
<p>Individuals differ in their relative independence from and interdependence to a social environment. This distinction is one of the most important in social science research and has been introduced repeatedly in the past, for example, as the distinctions between <italic>gemeinschaft</italic> and <italic>gesellschaft</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1088868311411587">Tonnies, 1887/1957</xref>) or mechanical and organic solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1088868311411587">Durkheim, 1893/1964</xref>). In psychological research, this distinction is best known as the dimension of individualism–collectivism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1088868311411587">Triandis (1995)</xref> defined the dimension as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p><italic>Collectivism</italic> may be initially defined as a social pattern consisting of closely linked individuals who see themselves as parts of one or more collectives (family, co-workers, tribe, nation); are primarily motivated by the norms of, and duties imposed by, those collectives; are willing to give priority to the goals of these collectives over their own personal goals; and emphasize their connectedness to members of these collectives. A preliminary definition of <italic>individualism</italic> is a social pattern that consists of loosely linked individuals who view themselves as independent of collectives; are primarily motivated by their own preferences, needs, rights, and contracts they establish with others; give priority to their personal goals over the goals of others; and emphasize rational analysis of the advantages and disadvantages to associating with others. (p. 2)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Individualism and collectivism are “cultural syndromes,” or central themes of culture around which various social and psychological processes are organized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1088868311411587">Triandis, 1995</xref>). For this reason, this dimension affords an examination of a wide range of social psychological processes of significant importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1088868311411587">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>). Also for this reason, individualism–collectivism has received more attention than other dimensions of culture that past research has introduced. For example, Geert Hofstede, in his landmark study of IBM employees worldwide, introduced three dimensions of culture aside from individualism–collectivism: uncertainty avoidance, power distance, and masculinity–femininity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088868311411587">Hofstede, 1984</xref>). Nevertheless, findings on individualism–collectivism are probably the most frequently cited aspect of this research.</p>
<p>In contemporary cross-cultural research, the dimension of individualism–collectivism has been used most intensively in comparisons of East Asians and North Americans. This framework has given rise to hundreds of studies on a diverse range of topics, such as self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1088868311411587">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>), cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1088868311411587">Nisbett et al., 2001</xref>), emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1088868311411587">Kitayama, Mesquita, &amp; Karasawa, 2006</xref>), subjective well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088868311411587">Diener, Oishi, &amp; Lucas, 2003</xref>), and choice making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1088868311411587">Iyengar &amp; Lepper, 1999</xref>), among others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1088868311411587">Kitayama &amp; Cohen, 2007</xref>). These studies have greatly contributed to psychologists’ understanding of the interplay between culture and mind.</p>
<p>With accumulating findings, however, several challenging issues have been uncovered. One issue is the appropriateness of applying the dimension at country level (e.g., the international ranking obtained by Hofstede) as a schema for cross-cultural variations observed at individual level. In fact, a meta-analysis conducted on this topic identified discrepancies between the so-called “common view” (i.e., collectivism in East Asia and individualism in North America) and the empirical findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1088868311411587">Oyserman, Coon, &amp; Kemmelmeier, 2002</xref>). For example, there was no significant difference between Americans and Koreans on the level of collectivism, and Americans were more collectivistic than Japanese. This meta-analysis incited much subsequent research. Several studies have investigated the possibility of methodological artifacts causing the identified divergence from the “common view.” These studies have found that the measures that control for these problems, for example, by specifying a reference group in self-report items with the Likert-type scale, do yield a pattern that is consistent with the “common view” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088868311411587">Heine, Lehman, Peng, &amp; Greenholtz, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Another issue facing individualism–collectivism research is the demand for a more refined conceptualization of the dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088868311411587">Brewer &amp; Chen, 2007</xref>). Individualism–collectivism research has flourished by treating individualism and collectivism as cultural syndromes encompassing a collection of social and psychological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1088868311411587">Triandis, 1995</xref>). From this perspective, much research has taken the form of theoretically deriving a particular psychological process from the individualism–collectivism framework and then demonstrating cross-cultural variation in that process. To cite just one example, several studies demonstrated cultural differences in approach and avoidance motivation based on the rationale that the approach focus is more beneficial for seeking socially independent goals, whereas the avoidance focus is more beneficial for seeking socially interdependent goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1088868311411587">Elliot, Chirkov, Kim, &amp; Sheldon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1088868311411587">Hamamura, Meijer, Heine, Kamaya, &amp; Hori, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1088868311411587">Lee, Aaker, &amp; Gardner, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>This approach has been productive in uncovering cross-cultural variations in many psychological processes, even ones that were previously regarded as universal, such as basic processes of cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1088868311411587">Nisbett et al., 2001</xref>) or the need for positive self-regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1088868311411587">Heine, Lehman, Markus, &amp; Kitayama, 1999</xref>). However, one consequence of this approach is that the field is left with a rather impoverished understanding of ways in which various psychological processes of individualism–collectivism cohere. As one example of this challenge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1088868311411587">Kitayama, Park, Sevincer, Karasawa, and Uskul (2009)</xref> measured individualism–collectivism with five tasks that are theoretically related (dispositional bias, focused vs. holistic attention, experience of disengaging and engaging emotions, personal vs. social happiness, and relative self-size) in four countries (United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan). These five tasks converged in finding the expected cross-cultural differences: In all tasks, Americans were most individualistic, Japanese were most collectivistic, and British and Germans were individualistic but to a lesser extent compared to Americans. At the individual level, however, these five tasks were uncorrelated with each other.</p>
<p>Faced with this issue, greater attention has been paid to the mechanism by which various psychological processes of individualism–collectivism are organized. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1088868311411587">Kitayama and colleagues (2009)</xref> suggested the role of independence and interdependence as the unifying theme of a cultural syndrome. Within each culture, according to this theory, various psychological processes are used in an idiosyncratic fashion to strive toward independence or interdependence. For example, to reach toward the goal of social interdependence, some individuals may adopt conformity, some may adopt holistic attention, and yet others may adopt self-criticism. Consequently, one’s inclination toward conformity does not necessarily predict one’s holistic attention or self-criticism. Nevertheless, at the collective level, these psychological processes are distributed in a systematic manner. That is, at the society level, conformity, holistic attention, and self-criticism are more prevalent in collectivistic societies relative to individualistic societies. In sum, recent research has introduced new ways of thinking about ways in which various psychological processes of individualism and collectivism cohere.</p>

<title>Theories of Cross-Cultural Variation in Individualism–Collectivism</title>
<p>Why is it that cultures differ on individualism–collectivism? Recent research has started to examine factors (ecological, economic, or historical) that have produced cross-cultural variation in individualism–collectivism. These factors include economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088868311411587">Hofstede, 1984</xref>), prevalence of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088868311411587">Fincher, Thornhill, Murray, &amp; Schaller, 2008</xref>), residential mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1088868311411587">Oishi, 2010</xref>), language use (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1088868311411587">Kashima &amp; Kashima, 2003</xref>), and voluntary migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1088868311411587">Kitayama, Ishii, Imada, Takemura, &amp; Ramaswamy, 2006</xref>). However, of these factors, economic development has received the most attention. In fact, the idea that individualism is caused by economic development has been enormously influential, to the extent that it has penetrated the lay theory of cultural change (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1088868311411587">Kashima et al., 2009</xref>). The current research examines predictions from this theory, hereinafter called <italic>modernization theory</italic>, in cross-temporal comparisons of the United States and Japan on the dimension of individualism–collectivism.</p>

<sec id="section3-1088868311411587">
<title>Modernization Theory: Individualism as a Consequence of Modernization</title>
<p>Modernization research emerged out of multidisciplinary interests in understanding cross-cultural differences in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1088868311411587">Inkeles, 1975</xref>). In psychological research, modernization theorists have focused on identifying the psychological consequences of societal modernization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1088868311411587">Inkeles, 1983</xref>). Studies conducted in this tradition have yielded a long list of characteristics. Although the list differs among theorists, it is generally composed of such things as personal efficacy, gender equality, achievement motivation, independence, greater civic participation, greater social relationships beyond kin, distancing from tradition and religion as a source of authority, and acceptance of social mobility (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1088868311411587">Yang, 1988</xref>). A brief survey of these lists suggests that individualism is one construct that encompasses many of the identified characteristics. In fact, it has been suggested that contemporary individualism–collectivism research emerged out of the tradition of modernity research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1088868311411587">Kagitcibasi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1088868311411587">Yang, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>How does societal modernization foster individualism? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1088868311411587">Sachs (2005)</xref> illustrated this process with an example of garment factories in urban centers of developing countries, such as Dhaka, Bangladesh. These factories often provide employment opportunities that are attractive to many workers, particularly young women from rural areas where there are no viable alternatives. This “foothold in the modern economy” in turn affords these workers an opportunity to manage their own income, own living space, and own life, such as making decisions regarding whom to date and marry and when to have children, decisions that are traditionally made in accordance with the interests of kin. This observation suggests that a society’s participation in the modern economy triggers changes in social institutions, such as greater urbanization, smaller household size, and a lower fertility rate (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1088868311411587">Newson, Postmes, Lea, &amp; Webley, 2005</xref>). At the psychological level, these social changes not only free individuals from traditional sources of social influence (e.g., kin relations) but also afford means of autonomous decision making.</p>
<p>Empirically, the link between societal modernization and individualism is well established. A correlation between Hofstede’s international index of individualism and per capita GDP, which is a frequently used index of societal modernization because of its wide availability and convergence with other indices of social development (e.g., infant mortality rate, level of education, urbanization), is high (<italic>r</italic> = .82; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088868311411587">Hofstede, 1984</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1088868311411587">Greenfield (2009)</xref> observed a shift from traditional communal orientation to a more urban individualistic orientation in many societies around the world, including small-scale societies. In a large cross-cultural study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088868311411587">Inglehart and Baker (2000)</xref> also found that per capita GDP is correlated with less emphasis placed on collectivistic ways of living (e.g., less emphasis on family and religion) and greater emphasis placed on individualistic ways of living (e.g., the pursuit of happiness or an emphasis on self-expression).</p>
<p>The relationship between social development and individualism is found within a society as well. Modernization triggers a series of changes in social structure, such as changes in family structure, advances in the level of education, and urbanization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1088868311411587">Inkeles, 1975</xref>). Within a society, individuals from a high socioeconomic status (SES) background tend to have greater exposure to these modern institutions. Hence, the modernization theory predicts a positive correlation between individualism and SES. Studies conducted around the world have indeed found such a correlation. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1088868311411587">Inkeles (1975)</xref> found that individuals’ exposure to modern institutions predicts individualism in all countries investigated (Argentina, Bangladesh, Chile, India, Israel, and Nigeria). Among Kenyans, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1088868311411587">Ma and Schoeneman (1997)</xref> found that whereas university students tended to describe themselves with personality attributes on the Twenty Statements Test, context-dependent descriptions of the self were more common among workers in Nairobi, and even more so among members of traditional communities, such as Masaai and Samburu. Among Americans, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1088868311411587">Snibbe and Markus (2005)</xref> found that self-expression and the pursuit of uniqueness are more important for Americans with a high SES background relative to a low SES background. This research indicates that individualism is more descriptive of Americans with high (relative to low) SES backgrounds (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1088868311411587">Kraus, Piff, &amp; Keltner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1088868311411587">Stephens, Markus, &amp; Townsend, 2007</xref>). A positive correlation between SES and individualism has also been reported among Filipinos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1088868311411587">Guthrie, 1977</xref>), Chinese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1088868311411587">Hamamura, Xu, &amp; Du, 2011</xref>), and Japanese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1088868311411587">Kameda, Takezawa, &amp; Hastie, 2005</xref>). In sum, evidence linking societal modernization and individualism is robust and is found across cultures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1088868311411587">
<title>Problems With the Modernization Theory</title>
<p>Despite the converging evidence, there are a few problems with modernization theory. First, the theory does not explain collectivism observed in highly developed societies in East Asia. Although there is a debate regarding the extent to which East Asian societies are collectivistic relative to Western societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1088868311411587">Oyserman et al., 2002</xref>), findings from much research in cultural psychology generally converge in suggesting the relatively collectivistic nature of East Asian societies (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1088868311411587">Kitayama &amp; Cohen, 2007</xref>). To the extent that there is little difference in economic development between these two regions, collectivism in highly developed East Asian societies poses a challenge to the modernization theory.</p>
<p>Another problem with the modernization theory is the issue of the direction of causality. Modernization theory argues that economic development causes individualism. However, the case for the opposite—that particular patterns of culture cause economic development—has been made, most prominently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1088868311411587">Max Weber (1904/1992)</xref>. In sum, despite available evidence pointing to the robust relationship between societal modernization and individualism, a few issues concerning the modernization theory raise doubts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1088868311411587">
<title>Modernization Without Westernization</title>
<p>An alternative to the modernization theory is to consider the role of a society’s cultural heritage in shaping the course of its change over time. Samuel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1088868311411587">Huntington (1996)</xref>, in <italic>The Clash of Civilizations</italic>, rejected modernization as a framework for cross-cultural differences and proposed that a society’s cultural heritage sets a path for its evolution. Huntington and other critics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1088868311411587">Gusfield, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1088868311411587">Kagitcibasi, 1994</xref>) have argued against the conflation of modernization with “Westernization.” To some extent, such a conflation is inevitable, as modernized societies have predominately been Western societies. Nonetheless, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1088868311411587">Huntington (1996)</xref> stated, “[T]he West was the West long before it was modern” (p. 69), and argued that modernization of the West is a product of Western cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Under this framework, hereinafter called <italic>cultural heritage theory</italic>, the process of modernization is not uniform across cultures. Moreover, individualism, which is seen as a uniquely Western cultural phenomenon, is not a necessary consequence of modernization. Much has been written on the idea of multiple pathways for societal modernization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1088868311411587">Huntington (1996)</xref> found evidence in Japan. Modernization in Japan, starting in the mid-19th century, thoroughly transformed key political, economic, and technological institutions. Traditional cultural ideas and practices (e.g., Confucianism, filial piety) were seen as obstacles, and not only did Japanese adopted Western products, institutions, and technologies but also many ruling elites experimented with Western ideas, values, and ways of living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1088868311411587">Hirakawa, 1989</xref>). Nevertheless, in a matter of a few decades, the trend swung back and newly introduced Western ideas and technologies began to coexist with traditional cultural practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1088868311411587">Rozman, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Empirical support for the multiple pathways of modernization was found in a large cross-cultural survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088868311411587">Inglehart &amp; Baker, 2000</xref>). With data obtained from 65 countries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088868311411587">Inglehart and Baker (2000)</xref> investigated the relationship among economic development, cultural heritage, and values. One of the value dimensions investigated was that of survival versus self-expression orientation, which is highly similar to individualism–collectivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1088868311411587">Inglehart &amp; Oyserman, 2004</xref>). This research found the following. First, consistent with modernization theory, the endorsement of individualistic values was positively correlated with GDP. Second, cultural heritage accounted for variance in values, even after controlling for differences in GDP. For example, predominantly Protestant countries in Europe were more individualistic relative to other countries after controlling for differences in GDP. In contrast, countries belonging to the former communist bloc were more collectivistic relative to other countries. In sum, this research suggests that a society’s cultural heritage influences its current orientation on the individualism–collectivism dimension, independently of modernization.</p>

<title>Review of Prior Cross-Temporal Comparison Studies</title>
<p>Two broad theories of cultural change were considered. On one hand, the modernization theory suggests that the rise of individualism is one of the consequences of economic growth, and the theory predicts such a trend across societies. On the other hand, the cultural heritage theory considers the role of a society’s cultural heritage in shaping the course of its cross-temporal changes. This theory predicts continuity in a pattern of culture over time. Findings from past cross-temporal research support both of these theories.</p>
<p>Some studies are consistent with the modernization theory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088868311411587">Inglehart and Baker (2000)</xref> found increasing importance of individualistic values between the 1980s and the 1990s in those societies that posted economic growth. This effect was independently replicated across societies in Asia and the Pacific with a different set of values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088868311411587">Allen et al., 2007</xref>). Among Chinese, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1088868311411587">Yang (1996)</xref> concluded that the personality profile of Chinese people has shifted toward individual orientation from social orientation over the years. Many commentators in Japan have noted the rise of individualism over the past several decades (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1088868311411587">Yamagishi, 1999</xref>). One telling example of this trend is found in the changing norms of marriage. In the 1950s, the norm of Japanese marriage was to marry someone arranged by the concerned parties (e.g., parents, senior colleagues at work); arranged marriages accounted for more than half of all marriages, whereas love-based marriages accounted for only about one third. However, in a matter of several decades, the norm reversed. In recent years, the norm of marriage has become love based, which accounts for more than 80% of all marriages, and arranged marriages have become rare, accounting for only about 5% of all marriages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1088868311411587">National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings from the United States suggest a similar trend. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088868311411587">Alwin (1989)</xref> noted the rising importance of independence and the decline of obedience and conformity among Americans. A meta-analysis of conformity found that the conformity effects among Americans decreased over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088868311411587">Bond &amp; Smith, 1996</xref>). Over the years, Americans have become more withdrawn from social groups and institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1088868311411587">Glenn, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1088868311411587">Putnam, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1088868311411587">Roberts and Helson (1997)</xref> found a rise in the individualistic personality profile over time. Research by Twenge and colleagues also found a pattern of rising individualism in many psychological processes over the past several decades, including self-esteem and self-enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1088868311411587">Twenge &amp; Campbell, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1088868311411587">2008</xref>), narcissism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1088868311411587">Twenge, Konrath, Foster, Campbell, &amp; Bushman, 2008</xref>), and a decreasing need for social approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1088868311411587">Twenge &amp; Im, 2007</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1088868311411587">Twenge, Abebe, and Campbell (2010)</xref> reported that American parents are increasingly choosing unique names for their children, suggesting an increasing emphasis placed on uniqueness. In sum, findings from these studies are consistent with the modernization theory in showing the rise of individualism in those societies that experienced economic growth.</p>
<p>However, other findings do not fit this pattern. Among Americans, despite the rise of individualistic psychological processes, the importance of family life has remained relatively stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1088868311411587">Thornton &amp; Young-DeMarco, 2001</xref>), and external locus of control has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1088868311411587">Twenge, Zhang, &amp; Im, 2004</xref>). In addition, some indices of individualism have shown no cross-temporal change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1088868311411587">Trzesniewski &amp; Donnellan, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, several studies conducted in East Asian societies have reported the coexistence of rising individualism and traditional patterns of culture. Findings from Japanese social surveys indicated continuing emphasis on group orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088868311411587">Caudill, 1973</xref>) and traditional values, such as filial piety, obedience to authority, and group solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1088868311411587">Flanagan, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1088868311411587">Trommsdorff, 1983</xref>). Similar trends were also reported among Chinese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1088868311411587">Yang, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, the large body of evidence generally supports the modernization theory: Societies that experienced economic growth have generally become more individualistic. However, there are also findings that do not fit this trend: Some cross-temporal patterns found in the United States do not fit the pattern of rising individualism, and findings from East Asian societies suggest the persistence of traditional collectivistic patterns of culture along with rising individualism.</p>

<title>Current Research</title>
<p>The current research investigates the relationship between economic development and individualism–collectivism by cross-temporarily examining two highly developed societies with distinct cultural heritages: the United States and Japan. The period under investigation is from 1950 to 2008, which is characterized by steady economic development for both countries (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1088868311411587">Figure 1</xref>). In the United States, per capita GDP adjusted for inflation increased from $9,561 in 1950 to $31,049 in 2006. Similarly, the Japanese economy grew significantly, from $1,921 in 1950 to $22,464 in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1088868311411587">Maddison, 2008</xref>). The two theories considered above make diverging predictions. On one hand, the modernization theory predicts a rise of individualism as both countries have experienced substantial economic development. In contrast, the cultural heritage theory predicts continuity in patterns of American and Japanese cultures, even during periods marked by significant economic growth.</p>

<title>Measure of Individualism–Collectivism</title>
<p>Individualistic and collectivistic cultural syndromes manifest in a variety of social and psychological processes. As such, its measurement should also tap into a broad array of social and psychological phenomena. Moreover, to carry out cross-temporal analyses, this research requires indices with data available for decades. These indices were obtained from two broad sources: demographics and archives of surveys.</p>
<p>Demographics compiled by various government agencies were examined. With an interest in cross-temporal analysis, the search was limited to those indices that were available for at least a decade.</p>
<p>Similarly, indices were searched from surveys that were conducted repeatedly for an extended period. Survey data were searched from relevant literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1088868311411587">Putnam, 2000</xref>) as well as online resources that archive these surveys (e.g., the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research). Identified surveys included international surveys (the World Values Survey [WVS] and the World Youth Survey [WYS]) and national surveys (the General Social Survey [GSS], the American National Election Survey [ANES], the DDB Lifestyle Survey [DDB], and the National Characteristic Survey [NCS]; see the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1088868311411587">appendix</xref> also found online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pspr.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://pspr.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link> for details). Items in these surveys cover a variety of issues, such as religion, government spending, gender relations, race relations, immigration, and confidence in various public institutions. Although none of the surveys was designed to measure individualism–collectivism, some of the items investigated issues pertaining to this dimension. Prior research guided the identification of these items. Again, because of the interest in cultural changes, this search was limited to items with data available for at least a decade.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1088868311411587">
<title>Validation</title>
<p>Next, the items’ conceptual linkage with individualism–collectivism was empirically verified. This step is important for two reasons. First, many of the indices have not been used in prior research, and the empirical relationships with individualism–collectivism are unknown. Second, research in cultural psychology cautions against interpreting self-report responses on explicit self-beliefs and values, as these responses not only are confounded with response style differences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088868311411587">Heine et al., 2002</xref>) but also are poorly correlated with other types of measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1088868311411587">Kitayama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1088868311411587">Na et al., 2010</xref>). To ensure that the findings from the survey items extend beyond self-report responses, the items’ linkage with individualism–collectivism was verified against behavioral indices of individualism–collectivism.</p>
<p>Items were validated either internationally or domestically. Those indices where data were available for both countries (i.e., demographics and items from the international surveys) were validated by international indices of individualism–collectivism using the following procedure. First, for each index, the most recent worldwide data were obtained, and these data were correlated with three independent indices of individualism–collectivism. The three indices were the index developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1088868311411587">Hofstede (1984)</xref>, which is based on self-report data, as well as two indices that rely on non-self-report data: the index of pronoun drop, or whether the language of a society allows pronouns to be dropped (E. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1088868311411587">Kashima &amp; Kashima, 1998</xref>), and the index of pathogen prevalence, or the extent to which disease-causing pathogens were prevalent in a society’s historical environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088868311411587">Fincher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1088868311411587">Murray &amp; Schaller, 2010</xref>). The linguistic practice of pronoun drop indicates collectivism as the practice reduces the symbolic prominence of an actor and contextualizes the action (E. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1088868311411587">Kashima &amp; Kashima, 1998</xref>). The pathogen prevalence indicates collectivism because collectivistic tendencies, such as conformity, reluctance toward interactions with out-groups, and adherence to social norms, are an effective defense against disease-causing pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088868311411587">Fincher et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>These three indices are highly correlated (<italic>r</italic>s &gt; .63). Nevertheless, they differ in the number and coverage of countries. For this reason, the three resulting correlations were averaged, and indices were retained if the average correlation exceeded |.30| in the theorized direction (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088868311411587">Table 1</xref>). For example, the worldwide data on the percentage of population living in urban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1088868311411587">United Nations Statistics Division, 2009</xref>) had an average correlation of .32 with individualism (<italic>r</italic>s with Hofstede = .30, pathogen prevalence = .43, and pronoun drop = .23), and thus this item was retained. Of the international surveys, the WYS is administered in only five countries. To increase the reliability of the validation, for the items obtained from this source, data from the three most recent administrations were obtained.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>For items identified in national surveys, the empirical relationship to individualism–collectivism was examined at the regional level within each country. For the items identified in American surveys, data from the three most recent administrations were obtained for all states (the ANES and the DDB) or regions (the GSS) and were correlated with the scores of individualism–collectivism for American states that were compiled from a set of demographic indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1088868311411587">Vandello &amp; Cohen, 1999</xref>). Regional scores of individualism–collectivism were obtained by averaging the scores for the encompassing states. Indices with a correlation greater than |.30| in the theorized direction were obtained (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088868311411587">Table 1</xref>). For example, an item from the ANES asked, “Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people?” The percentage of agreement with the former option across states correlated at .62 with individualism, and thus the item was retained.</p>
<p>For items from the Japanese survey, data from the three most recent administrations were obtained for all regions and were correlated with the scores of individualism–collectivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088868311411587">Hitokoto, Murabe, Narita, &amp; Tanaka-Matsumi, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1088868311411587">Hitokoto et al. (2010)</xref> developed this index using a method similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1088868311411587">Vandello and Cohen (1999)</xref> to reveal regional variations in individualism–collectivism within Japan. Regional scores of individualism–collectivism were obtained by averaging the scores for the encompassing prefectures. Items with a correlation greater than |.30| in the theorized direction were obtained (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088868311411587">Table 1</xref>). For example, an item from the NCS asked about important moral principles, with “respect individual rights” being one of the options. The percentage of participants choosing this option across regions in Japan correlated at .36 with individualism and thus the item was retained.</p>
<p>Two issues need to be noted concerning the item validation. First, the validation resulted in many indices that were theoretically relevant to individualism–collectivism not being retained for lack of empirical relationships (e.g., the theoretical relationship was not verified) or for lack of sufficient data for validation (e.g., regional data were not available). Second, because all of the benchmarks of individualism–collectivism used for validation operationalize the single-dimension structure, the obtained indices were also analyzed on the single dimension with individualism and collectivism being two opposing ends, which is appropriate for the analysis of a culture-level trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1088868311411587">Triandis, Bontempo, Villareal, Asai, &amp; Lucca, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1088868311411587">Vandello &amp; Cohen, 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1088868311411587">
<title>Indices of Individualism–Collectivism</title>
<p>A total of 26 indices met the above inclusion criteria (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088868311411587">Table 1</xref>). These indices fell into one of the following themes. Some items assessed the strength of family relationships. Research indicates that family relationships tend to be stronger and closer in collectivistic societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1088868311411587">Triandis, 1995</xref>). Sample items in this category are demographic, such as household size and divorce rates, and survey items on family values (e.g., unconditional love toward parents) and frequency of social interactions with family members.</p>
<p>One survey item assessed the importance of friendship. Research suggests that individualistic societies place greater value on friendship than collectivistic societies do: For example, individualists have more positive attitudes toward friends than collectivists, whose attitudes toward friends tend to be more ambivalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088868311411587">Adams &amp; Plaut, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A demographic on urbanization tracks the proportion of population living in urban areas. Research suggests that urbanization is characterized by social relations that are detached from traditional collectivistic social relations, and it is regarded as one of the primary societal forces behind individualism (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1088868311411587">Kashima et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of survey items assessed social values. A few of them assessed values in child socialization: independence and obedience. Research suggests that child socialization focuses on nurturing independence in individualistic societies and obedience in collectivistic societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1088868311411587">Triandis, 1995</xref>). Other items assessed values such as social obligation, social harmony, tradition following, contribution to a collectivistic goal, and the importance of society or nation: All of these are characteristic of collectivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1088868311411587">Triandis, 1995</xref>). In addition, one item assessed the importance of individual right, which is associated with individualism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1088868311411587">Triandis, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of survey items assessed general trust of others. Research finds that individualists are more trusting of general others (vs. intimate others) than collectivists are. Specifically, in collectivistic societies, where important social relations tend to concentrate within in-groups, trust does not generalize beyond in-group members, whereas in individualistic societies social relationships tend to be more expansive and trust is not confined to in-groups: in fact, general trust of others serves as a lubricant for expansive social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1088868311411587">Yamagishi &amp; Yamagishi, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, one survey item assessed the importance of personal effort for success. Research suggests that effort is valued more in collectivistic societies than in individualistic societies, as it is seen as a key for goals valued in these societies, such as self-improvement and social harmony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1088868311411587">Heine et al., 1999</xref>). For instance, a study asking participants about the relative contribution of effort and the innate ability for intelligence found that whereas Japanese participants, on average, attributed 55% of intelligence to effort, that proportion was only 36% among European American participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1088868311411587">Heine et al., 2001</xref>). This linkage between the importance of effort and collectivism was confirmed in the validation that collectivistic societies placed relatively greater importance on effort than individualistic societies did (<italic>r</italic> = –.53).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All of the indices except average household size and the divorce rate were obtained via percentage (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088868311411587">Table 1</xref>). Historical changes in the obtained indices were analyzed in three ways: ecological correlation, annual change, and scatter plot. First, for each index, a correlation with year was computed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1088868311411587">Table 2</xref>). This correlation captured a linear trend of each index over time. The direction of these correlations was standardized based on the validated relationship with the dimension: A positive correlation was set to indicate an increase of individualism, whereas a negative correlation was set to indicate an increase of collectivism. These were ecological correlations (correlations between group-level values; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1088868311411587">Robinson, 1950</xref>), which are appropriate for studying culture-level phenomenon, but they could not be used to infer individual-level phenomena. The sample size of these correlations corresponded to the number of years in which a particular item was administered; thus, they were small, especially for the survey indices, despite the fact that the items were administered to thousands of participants over the years. For this reason, analyses of the correlations focused on their direction and magnitude and not on significance tests.</p>

<p>There is no established convention for interpreting the size of ecological correlations, partly because ecological correlations are known to produce a larger magnitude compared to individual-level correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1088868311411587">Robinson, 1950</xref>). Furthermore, correlations that are large in magnitude could be obtained from changes that are relatively small in absolute magnitude (i.e., a linear trend for a small change). For these reasons, analyses of absolute magnitude accompanied the correlations. For each index, the difference between the two earliest and the two latest values was obtained, and the difference was divided by the number of years the index was available (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1088868311411587">Table 2</xref>). For example, an item from the GSS assessed the importance of obedience in child socialization. In 1986, 23.4% of the participants thought obedience was important, and in 1987, 19.9% of the respondents had the same response. In contrast, in 2006 and 2008 only 17.0% and 15.7% of the participants thought obedience was important, respectively. This index had an average annual change rate of 0.24% (or a 5.3% difference over a 22-year period). Given the average population of more than 110 million in Japan and 230 million in the United States, for the past several decades, a 1% change roughly corresponds to annual changes in more than 1.1 million Japanese and 2.3 million Americans.</p>
<p>Indices with correlations below |.10| or annual rates less than 0.1% (or changes that are less than 1% per decade) were operationalized as not showing changes. This conservative criterion was selected to conduct analyses that are sensitive to cultural changes. In addition, all of the indices were plotted against year and visually inspected for nonlinear trends.</p>

<sec id="section14-1088868311411587">
<title>Changes in the United States</title>
<p>In the United States, average household size decreased over time (<italic>r</italic> = .96), whereas the proportion of people living in urban areas (<italic>r</italic> = .96) and the divorce rate (<italic>r</italic> = .52) increased over time (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1088868311411587">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1088868311411587">Figure 2</xref>). These are dramatic changes. In 1950, the average American household consisted of 3.4 people, but in 2006 the average was 2.6 people. Urban population increased at an average annual rate of 0.3%, which equates to about 700,000 Americans migrating to urban areas every year since 1950. Similarly, in 1950, only 2.6 out of every 1,000 Americans experienced divorce, whereas the rate was 3.8 in 2003. These findings are consistent with the modernization theory: During a period of steady economic growth, individualism increased. In the scatter plot, one nonlinear trend was apparent: The divorce rate in the United States peaked around 1980 and has gradually decreased since then (<italic>r</italic> = −.98 since 1980 vs. .52 overall). In past research, this trend has been attributed to factors such as an aging population and the rise of cohabitation in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1088868311411587">Goldstein, 1999</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, findings from the survey indices were examined (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1088868311411587">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1088868311411587">Figures 3</xref> through <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1088868311411587">6</xref>). The importance of obedience in child socialization decreased (<italic>r</italic> = .73). The percentage of young adults feeling that social contribution is important for a fulfilling life also decreased over time (<italic>r</italic> = .89). These findings also indicate a rise in individualism.</p>

</fig>
<p>However, this pattern did not emerge in the other indices. Over the years, agreement with unconditional love and respect for parents increased (<italic>r</italic> = −.78), and, among young adults, the perceived importance of effort for success increased (<italic>r</italic> = −.65). To the extent that strong family relations and importance of personal effort for success are associated with collectivism, increases in these indices suggest a rise in collectivism. Furthermore, the importance of friendship (<italic>r</italic> = .43, annual change = .03%) and the frequency of interactions with relatives have not changed over time (<italic>r</italic> = −.13, annual change = .01%).</p>
<p>Two items assessed the importance of independence in child socialization. The item from the WVS (importance of “independence”) indicated a rising importance of independence (<italic>r</italic> = .77). In contrast, a similar item from the GSS (importance of “think for oneself”) showed the opposite pattern (<italic>r</italic> = −.86). The divergence between these two items is surprising, as the two items not only are similar in content and time coverage but also are correlated with individualism in the validation (<italic>r</italic> with individualism was .32 for the WVS item and .71 for the GSS item).</p>
<p>Several indices assessed Americans’ trust of other people. Three indices asked participants whether most people in society could be trusted (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1088868311411587">Figure 5</xref>). Findings across these three items converged in showing the decline of trust in American society (<italic>r</italic>s &lt; −.35). In terms of annual changes, the item from the ANES showed no change (annual change = −.01%), whereas two other indices showed a decline (the GSS: -.39%; the WVS: -.33%). Hence, a discrepancy among surveys was found. The decline of trust was also found in a decreasing percentage of Americans feeling that most people are honest (<italic>r</italic> = −.88). These findings generally replicate prior research documenting the decline of trust in American society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1088868311411587">Putnam, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>There were four additional items on trust. Two items asked whether most people would try to be helpful or just look out for themselves (from the ANES and the GSS), and two items asked whether most people would try to be fair or try to take advantage of another if they got the chance (also from the ANES and the GSS; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1088868311411587">Figure 6</xref>). However, for both of these items, the findings from the GSS and the ANES diverged. Although items from the GSS showed that Americans have developed a less benevolent view of others over time (<italic>r</italic>s &lt; −.35), items from the ANES showed the opposite pattern (<italic>r</italic>s &gt; .16). With an inspection of scatter plots, one trend that was common to all of the ANES items (but not to items from other sources) was that they showed a rise in trust since 2000. Nevertheless, the source of the discrepancy is not clear: These items not only are very similar in item content and time coverage but also have a similar empirical relationship to individualism in the validation process (<italic>r</italic>s with individualism &gt; .43).</p>

<sec id="section15-1088868311411587">
<title>Findings Summary</title>
<p>Diverging patterns were observed across indices. The rise of individualism was observed in both the residential and the family environment: Over the years, urban population increased, household size became smaller, and divorce became more prevalent. These changes were accompanied by changes in some attitudes and values: A smaller percentage of Americans today value social contribution and obedience in children. However, other indices did not fit this pattern. Relationships with family and friends have been largely stable or have even strengthened over time, as indicated by the continuing importance of friendship and interactions with relatives and an increase in unconditional love and respect for parents. Moreover, young adults in the United States today perceive a greater importance of effort for success. In addition, Americans have become less trusting of others over the years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1088868311411587">
<title>Changes in Japan</title>
<p>Similar to in the United States, in Japan the average household size decreased (<italic>r</italic> = .94), whereas the proportion of people living in urban areas (<italic>r</italic> = .97) and the divorce rate (<italic>r</italic> = .90) increased (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1088868311411587">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1088868311411587">Figure 2</xref>). These changes are even more pronounced than the American pattern: In 1950, the average household consisted of 5 people, but in 2006 the average was 2.7 people. The urban population increased at a rate of 0.6% per year, equivalent to about 600,000 Japanese migrating to urban areas every year since 1950. In 1950, only 1 out of every 1,000 Japanese experienced divorce, whereas the rate was 2.3 out of every 1,000 in 2004.</p>
<p>The corresponding trend was found in some but not all survey indices (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1088868311411587">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1088868311411587">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1088868311411587">8</xref>). The importance of independence in child socialization increased (<italic>r</italic> = .96), and following tradition is seen as less important today (<italic>r</italic> = .19). When family life is pitted against business engagement, a greater proportion of Japanese today would choose business over family (<italic>r</italic> = .36). These trends suggest a rise of individualism in Japan over the past several decades, a period characterized by steady economic growth (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1088868311411587">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>However, this pattern did not apply to other indices. The importance of social obligation increased (<italic>r</italic> = −.55), whereas the importance of individual rights decreased (<italic>r</italic> = −.81). Among young adults, the perceived importance of effort for success increased (<italic>r</italic> = −.76). Furthermore, the percentage of young adults feeling that making a positive contribution to society is important for a fulfilling life has increased over time (<italic>r</italic> = −.71). These trends suggest a rise of collectivism in Japan. Some indices indicated no changes over time. For example, Japanese’s feelings of unconditional love and respect for parents were unchanged over time (<italic>r</italic> = −.22, annual change = −.05%), as were the importance of friendship (<italic>r</italic> = .47, annual change = .04%), social harmony (<italic>r</italic> = −.39, annual change = .03%), and society or nation (<italic>r</italic> = −.77, annual change = −.06%).</p>
<p>Two items assessed trust among the Japanese. The item asking whether most people can be trusted showed no change (<italic>r</italic> = −.30, annual change -.02%). In contrast, when asked whether people would try to take advantage of another if they got the chance, the percentage of Japanese disagreeing with this item actually increased over time (<italic>r</italic> = .71), indicating an increase in the benevolent view of others in society.</p>

<title>Findings Summary</title>
<p>In Japan, the rise of individualism was observed in both the residential and family environments: Over the years, Japanese migrated to urban areas, household size became smaller, and divorce became more prevalent. These changes were accompanied by changes in attitudes and values: Following tradition has become less important over time, and independence is seen as more important in child socialization today. Furthermore, when given a choice between seeing a dying parent and attending an important business meeting, more Japanese today would go to the business meeting. However, this pattern did not apply to other indices. The importance of unconditional love toward parents, friendship, and social harmony has not changed over time. Moreover, the importance of social obligations has increased, whereas respect for individual rights has become less important. In addition, an increasing number of young adults perceived a greater importance of effort for success and felt that social contribution is important for a fulfilling life. Concerning trust of others, the available indices do not indicate a decline of trust in Japan.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The modernization theory has been enormously influential as a theory of cultural change and has also shaped our everyday thinking (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1088868311411587">Kashima et al., 2009</xref>). The current research examined an empirical foundation to this theory in the context of cross-temporal changes in individualism–collectivism in the United States and Japan. Diverging patterns of changes emerged across indices.</p>
<sec id="section19-1088868311411587">
<title>Modernization</title>
<p>Some findings from this research clearly support the modernization theory. In both countries, the average household has become smaller, urban population has increased, and divorce has become more prevalent. In addition to these changes in living and family environments, corresponding changes were observed in attitudes and values. In the United States, obedience is less important in child socialization today and a smaller proportion of young adults value social contribution. Similarly, in Japan, following tradition has become less important over time and independence in child socialization is valued more. To the extent that these changes occurred in a period characterized by steady economic growth, these findings are consistent with the modernization theory.</p>
<p>One pattern that is also consistent with the modernization theory is the rising importance of effort for success observed in both countries. One of the implications of modernization is labor specialization, which would require employees to have specialized training. Moreover, with the constant advances in technology, the competency of a modern workforce demands constant updating of skills and knowledgebase. In other words, the success of a modern workforce necessitates hard work and an achievement-oriented mind-set in employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1088868311411587">McClelland, 1961</xref>). In fact, rapid modernization of East Asian societies has been attributed to cultural systems that sanction hard work and effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1088868311411587">Dore, 1973</xref>). This rationale suggests that the increasing importance of effort for a successful life felt among young adults may reflect the continuing growth of the American and Japanese economies.</p>
<p>In sum, the modernization theory successfully affirms some of the cultural changes observed in the United States and Japan for the past several decades. At the same time, however, other changes observed in this research are inconsistent with the modernization theory. In fact, these findings highlight its limitations as a theory of cultural change. In the following sections, findings that did not fit the modernization theory are considered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1088868311411587">
<title>Changes in Family, Friendship, and Trust of Others</title>
<p>Findings on family life, friendship, and general social trust did not fit with the modernization theory. First, findings on the importance of family and friends diverged across indices. On one hand, demographic indices of family relations (i.e., household size and divorce rates) indicate a weakened family relationship in both countries. On the other hand, findings from survey items suggest continuing importance of family and friends. Specifically among Americans, the strength of relationships with relatives was unchanged, and the proportion of people feeling unconditional respect and love toward their parents actually increased over time. Similarly, among Japanese unconditional love toward parents has not changed over time. In both countries, the importance of friends was unchanged.</p>
<p>The continuing importance of family among Americans has been reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1088868311411587">Thornton &amp; Young-DeMarco, 2001</xref>). It has been argued that these patterns highlight changes in the meaning of family life: Although Americans continue to value family life, these relationships are much less obligatory (e.g., more aged people needing support live independently of their children today compared to previous decades) and more voluntary in nature today than in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1088868311411587">Thornton &amp; Young-DeMarco, 2001</xref>). Current findings suggest that a similar process might be occurring in Japan. Hence, one interpretation of these findings is that although modernization processes transformed the physical environment surrounding relationships with family and friends, Americans and Japanese continue to value family and friends, probably in a less obligatory and more voluntary fashion today compared to previous decades. However, these patterns await further research. The current data set had just two demographic indices, a few attitudinal items of family relations, and a single attitudinal item on friendship. Moreover, one Japanese survey item that pitted the importance of family against business engagement showed that more Japanese today would choose business over family, showing a conflicting pattern, although this item does not necessarily suggest the declining importance of family irrespective of the importance of business. Clearly, more research, for example through a creative analysis of archival data as discussed below, is warranted.</p>
<p>Unlike relationships with family and friends, trust of others showed a diverging pattern between the two countries: Although the level of trust declined among Americans (replicating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1088868311411587">Putnam, 2000</xref>) the same pattern did not emerge in Japan. The finding that the decline of trust observed in American society may not generalize to Japan was suggested in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1088868311411587">Inoguchi, 2000</xref>) but to my knowledge this is the first documentation of such a pattern.</p>
<p>Research on declining trust in American society has attributed the trend to such factors as increased pressure for time and money, more time spent in private, and a rise of electronic entertainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1088868311411587">Putnam, 2000</xref>). However, in Japanese society, where these changes seem to have occurred as well, trust has largely been stable. This consideration casts some doubt on the generality of Putnam’s theory of declining trust in cross-cultural examinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1088868311411587">Inoguchi, 2000</xref>). An alternative possibility for the diverging pattern is racial and cultural diversity in a society. Research suggests that racial and cultural diversity is one of the predictors of trust at the community level, presumably because it is more difficult to trust others who are racially and culturally dissimilar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1088868311411587">Alesina &amp; La Ferrara, 2002</xref>). This suggests that trust of others might have decreased in American society because of increased racial and cultural heterogeneity in American society, whereas trust has remained unchanged in Japan because of its continuing racial and cultural homogeneity. This rationale is consistent with the statistics on immigration: Although in the United States the proportion of foreign-born citizens increased in the past several decades, in Japan such a proportion has remained small and largely unchanged over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1088868311411587">World Bank, 2010</xref>). Hence, the rise of racial and cultural diversity in the United States and continuing racial and cultural homogeneity in Japan may account for the diverging pattern of trust.</p>

<title>Collectivism in Modern Japan</title>
<p>Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this research is the persistence of collectivism in Japan: In several indices, there were signs of persisting, even rising, collectivism. One commonality in these indices is that they assessed the importance of collectivistic living (increased importance in social obligation, social harmony, and social contribution and decreased importance in individual rights). In fact, these findings confirm prior cross-temporal analyses of Japanese society that reported continuing emphasis on group orientation, social harmony, and obligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088868311411587">Caudill, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1088868311411587">Flanagan, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1088868311411587">Trommsdorff, 1983</xref>). These findings are consistent with the cultural heritage theory and show that the importance of collectivistic living has continued in Japanese society even during a period of significant economic development.</p>
<p>Other research has also suggested the role of cultural heritage in continuing cultural tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1088868311411587">Inglehart &amp; Baker, 2000</xref>). However, the processes through which heritage sustains cultural tradition has not received much systematic attention. In the following sections, the mechanism of cultural continuity is considered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1088868311411587">
<title>Cultural Heritage and the Persistence of Cultural Tradition</title>
<p>One way in which cultural heritage sustains a pattern of culture is by shaping the effects of modernization. There are a number of examples of this process in prior research. One of the consequences of modernization is mass education, as modernized societies require a workforce that is trained for a socially and technologically complex environment. Across societies, there is commonality in the contents of education (i.e., skills taught in school), but research suggests that societies vary greatly in <italic>how</italic> these contents are taught. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1088868311411587">Tweed and Lehman (2002)</xref> argued that although the Western approach to learning is influenced by the Socratic method characterized by habits of questioning, expressing personal hypotheses, and esteeming self-directed learning, the East Asian approach to learning is influenced by the Confucian tradition characterized by habits of hard work, self-improvement, and pragmatic orientation to learning. Hence, even though greater accessibility of education is one of the consequences of modernization, societies’ educational philosophy is profoundly influenced by their cultural heritage, and schooling actually serves to reinforce cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Another example of a pattern of culture shaping the effect of modernization can be found in mass advertisement. Although the rise of mass advertisement is another consequence of modernization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1088868311411587">Inkeles, 1975</xref>), the ways in which advertisements are designed differ across cultures, as successful advertisements accommodate the tastes of local consumers. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1088868311411587">Kim and Markus (1999)</xref> found that advertisements in American and Korean magazines differ in that American ads tended to focus more on the theme of the pursuit of uniqueness, whereas Korean ads focused more on the theme of social harmony. To the extent that advertisements are sources of social influence, this example also suggests that mass advertisements may reinforce cultural heritage, in that exposure to advertisements portraying conformity may reinforce conformity among Koreans.</p>
<p>One difficult question regarding the idea of cultural heritage is its origin. That is, how is it that American society came to value uniqueness, whereas Korean society came to value conformity? More broadly, how is it that Western societies came to become individualistic and East Asian societies collectivistic?</p>
<p>Research has examined this question from a number of perspectives. Some theorists have sought the origin to intellectual and religious traditions, such as the tradition of Greek civilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1088868311411587">Nisbett, 2003</xref>) or the Protestant Reformation in the West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1088868311411587">Weber, 1904/1992</xref>) and the tradition of Buddhism and Confucianism in East Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088868311411587">Collcutt, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1088868311411587">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1088868311411587">Nisbett, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Others have focused on ecological factors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088868311411587">Barry, Child, and Bacon (1959)</xref> focused on the schedule of food accumulation. In this framework, an agriculture-based community represents one end of the continuum, a high-food-accumulation community. In such a community, food is harvested in large quantities infrequently, and the processes of food production are managed carefully to ensure the availability of enough food for the community. Adherence to social norms and conformity are encouraged, and risk taking is discouraged, as the potential benefit from innovation is outweighed by the danger of a food shortage in the case of failure. On the other hand, hunting represents a low level of food accumulation. Obtaining food is largely dependent on one’s skill. Moreover, as food is obtained more frequently, the benefit of innovation outweighs its cost: Successful innovation could bring an abundant accumulation of food, whereas a failure is not necessarily life threatening. These predictions have empirical support: Frequency of food accumulation was indeed found to predict societies’ orientation toward individualism–collectivism in worldwide studies of ethnographies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088868311411587">Barry et al., 1959</xref>) as well as in cross-cultural experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088868311411587">Berry, 1967</xref>).</p>
<p>Another possible socioecological cause of individualism–collectivism is the historical prevalence of disease-causing pathogens in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1088868311411587">Fincher et al., 2008</xref>). According to this theory, collectivism works as a defense mechanism against pathogens. For example, a reluctance to interact with members of an out-group can protect individuals from potential exposure to novel pathogens. Similarly, the norm of conformity, to the extent that it helps preserve rituals and customs that buffer against the risk of infectious disease, is an effective defense against pathogens. Supporting this idea, Fincher et al. found that the historical prevalence of pathogens was positively correlated with collectivism (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1088868311411587">Hamamura &amp; Park, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1088868311411587">Schaller &amp; Murray, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Another socioecological theory of individualism–collectivism has focused on the role of mobility. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1088868311411587">Kitayama, Ishii, et al. (2006)</xref> focused on the role of voluntary settlement. They theorized that voluntary migrants are a self-selected group of highly autonomous, independent, and goal-oriented individuals. Moreover, to the extent that settlements are occupied by these individuals, a highly individualistic ethos develops in these areas, which further reinforces individualistic mentality in a mutually reinforcing fashion. Supporting this hypothesis, in a series of experiments, Japanese living in the northern island of Hokkaido, which was the destination for many voluntary migrants in the late 19th century, exhibited psychological processes of individualism (e.g., internal attribution, dissonance reduction for personal choices, happiness predicted by socially disengaging emotions) more so than Japanese living outside Hokkaido. Recent research has also identified other forms of mobility (e.g., residential, employment, social relationships) in predicting individualistic psychological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088868311411587">Chen, Chiu, &amp; Chan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1088868311411587">Oishi, Lun, &amp; Sherman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1088868311411587">Schug, Yuki, &amp; Maddux, 2010</xref>). In sum, this line of research suggests historical and ecological factors that presumably gave rise to cross-cultural variations in individualism–collectivism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1088868311411587">
<title>Functional Autonomy: Subjective Representation in Continuing Culture</title>
<p>Another important question is the process by which the influence of distal factors continues into contemporary environments, where at times these original factors are no longer present. On this question, research introduced the idea of “functional autonomy,” a mechanism in which culture, once evoked, can have a life of its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1088868311411587">Cohen, 2001</xref>). The persistence of the culture of honor in contemporary the southern United States, which began with a herding economy that is no longer prevalent, provides one illuminating case of functional autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1088868311411587">Nisbett &amp; Cohen, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>When applied to the individualism–collectivism research, the theory of functional autonomy suggests that the individualism–collectivism differences of today may be legacies of historically evoked patterns of culture that have been carried forward by a subjective representation of that culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1088868311411587">Yamagishi, Hashimoto, &amp; Schug, 2008</xref>). That is, cross-cultural variations in individualism–collectivism today may reflect differences in individuals’ representation of culture that are maintained independently of the external environment that gave rise to such differences in the first place.</p>
<p>Research has located processes in which individuals’ representation of culture are maintained culturally in socialization practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1088868311411587">Ng, Pomerantz, &amp; Lam, 2007</xref>), communication (E. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1088868311411587">Kashima &amp; Kashima, 1998</xref>), media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1088868311411587">Kim &amp; Markus, 1999</xref>), and legal institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1088868311411587">Nisbett &amp; Cohen, 1996</xref>). Similarly, Nisbett and colleagues have maintained that the heritage of Greek civilization in the West and Buddhism and Confucianism in East Asia are maintained today by social norms, socialization, communication practices, aesthetic preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1088868311411587">Masuda, Gonzalez, Kwan, &amp; Nisbett, 2008</xref>), architecture and landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1088868311411587">Miyamoto, Nisbett, &amp; Masuda, 2006</xref>), and social and legal institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1088868311411587">Nisbett et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent research has started to examine directly the role of subjective representation in shaping psychological processes. In a series of studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1088868311411587">Zou et al. (2009)</xref> found that individualistic and collectivistic psychological processes are predicted by people’s representations of culture. In these studies, Hong Kong Chinese who believed Hong Kong was a collectivistic society were more collectivistic in their behaviors (e.g., showed more compliance and situational attribution) compared to others (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1088868311411587">Yamagishi et al., 2008</xref>, for similar findings among Japanese). In sum, people’s representation of their culture and their cultural environment reinforce each other in a mutually constitutive way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1088868311411587">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>): Exposure to social and cultural institutions shapes people’s representation of culture, which in turn shapes their cultural environment. This process of mutual reinforcement continues in a functionally autonomous fashion, independently of the external factor that gave rise to cultural differences in the first place.</p>
<p>To summarize, research has identified several distal factors of cross-cultural variations in individualism–collectivism. Influence of these factors can be carried across generations by subjective representation in a functionally autonomous fashion. When viewed under this framework, the persistence of collectivism in modern Japan is not surprising. Collectivism in Japan today is likely reflecting legacies of historical and ecological conditions that evoked collectivism in the first place, and such a legacy has been carried forward via Japanese’s representations of their culture. Thus, findings from the current research underscore the importance of research examining the role of societies’ cultural heritage and its persistence within the population.</p>

<sec id="section24-1088868311411587">
<title>Implications and Limitations</title>
<p>The current findings showed diverging patterns across different aspects of individualism–collectivism. Previous sections have illustrated the factors and processes behind the diversion.</p>
<p>However, one alternative explanation of this pattern is the process of cultural lag, or the idea that aspects of individualism–collectivism differ in the <italic>speed</italic> in which they are modernized. That is, this theory would suggest that even those aspects of Japanese culture that remain collectivistic today will eventually modernize and will shift toward greater individualism. Such an account is plausible, although there are at least two problems. First, it is unclear how much time is needed for modernization effects to take place: Without the specification of time, the theory of cultural lag is unfalsifiable. Second, even if cultural lag is taking place and the rise of individualism will be observed eventually in all aspects of individualism–collectivism, why some of these changes lag others needs to be explained. In turn, it seems inevitable that such an explanation incorporates the role of cultural heritage. Hence, even if the cultural lag theory were made falsifiable, and the changes it predicted were observed eventually, it seems that such a theory would still require the role of cultural heritage in accounting for patterns of cultural changes.</p>
<p>Methodologically, this research’s reliance on survey indices has implications. A large majority of the indices in this research were self-report items of beliefs and values. Research suggests not only that self-report items are compromised by methodological issues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1088868311411587">Heine et al., 2002</xref>) but also that the abstract beliefs and values assessed by these items are poorly correlated with behavioral measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1088868311411587">Kitayama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1088868311411587">Na et al., 2010</xref>). In the current research, the process of validation, in which these indices were validated against behavioral indices of individualism–collectivism, ensures that the findings extend beyond self-reported responses. Nevertheless, some ambiguous patterns in the findings may be attributable to the self-report method. For example, there were cases in which similarly worded items (e.g., items on the importance of independence in child socialization in the United States and different indices of trust showing diverging patterns among Americans) administered for comparable time period showed diverging patterns despite having the same validated relationship with individualism–collectivism. In both cases, it is unclear what factor accounts for the discrepancy. Research in cultural psychology has overcome the limitations of self-report data by employing a diversified methodological approach. Researchers gain confidence in their findings when a converging pattern emerges, for example, from a self-report measure, an experiment, and an analysis of cultural product. Similarly, alternative methodological approaches to cross-temporal analysis of culture seeking data outside self-report data should help overcome some of the ambiguities in the current findings. One promising approach is to analyze cultural product. Recent research in cultural psychology suggests that patterns of culture can be measured reliably and accurately in analyzing proverbs, news articles, magazine advertisements, children’s storybooks, song lyrics, and landscapes, among others (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1088868311411587">Morling &amp; Lamoreaux, 2008</xref>). These techniques could be applied to cross-temporal research.</p>
<p>Finally, one challenge to studies of cross-temporal changes is that the investigations are necessarily confined to preexisting data: Unlike with other topic areas, it would be impossible to administer a new measure to study psychological processes in the past. There are a few issues implicated by this limitation, one of which is the issue of validation. Although the indices in this research were validated against independent indices of individualism–collectivism, the validated relationships apply only to contemporary data. In other words, whether the validated relationships remain across time requires further examination. However, carrying out such an examination is a challenge, as there are no clear benchmarks of individualism–collectivism across different periods. An example of the divorce rate in Japan illustrates the nature of this challenge. In the beginning of the 20th century, divorce rates in Japan were among the highest in the world, much higher than today’s level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088868311411587">Fuess, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1088868311411587">Fuess (2004)</xref> maintained that prior to Japan’s encounter with modern Western cultures in the late 19th century, the idea of marriage as a sacred and eternal union was largely foreign in Japan. In subsequent years, however, with increased exposure to Western cultures, and with the government’s policy to stabilize marriage as one of the key institutions for modernization, the longevity of marriage has increased and the divorce rate has declined gradually, reaching its lowest level in the 1960s. This example suggests that if one were to compare individualism–collectivism of 1900 and 2000 in Japan, using the divorce rate would be problematic, as marriage and its relationship to individualism–collectivism were quite different between these two periods. More generally, this example highlights the difficulty of establishing indices’ validity across different periods.</p>
<p>To remedy this issue, in this research, cultural changes were analyzed in a data-driven, bottom-up manner. This approach was fruitful in identifying discrepant patterns across indices: Identification of these patterns would have been difficult if the data analysis had imposed a single dimension. Nevertheless, the limitation posed by the validity issue is best addressed by future research that examines the patterns identified here. For example, analyses of cultural products such as individualistic and collectivistic themes in magazine advertisements or song lyrics would be important not only in extending this research but also in providing a more comprehensive and richer picture of cultural change.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>One common belief inside and outside the field of cultural psychology has been that cultures are becoming more individualistic over time, especially in those parts of the world where the economy is growing. Findings from this research showed that the modernization theory is applicable to some, but not all, changes in individualism–collectivism over time. A comprehensive theory of cultural change requires consideration of modernization effects as well as the role of cultural heritage, considering questions such as how a pattern of culture emerges and how such a pattern continues over time, even in the face of a changing environment.</p>
