<title>Objective:</title>
<p>The evolution of views about causes and management models in psychiatry is of keen interest to those who respect the field’s history. The objective of this study was to identify international paradigm shifts since 1950 in psychiatric theorising and management models.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1039856213492354">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>Multiple methods were used, including citation analysis, qualitative judgments by highly cited researchers and obtaining the views of historians of psychiatry.</p>

<sec id="section3-1039856213492354">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The quantitative citation analysis was of low yield, seemingly reflecting limitations intrinsic to such an approach, but it did identify some ‘signals’ to broader domain shifts, such as the progressive loss of salience of psychoanalysis and a contrasting emphasis on a science-weighted model. Also, the highly cited researchers tend to nominate narrow exemplars. Nominations by the historians were more panoramic and, while capturing the domains identified by the two other strategies, went further in proposing a wide set of additional candidates for consideration.</p>

<sec id="section4-1039856213492354">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Of the three strategies employed, the qualitative approach (canvassing the views of historians and of highly cited authors) captured the paradigm changes, or at least theoretical or research trends, more accurately than the quantitative citation analysis. Changes in Australasian psychiatry would appear to generally mirror such international changes, rather than evidence a distinctive voice.</p>

<p>Over the centuries, psychiatry’s causal and treatment frameworks have ranged widely. We sought to identify paradigm shifts within psychiatry over the last 60 years, and then to consider their correspondence or not with Australasian regional changes. While the phrase ‘paradigm shift’ is often associated with Kuhn,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213492354">1</xref></sup> his seminal book dealt more with revolutionary change in science and requiring the new theory to be superior – and not just different to – the theory it replaced. We elected not to restrict ourselves to revolutionary changes, nor for any newer model to be necessarily superior to its predecessor, in seeking to identify distinctive paradigm changes or shifts. We examined whether shifts might be captured quantitatively, by analysing citations of journal articles in both psychology and psychiatry; and also undertook two qualitative approaches, allowing agreement between differing frames of reference to be examined.</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856213492354" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Our citation analysis sought to identify the most highly cited journal articles in psychiatry and psychology since 1950, and also examined citation patterns. Using the Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge (WoK) search engine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213492354">2</xref></sup> we identified the top 20 cited articles for each year between 1950 and 2010. The methodology was suggested by a WoK bibliometrician (personal correspondence).</p>
<p>The citation search identified every article written in each relevant year and indexed by WoK, by using every letter of the alphabet as truncated search terms (i.e. ‘a*, or b*, or c* … or z*’) in the ‘title’ field. Once the articles were retrieved, their selection was refined using WoK topic areas specific to psychology and psychiatry, and the articles were sorted by citation count to identify the top 20 cited articles/year. To ensure that we weighted the most highly cited publications, we excluded any article with less than 2000 citations.</p>
<p>We also used two qualitative approaches. The 100 currently (2012 listed) most highly cited researchers in the psychology/psychiatry domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213492354">3</xref></sup> were invited to nominate topics or areas that they viewed as distinctive ‘paradigm shifts’ over the last 60 years. Additionally, we invited three historians of psychiatry to nominate paradigm shifts over the same period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1039856213492354" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The citation analysis indicated that, while allocation of a paper to the discipline of psychiatry or psychology was not always clear cut, there was an overall weighting towards psychology (i.e. 52 or 64% of the 81 identified publications). Three journals were distinctly over-represented: the <italic>Archives of General Psychiatry</italic> (<italic>n</italic> =14 articles), <italic>Psychological Review</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 14) and <italic>Psychological Bulletin</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 12).</p>
<p>We analysed the identified articles chronologically and thematically, to examine them for varying patterns in content over time. We were able to assign all but 16 of the 81 articles to seven differing themes or domains: statistics, depression, anxiety and stress, schizophrenia, cognition, psychosocial factors and diagnostic tools. The number of articles from each domain was then graphed over time (by year) to examine for peaks in publications.</p>
<p>The statistics domain was the most stable of all seven categories, with highly cited papers consistently published over the review period. This category might best be positioned as a domain that provided tools to advance a higher-order paradigm shift toward more scientifically-weighted and research-based, as against theory-based, journal articles.</p>
<p>Depression papers evidenced two peaks: 1960 – 1967 and 1978 – 1988. The first peak followed the discovery and trials of the first antidepressant drugs, in the 1950s. Depression measures weighted the second peak, but were joined by theoretical papers on the cognitive aspects of depression and their links with personality style. Papers on stress and anxiety also evidenced two publication peaks, one from 1953 – 1959, perhaps reflecting awareness of the psychological impact of World War II, and a second peak commencing in the late 70s, perhaps representing the inclusion of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual III and the broader manifestations of anxiety disorders, and research into their genetic and environmental determinants.</p>
<p>The only other identifiable ‘condition’ was a progressive weighting toward schizophrenia, both aetiologically and in relation to new treatments.</p>
<p>Cognitive psychology was distinctive by its high prevalence, accounting for one-fifth of the identified articles, and enduring for two decades, from the early 70s. The psychosocial category, while less represented, was a relatively constant research domain from the 60s to the mid-90s.</p>
<p>The final category, diagnostic tools, almost certainly reflected the objective of advancing science-weighting to psychology and psychiatry (it showed a first peak between 1962 and 1981), preceding the introduction of DSM-III, which weighted criteria-based diagnoses and reliability. The second peak began in the early 90s and suggested a focus on obtaining reliable epidemiological data and clinical tools for assisting diagnosis and quantification of severity.</p>
<p>Thus, the citation analysis identified a weighting toward a progressive ‘science-based’ paradigm emerging across psychiatry and psychology, with highly-cited psychiatry publications focusing more on diagnosis, epidemiology and causality; while highly-cited psychology publications weighted measurement, statistical analyses and the cognitive domain.</p>
<p>Turning to the qualitative analyses: of the 100 most highly cited researchers in the domain of psychology/psychiatry, only 20 responded, offering multiple paradigm shifts (mean = 4) ranging across broad fields (neurosciences = 15, aetiology = 14, cognition = 10, medication = 8, therapy = 6, diagnostics = 6, eating disorders = 4, statistics = 3 and uncategorised = 8), but with few topics receiving more than several nominations. Two of the three psychiatry historians who were invited to nominate paradigm shifts did so (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1039856213492354">Table 1</xref>), while the third historian judged that psychiatry had not evidenced any substantive paradigm shift over the study interval.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our objective was to identify significant paradigm shifts in psychiatry/psychology over the last 60 years. The subjectivity of the phrases ‘paradigm shift’ and ‘paradigm change’ was addressed by our third historian, German Berrios. He observed that (private communication; April 30, 2012) since early in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, ‘madness’ was viewed as a disease resulting from triggers (external or internal) acting upon predisposed brains and that ‘at the deeper level, nothing has since changed – apart from the emphases and relative importance given to triggers and predispositions’. By contrast, our other two historians identified a decline in the perceived relevance of psychoanalysis and an increased weighting toward science.</p>
<p>Before focusing on psychiatry, we note that there was a candidate list of 12 ‘definitive moments’ generated for ‘Medicine’ by Le Fanu.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213492354">4</xref></sup> While the ‘discovery’ of chlorpromazine was the only psychiatric topic identified, in an appendix Le Fanu also overviewed the ‘pharmacological revolution in psychiatry’ – specifying the discovery of lithium, antidepressants and the benzodiazepines – along with the ‘slow death of psychoanalysis’.</p>
<p>While there are many limitations to citation theory, we note several salient to this study. Highly-cited papers published late in the analysed period might be more important than those published earlier, yet not have met the required number of citations, perhaps explaining why we failed to identify any eligible papers published after 1998.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213492354">5</xref></sup> A second phenomenon is ‘obliteration’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213492354">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213492354">6</xref></sup> when an article is so completely absorbed into the working knowledge of the field that people neglect to cite it. High citations can be achieved by multiple distorting factors, including self-promotion or studies needing to reference methodological tools, while low citation may reflect the totsweigtaktik<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213492354">7</xref></sup> phenomenon, where authors simply refuse to refer to or cite work that they view as inferior, mistaken or unacceptable. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213492354">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite such limitations, our analysis did identify some changes in emphases across the scientific literature. Firstly, a focus on the development of new measures and statistical tools, following the discovery and development of drugs to treat depression, anxiety and psychosis, and capturing a move to a biological weighting. A second emphasis was the development of criteria-based diagnostic categories, perhaps reflecting a move away from the non-specificity of psychoanalysis and allowing application studies into the epidemiology and cause of more ‘specific’ disorders. A third emphasis was an increased focus on models and theorising, such as cognitive psychology. The last presumably contributed to the articulation of a cognitive behaviour therapy treatment model that has straddled psychology and psychiatry. A fourth emphasis was a focus on studies considering the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences, particularly the aetiological determinants of depression.</p>
<p>Our first ‘qualitative’ analysis, considering nominations by highly cited researchers, threw up relatively narrow topic areas (and at times seemingly reflected the individual’s own research focus), but several macro-themes were identified. The growth in psychopharmacology and the emergence of criterion-based diagnostic systems were distinctive themes or shifts. In addition, the emphasis on neuroscience argues for its status as a ‘paradigm shift’. Other themes generating multiple nominations were the dimensional versus categorical models of psychopathology, recognition of pluralistic causality for disorders, as well as a move to early intervention. Nomination of such themes was not necessarily associated with the researcher’s personal support. For example, while some nominees of criteria-based diagnoses were in favour of them, others were highly critical (e.g. ‘DSM diagnoses do not exist’).</p>
<p>Our second qualitative analysis considered the nominations by two historians of psychiatry. As in the two previous data sets, we observed the selection of diagnostic models (especially the criteria-based DSM approach and of some new disorders), psychopharmacology, and the loss of relevance or ‘discrediting’ of psychoanalysis. In addition, topics or themes not evident in any of the previous data sets (e.g. deinstitutionalisation, removal of the ‘diagnosis’ of homosexuality from the DSM system, anti-psychiatry and the rise of the patient rights’ movement) were proposed. The first two seem particularly distinctive paradigm shifts. The rapid spread of deinstitutionalisation and the closure of psychiatric institutions across much of the western world had a very broad impact, both immediate and subsequently. Such impact was both positive (i.e. leading to new and innovative models of community-based care) and negative (e.g. the ‘abandonment’ of many to become so-called ‘rootless wanderers’ in the community, and the ‘warehousing’ of many of those previously in psychiatric hospitals to either nursing homes or other mini-institutions). The removal of ‘homosexuality’ as a diagnostic pathological condition in the DSM system is also a major paradigm shift, reflecting changes not just in psychiatry, but across society in general.</p>
<p>The rise in patient rights’ movements and in ‘consumerism’ charted a move in psychiatry to a more parity-based practice or partnership. In psychiatry, this move may have been advanced quite visibly by the ‘revolutionary phase’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213492354">1</xref></sup> of the anti-psychiatry movement, which seized on certain excesses of psychiatric practice and some of its modalities (e.g. psychosurgery, electroconvulsive therapy, deep sleep therapy). The anti-psychiatry movement is perhaps better positioned as a ‘paradigm changer’, rather than as a ‘paradigm change’, as it caused many in the field to consider the validity of their practices.</p>
<p>If the last several examples are accepted as distinct paradigm shifts, it is interesting then to reflect that all such changes were socially weighted, all involved a political process and the majority were initiated from outside of the profession; however, none of these were detected by our citation analysis. The historian Porter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213492354">8</xref></sup> observes that the historical record is ‘like the night sky: we see a few stars and group them into mythical constellations. But what is chiefly visible is the darkness’. While historians recognise limits to their task, it appears that historical dissection is the most appropriate strategy for identifying paradigm changes in psychiatry (the lists of highly cited papers and domains nominated by historians and highly cited researchers may be obtained by contacting the first author).</p>
<p>Finally, we considered whether such identified changes in the international literature were mirrored in Australasia, clearly an issue that can only be addressed speculatively. We suggest that most pattern changes in the international literature and in the practice of psychiatry were mirrored in this region, and that the differences were more ones of degree. For example, while psychoanalysis would seemingly have been progressively viewed as less salient in the region, it never had the prominence accorded to it in the US. Another example might be post-traumatic stress not having received as much parochial attention as we observed in the international literature. A third can be suggested, that of of less interest in the region in debating categorical versus dimensional diagnostic and classificatory models, and certainly less critiquing of recent DSM systems, than we observed internationally. Apart from such relatively slight differences of emphasis, Australasian psychiatry and psychology would appear to have moved broadly in step with international paradigm shifts.</p>
