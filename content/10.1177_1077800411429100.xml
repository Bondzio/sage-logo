<abstract>
<p>How do we make sense out of the lives of our fathers? Do we rely on a well-worn family narrative that omits complications or unresolved tensions or deeper mysteries, or do we question what we claim to know and dig deeper for details? If we choose to reenter the past with new questions, what might we find there? What artifacts, stories, secrets, and memories do we bring into the revised narrative? And what might be the longer term effects of revising that narrative on how we understand our own lives as well as the lives and understandings of those family members who come after us? This narrative essay explores those issues in relation to the life of my father, Harold Lloyd Goodall, Sr.</p>

<title>The Past in the Present: The Narrative Museum of Other People’s Memories</title>
<p>When I enter the narrative I have created for my father I enter a word and image museum. Once inside I pause to consider where best to spend my time, because despite the fact that this narrative museum has few physical artifacts, it offers a large space for wonder and imagining. It is a place for connecting stories and fragments of stories with real people and events to make whole, or nearly whole, a coherent account of the complex and contradictory man who was Harold Lloyd Goodall. As usual, I begin with the oldest artifacts in the museum and find particular significance in three fragments of stories that reveal a consistent pattern of secrecy.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>It was August 1, 1944. We were flying a mission out of the south of England to bomb a German airfield installation near Tours, France. On the first pass, we missed it. You’d think we could hit an airfield. The Captain turned us around to make another run</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>That’s when we got hit. I was the tail gunner and fortunately escaped injury. But Staff Sergeant Goodall was the radio operator and took shrapnel in his legs and back. The only thing that saved him was the console. Protected his upper body</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>When I reached him he was in great pain. I used my morphine to calm him down and did what I could for his wounds</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>About half the plane was gone. Blown all to hell by the antiaircraft guns. But somehow the Captain got us safely back to base on two engines, which was a miracle in and of itself. They decommissioned the plane after that, as it wouldn’t have made sense to try to repair it. That was rare in those “use everything again” war days, but the damage was too extensive</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Duke survived and did several weeks—or maybe it was longer—in the hospital. But his war was over. They shipped him home shortly after that</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Who was Duke? Sandra asked. The fellow she was interviewing, Ansil Miller, was pretty old so maybe he had switched channels and was talking about someone else.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Lloyd Goodall. Everyone called him Duke. Ansil sounded a little miffed. Everyone called him Duke, he repeated</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sandra reported her interview with Ansil to me. I was puzzled. Duke? My father had a nickname? I asked if she asked Mr. Miller why my father was called Duke.</p>
<p>She smiled. She read verbatim from her notes: <italic>Oh, that’s easy. Because he carried himself royally</italic>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Yes, I could see that. How he carried himself. He stood tall, shoulders squared, face tilted upward and slightly forward. Always impeccably dressed. Always calm, cool, and collected. Preferred gin to vodka; had meticulously manicured fingernails and never left the house without a stiletto. But I never knew he had a nickname.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>He mentioned, once, and then only in a kind of melancholy way, that he had played the trumpet in the 1939 World’s Fair. He added, almost as an after thought, that on that day he played in front of the King and Queen of England</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>I never believed this fanciful story. How could I? When he told it to me, way out there when we lived in the wilds of old Wyoming, he was mostly gone away to that place he went to in the company of gin and memories. The distance between where we were living then, at 2817 Henderson Drive, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and him playing for British royalty in New York City, was more than could adequately be measured on any map I was then aware of</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>I should have believed him. I learned from Warren Bills, his high school pal, that their high school band won the 1939 State Championship and their reward was a trip to the Big Apple, where, yes indeed, they played before the King and Queen of England</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Mr. Bills ended up a professional musician. Bills went far in the music world, producing Perry Como and Patti Page in addition to serving as the musical director for the Lawrence Welk Show</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Moreover, Lloyd Goodall, aka Duke, is remembered by his surviving friends for a soulful jazz trumpet performance he gave one perfect Easter Sunday in 1941. He stood alone and proud on a giant sundial overlooking the river just behind the Kelly-Hatfield Mansion and blew the horn for the assembled guests. “I can still see him plain as day in my mind,” Bill Hastings recalled. “He was beautiful.”</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I never heard my Dad play the trumpet. One of the casualties of what he called “the loud bloody nightmarish hell” of war was his eardrum and with it, his pitch.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Bill Hastings had known my father all of his life. They had grown up a block from each other, played together, went to school with each other, and enlisted in the Navy</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077800411429100">1</xref></sup> <italic>on the same day. But never during their shared history did Bill Hastings remember my father disclosing much that was personal about himself</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>What he does recall is perhaps more revealing about my father’s life . . . Hastings remembers vividly a clear, cold January day in early 1955, downtown in Huntington at the bus depot, on his routine way to work, whereupon he suddenly came upon my father. My father was leaning against the depot wall, casually smoking a cigarette, wearing a well-tailored blue suit and crisp white shirt and dark tie</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Bill shouted “Lloyd!”</italic></p>
<p><italic>My father turned and looked at him. His expression gave away nothing</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>“Lloyd? Lloyd Goodall! It’s me, Bill Hastings!”</italic></p>
<p><italic>My father just stared at him for what Hastings remembers as a “long time,” then abruptly turned, tossed the butt of his cigarette into the gutter, and walked away</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When Bill Hastings told us this story I didn’t know what to say. The summer of 1955 was the turning point in my father’s clandestine career. He went from working under cover as a veterans affairs officer in Martinsburg, West Virginia to vice consul of the United States in Rome, Italy.</p>
<p>Why he didn’t want to be recognized by Bill Hastings is a mystery to me, but it fits into a larger pattern of erasure evident in my father’s records. He seemed intent on removing any trace of his past life in America from his new life, his secret life that he was entering overseas.</p>

<title>The Present Through the Past: The Narrative Museum of My Own Memories</title>
<p>When I enter the narrative I have created for my father I enter a word and image museum, but it is also a museum of echoes that replay his voice and our conversations, that replay my mother’s voice and her conversations with me about him, and when I reenter those conversations they always take me to the exact same place, a place of premature silence:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>My father died, either in Virginia or Maryland, at the age of 53 on the night of March 12, 1976. My mother told me that he died at home in his bed in Hagerstown, Maryland, but the Social Security Death Index indicates that he was pronounced dead in Virginia, although it doesn’t say where in Virginia</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>I had doubts, even then, that he died at home</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>The reason for his death was a mystery</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>My mother said that she requested an autopsy because three days before he died he had been told that he was run down due to a bad cold and just needed some bed rest. He was given “a shot of something” and sent home. A doctor he saw at the Veteran’s Administration Hospital supposedly gave him this diagnosis and the shot, but my mother couldn’t recall the name of the doctor and the hospital records do not show that he had any appointments in March</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Nor did I ever see a report of an autopsy. One year later, close to the anniversary of his death, my mother told me that she had been informed—by “the government”—that he had died of “multiple bleeding abscesses on both lungs.” This was about the time of a news report that Legionnaire’s Disease was responsible for the deaths of several men, all veterans, in Philadelphia, all of whom had also died of multiple bleeding abscesses on their lungs. My mother claimed that “the government” now believed that my father, too, had died of Legionnaire’s Disease</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>That may or may not be true</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>My mother never showed me the letter “from the government” that supposedly provided her with this information. She told me she had “thrown it away.” I have no doubt that she had done precisely that, if, in fact, there had ever been a letter in the first place. But by then, by March of 1977, I was so disillusioned with the idea of truth in relation to my father’s life, much less his death, that I didn’t pursue it</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>He had led a secret life. And even in death, she kept his secrets</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When I say, as I did above, that this is a narrative of <italic>my</italic> creation, I mean exactly that. It is a narrative constructed out of fragments, stories, images, my memories, and other people’s memories about <italic>my</italic> father that I have assembled into a more or less coherent whole. That it has a “coherent whole” does not mean it provides a full account:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>My disillusionment with the truth about my father began the day after his funeral. Gilbert Hovermale, our attorney, gave me a key to a safety deposit box and said “your father wanted you to have this.”</italic></p>
<p><italic>My mother and I were in Hovermale’s small cramped office for the reading of my father’s</italic> Last Will and Testament. <italic>My mother was in bad shape, barely functioning in the daylight over the heavy sedation required to get her to sleep, and I worried that she might commit suicide. She had told me, repeatedly, that she “just wanted to die.”</italic></p>
<p><italic>I took the key, put it in my pocket, and didn’t think any more about it. In fact, I didn’t visit our bank to open the deposit box until two or three days later, and I only went there then because it was on my way to the pharmacy</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>I don’t know what I expected to find. Papers, perhaps. Another insurance policy, maybe. I can’t recall</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Instead I found two items. There was a diary and a dog-eared, heavily marked up copy of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel</italic>, The Great Gatsby. <italic>These two items were what my father wanted me to have? Why?</italic></p>
<p><italic>I opened the diary and recognized his signature in the top right hand corner of the first page. My father’s signed name, like his life, was a carefully constructed series of perfectly composed, by-the-rules actions, angled slightly to the right. To the casual observer his handwriting was entirely ordinary and his penmanship, like his life, easily readable. If it was true that a man’s signature reveals something about his character, then the character revealed here was that of a man who cared what people thought about his handwriting, and upon further reflection, about his life</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>If I thought anything was odd about his handwriting, it was only the raw fact of it being used to keep a diary. I didn’t know he kept one. As far as I knew, my father never had been a diarist. So the fact that he kept a diary, coupled with a clearly well worn copy of Gatsby, and that these two items were the sum total of my personal inheritance from him—that was what I thought was unusual</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>“Your father wanted you to have this,” Hovermale had said when he handed me the key. I had asked him if he knew what was in the box. “No,” he had replied. That was all he said</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>I turned the page and began reading. What my father had given me was a story about his life. Not all of it—it was, after all, a diary and not an autobiography—but enough of it to present me with what I would later learn to call “a relational identity crisis.” He had passed along a story of a man whom I had called “Dad” for the past twenty-three years but who was not really my father. My father had been an ordinary government worker who had retired on full disability from the Veteran’s Administration. The story I read was about an extraordinary man with my father’s name who worked for a clandestine organization, a man who ran illegal operations during the Cold War, a “case officer” who communicated using codebooks</italic>.</p>
<p>The Great Gatsby <italic>and a</italic> Holy Bible <italic>were named as his “codebooks.” The former for London, the latter, appropriately, I thought, for Rome. I held his copy of Gatsby in my hands</italic>. The Bible <italic>was more of a mystery. I supposed there might once have been one among his possessions, although the days of my father being a religious man seemed distant</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>There were also names laced throughout the diary. J. Bert Shroeder. Frank Wisner. Allen Dulles. James Angleton. William Colby. Clare Boothe Luce. Abbe Lane. Bill Harvey. Kim Philby. Angleton, again. Philby, again. Richard Nixon. Frank Rizzo. Angleton, yet again</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>There were lists of dates and places, as well as a name given in all capital letters that dominated the last few pages, something or someone called CHAOS. It sounded too much like an acronym to be anything but an acronym. BROOKLANE, too, but I thought I knew what those letters referred to and it wasn’t an acronym at all. It was a psychiatric center located in rural Pennsylvania. I had “visited” my father on that “farm” several times</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>The last entry was difficult to make out. Maybe his usually fine handwriting had deteriorated with his illness or perhaps he was just less sure of himself toward the end. I could only make out the words: “Church committee.”</italic></p>
<p><italic>His diary didn’t come with a note to me or with any instructions. What was I suppose to think, or to do, with it? What did he intend for me to do with this new information?</italic></p>
<p><italic>I had no idea</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>So it <italic>was</italic> that my memories of my father, the kind and generous, seemingly ordinary man whom I had known, became intertwined with words in his diary and with passages from <italic>The Great Gatsby</italic>.</p>
<p>The childhood father who was absent a lot due to his work “for the government” in real life had a new source of explanation in spy fiction. The thoughtful father who returned from those places, places he seldom mentioned by name, with a toy or a surprise for me, became blurred with scenes from spy novels and films, wherein the hero grabs some token for the child on his way out of a bad place, escaping from the bad guys.</p>
<p>After I discovered his secret life, I rarely spoke of it. I was 23 years old and I knew I wasn’t emotionally equipped for it. I wasn’t narratively equipped for it, either. The well-known storylines <italic>of</italic> the life I thought I knew were disrupted by a truth that ran parallel to it until that truth collided with it. Because I could not resolve the two stories I opted for the one I knew best. So when people asked about my parents, I found myself repeating the same half-truths that my parents told to me when I was growing up: My father worked “for the government.” My Mom was a nurse. We moved every couple of years. And so on.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, and without any conscious effort to reveal my secrets, there are clues to my ongoing internal narrative struggle in my published work for the next two decades. Throughout the 1980s I wrote about organizations, power relationships, analogic codes and bureaucratic betrayals, and the “plural present” of cultural identities where by day we live a role we are paid to perform and by night we reassume another one. In 1991 I dropped a bombshell chapter called “The Truth of My Experience” into <italic>Living in the Rock n Roll Mystery</italic>, wherein I revealed the parts of the spy story I knew (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800411429100">Goodall, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>But it wasn’t until after 9/11 and our family conversations darkened with the ominous weight of a run-up to war and of a war culture of fear being manufactured daily by the Bush administration, that I decided to reenter the museum of Fatherland. In those early days while all of us were dealing with the aftershock of the attack and steadying ourselves for the likelihood of another one or something worse, coming to terms with the truth seemed more urgent.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t the only reason. My reentry came at the request of our son, Nic, who asked questions I couldn’t answer about my parents, or at least I could not answer truthfully. From my father I inherited an incomplete narrative and I wanted to pass on to my son something better than that. I did not want to do to our son what my father’s secrets had done to me. So it was that we began—all three of us—to investigate in earnest what previously I had only inherited in memories, fragments, and a few artifacts.</p>
<p>For the next 4 years my wife and I did copious research under the Freedom of Information Act, visited archives, interviewed retired spooks of the same generation, and toured cold war sites in Europe. We acquired his “Dummy File,” or “cover file” that gave us an official version of the truth in the form of analogs to the real truth that lay beneath it. We speculated with everyone we met about how best to connect these illusive dots, how to find patterns within patterns that were themselves doubled in deceit. I talked out the emerging narrative with my wife and son, relatives, friends, and colleagues.</p>
<p>Finally, I wrote the narrative I now inhabit. I added it to my Fatherland Museum. In addition to including and correcting the Dummy File I had grown up believing, I was aware of an overarching task: to give the story of my father and me a better ending. Better than how my father and I had ended:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Due to the sudden and unexpected nature of my father’s death there were now unresolved tensions that weighed heavily on me, on my soul. I had moved away from home, away from him, and away from what he thought was right, in ways that he could not have failed to read as signs of a definitive rejection</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>The last time we had spoken, I had said as much. He had dutifully walked me to my car after another one of our unhappy Christmas holidays and we had shaken hands, as if that settled something that it didn’t really settle, just to keep up the public appearance of family peace. I remember that he held my eyes as if he wanted to tell me something else, but in the end he couldn’t manage it. Instead, his eyes teared up, and then, because it was embarrassing to both of us, he said simply, quickly, and now I realize finally, “I love you, goodbye.”</italic></p>
<p><italic>I don’t remember what I said. I wish I did</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Fathers and sons. What is it between us? That is an ancient question and it may never be resolved</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Since completing and publishing the book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800411429100">Goodall, 2006</xref>), when I reenter the museum of my own memories, I no longer try to resolve them. I have learned that is impossible and maybe not even desirable. It is a museum with no clear paths or well-lit passages to mark the way. It is a place for lingering and remembering, sometimes imagining.</p>
<p>But never resolving. Because there is no one final truth to reach about him.</p>
<p>He was a complex man who lived two lives, one of which was a bit beyond a son’s understanding. Perhaps that is truth enough for me. Instead of illuminating the saintly whole of his life like bright sunlight through a stained glass church window, my journey through this darkened underground labyrinth is filled with twists and turns, double-backs, trapdoors, and dead ends. The only way to get through it—which is to say to learn how to live with its ambiguities—is to appreciate the man I knew for who he was, to honor the man I didn’t know for what I believe he tried to do, and to be content with it.</p>
<p>Once inside I linger lovingly but without a singular purpose. I remain within the webs of significance I myself have spun and revisit passages and passageways that are now known to me, but despite my ability to write about them, remain just as mysterious.</p>
<p>It is <italic>my</italic> narrative museum, after all. Which is to say, following Alastair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800411429100">MacIntyre (1981)</xref> in <italic>After Virtue</italic>, this narrative is where I come from. It is who I am. It tells me what stories I am a part of.</p>
<p>It also tells me what mysteries I am part of. I am thankful for that.</p>
<p>I close the book. I no longer need it. This narrative museum is part of me.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077800411429100">
<title>The Future Made Out of the Past: The Narrative Museum I Can Only Imagine</title>
<p>When I enter the future narrative I imagine for the Fatherland Museum, I enter a word and image afterlife. I <italic>know</italic> this afterlife. I know this afterlife because the afterlife of sentences is always one of distant echoes and familiar ghosts still searching for narrative resolution. It is the not-so-final haunting place for the stories that drew us in and kept our attention but that leave us unsatisfied. This is because narratives have trajectories that begin in a desire to resolve conflict, and they end only when that original desire has been satisfied (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800411429100">Halverson, Goodall, &amp; Corman, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet conflicts of identity are seldom satisfied. That is why there are narrative museums. That is why there are artifacts, photographs, voices, and stories that get left behind for someone else to muse over, think about, disagree with, and rework. Our children and grandchildren inherent those artifacts as keys to these museums, but each one of them must choose whether or not to use it on the locked entrance door, there beneath the imagined sign that partially states the risk: “Beware, all who enter here!”</p>
<p>When I approached that warning I had no real idea what was at risk. I only knew I had a “need to know.” But the Fatherland Museum taught me that true understanding comes with a high price that forever alters our relationship to the man we thought we knew. To the life we thought we understood. To ourselves. For within the stories that compose the narrative held in that museum I learn, in addition to all that I can never know, that I was no hero. Maybe I could have been a better son if I had maybe paid more attention to details, maybe spent more time reading the available clues, asked better questions, and not settled for an easy exit from their lives into my own. And now, of course, there is nothing I can do about it. Except to set the record as straight as I can and to place a bright red light above that ancient warning.</p>
<p>Had I known then what I know now, would I have behaved any differently?</p>
<p>I don’t know. I like to think I would. What I know instead is that I didn’t heed the warning when I entered the past and opened up the old Fatherland Museum, so now I am unable to distance myself from my own narrative about it. It has become a part of who I am. I added to the Fatherland Museum what I found out and I have enlarged that warning sign.</p>
<p>It won’t matter. Future children and grandchildren will always return to what is not known about their distant relatives and reopen those narrative museums regardless of any warning. Questions about who we were, how we lived, our relationships, and so on will be revisited by offspring far removed from the original archaeological sites. They will dust off the old artifacts, reexamine the faded photographs, listen to the recorded voices that now already sound alien and old in order to offer their own accounts about who and what we were. They will do so as I have done, laboring under the narrative promise of offering a “new light” on old lives.</p>
<p>So it is that I know in my heart that somewhere in the future our son, Nicolas—named for the narrator of <italic>The Great Gatsby</italic>—will enter our family’s museum, read my narrative about my father and mother, and ask his own questions about it. I wrote the book for him, but he has told me that he isn’t ready to read it. “I know what it took out of you to write it,” he says. Right now he prefers to remain outside of that storyline in order to make his own.</p>
<p>I can’t blame him. For almost 30 years I did exactly the same thing. After finding my father’s diary and <italic>The Great Gatsby</italic> I put them aside, tried to live my own life without directly making use of my “narrative inheritance.”</p>
<p>I should have known better. After all, in my narrative museum some of the most important clues to my father’s identity are sentences found in Gatsby. That fine novel ends with this one: “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”</p>
<p>There will come a time when the truth of that line beckons to Nic. What he will make of it I cannot know, nor am I supposed to know.</p>
<p>Like my father before me, I leave behind clues to this mystery. To my father’s identity and life as well as to my own. I bequeath these stories to my son. Those clues are on display in the museum.</p>
<p>And the museum of the future has all the time in the world.</p>
