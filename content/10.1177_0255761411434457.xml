<abstract>
<p>In an exploratory study lasting more than 16 weeks, 15 undergraduate and graduate piano students prepared a short piece by the Brazilian composer Guarnieri, <italic>Ponteio</italic> no. 22, without guidance from their piano teachers. The data that were collected included their performances, interviews pertaining to their practice and stimulated recall interviews. These data were analyzed in terms of the ways of knowing and types of knowledge that are articulated in Davidson and Scripp’s (1992) matrix of cognition skills in music. The data were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. The production of representation (outside the actual performance) showed a structural relationship with the local and global information about the piece. In terms of perception, cognitive skills were essentially dependent on expertise levels. Concerning the ways of knowing as reflection, a number of students were able to identify problems outside of their own performance. However, the solutions to these problems were less often planned. In summary, graduate students tended to rely on procedural knowledge, while the undergraduates generally used declarative knowledge. The results suggest that graduate students are more likely to make tacit decisions rather than verbal decisions.</p>

Thus the singular aspects of personal knowledge in relation to the specific demands of musical practice become target subjects for investigation.</p>
<p>Musical knowledge as it relates to performance and music education has been debated (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411434457">Davies, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0255761411434457">Osa, 2007</xref>). Within the area of musical knowledge, structural knowledge has been studied. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0255761411434457">Williamon and Valentine (2002)</xref> have shown that formally trained piano students tend to start and stop practicing at structural boundaries. However, the subjects’ definitions of ‘structure’ varied and did not necessarily conform to formal analysis. Some authors argue that such individual variation could be considered a type of intuitive interpretative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0255761411434457">Rink, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0255761411434457">Holmes, 2005</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0255761411434457">Holmes (2005)</xref>, a subject’s intuitive imagination demonstrates the links between interpretative goals and the development of playing techniques. Despite describing a particular perspective, the argument for intuitive knowledge does not delineate the relationship between different levels and perspectives of musical thinking (and/or ways of knowledge) demonstrated by music students.</p>
<p>In higher education, undergraduate students must prepare new repertoires while responding to technical constraints and stylistic aspects within a given deadline. This process involves beliefs, choices, assumptions, and hypotheses that highlight various forms of thinking. This process also shows the strengths and weaknesses in ways of knowledge based on expertise levels, and it forces one to confront the specificities of daily musical practice in relation to the demands of the Western classical tradition. To prepare for the repertoire, students access previously systematic musical experiences that incorporate different ways of thinking and knowing that are geared toward improving personal production.</p>
<p>To discuss ways of thinking and knowing, it is necessary to broaden our understanding of knowledge and include cognition studies. According to previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0255761411434457">Williams, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411434457">Gunther, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411434457">Davies, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0255761411434457">Niedderer, 2007</xref>), there are different types of knowledge. Propositional knowledge is usually expressed through either verifiable or falsifiable statements that allow us to believe something is one way or another. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0255761411434457">Williams (2001)</xref> identifies the characteristics of propositional knowledge as ‘knowing-that’ and ‘knowing-why’. Knowing-that is associated with the description of and discrimination between concepts or objects. According to some authors, knowing-that is declarative knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0255761411434457">Ryle, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0255761411434457">Swanwick, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411434457">Gruhn &amp; Rauscher, 2006</xref>). Knowing-why is associated with understanding. In contrast, procedural knowledge refers to knowing how to do something based on ability or skill. Procedural knowledge denotes the dynamic (and successful) utilization of procedures within relevant representational forms. Procedural knowledge usually requires knowledge of the objects being used and knowledge of the format and syntax of the representational system(s) expressing these objects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0255761411434457">Sternberg (1999)</xref> associates procedural knowledge with tacit knowledge because its essence is difficult to articulate. However, some procedural knowledge can be made explicit because it is possible to have explicit instructions on how to do something.</p>
<p>In the context of music education literature, three models of musical knowledge have been proposed, including models by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411434457">Davidson and Scripp (1992)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0255761411434457">Swanwick (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761411434457">Elliott (1995)</xref>. Swanwick’s framework has formed the basis for discussing knowledge in music performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0255761411434457">Osa, 2005</xref>). Elliott’s model of musical knowledge has recently been applied to the interpretation of repertoire preparation by undergraduate piano students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0255761411434457">Santos &amp; Hentschke, 2010</xref>). Because Davidson and Scripp’s musical knowledge proposition has not been employed in either the analysis of practice or the performance of musical students, we propose to explore their framework.</p>

<sec id="section2-0255761411434457">
<title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411434457">Davidson and Scripp (1992)</xref> proposed a model for cognitive music processing to gain a comprehensive and integrative understanding of how musicians think. The model is described in the matrix of cognitive skills in music, which outlines six <italic>ways of knowing</italic> that can be traced in musical production, perception and reflection. These processes may take place outside of or during a musical performance, and they involve two different types of knowledge. One type of knowledge is fixed or ‘declarative’ knowledge, and the other is more dynamic or procedural (knowing how); each implies a distinct set of cognitive skills. For example, production encompasses composing and interpretative performance (including sight-reading and improvisation); perception includes aspects of thinking that support discrimination and judgment; and reflection emphasizes the importance of re-envisioning, re-conceptualizing, and reviewing a performance. These three ways of knowing intersect with the two conditions of knowledge: (1) the representation as production, perception and reflection situated outside the scope of a performance; and (2) the production, perception and reflection during a performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411434457">Davidson &amp; Scripp, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0255761411434457">Kopiez, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0255761411434457">Lehmann &amp; Davidson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0255761411434457">Lehmann and Davidson (2006)</xref>, Davidson and Scripp’s model presents ‘evidence for the development of some of these representations of knowledge and posits that the different parts of their matrix are sometimes formed in the individual musician independently from one another’ (p. 234). We corroborate with Lehmann and Davidson’s view that music educators may be aware of the potential to promote particular skills and the interaction and interconnectedness of those skills.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0255761411434457">Lehmann and Davidson (2006)</xref> state, each aspect of Davidson and Scripp’s model would be amenable to empirical testing and validation. Despite its publication date, this model presents several aspects that have been recently revived. For instance, the relationship between memory and perceptual modalities (auditory, visual and kinaesthetic) has been empirically investigated (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0255761411434457">Palmer &amp; Meyer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0255761411434457">Finney &amp; Palmer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411434457">Highben &amp; Palmer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0255761411434457">Wöllner &amp; Williamon, 2007</xref>; Jabusch, Alpers, Kopiez, Vauth, &amp; Altenmüller, 2008). Furthermore, from the perspective of neuroscience, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761411434457">Griffiths (2009)</xref> argues that music representation is modular; that is, it involves: (1) simple processing (neural encoding of simple temporal, spectral and spatial information); (2) complex processing (stabilized representation of temporal, spectral and spatial patterns); and (3) semantic processing (symbolic use of auditory ‘tokens’ derived from complex sound processing). Thus the ways of knowing and representations of knowledge in Davidson and Scripp’s model can potentially be useful in organizing and interpreting practices and productions in music performance.</p>
<p>Because repertoire preparation involves a complex set of activities and skills, to what degree is a student’s level of expertise dependent on the various ways of knowing and types of knowledge? The aim of the present exploratory research is to investigate the correlations between ways of knowing (production, perception and reflection) and types of knowledge (declarative and procedural) used in the preparation of a musical work. Graduate and undergraduate students with different expertise levels were asked to prepare a short piano piece without the benefit of guidance from their piano teachers.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The 15 participants included college and postgraduate students at a Brazilian university. The data were collected at the Music Performance Laboratory at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS, Porto Alegre, Brazil). In this paper, U represents an undergraduate (college-level) student, and G represents a graduate student studying for either their master’s or doctorate. The number following the letter was randomly assigned to distinguish each student.</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>In this quasi-experimental study, music students studied <italic>Ponteio</italic> no. 22 by the Brazilian composer Guarnieri (1907–93) for 16 weeks without receiving guidance from their piano teachers. The chosen piece carries clear indications of tempo (quaver, 72), articulation, dynamics and character (‘triste’ [sad]). The students’ preparation for the musical piece was monitored in four sessions. In the first two sessions, the students’ performance was recorded on video and audiotape, and the students were interviewed about their practice of the piece (e.g., number of hours, employed strategies, technical or interpretative problems and hypothesized or employed solutions). The observation of the students’ performance aimed to reveal clues about the non-verbal tacit knowledge used by students and demonstrated in their performances. It is often observed that, in terms of their performance, subjects are capable of doing something but incapable of explaining how it was done. The performance of this <italic>Ponteio</italic> was again recorded during the third interview. Finally, the last session consisted of stimulated recall interviews in which students reflected on their recorded performances during the previous sessions. In this session, students chose the rendition that they considered the best.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Sampling involved a total of 34 hours of audio- and video recording The interviews were transcribed, and the transcripts were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0255761411434457">Smith &amp; Osborn, 2003</xref>). The analysis identified individual meaning units or parts of the text representing a particular idea that fits the ways of knowing represented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411434457">Davidson and Scripp’s (1992)</xref> matrix of cognition skills in music.

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0255761411434457">Table 1</xref> illustrates examples of students’ statements concerning their practice or performance as interpreted through the <italic>ways of kn</italic>o<italic>wing</italic> from the matrix of cognition skills in music. According to students’ interview statements, different sets of cognitive skills could be observed. Thus the representation as production (outside the scope of the performance) has shown a structural relationship with the individual and collective information about the piece. These comments have shown different types of approaches: (1) relationships between events, such as functional harmony and phrasing structure; (2) explicit structural organization of bars, meter, and instrumental realization; (3) relationships between structures and interpretative decisions (e.g., dynamic and phrase contour); and (4) clues supporting the unraveling of the score. The observation of their performances revealed a broad range of levels of expertise regarding the production during performance (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0255761411434457">Table 1</xref>, production in performance). Although the composer indicated 72 bpm for the quaver, students used a broad range of tempos (63 to 83). The character, which was explicitly indicated as sad (<italic>triste</italic>), did not seem to concern the students during preparation.</p>

<p>In terms of the representation as perception (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0255761411434457">Table 1</xref>), cognitive skills were shown to be dependent on expertise level. During their performances, first-semester undergraduate students could not perceive some inaccuracies in note reading or rhythmic imprecision. Nevertheless, during the interviews, these students revealed that they possessed the competence to discuss musical components such as melodic lines and rhythmic patterns. Students also revealed perceptual differences in both the nature and magnitude of the explicit manifestation of the preparation for the musical piece: (1) perception as psychological sensation (discomfort and doubt); (2) aural perception in terms of pitch and rhythm discrimination, holistic aspects and stylistic idioms (<italic>Bossa Nova</italic>, Jazz, <italic>Serenata</italic>); and (3) kinaesthetic perception – that is, the lack or mastery of technical skills. These findings point to the complexity that is intrinsic to perception during or after a performance.</p>
<p>Concerning the representation as reflection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0255761411434457">Table 1</xref>), a number of students were able to identify problems outside the scope of the performance. However, solutions to the problems were infrequently proposed. These results corroborate the results reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0255761411434457">Vaughan (2002)</xref>, who concluded that music students attempt to address problems but lack systematic ways of solving them. The students seemed to think in terms of interpretative metaphors. However, during the performances, reflection seemed less explicit. A detailed list of the ways of knowing is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0255761411434457">Table 2</xref>. For each student, a grade from 0 (absent) to 5 (very accentuated) was assigned to each way of knowing. The results were then treated by Spearman’s correlation analysis.

<p>According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0255761411434457">Figure 1</xref> the procedural forms show a strong correlation between production and perception (0.791). The other two correlations follow the mean for production and reflection (0.616) and perception and reflection (0.523). The correlations for declarative forms are much lower; these data suggest a low interaction among these three ways of knowing outside the scope of the performance. In this sample, declarative representations of Guarnieri’s <italic>Ponteio</italic> no. 22 demonstrated that students were not explicit regarding the structural and expressive characteristics of this work as an object. The students’ powers of observation were primarily confined to perceptual (or sensual) knowledge (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0255761411434457">Williams, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0255761411434457">Niedderer, 2007</xref>). This type of knowledge corresponds to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0255761411434457">Swanwick (1994)</xref> called acquaintance or first-hand knowledge. The Spearman correlations for the three ways of knowing in the two types of knowledge are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0255761411434457">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0255761411434457">Figure 2</xref> the relationships between representation as production versus production in performance (−0.180), representation as production versus perception in performance (−0.417) and representation as production versus reflection in performance (−0.145) show a low inverse correlation. This correlation suggests that the students who verbalized did not necessarily demonstrate a procedural form of knowledge in their performance.</p>
<p>The correlations between representation as perception and production in performance (0.292), representation as perception and perception in performance (0.101) and representation as perception and reflection in performance (0.232) were low but positive.</p>
<p>The correlation between representations as reflection versus production in performance (0.076) is scarcely perceptible. However, the correlation between representation as reflection and perception in performance (−0.133) is low and inverse. A mean correlation was observed in Spearman’s correlation between representation as reflection and reflection in the performance (0.560).</p>
<p>These results reinforce the idea that students who strongly mobilize their declarative knowledge (outside the scope of the performance) do not necessarily manage the ways of knowing during their performances (procedural form). The weak and even inverse correlations between the two types of knowledge suggest that neither type is articulated in the musical practice of this group. Further research employing a diverse approach to this situation, such as the inclusion of a broader student population, may contribute to the understanding of this behavior. Procedural knowledge is considered interactive; that is, there is no separation between facts and processes. Additions or changes are attained only through modification (and a consequential debugging process). Declarative knowledge contains various components; the meaning of a complex expression can be derived from the meaning of its parts and their combinations. There is no interaction between separate entities; thus the representation is extremely modular. Declarative knowledge can be added easily if it reinforces a consistent system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0255761411434457">Rumelhart &amp; Norman, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761411434457">Griffiths, 2009</xref>). In the present case, the results have shown a strong correlation between production in performance <italic>versus</italic> perception in performance (0.791). Consider the case of a graduate student who may not have verbalized the musical components (as observed in the present study) but was still capable of using them in the piano performance. One must recognize that the negative (inverse) correlation between representation as production and the procedural forms suggests that the skills necessary for performing differ from the skills involved in declarative knowledge. Further evidence pertaining to the correlations between the ways of knowledge was extracted from cluster analysis. This analysis provided the dendrogram shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0255761411434457">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0255761411434457">Figure 3</xref>, the ways of knowing expressed through production and perception in performance are linked in this sample. This relationship reinforces the notion of using perception as awareness during a performance. However, the dendrogram suggests that the way of knowing for representation as production (i.e., the declarative form outside the scope of performance) is far removed from the other ways of knowing. These results suggest that, although some students did not verbalize their structural knowledge, they tacitly employed this knowledge during their performances. However, the artistic quality reached by some students in their performances suggests that they employed structural knowledge in a pragmatic way (i.e., in the way that it was supposed to function organically in their practice).</p>
<p>The results were further analyzed using multidimensional scaling (MDS), which is a set of related statistical techniques that are often used in information visualization to explore similarities or dissimilarities in data. These data are then transformed into distances that allow for the construction of the perceptual map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411434457">Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, &amp; Tatham, 2005</xref>), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0255761411434457">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

<p>In the perceptual map, we interpreted the abscissa as procedural knowledge and the ordinate as declarative knowledge. Collectively the graduate students showed a higher degree of reliance on procedural knowledge during the preparation, and the undergraduates tended to rely on their declarative knowledge. These results suggest that the graduate students in this study tended to make tacit decisions although they were less likely to verbalize them. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0255761411434457">Osa (2007)</xref>, because students managed to demonstrate a particular perspective relative to the piece, their knowledge in music performance is articulated through sound in a non-verbal mode of expression. In the sample we investigated, this pattern was observed because the correlation between production and perception in performance was very high in the students sampled (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0255761411434457">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Alternatively, because the level of reflection during and outside the scope of performance is low, the investigated group may have been more concerned with shaping a piece as quickly as possible rather than constructing a conscious interpretation. The undergraduate students may have exhibited a higher level of declarative knowledge because these students are still forming and strengthening their concepts in their formal music education.</p>

<title>Final remarks</title>
<p>In this study students have shown varying degrees of autonomy in their preparation for a given piece of music; moreover, this autonomy seems to mirror students’ current expertise levels. However, although the majority of students demonstrated levels of basic competency in terms of phrase contour and note accuracy, few students were concerned with artistic refinement. During students’ practice, the ways of thinking about production and perception seemed stronger than those of reflection. This behavior may be a consequence of the demanding nature of performance. Because they are faced with numerous deadlines and academic demands, students may seek to achieve a product within a very short time at the expense of artistic quality. Students are rarely requested to critically plan, speculate or hypothesize ways to reach specific goals. For instance, the indicated character (<italic>sad</italic>) played no significant role in the performances. The music education literature suggests that, to raise awareness about musical performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761411434457">Davis &amp; Pulman, 2001</xref>), critical tools (generic and specific creative and self-regulatory thinking) must be provided to students (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761411434457">Brown, 2009</xref>) as early as possible.</p>
<p>In the present sample, graduate students seemed to have acquired more consistent and efficient procedural knowledge. Because the product (performance) is the object through which the students articulate and integrate knowledge, the graduate students spent less time shaping results and thus revealed a better command of sight-reading and finer motor control, among other skills. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0255761411434457">Pascual-Leone (2001)</xref> demonstrated with neuroimaging techniques, playing a musical instrument demands extensive procedural and motor skills that result in the flexible reorganization of the human brain. This reorganization seems to include the rapid recognition of existing connections and the establishment of new connections.</p>
<p>In the investigated groups, undergraduate students have demonstrated that they are more prone to use their declarative knowledge. The recall stimulated interviews strongly indicate that declarative knowledge, although not explicit in the interviews, was employed tacitly for graduate students. Perception plays a strong role in performance in terms of the sense of pitch, rhythm or harmony discrimination and holistically aids the overall improvement of the performance. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0255761411434457">Sulaiman, Wan Ahmad, Awang-Rambli, Hasbullah, and Goh (2008)</xref> identified touch sensation (or haptic feedback) as the most important sensory modality used when playing. This finding was discovered using a survey involving 200 music students playing different types of instruments. These results suggest that the strong role of movement (kinaesthetic modality) and touch (tactile modality) in performance, when aligned with the visual (reading) and auditory (hearing) modalities, may contribute to the development of procedural knowledge among music students.</p>
<p>In the literature, some approaches to practice have been suggested to make time spent during preparation more efficient and more reflective. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0255761411434457">Santos and Hentschke (2009)</xref> proposed that interviews and stimulated recall interviews about students’ practice were potential tools for improving the reflective skills of music instrument students. Similarly, self-assessment and discussion of recorded performances were shown to aid in developing autonomy in undergraduate music students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411434457">Daniel, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, although we are not downplaying the role of reflection, we cannot overlook the role of substantial practice in instrumental development and education. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0255761411434457">Pascual-Leone (2001)</xref> has stated, the central nervous system must acquire and implement a translation mechanism to convert knowledge into action. These translation capabilities constitute skills that enable an instrumentalist to act on memory systems, select the relevant points, choose the proper response goals, activate the necessary sensory-motor structures, and execute the piece successfully. Such skills cannot be acquired without significant practice time. A balance between the mandatory practice necessary for fine motor skills and reflective thinking must be reached. Recent research with undergraduate music students and musicians has identified the necessity of devoting considerable amounts of time to practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0255761411434457">Creech et al., 2008</xref>). The authors argue that practicing continues to be a foundation of musical development through and beyond higher education.</p>
<p>In this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411434457">Davidson and Scripp’s (1992)</xref> matrix of cognitive skills in music allowed us to identify the ways of knowing employed by graduate and undergraduate students as they prepared a piano piece without guidance from their teachers. According to the data, different skills were converted into action and manipulated during practice and/or performance. The distance between the skills of declarative and procedural knowledge denotes that verbalized structural knowledge is not the only relevant tool in instrumental practice; thus this distance may explain why students learn, assimilate and appropriate this kind of knowledge so tacitly. It is important that instrumental music teachers provide students with musical expression parameters as guiding points to foster contextualized reflection about their music practice. Musical expression parameters, including articulation, dynamics, contour (phrasing), and timing, may catalyze the artistic preparation for a piece in consonance with stylistic and music-structural parameters.</p>

<title>Façons de savoir et de types de connaissances: comment les élèves abordent un nouveau morceau de musique?</title>
<p>Dans une étude exploratoire de plus de seize semaines, quinze étudiants de piano (du premier et du troisième cycles) ont préparé une courte pièce du compositeur brésilien Guarnieri, Ponteio n ° 22, sans les conseils de leurs professeurs de piano. Les données ont été recueillies, y compris leurs performances, les interviews se rapportant à leurs pratiques et d’interviews de rappel stimulé. Ces données ont été analysées en termes de façons de savoir et de types de connaissances qui sont exprimés dans la matrice d’habilités cognitives en Musique de Davidson et Scripp (1992). Les données ont été analysées qualitativement et quantitativement. La production de la représentation (en dehors de la performance réelle) a montré une relation structurelle avec l’information locale et globale au sujet de la pièce. En termes de perception, des habilités cognitives ont été essentiellement dépendante des niveaux d’expertise. Concernant les façons de savoir en tant que réflexion, un certain nombre d’étudiants ont été capables d’identifier les problèmes en dehors de leur propre performance. Cependant, les solutions à ces problèmes suivaient moins souvent un plan. En résumé, les étudiants du troisième cycle ont tendance à s’appuyer sur les connaissances procédurales, tandis que les étudiants de premier cycle généralement utilisé les connaissances déclaratives. Les résultats suggèrent que les étudiants en post-graduation sont plus susceptibles de prendre des décisions tacites plutôt que des décisions verbales.</p>
