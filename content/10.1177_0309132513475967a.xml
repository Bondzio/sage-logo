<p>Some years ago, Gerry Pratt wrote a letter in support of my tenure and promotion file – a valuable act of care work in academia. One of the many quirks about living in ‘the Sunshine state’ of Florida is that tenure and promotion candidates read their external letters of support – punch holes in them and put them in the binder, in fact – before the files go forward. So we have plenty of time to ruminate, worry, and obsess about their contents. I will confess that the only part of my letters of support that I recall with any clarity today is Gerry’s characterization of my work as ‘risky’. At the time, and coupled with the general anxiety that is tenure and promotion, I thought that was a potentially damning comment. I was right, as administrators up the food chain seized on the word ‘risky’ being used in conjunction with my work, though when read in context the adjective was not meant to be negative at all. Risky as it may have been, my tenure case sailed through with no major problems. Since then, I have come to appreciate the very worthwhile endeavor that is risky research, regardless of what the administration thinks. Therefore when I discuss <italic>Families Apart</italic> as a risky undertaking, I mean that in all the good senses of appreciation, admiration, and solidarity for what is a very important, provocative, and daring book.</p>
<p>
<italic>Families Apart</italic> sits squarely within what I have termed ‘the intimate turn’ in human geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132513475967a">Price, 2013</xref>). Very much a fluid and multi-stranded constellation of research interests and theoretical genealogies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132513475967a">Seigworth and Gregg, 2010</xref>, for a comprehensive discussion), scholarship by geographers has particularly focused on ‘viscerality’, capacities to affect and be affected, boundaries in multiple permutations, and narrative, among other topics. In <italic>Families Apart</italic>, Pratt covers all of these grounds, and in addition unflinchingly examines the imbroglio of politics, aesthetics, and ethics that resides at the heart of discomfits over the turn to intimacy. Because of the diverse political, narrative, and methodological modalities involved, and the multiplicity of voices that ‘speak’ and of actors involved, <italic>Families Apart</italic> might be best viewed as a project and we as participants.</p>
<p>Certainly the subject matter of <italic>Families Apart</italic> – the mobilities of Filipino workers and the affective labor performed by them for Canadian children and seniors at the expense of their own families’ emotional (if not economic) security – resonates within a traditional understanding of intimacy, involving as it does love and other emotions, sexuality, emotional and physical vulnerabilities, and erotic as well as non-erotic familial ties. The women’s experiences, both as recounted ethnographically and as worked into the play <italic>Nanay</italic>, are in addition methodologically and politically intimate. The individual stories are proximal in the sense that they are personal and therefore particular, and <italic>Nanay</italic> adds the elements of movement, physical encounter, and exchange between actors and audience. Audience members and readers of <italic>Families Apart</italic> are encouraged to imagine themselves in various situations and roles, bringing yet another form of intimacy – that fraught dance between Self and Other – into play. Finally, the participant in <italic>Families Apart</italic> is drawn into the ethical and political dilemmas posed by Canada’s Live-In Caregiver Program (LCP), and is encouraged to actively address these dilemmas rather than being told what to do by the author. ‘We have prompted you to reexamine the boundaries of your world. We ask that you might join us; this action is for you to take’ (p. 172).</p>
<p>Thus these personal stories are productively knitted with wider geographies of power asymmetries, addressing what many have signaled as a shortcoming of scholarship in an intimate register. But the connections are neither one-way nor do they resonate within structural approaches that seem ‘all angles and bones’. Pratt deliberately avoids invoking media-scripted responses to trauma which either incite voyeurism or numb the participant. Rather, the individual stories are allowed to impact the reader, not simply intellectually, but bodily as well. They also impact the researcher in a forceful, intense, and visceral fashion. Recounting a fact-finding mission to the Philippines during which Canada-based activists somaticized the painful experience of recording survivor testimonies, Pratt notes:
<disp-quote>
<p>Their witnessing was embodied, fleshy, lived, emotionally intense; and while their goal is to effect political change both in the Philippines and in Canada, members of the Canadian mission were also changed through the process of witnessing. They both put their bodies on the line and brought stories back with them in their ‘backs, hips and calves’. (p. 161)</p>
</disp-quote> <italic>Families Apart</italic> broadens and unsettles immigration studies in key ways. Most obviously, the research is primarily set within a Canadian context, and therefore works against universalizing the US immigration arena, itself quite particular, to all of North America. Not only are the historical and contemporary framings specific to Canada, so too is the foundational national discourse of liberal humanism, which Pratt notes is quietly yet profoundly predicated on disappearance and silencing of the violences tapped, circulated, and intensified by the LCP. In scholarship about immigration, the discourse of assimilation – along with policies informed by that discourse – are likewise predicated on the active disappearing of racialized difference (i.e. the oft-noted ‘silence’ and ‘invisibility’ of Filipino youths in school settings); when difference cannot or will not be erased, the discourse of assimilation is productively unsettled. In a wholly welcome contribution, Pratt consistently refuses to engage in romanticism – of liberal democracy, of immigrants, of youth and nuclear families, of hegemonic theories about immigrants, of ‘Third World women’ – and by doing so infuses these debates with a nuance and pragmatism that is frankly overdue.</p>
<p>Pratt documents the dissonance between women’s scripting of their labor migration under the auspices of the LCP as involving luck, ambition, and improved life chances for children and the realities of familial and economic instability, physical violence, exploitation, loneliness, and academic failure for many of the youths once they are reunited with their mothers in Canada. In doing so, literatures on academic, workplace, and cultural challenges faced by immigrant and ‘second generation’ youth are supplemented. By widening analysis to include the Philippine context of political violence that colors migrants’ lives before arriving in Canada, and continues to affect their families in the Philippines, Pratt does not simply expand the lifeworld boundaries of the women she studies, for ‘terror systems reorder geographies for all who come into contact with them’ (p. 148). She questions boundaries themselves, noting that geopolitical borders have a nasty habit of extruding and intruding, of following live-in care workers and their children around and marking them, and of fusing the Philippines and Canada so tightly there might as well not be a Pacific Ocean at all – if it were not for the obfuscatory power of sheer distance, and particularly if that distance is felt as geographically and temporally ‘empty’. It will be interesting to follow the reshaping of diasporic families and communities through increasing utilization of cell phones and computer-based communications technologies; which, given the median family reunification date of 1999 in the case of the women Pratt interviewed, coupled with cost and access issues related to these technologies, did not figure prominently in the <italic>Families Apart </italic>project.</p>
<p>Geographers have, especially very recently, engaged in productive collaborations with activists and practicing artists of all sorts, and have thereby extended our reach of the modalities through which we can act as public intellectuals. While Pratt notes that ‘we do have an obligation to dust off our research and send it into the world’ (p. 132), her collaborative engagements with Vancouver-based theater artists and activists at the Philippine Women Centre of British Columbia (PWC) allow her to expand the range and scope of voices and encounters in creative, impactful, and hopeful ways. So little of the existing scholarship on immigration is hopeful, yet the sort of hopefulness inspired by the <italic>Families Apart</italic> collaborations is anything but naive, engaging rather in an extensive discussion of ethics and politics throughout the book, but particularly in the concluding chapter. If the politics of affect largely involve how one can move, and be moved (both emotionally and to action), the <italic>Families Apart</italic> collaborations provide an illustration of the possibilities.</p>
<p>As we search for effective affective tactics in an increasingly more-than-representational scholarly environment, representational practices – particularly visual ones – are increasingly destabilized. I am, however, unsure how to receive the author’s strategy of substituting photographs of her son in various stages of his childhood for photos of interviewee Marlena’s left-behind son. The rationales given by the author – the photographic documentation of all lives lived as losses (here, of childhood), the disruption of the ethnographic gaze through preserving aspects of Marlena’s experience as unknowable, the staging of an encounter among prototypes (children, workers, mothers, employers) rather than specific individuals – run perilously close to the shores of ‘sisterhood is global’, on the one hand, and on the other the fundamental opacification of the Other. Pratt is deeply cognizant of these debates and I appreciate her careful discussion of ethics here and throughout the book. I am simply unsure of whether this tactic fails or succeeds to accomplish its larger goals.</p>
<p>
<italic>Families Apart</italic> dares, troubles, and takes risks. To take risks entails vulnerability through willingness to open one’s work to critical scrutiny. I suspect few of us are willing to do this in the forthright way that Pratt has here, and for her leadership on this front she should be roundly commended. In all, this is a brave, inspiring, and provocative book – an act of feminist care ethics, if you will – that this reviewer found masterful.</p>
