<p>The clack of a woman’s heels on the city street, the rap on an editor’s door, and the echo of typewriter keys from the rented room down the hall all signaled the arrival of the newspaper woman to the urban beat. Not welcome in the newsroom, women set up their typewriters on makeshift desks and created copy that expanded the boundaries of typical newspaper fare. Their assignment: the woman’s angle on the news of the day.</p>
<p>Historian Alice Fahs documents the public process of becoming a newspaper woman at the turn of the 20th century by reconstructing the lives of women who flocked to the cities to work for the metropolitan dailies that were shaping modern society. Relying on a journalist named Margherita Hamm to give voice to a larger population of newspaper women and incorporating a wealth of other primary sources, Fahs allows her cultural history to dwell on common newspaper women, fitting their stories between Stunt Girl exploits and Sob Sister coverage, which have already found their way into journalism histories. Alongside their celebrity sisters, these determined newspaper women translated their urban explorations into newspaper column inches to create a public space for women, often by taking advantage of modern opportunities such as syndication and foreign correspondence.</p>
<p>Newspaper women worked to support themselves, yet they distinguished themselves from working-class women, even though much of the newspaper work available to women was on a space rate analogous to working in factories. Calling themselves ‘bachelor girls’, they differentiated themselves from the New Woman. Newspaper women defined their whiteness through their ‘assumption of racial hierarchy’ (p. 271).</p>
<p>Drawn to the urban centers, women left the domestic sphere of the 19th century behind them. Away from their families, women created new homes, carving domestic space into the public space of the cities. Further blurring the line between the private and the public spheres, they wrote themselves into their stories, glorifying their independent lifestyles. Through columns and first-person features, they created a public persona. Fahs locates their human-interest writing within turn-of-the-century New Journalism, attributing to the newspaper women an interactive quality that transcended the pages of the newspaper, changing ‘the relationship between public and private life in American popular culture’ (p. 124). Their self-representation in print, Fahs notes, was a precursor to women’s full political participation.</p>
<p>Fahs articulates an uncommon appreciation of the common woman, which creates awareness in the reader that too often women’s history has mirrored the canon of great men, overlooking less famous women whose lives remain unexamined for key components of the cultural dynamic. Throughout the years, definitions of news have contributed to a devaluation of women’s work and to the invisibility of women; so, too, boundaries of academic research have inhibited analysis of women and their contributions. Using an interdisciplinary approach, Fahs traces the working lives of women who moved between fiction and non-fiction throughout their careers as well as in the articles they wrote. Feminist media scholars recognize how easily women slip out of history with the mere adoption of a married name. In early newspaper work, the task of tracing women is compounded. It was typical for women to write under pseudonyms, sometimes with one woman using multiple names or with one byline being taken up by a string of different women.</p>
<p>As comprehensive a work as <italic>Out on Assignment</italic> is, Fahs cites opportunities for further research, encouraging scholars to embrace the sensationalism of the period as the entertainment of an emerging leisure class. Although at times heavy-handed in her assessment of the gaps in media research and journalism history, her criticism is not to be dismissed among those interested in integrating meaningful narratives of women’s contributions into the larger body of journalism and mass communication scholarship. Fahs encourages researchers to suspend judgment of sensationalism in order to appreciate the platform it provided for writers’ experimentation. Despite being well known in their day and producing a record of published work, women have dropped out of the public record because the work they pursued did not fit neatly into the categories of respectable journalism. She attributes this oversight to a bias against the sensational, which was seen to cheapen the news product and threaten the development of the profession, a bias that has persisted among professionals and scholars well into the 21st century.</p>
<p>Women of the early 20th century moved through journalism. With little compensation for its labor-intensive demands or the chance for women’s advancement, newspaper work was often one chapter in women’s lives, but it was a chapter they wrote. Newspaper work shaped them, their recollections and, Fahs argues, transformed an industry as well as the culture. A modern public space that accommodated women had to be invented by women themselves, and the creation of this public space set the stage for women’s enfranchisement.</p>
