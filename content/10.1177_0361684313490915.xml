<body>
<p>In <italic>The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Multicultural Counseling Psychology,</italic> editors Carolyn Zerbe Enns and Elizabeth Nutt Williams definitely meet the purpose and challenge of integrating feminist, multicultural, and counseling psychologies. Every chapter offers up-to-date history, summarizes research and empirical support, and provides practical real-world applications. In the style of true feminist and multicultural inquiry, the authors guide readers with questions to ponder as well as future directions of theory, research, and practice—thus engaging readers in a dialectic process. Identifying and threading together consistent themes such as intersectionality and complexity of identities, self-awareness/reflection, strengths-based and resilience approaches, recognition of ecological/sociocultural context, and the imperative of social justice and activism, the editors and authors make a potent argument for the convergence and integration of feminist multicultural counseling psychology (FMCP).</p>
<p>The handbook is sectioned into four primary parts. Part one, “Foundations of Feminist Multicultural Counseling Psychology,” includes feminist integration of general areas of psychology (e.g., ethics, life span development) and provides a helpful framework for the remainder of the book. Any psychologist or mental health professional who wants to know the story of feminist multicultural convergence is urged to read the beautifully told herstory in Chapter 1, written by the editors with Ruth Fassinger. Further, Fischer and DeBord, in Chapter 5, challenge the status quo regarding social and feminist identity development models and pose a critical question to readers about how overt and covert power influences their research, theory, and practice.</p>
<p>Part two, “Feminist Multicultural Counseling Psychology and Specific Social Identities,” provides readers with nuances of many specific identity groups including Muslim women, women with disabilities, Latinas, lesbians, bisexual women, and transnational women. Collectively, the authors balance covering specific identities in depth, while also speaking to the heterogeneity within these groups. Mahmood’s chapter on American Muslim women highlights the intersection of spirituality and religion within cultural analysis, which in spite of recent attention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684313490915">Crook-Lyon et al., 2011</xref>) has historically been ignored in the extant psychological literature. Similarly, Szymanski’s inclusion of the benefits of being lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer is refreshing, because marginalization and oppression are typically the focus of multicultural analysis, with some recent exceptions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0361684313490915">Riggle, Whitman, Olson, Rostosky, &amp; Strong, 2008</xref>). It was particularly encouraging to read Palombi’s chapter on women with disabilities, given that issues about able-bodiedness/disability are often avoided in the field of multiculturalism and feminism and are just now beginning to receive more widespread attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684313490915">Banks, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0361684313490915">Mona &amp; Worthington, 2013</xref>).We also appreciate that several authors provided resources for specific populations and identities, providing tools for potential advocacy and activism.</p>
<p>Part three, “Feminist Multicultural Counseling Psychology Applications: Theory, Research and Practice,” operationalizes theory into practice using vignettes and salient examples to illustrate how to implement Feminist Multicultural Counseling interventions and strategies. Two chapters on career/vocational psychology made a unique contribution, consistent with primary counseling psychology tenets. Chapters reviewing political analysis (Morrow and Hawxhurst), traumatized individuals (Courtois), and body image/eating disorders (Kashubeck-West and Tagger) eloquently illustrate how women have been pathologized based on their social and cultural identities. Additionally, Nutt provides a comprehensive overview of how traditional approaches to couples and families are inherently biased due to lack of examination of power and gender dynamics. She integrates specific social identity information and feminism in a way that is very readable and applicable. Overall in this section, authors present specific, feminist multicultural alternatives for assessment and intervention, using balanced and affirming perspectives for understanding diverse psychological issues.</p>
<p>Part four, “Education, Advocacy and Social Justice,” challenges readers to question the structures and systems that reinforce patriarchal power dynamics in our training programs and practice settings. The authors acknowledge that social justice is still in the process of becoming a truly integrated practice in FMCP. They point out continued barriers to social justice/activism, including tenure structures and procapitalist business practices. The chapters in this section articulate the many different channels of advocacy and social justice (pedagogy, supervision, and mentorship). In particular, Norsworthy, Abrams, and Lindlau’s chapter was very useful in expanding ideas about how to engage in social justice activism/advocacy, how to identify aspects of one’s work as activism/advocacy, and how to affirm those who are doing this work.</p>
<p>As a whole, this book brings readers up-to-date by giving a thorough history and providing a deeper understanding of the process of integration of FMCP. Although the identities section is “less than comprehensive” (p. 19), as the editors humbly acknowledge, the book as a whole is quite thorough and beneficial. This handbook is relevant for many different individuals. Specifically, this book is helpful for students who have interest in feminism and/or multiculturalism, yet are not learning FMCP tenets in their psychology programs. In addition, the handbook appeals to those who have some knowledge of feminism and/or multiculturalism but have not been exposed to integrative information. Those who identify as feminist multicultural psychologists are likely to embrace this handbook and find the collection to be affirming and reinforcing of their lived work. In particular, we genuinely appreciate that the handbook is unapologetically clear about its values. In this way, it would make an ideal companion volume to such resources as <italic>the Handbook of Multicultural Competencies</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0361684313490915">Cornish, Schreier, Nadkarni, Metzger, &amp; Rodolfa, 2010</xref>), published by Association of Counseling Center Training Agencies.</p>
<p>As a point of critique, although peripherally included, transgender identities seem marginalized within the handbook, and we questioned the implicit gender binary perspective that was often present. In a future edition, it would be more affirming and informative to include a stand-alone chapter on gender spectrum and transgender identities. Although these issues are noted in the chapters on Lesbian and Bisexual Women, Feminist Therapy in Counseling Psychology, Feminist Therapy with Men, and in Sinacore, Ginsberg, and Kassan’s integration of queer theory into feminist multicultural pedagogy, further attention is warranted. It appears to us that feminism and multiculturalism is already shifting toward a new paradigm regarding sex and gender, consistent with editors’ first theme in their afterword. Seeing gender and sex more as a continuum of expression, which we believe is most congruent to individuals’ lived experiences, is one of the critical next steps in feminist multicultural awareness.</p>
<p>In summary, the handbook does an outstanding job of emphasizing foundational aspects of feminism and multiculturalism and of challenging us to question ourselves, the models we use, and the power lens we have in any situation. In the FMCP handbook, multiple authors remind us to keep working on recognition of locations of privilege, power, and interlocking oppressions. Regarding acceptance of lifelong learning and challenging the self, Miville in Chapter 23 astutely points out that continuing education is more than just an accrual of credit hours to maintain one’s license and should be infused with the same FMCP values and expectations that are elucidated throughout this handbook.</p>
<p>Overall, we believe this is an extraordinary contribution to the field of psychology. It is time for the next paradigm shift. Keeping feminism, multiculturalism, and counseling psychology separate perhaps only perpetuates the false assumption that one is more powerful than the other. In their closing chapter, Enns and Williams challenge us to transform the historical feminist phrase to “make the political personal.” The FMCP handbook provides inspiration for us to take up the charge to continue the process of feminist multicultural integration on personal, professional, and political levels.</p>
