<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To determine what influences the decision to insert an indwelling urinary catheter in acute stroke patients.</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> A prospective casenote review and semi-structured interviews were conducted and corporate catheterization policy in the study sites was investigated.</p>
<p><bold>Setting:</bold> Three teaching hospitals, typical of stroke service provision in most developed countries.</p>
<p><bold>Subjects:</bold> Casenotes from 70 consecutive acute stroke admissions; 50 doctors, nurses and physiotherapists working in acute stroke units and medical receiving units.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Stroke patients were catheterized for output monitoring, relief of urinary retention or, especially for older patients, continence-related issues. Half of all catheterizations occurred in acute stroke units. Continence and catheterization were considered less important than other aspects of acute stroke care. No catheterization policy or standardized continence assessment tool was in use. Documentation was often lacking. Patients and relatives were not fully involved in the decision to catheterize. Continence assessment and catheterization practices varied widely. Complex unwritten rules relating to gender proliferated. Such rules demonstrated heuristic problem-solving could potentially cause conflict. Decisions to catheterize ‘belonged’ to doctors or nurses depending upon clinical indications. Clinical assessment and specialist referrals were often seen as ‘not my job’.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Clear corporate policy on catheterization is required to direct practice. Use of standardized continence assessment tools is recommended to set and monitor standards of care. Documentation relating to urinary catheterization needs to improve.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Indwelling urinary catheters are commonly found in acute stroke patients although exact rates of use are seldom reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511426160">1</xref></sup> They can enhance the medical management of stroke but are associated with adverse effects, the most serious being catheter-associated urinary tract infection and its consequences,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511426160">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511426160">4</xref></sup> including increased morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay and resource use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511426160">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511426160">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511426160">6</xref></sup> Indwelling urinary catheters have been reported to be uncomfortable, with many patients preferring alternative methods of bladder care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511426160">7</xref></sup> Their use may delay recovery of bladder function, cause inflammation and potential trauma to the urinary tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511426160">8</xref></sup> and interfere with rehabilitation and recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511426160">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>International guidelines state that catheterization post stroke is to be avoided.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511426160">9</xref></sup> Urinary catheterization post stroke should only be considered in the presence of urinary retention, if the stroke survivor is severely unwell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511426160">10</xref></sup> or ‘to protect the vulnerable skin of patients with chronic urinary incontinence … when all other … strategies have been tried’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511426160">11</xref></sup> A Scottish study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511426160">4</xref></sup> found 25% (<italic>n</italic> = 104) of patients were catheterized during acute post-stroke care but reasons for catheterizations were not reported, while 29% of stroke survivors in England and Wales were catheterized post stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511426160">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The presence or absence of urinary incontinence should be documented and investigated for all stroke survivors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511426160">11</xref></sup> Post-stroke urinary incontinence should be assessed by trained healthcare professionals using established protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511426160">12</xref></sup> with care plans reviewed regularly and including a planned ‘trial without a catheter’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511426160">13</xref></sup> However, healthcare professionals working with stroke survivors have been reported as viewing continence to be outside their remit or believing they have sufficient knowledge of good practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511426160">14</xref></sup> There is a lack of evidence relating to the promotion of urinary continence in stroke survivors. A Cochrane systematic review recommended trials for continence promotion methods and managing urinary incontinence but did not address the justification for catheterization in the first instance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511426160">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a lack of information concerning why most post-stroke patients are catheterized in hospital, whether assessment protocols are used, who sanctions and performs the procedure, whether patients or relatives are consulted and the influence of staff availability, equipment and shift patterns. If targeted prevention is to be successful, current clinical practices must be better understood.</p>
<p>The research question was, ‘What influences the decision to insert an indwelling urinary catheter in acute stroke patients?’ The research objectives were: to identify and review any protocols or procedures for assessment of urinary incontinence in study sites; to identify when, where, why and by whom acute stroke patients are catheterized; to identify any structural issues that influence catheterization; to explore the involvement of patients or relatives in the decision to catheterize post stroke.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269215511426160">
<title>Design and methods</title>
<p>A one-year study was conducted, consisting of a prospective casenote review of consecutive, acute stroke admissions and semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals. Data were collected from three teaching hospitals with accident and emergency departments and specifically from the acute stroke unit and the medical receiving unit in each site. The same researcher, a registered nurse employed as a university research assistant, collected all data (EC).</p>
<p>The casenote review was registered with the clinical effectiveness department in each hospital. It was planned to sample 25 consecutive casenotes at each hospital (total = 75) for patients recorded as having a urinary catheter inserted within 28 days of a clinical diagnosis of stroke. Patients with a subarachnoid haemorrhage, cerebral metastases or existing urinary catheter were excluded. A specifically designed tool was used to collect the following data from each casenote: stroke diagnosis including Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511426160">16</xref></sup> if available; type of stroke; stroke severity; patient demographics including age, sex, National Institutes of Health Modified Stroke Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511426160">17</xref></sup> (NIHm), recorded urinary symptoms including any pre-stroke urinary infection; catheterization record including assessment, justification, duration of catheterization, interventions; trials without catheters, re-catheterization, difficulties or adverse events associated with catheterization, reasons for removal or retention of the catheter; acceptance of catheter by patient and carer. Data were entered into Minitab 15 and transferred to SAS version 9.2 for analysis. Associations between categorical variables were assessed using the chi-square test; mean age values were compared between groups using one-way analysis of variance. The level of significance was set at 5%.</p>
<p>Ethics approval was secured for healthcare professional interviews. Study participants provided informed consent with interview data held securely and anonymized for study reporting. Fifty healthcare professionals (12 doctors; 30 nurses; 8 physiotherapists) were purposively sampled. All registered nurses up to the level of charge nurse/ward manager, physiotherapists and junior doctors involved in the admission or treatment of stroke patients in medical receiving units or acute stroke units at study sites, across all shifts, were invited by letter to participate. Interview recruiting went smoothly with potential respondents either posting signed consent forms or speaking to the researcher on the ward. Purposive sampling allowed data saturation to be reached. Participants chose to take part in either one-to-one (<italic>n</italic> = 23) or small group interviews (<italic>n</italic> = 10). Interviews were conducted either in a quiet room on the ward or in a teaching room at study sites. In general, interviews lasted 25–35 minutes and participants seemed keen to discuss the issues. The interview schedule consisted of 12 open questions with prompts on stroke care priorities, continence assessment, catheterization pathway, patient, family and team involvement, hospital infrastructure, information giving (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215511426160">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Interviews were digitally recorded with permission. Accuracy was checked by confirming statements with participants during interviews. Inductive content analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511426160">18</xref></sup> was used to explore interview data thematically. Interview recordings were transcribed, re-read, coded and categorized using NVivo8 (EC). Initially the interview schedule was used as an organizing framework and new categories added as further interviews were analysed. Categories were reviewed with other researchers (LS, JB) to identify emergent themes. Themes were compared with transcripts to ensure the team’s interpretation was valid. Interview themes were triangulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511426160">19</xref></sup> against quantitative data from the casenote review.</p>

<title>Casenote review</title>
<p>It was established at the study outset that no policy on urinary catheterization existed in or across the study sites. It was only possible to sample 20 casenotes in Site C despite extending the data collection period as it had a lower catheterization rate compared with the other two study sites. On average, notes were reviewed a mean (SD) of 14.9 (14.8) days (median: 9.5 days; range 2–64) after admission and all included patients met the entry criteria. Demographics and clinical characteristics are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511426160">Table 2</xref>. Seventeen patients (24.3%) had a documented history of incontinence pre stroke. Ten (22.7%) patients also had faecal incontinence. It was impossible to review the use of standard neurological impairment tools such as National Institutes of Health Modified Stroke Scale owing to inconsistency in record-keeping or the non-use of such instruments.</p>

<p>The 50 respondents’ stroke experience ranged from six weeks to more than 20 years. Almost half reported no previous continence training. Again almost half indicated that they avoided catheterizing patients post-stroke but few linked this to a policy or protocol. No standardized continence assessment tool was in use within or between sites. The availability and use of continence assessment tools varied. Only 11 respondents indicated that a continence assessment would be carried out on post-stroke patients in their unit and if done, it would be of lower priority than other physiological and functional assessments. In contrast to the casenote review findings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0269215511426160">Table 5</xref>), respondents generally believed that few catheterizations occurred in stroke units.</p>
<p>Overwhelmingly, respondents reported that decisions to catheterize post stroke were driven by clinical indications: ‘skin integrity, urinary retention, output monitoring’. Respondents were clear that staffing levels or ward infrastructure (e.g. availability of beds near toilets) did not influence the decision to catheterize. Only five respondents reported use of intermittent catheters and some nurses believed these posed an unacceptable infection risk.</p>
<p>Catheterization after stroke was sometimes seen as ‘not my job’. In addition, tasks related to pre-catheterization assessment such as rectal examination or checking drug regimes were often seen as a task for another profession within the multidisciplinary stroke team: ‘I don’t tend to do PR examinations . . . I would get a doctor’ (RN24). ‘It’s [checking drug prescriptions] not something that I would particularly want to mess around with just because they’re being incontinent. I’d probably leave it to someone who’s a bit more clued up on their heart failure’ (D2). Physiotherapists did not consider that they had a role in continence assessment within a stroke context – ‘It’s an area of specialty, almost, that I certainly wouldn’t be competent to do, as I am’ (P7) – and saw continence management as the domain of nurses: ‘We would . . . provide the nursing staff with the information that this person is being regularly incontinent’ (P4).</p>
<p>The use of ‘rules of engagement’ or heuristics was identified. Heuristics are loosely defined as ‘rules of thumb’ that enable efficient decision-making by bypassing the necessity to process large amounts of data. A set of unwritten, often unspoken but nevertheless agreed rules of behaviour relating to catheterization was identified:</p>
<list id="list1-0269215511426160" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Doctors can catheterize any patient.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Female nurses with appropriate training can catheterize any patient.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A male nurse can catheterize a male patient; no additional training required.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A male nurse can catheterize a male patient; additional training required.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A female nurse can catheterize a male patient; additional training required.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A female nurse doesn’t catheterize a male patient even with appropriate/additional training.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Some respondents reported that these heuristics influenced decision-making. ‘I always get the impression that the decision to catheterize a male patient is a medical one and nurses seem to expect it to be a medical one, whereas the female patients, they [nurses] expect to make the decision to catheterize’ (D5).</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly therefore, a potential for interdisciplinary conflict emerged. Respondents (<italic>n</italic> = 18) spoke of the potential particularly in relation to the initial decision to catheterize. ‘We’ve had situations where medical staff have said to catheterize a stroke patient purely because they’re incontinent and for no other reason, and we’ve challenged it’ (RN5). ‘Anytime you broach that [urosheaths and other interventions to avoid catheterization] it’s normally like “Oh no, that’ll just not work” . . . and then they [nurses] kind of talk you into sometimes using an actual catheter. I’ve had previous experience of that’ (D7). Site C reported the least potential for conflict and there, more nurses (<italic>n</italic> = 9) believed a nurse could catheterize any patient.</p>
<p>The decision to catheterize ‘belonged’ to specific disciplines depending on clinical indications; doctors usually led on catheterization for relief of acute retention or for output monitoring, often acting on information provided by nurses and with the two disciplines generally in agreement. However, nurses tended to decide catheterization for skincare or patient comfort issues and respondents described this decision making as inconsistent and less likely to involve other disciplines. Unlike other aspects of stroke care, the decision to catheterize was not a matter for the wider multidisciplinary team. Only a few respondents mentioned patient involvement in the decision to catheterize and this was mainly in terms of capacity to consent.</p>
<p>Respondents described variations in practice within and between study sites. While many (<italic>n</italic> = 27) cited urinary retention as a common indicator for post-stroke catheterization, few were clear that pre-catheterization assessment would include rectal examinations. Most doctors (<italic>n</italic> = 10) and one third of nurses (<italic>n</italic> = 10) reported they would check the prescription chart before catheterizing. The availability of bladder scanners varied widely. Variation also occurred in the disciplines permitted to scan. Some nurses reported, ‘It’s not something we do as a matter of course. Obviously that’s why we should get the doctors to do it’ (RN6) while elsewhere, healthcare assistants performed scans: ‘Everybody can bladder scan – all our auxiliaries [unregistered nursing assistants] bladder scan’ (RN24).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study indicate that while clinical indicators drove the decision to catheterize, continence assessment and catheterization practices varied widely and standardized assessment tools were not in use. Many catheterizations took place in acute stroke units and documentation relating to catheterization was often inadequate. It was clear that patients, relatives and the wider multidisciplinary team were not commonly involved in the decision to catheterize.</p>
<p>The principal limitation to this study was the quality of documentation, for example relating to indications for catheterization, which created difficulty in extracting data from casenotes, limited comparisons between study sites and with other studies and hampered the study aim of understanding the stroke catheterization pathway. In addition, in one study site the lower level of catheterizations meant it was not possible to achieve the target number of cases for review despite extending the data collection period. Further, the researchers took the view that ‘if it’s not in the case notes then it didn’t happen’. As data collection was carried out at three sites only, the findings of this study are not generalizable but they do fall within the trends reported elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511426160">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511426160">22</xref></sup> Finally, accident and emergency staff who performed catheterizations post-stroke were not interviewed.</p>
<p>The range of professional issues relating to role, heuristics and potential conflict that emerged in interviews surprised the research team. Although nurses, doctors and physiotherapists had clear views of their role in relation to catheterization, they were generally in accord as to what clinical indicator ‘belonged’ to which professional group. At the same time the unspoken rules that guided clinical practice were seen as limiting, annoying, time-consuming but never helpful. Consequently the irritation expressed between professional groups was understandable but again not managed. At one level, these findings highlight the importance of having a corporate policy towards catheterization generally; the lack of clear direction caused by a policy vacuum is suggested as a reason for at least some of the role-related themes that emerged. However, it is also interesting to reflect that stroke unit care has received much scrutiny over past years and national stroke audit data have consistently thrown up problems related to urinary catheterization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511426160">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511426160">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511426160">22</xref></sup> The lack of corporate guidance on urinary catheterization and of standardized continence assessment tools is in common with many other UK areas. It is notable that in Site C there were fewer reports of potential conflict. In the absence of an overall policy, this may have been due to strong local clinical leadership or greater provision of training resulting in higher numbers of nurses willing to catheterize both sexes.</p>
<p>Structural issues were not found to influence the decision to catheterize and patients were just as likely to be catheterized on dayshift as nightshift; nor did the variations in bladder scanning practice affect the decision to catheterize. And while the standard of documentation in this study is not dissimilar to that found elsewhere,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511426160">20</xref></sup> it remains the case that catheterization is an invasive procedure with a potential for harm and therefore warrants signed accountability.</p>
<p>Overall, healthcare professionals agreed that sensitive and safe urinary catheterization was important. However, inadequate documentation, the lower priority attached to continence assessment, the absence of routine audit and the lack of patient or family involvement may all have contributed to the procedure being seen as ‘of lesser importance’ and the way in which the ‘task’ was apportioned. The lack of interest expressed by physiotherapists, given that incontinence can militate against physical recovery post stroke, is a concern.</p>
