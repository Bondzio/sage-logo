<abstract>
<p>The coexistence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is unusual, but the occurrence of SLE after HIV infection is even less common. Both conditions share similar clinical features including constitutional symptoms, facial rash, oral ulcers, alopecia, arthralgias, arthritis, seizures, cytopenias, glomerulonephritis, and antinuclear and antiphospholipid antibodies. This clinical overlap makes the diagnosis of SLE in a patient with pre-existing HIV infection difficult. Furthermore, immune complex glomerulonephritis with features resembling lupus nephritis has been described in HIV-positive patients. We present the case of a 45-year-old Hispanic woman with long-standing HIV infection who developed membranous glomerulonephritis with histological features of lupus nephritis. Five years after onset of renal disease she developed clinically evident SLE.</p>

<p>The coexistence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is very rare. Only few cases of true coexistence have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203311434106">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203311434106">7</xref></sup> Moreover, both diseases share several clinical features, including the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203311434106">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203311434106">7</xref></sup> The term pseudolupus is used to describe a patient with HIV infection that presents with rheumatic manifestations similar to SLE. One of the renal manifestations of HIV infection is immune complex glomerulonephritis with lupus-like renal features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203311434106">8</xref></sup> Thus, it is difficult to determine if affected patients have a true coexistence of HIV and SLE versus pseudolupus. Here, we report the case of a middle-aged woman with long-standing HIV infection who presented chronic membranous glomerulonephritis as the initial manifestation of SLE.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203311434106" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>A 45-year-old Puerto Rican woman with an established diagnosis of HIV infection of 20-year duration presented in November 2009 with arthralgias, 30-minute morning stiffness, facial and body rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, alopecia, and increasing fatigue, and tiredness for 1 year. HIV infection was manifested by constitutional symptoms, positive ELISA and Western blot test for HIV, and decreased CD4 T cell count (lowest cell count in the past was 310/mm<sup>3</sup>). She received multiple protocols of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) but due to poor adherence to therapy, none of them were used for more than six consecutive months. She had no opportunistic infections or received prophylactic therapy. The obstetrical history was remarkable for one full-term pregnancy without HIV transmission; this was followed by three spontaneous abortions, all during the first trimester of gestation. She had no thromboembolic events, seizures or neuropsychiatric disease, nor history of hematological disorders. In 2004 she developed nephrotic-range proteinuria. Kidney biopsy performed in February 2005 revealed membranous glomerulonephritis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203311434106">Figure 1</xref>). IgM deposition in granular and segmental patterns was observed by immunofluorescence, and a thickened basement membrane with subepithelial deposits was seen on electron microscopy. She was treated with enalapril 20 mg daily and furosemide 40 mg daily.

(B) Electron microscopy discloses glomeruli with thickened basement membranes and subepithelial deposits.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0961203311434106-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>On physical examination the patient had diffuse alopecia, malar rash, a hard palate oral ulcer, and a diffuse maculopapular erythematous rash involving the upper extremities, chest and thighs. She had marked pedal edema bilaterally. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell count of 6600/mm<sup>3</sup>, hemoglobin of 11.1 g/dl, platelets count of 131,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, lymphocyte count of 1188/mm<sup>3</sup>, serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dl and albumin of 2.8 g/dl. Urine analysis showed 6–10 RBC/hpf, 0–5 WBC/hpf, 0–2 granular casts/hpf, and 3+ protein. Urine collection revealed proteinuria of 6751 mg/24 h. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 30 mm/h. ANA test was positive at 1 : 320 with a homogeneous pattern. Anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith, anti-RNP, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, and anticardiolipin antibodies were negative. C3 and C4 complement levels were normal. Cryoglobulins were not detected. HIV load by PCR was 97,580 copies/ml and CD4 count was 214/mm<sup>3</sup>. Hepatitis B and C virus tests were negative. VDRL test was non-reactive.</p>
<p>Kidney biopsy was repeated in December 2009 and showed chronic membranous glomerulonephritis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203311434106">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast to the first renal biopsy, IgG and C1q deposition was observed in addition to IgM. Electron microscopy disclosed glomeruli with segments of capillary collapse and thickened basement with inconspicuous intramembranous and subepithelial electron-dense deposits.

<p>The patient was started on hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily and HAART. Constitutional symptoms, mucocutaneous lesions, and arthralgias resolved. Proteinuria decreased and renal function remained normal. She did not require corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0961203311434106" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The clinical overlap that exists between HIV and SLE makes it difficult to distinguish whether the disease manifestations are caused by HIV (pseudolupus), SLE, or both. Shared manifestations include constitutional symptoms (fever, tiredness and malaise), dermatological features (facial rash, oral ulcers and alopecia), musculoskeletal involvement (arthralgias, arthritis and myalgias), central nervous system disorders (seizures and psychosis), renal disease (proteinuria, hematuria and glomerulonephritis), and cytopenias (leukopenia, anemia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia). Our patient developed tiredness, malar rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, alopecia, and arthralgias 5 years after the onset of membranous glomerulonephritis with immune complex deposits.</p>
<p>ANA with low titers (1 : 40, 1 : 80) are seen in 20% of patients with HIV infection; however, titers up to 1:160 have been documented in only 10% of these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203311434106">9</xref></sup> Our patient had an ANA titer of 1 : 320, which may favor the diagnosis of SLE. In addition to ANA, other autoantibodies have been reported in HIV-positive patients including anti-ssDNA, anti-RNP, and anticardiolipin antibodies, among others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203311434106">7</xref></sup> Conversely, anti-dsDNA antibodies are usually absent in HIV infection; this has been used as a major serological maker for the diagnosis of SLE in patients with pre-existing HIV infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203311434106">9</xref></sup> The lack of anti-dsDNA antibodies in our patient does not exclude the possibility of SLE since anti-dsDNA antibodies are seen less frequently in Puerto Ricans with SLE when compared with other ethnic groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203311434106">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most common glomerular disease occurring in HIV-positive patients is focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with glomerular basement membrane collapse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203311434106">5</xref></sup> Immune complex glomerulonephritis with histological and structural features resembling lupus nephritis has also been described in HIV-positive patients, but its occurrence is less common.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203311434106">8</xref></sup> This HIV-associated glomerulonephritis is characterized by a diverse pattern of immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM, and IgA) and complement (C3 and C1q) deposition within the glomeruli. It commonly presents without clinical manifestations or serological markers of SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203311434106">8</xref></sup> In a retrospective study of 77 patients with HIV and kidney disease, 14 (18%) patients had lupus-like glomerulonephritis, of which 11 had negative ANA and three had weakly positive ANA (1 : 40 in one, and 1 : 80 in two). None of them had clinical features of SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203311434106">8</xref></sup> Interestingly, our patient presented persistent immune complex glomerulonephritis with a lupus-like pattern manifested by deposition of IgM, IgG and C1q. Eventually she developed extra-renal manifestations of SLE and high-titer ANA.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, seven cases of adult SLE patients with pre-existing HIV infection have been reported. (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203311434106">Table 1</xref>). Of those cases, lupus nephritis was reported only in two patients. Both of them were black males; one had class V lupus nephritis and the other class IV, as defined by the World Health Organization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203311434106">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203311434106">5</xref></sup> Similar cases of SLE with lupus nephritis have been described in children and adolescents with congenital HIV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203311434106">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203311434106">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203311434106">12</xref></sup> In addition, there are two cases of HIV and SLE in adult patients with lupus nephritis, but diagnoses were made simultaneously for both patients; therefore, it is difficult to determine which disease occurred first. Nonetheless, these cases reaffirm that the coexistence of both entities is possible.

<p>The prevalence of rheumatic disorders in HIV-infected patients is approximately 9%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203311434106">13</xref></sup> Besides SLE, other autoimmune diseases have been reported in HIV/AIDS including rheumatoid arthritis, antiphospholipid syndrome, spondyloarthropathies, vasculitis, myopathies, autoimmune thyroiditis, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura and diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome. These entities may occur at any time during the course of HIV infection. The mechanisms that explain the coexistence of HIV infection and autoimmune diseases are unclear, since the development of autoimmune diseases is unexpected in immunosuppressive states characterized by a decline of CD4 T cells. On the other hand, it has been proposed that remission of SLE is achieved when there is depletion of CD4 cells in active HIV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203311434106">13</xref></sup> However, the occurrence of SLE in HIV-infected patients with a CD4 T-cell count under 200/mm<sup>3</sup> has been reported before.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203311434106">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203311434106">4</xref></sup> Our patient had a low CD4 T cell count at the time of SLE diagnosis. Despite a 20-year history of HIV infection and low CD4 T cell counts she never presented opportunistic diseases or any AIDS-defining illnesses. The occurrence of SLE in our patient could be related to HAART, which has been known to cause the immune reconstitution syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203311434106">13</xref></sup> On the other hand, the relatively benign course of her renal disease could be related to the immunosuppression caused by HIV infection.</p>
<p>The treatment of patients with coexistent HIV infection and SLE is not well established because of the negative impact that immunosuppressive medications could have in those with preexistent impaired immunity. However, in addition to HAART, hydroxychloroquine seems to be a reasonable treatment option. This immunomodulator exhibits an antiviral property in HIV patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203311434106">14</xref></sup> as well an anti-inflammatory effect that does not confer an increased risk for opportunistic infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203311434106">15</xref></sup> Low-dose prednisone may be considered but with caution for those with severe immunosuppression.</p>
<p>In summary, we report a case of a Hispanic woman with HIV infection who presented lupus nephritis as the initial manifestation of SLE. Two other similar cases have been reported before. The number of patients with HIV presenting lupus-like immune complex glomerulonephritis in the absence of clinical or serological SLE appears to be increasing. The diagnosis of SLE in a patient with pre-existing HIV infection could be challenging because HIV may present with features that mimic SLE such as lupus-like nephritis. Thus, further evaluation with proper assessment of clinical manifestations, serological markers, and renal biopsy is highly recommended to pursue the diagnosis. Clinicians should be aware of the coexistence of both entities for proper evaluation, management, and assessment of long-term prognosis.</p></sec>
