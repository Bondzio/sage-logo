<p>Steve Summers argues that ‘Amongst the various expressions used to identify the Church … few have the unexplored potential for contemporary society than “the Friend of Christ”’ (pp. 164-65). His impressive, wide-ranging, interdisciplinary study examines classical, ancient and contemporary understandings of friendship, contending that it should be central to the Church’s self-understanding in postmodern society.</p>
<p>The book comprises three parts, the first of which sets out the religious and social contexts for its argument. Summers supposes that mention of friendship in the canon ‘requires at least a respectful glance’ (p. 9), and proceeds to present a sample of exegetical approaches to Jn 15.12-17, in which Jesus declares his disciples to be not servants but friends. The author then examines ‘Friendship’s Postmodern Context’, wisely eschewing an attempt to define ‘postmodernism’ and instead using its theorists to describe contemporary Western culture. He focuses on communication, including the media presentation of friendship in TV series like <italic>Friends</italic> and <italic>Big Brother</italic>, as well as studies like Robert Putnam’s <italic>Bowling Alone</italic>. The role of friendship in affluent societies, where it does not function as an economic safety net, emerges as an important issue. A helpful philosophical discussion delineates postmodernity’s emerging form as it contrasts with modernity, especially with respect to meta-narratives, art and political economy. Summers concludes that the social implications of postmodernity offer new scope for revitalized forms of friendship.</p>
<p>Part II focuses upon how friendship has been conceived in the past. Summers examines not only ancient definitions but also the means by which the topic is raised. Homer, for example, recounts stories of ideal friendship that portray the obligation to prosecute posthumous vengeance on a friend’s behalf. A brief excursus critiques C. S. Lewis’s four-fold typology of love because it excludes, <italic>a priori</italic>, physical expression from ‘friendship love’. The presentation of friendship in Plato highlights how he perceived it as a means of achieving the good. Importantly, friendship in the Greek world was not merely private but a public matter, and in his discussion of Aristotle’s enduring analysis of friendship, Summers pays particular attention to how friendship occurs in the context of <italic>koinonia</italic>. According to Cicero, friendship itself is a moral good, thus it is permissible to ‘bend the rules’ to help a friend. The discussion concludes with a summary table of the characteristics of friendship along with mention of ‘friendship’s variety’ (p. 71) through history and across cultures.</p>
<p>Summers then turns to theological understandings of friendship in Augustine and Aquinas. He rejects Augustine’s ‘problematic dualism’ (p. 83) that distinguishes between friendship generally and ‘Christian friendship’. ‘If one sees Christ in, and loves God through, those who are friends there is a real danger of not seeing Christ in the poor and marginalised, the excluded and rejected, who may also reveal the face of God’ (p. 86). For Aquinas friendship with God is an appropriate way of thinking about love of God, and Summers highlights how reciprocity, which is usually considered a central feature of human friendship, is itself a gift. ‘Grace provides the means by which one is raised to a position of offering reciprocal love to God: it is reciprocity enabled by God’s generosity’ (p. 89).</p>
<p>In classical sources friends were sometimes conceived as ‘other selves’, so raising the issue of personhood. Summers critiques a ‘Cartesian metaphysics’ that supposes the self is both equivalent to the mind and fixed. Although the analysis starts by using Nietzsche to deconstruct this belief, he concludes, with Heidegger, that Nietzsche remains thoroughly modern when it comes to the conception of the self. Summers adopts, therefore, the more radical position of Derrida, who conceived personhood as a process. Postmodernity, it is claimed, ‘offers a self without a centre, a self without parameters, and the opportunity for a self formed in relationship with others’ (p. 115). Summers does not see this dynamic as problematic but fertile ground for friendship that provides a hospitable welcome to others.</p>
<p>Part III seeks to identify lessons from the insights of earlier chapters for the life of the Church. Summers starts by addressing the challenge that friendship's openness to others seems to be undermined by the fact that it is a relationship that prefers particular people. He avers that particular friendships are not merely instantiations of some principle of benevolence; rather ‘friendship’s particularity provides the only meaningful expression of universal love’ (p. 131). The practicalities of friendships in monastic communities are briefly discussed, before a more extended discussion of friendship and gender. Queer Theory is utilised to destabilise hegemonic understandings of sexuality; and lesbian and gay friendship is presented as an example of open and hospitable relations not tied to the nuclear family and, as such, a model for ecclesial communities.</p>
<p>The final, longest chapter examines the meaning of community, asks how <italic>koinonia</italic> within the Trinity can inform ecclesial relations, and demonstrates the centrality of the Eucharist for friends of Christ. The discussion of patristic understandings of the Trinity informs Summers’ understanding that the Father chooses to love and send the Son and the Spirit. Yet it is not simply Trinitarian love but also the otherness of the divine three that serve as examples for the Church: friendship does not seek to assimilate the other. Turning to the Eucharist, Summers is critical of attempts to ‘window dress’ the sacrament, a charge he levels at the ‘Emerging Church’ and ‘Fresh Expressions’ movements. Instead, he wants to locate the meaning of the bread and wine in the context of friendship with Christ, which includes the risks associated with offering hospitality. ‘In the breaking, sharing and eating together, the divided and reunited community is mirrored … and the Church is seen, not as an opportunity of simultaneous, privatised religious experience, but as a corporate encounter of hospitality received and offered’ (p. 178). A brief discussion of the eschatological dimension of friendship with God brings the main argument to a close.</p>
<p>In a very short ‘Conclusion’ Summers highlights how the threads of his thesis are drawn together. <italic>Friendship</italic> contains 14 pages of bibliography and an index; extensive notes and references are found at the end of each chapter. The book is refreshingly free of typographical errors: I noted only the misspelling of one name (Johnnie for Johnny on p. 169) and some unexpected semicolons (p. 76, n. 77).</p>
<p>Summers writes accessibly and engagingly. He synthesizes material from several diverse fields and is particularly impressive when discussing theological and philosophical sources. Moreover, the image of the Church as ‘friends of Christ sharing a meal and open to others’ is powerful: Steve Summers has done the Church a service in demonstrating that it is theologically robust. Nevertheless, I would wish to pose several important questions.</p>
<p>First, what would Summers’ account look like if he took the social context of friendship more seriously? The initial discussion of Jn 15 might be likened to a very fleeting glance, especially when it comes to the relations between friends and other people. The anthropological literature, some of which is cited in the book, shows that the category ‘friend’ exists alongside those of ‘family’ and ‘enemies’. While these classifications are flexible and can overlap, one can only understand ‘friendship’ in relation to the frustrations, joys and obligations of other relationships. This was certainly so in the ancient world and in the medieval period, both of which are discussed by Summers. In the Bible itself one need look no further than the conjunction of friends and brothers in Lk. 14.12; 21.16; and Summers mentions David and Jonathan, and Ruth and Naomi. Yet the social matrix of friendship, and especially its socially conditioned implicit or explicit obligations, is not a prominent theme in this book, leaving the reader with the impression that Summers conceives friendship in quite an atomistic way. Of course, this may be a characteristic of postmodern relations, but then this sort of ‘friendship’ is markedly distinct from that in the past. This is exactly what some claim, and it is not irrelevant that Summers’ choice of the gay community is in contradistinction to the nuclear family, although this is itself a partial choice: what has become of others for whom the idea of friendship might be key, for example, single and divorced people?</p>
<p>A second question is whether it is theologically satisfying to endorse a postmodern conception of the self. Without wishing to dispute the difficulties that Summers identifies with modernist understandings, he opts rather uncritically for Derrida’s centre-less self. At one point he states that ‘“being for” the other is not something one <italic>decides</italic> to do but is a recognition of, or an awakening to, an already existent state of responsibility for the other’ (p. 126). But why should one have a sense of responsibility, rather than, say, a desire to abuse or oppress the other? A traditional Christian answer, that would make sense of Summers’ use of ‘recognizing’, is that because we inhabit a created world with a natural moral order, the obligation precedes the encounter. But if the ethical demand is ‘already there’, why not also—in some sense—the self who is confronted by this demand?</p>
<p>Finally, does the book’s positive statement of the possibilities for re-imagining ecclesial communities today ignore the shadow side of human action? Some, of course, will object to Summers’ presentation of the gay community as an exemplar on the basis of sexual ethics. Regardless of one’s stance on this matter there are other concerns. On the one hand, as Summers acknowledges (p. 147), some homosexual relationships are coercive (something that can also be true of heterosexual relationships). He rather downplays such abuse, preferring to highlight the gay community’s cohesion based upon friendship. Yet the question about what to do when there is misuse of power within the ecclesial community remains and may be a challenge to an overly egalitarian and amorphous conception of friendship: order and (moral) discipline are also important facets of Church life. On the other hand, because relations between friends will be virtuous to varying degrees, the Church needs to be a community that promotes virtue and discourages vice. This can conflict with its mission to be hospitable. Summers provides a rather extreme example of ‘bodily hospitality’ (p. 147), which raises questions about what is, and what is not, morally acceptable openness to the other.</p>
<p>To conclude, Summers has penned an engaging proposal for an ecclesiology rooted in divinely influenced human relationality. Its scope and depth make <italic>Friendship</italic> a solid starting point for more work on its theme. In addition, ministers of churches in postmodern societies will find the idea that the Church is a gathering of ‘friends of Christ’ stimulating and invigorating.</p>
