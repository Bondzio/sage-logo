<abstract>
<p>This paper analyses the effect of macroeconomic and social conditions on the demand for redistribution. Using a synthetic cohort design to generate panel data at the level of socio-demographic groups, analysis of fives waves of data from the European Social Survey (2002–2010) shows that differences across countries in macroeconomic and social conditions have an effect on the demand for redistribution. Consistent with theoretical expectations, economic growth generates a lower demand for redistribution, while higher income inequality generates a higher demand. By contrast, differences across countries in unemployment levels and social expenditure are unrelated to the demand for redistribution. The analysis also suggests that empirical results depend to a considerable extent on the assumptions underlying different methodological approaches.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>What drives popular demand for income redistribution? Theoretical models in political sociology and political economy hypothesise that the demand for redistribution is driven by exposure to social risks at the individual level, for example, unemployment, illness and old age (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0958928712471225">Bowles and Gintis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0958928712471225">Jæger, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0958928712471225">Kangas, 1997</xref>), and by social risks at the contextual level, for example, adverse macroeconomic conditions and high income inequality (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928712471225">Blekesaune, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0958928712471225">Durr, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0958928712471225">Finseraas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0958928712471225">Moene and Wallerstein, 2003</xref>). Consequently, the demand for redistribution reflects personal risks and social risks shared with others.</p>
<p>While there is compelling empirical evidence that individuals’ socioeconomic position measured by, for example, income, education and social class is linked to the demand for redistribution, the evidence on an effect of macroeconomic and social conditions is much less consistent (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0958928712471225">Andreβ and Heien, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928712471225">Blekesaune and Quadagno, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0958928712471225">Busemeyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471225">Dallinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928712471225">Dion and Birchfield, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0958928712471225">Finseraas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928712471225">Fraile and Ferrer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0958928712471225">Goerres and Tepe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0958928712471225">Jæger, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0958928712471225">Jakobsen, 2010</xref>). The inconsistent results are surprising given that theory clearly predicts that the demand for redistribution should be high in times with poor economic and social conditions and vice versa in good times. Candidate reasons for the lack of consistent results in previous research are limitations in the available data and analytical designs. This paper provides new evidence on the effect of macroeconomic and social conditions on the demand for redistribution using an alternative analytical design that addresses two important limitations in previous research.</p>
<p>The first limitation in previous research concerns the low number of observations at the country level. Given that most comparative datasets, for example, the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) and the European Social Survey (ESS), include only a relatively small number of countries (typically fewer than 30), there is inherently limited variation in the country-level variables that measure macroeconomic and social conditions. This limitation means that it is difficult to identify the effect of country-level variables on individual-level outcomes and it may be one important reason behind the lack of consistent results in previous research. This paper extends previous research by constructing pseudo panel data that, in addition to cross-sectional (that is, between-country) variation, also provides longitudinal (that is, within-country) variation in empirical indicators of macroeconomic and social conditions. This pseudo panel approach, which is presented in detail below, thus adds an extra source of variation to country-level variables capturing macroeconomic and social conditions.</p>
<p>The second limitation in previous research concerns difficulties in credibly estimating the effect of country-level variables on the demand for redistribution. Most previous research combines cross-sectional data and multilevel models to analyse whether differences across countries, for example, differences in unemployment levels and social security spending, are linked to the demand for redistribution. However, the types of multilevel models often used in previous research assume that observed country-level variables are uncorrelated with omitted country-level variables that also affect the demand for redistribution. For example, when analysing whether differences in observed unemployment rates in Germany and Norway explain differences in the demand for redistribution in these two countries, existing research implicitly assumes that other unmeasured differences between Germany and Norway that also affect the demand for redistribution are unrelated to the unemployment rate. This assumption is often unrealistic, and the consequence of omitting relevant country-level variables is that empirical estimates of the effect of observed country-level variables are biased because these estimates also pick up the effect of omitted country-level variables. This paper proposes an alternative approach that combines pseudo panel data with a fixed effect multilevel design. By relying exclusively on cross-time variation in country-level variables and in the demand for redistribution, the main advantage of this design is that it controls away all omitted but fixed differences between countries that affect the demand for redistribution (institutional, political, cultural, and so on). Consequently, the proposed analytical design provides a stronger basis than previous research for analysing whether, as suggested by theoretical models in political sociology and political economy, macroeconomic and social conditions affect the demand for redistribution.</p>
<p>The alternative design proposed in this paper uses data from 31 countries from five waves of the European Social Survey (ESS, data collected 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010). Unlike previous studies, which use either a cross-sectional design with inference at the level of individuals (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928712471225">Blekesaune and Quadagno, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471225">Dallinger, 2010</xref>) or a longitudinal design with inference at the levels of countries (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928712471225">Blekesaune, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0958928712471225">Durr, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0958928712471225">Kenworthy and McCall, 2008</xref>), this paper takes a middle ground and analyses whether macroeconomic and social conditions affect the demand for distribution at the level of socio-demographic groups. In the absence of panel data at the level of individuals, the identification strategy builds on matching groups of individuals over time that are observationally identical with regard to their level of education, social class position and age. The paper proposes a 3 × 3 × 3 classification of education, social class and age that results in 27 distinct socio-demographic groups within each ESS country and time period. This synthetic cohort design yields a sample of approximately 3300 group-by-year observations nested within 31 countries.</p>
<p>The paper includes five time-varying variables capturing macroeconomic and social conditions (unemployment, consumer prices, economic growth, income inequality and social expenditure). After controlling for fixed characteristics of countries, results suggest that macroeconomic and social conditions do affect the demand for redistribution to some extent. Higher consumer prices and economic growth is associated with a lower demand for redistribution, while higher income inequality is associated with a higher deman. By contrast, differences in countries’ unemployment rates and social expenditure are unrelated to the demand for redistribution. These results partly confirm theoretical expectations and results from previous research. Furthermore, results suggest that being able to account for omitted characteristics of countries that affect the demand for redistribution has important implications for substantive conclusions.</p>

<sec id="section2-0958928712471225">
<title>Theoretical background</title>
<p>Several theories in political sociology and political economy seek to explain why individuals differ with regard to the demand for redistribution. These theories can be divided into two groups, depending on whether they focus on individual or contextual explanations of individual differences in the demand for redistribution. The next sections briefly introduce individual-level explanations before proceeding to contextual explanations that are of principal relevance in this paper.</p>
<sec id="section3-0958928712471225">
<title>Individual-level explanations</title>
<p>Individual-level theories in political sociology often point to ideology or self-interest as the driving forces behind between observable differences in the demand for redistribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0958928712471225">Bowles and Gintis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0958928712471225">Rehm, 2009</xref>). The <italic>ideology</italic> explanation argues that political socialisation shapes individuals’ core values (for example, left–right or conservative vs progressive orientation), which in turn affect operational attitudes such as the demand for redistribution and beliefs about redistributive justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0958928712471225">Franklin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0958928712471225">Fong, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0958928712471225">Oorschot, 2002</xref>). The <italic>self-interest</italic> explanation, by contrast, argues that the demand for redistribution reflects individuals’ socioeconomic position and their exposure to social risks (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0958928712471225">Jæger, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0958928712471225">Kangas, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0958928712471225">Rehm, 2009</xref>). Consequently, individuals who are more exposed to social risks, for example, through unemployment, low income and poor health, have a larger incentive to support redistribution (which will benefit them) compared with individuals who are less exposed to social risks. Results from empirical research suggest that both explanations matter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0958928712471225">
<title>Contextual explanations</title>
<p>Theories emphasising the effect of contextual factors on the demand for redistribution come in different flavours. Some theories begin from the self-interest explanation and argue that individuals are utility-maximising agents who care about material self-interest and who seek to minimize exposure to social risks. These theories argue that the extent to which agents demand redistribution depends on the overall level of social risk in their country, agents’ position within the distribution of risks (as measured by, for example, their position in the income distribution), and their beliefs about how much they will gain from increasing (or decreasing) redistribution. Other theories emphasise how institutional differences across countries affect the demand for redistribution.</p>
<p>In political sociology, the <italic>governmental protection hypothesis</italic> argues that the welfare state is a form of social insurance that protects agents from adverse macroeconomic and social conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928712471225">Blekesaune, 2007</xref>). According to this hypothesis, agents seek to reduce exposure to social risks, which means that they will favour more redistribution in ‘bad’ times with high unemployment and poor economic conditions and will favour less redistribution in ‘good’ times with low unemployment and high economic growth (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471225">Dallinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0958928712471225">Sihvo and Uusitalo, 1995</xref>). As a consequence, the governmental protection hypothesis predicts an almost mechanical relationship between macroeconomic and social conditions and the demand for redistribution.</p>
<p>In political economy, the <italic>Meltzer–Richard</italic> (M-R) model seeks to explain the link between income inequality at the country level and the demand for redistribution at the individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0958928712471225">Meltzer and Richard, 1981</xref>). This theoretical model argues that most industrialized societies have a right-skewed income distribution in which mean income is higher than median income. In these societies, and holding other factors constant, utility-maximising agents will prefer more redistribution in order to reduce the gap between the mean and the median income and thus to maximise their own income. As a consequence, in a cross-national context the prediction from the M-R model is that, holding other factors constant, the demand for redistribution will be higher in societies with more income inequality and lower in societies with low income inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471225">Dallinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0958928712471225">Finseraas, 2009</xref>). More sophisticated versions of the M-R model have been proposed that emphasise the social insurance aspect of redistribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0958928712471225">Moene and Wallerstein, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0958928712471225">2003</xref>), the shape of the income distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0958928712471225">Lupu and Pontusson, 2011</xref>), and the mediating role of institutional and political factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0958928712471225">Bradley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0958928712471225">Iversen and Soskice, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, institutional theories argue that the size and organisation of the welfare state affects the demand for redistribution. According to welfare regime theory, popular demand for redistribution is a function of countries’ institutional arrangements (for example, the way the welfare state is organised) and their political and cultural history (for example, the power of left-wing parties and religious composition; for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0958928712471225">Esping-Andersen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0958928712471225">Jæger, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928712471225">Linos and West, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0958928712471225">Svallfors, 1997</xref>). Welfare regime theory identifies three proto-typical welfare regimes: the Social Democratic, the Liberal and the Conservative regime. The <italic>Social Democratic</italic> welfare regime is characterised by high social expenditure, generous benefits and services, high levels of income redistribution and low income inequality. The <italic>Liberal</italic> welfare regime, by contrast, is characterised by low social expenditure, targeted benefits and services, low levels of income redistribution and high income inequality. Finally, the <italic>Conservative</italic> regime is characterised by social insurance rather than universalism or residualism, medium social expenditure, and clear divisions in social risk coverage between well-protected ‘insiders’ with strong labour market attachment and poorly protected ‘outsiders’. Based on this typology, welfare regime theory predicts that, once in place, welfare regimes act as socialising forces that reproduce the demand for redistribution that legitimises a particular regime type. As a consequence, welfare regime theory predicts that the demand for redistribution will be relatively highest in the high-spending and comprehensive Social Democratic regime, lowest in the low-spending Liberal regime, and somewhere in-between in the Conservative regime.</p>
<p>To summarise, contextual explanations in political sociology and political economy suggest that macroeconomic and social conditions should lead to different demands for redistribution. Furthermore, institutional differences across countries, and notably the size of the welfare state, should also affect the demand for redistribution. Before presenting empirical hypotheses derived from these theoretical models, the next section reviews results from existing empirical research.</p>

<title>Results from previous research</title>
<p>Results from previous empirical research provide mixed support for the hypothesis that macroeconomic and social conditions affect the demand for redistribution. First, studies find that unemployment levels tend to be positively correlated with the demand for redistribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928712471225">Blekesaune, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928712471225">Blekesaune and Quadagno, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471225">Dallinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928712471225">Fraile and Ferrer, 2005</xref>). Second, studies find that economic growth, typically measured by change in GDP, is negatively correlated with the demand for redistribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471225">Dallinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928712471225">Dion and Birchfield, 2010</xref>). Third, studies find that income inequality, typically measured via the GINI coefficient, is negatively correlated with the demand for redistribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471225">Dallinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928712471225">Dion and Birchfield, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0958928712471225">Finseraas, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0958928712471225">1</xref></sup> Fourth, studies find that total social expenditure as a percentage of GDP is positively correlated with the demand for redistribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471225">Dallinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0958928712471225">Finseraas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0958928712471225">Jæger, 2006b</xref>). Results for the effects of unemployment levels and economic growth are in line with predictions from the governmental protection hypothesis. The positive effect of social expenditure on the demand for redistribution is consistent with welfare regime theory suggesting that welfare regimes shape public opinion, with high-spending countries fostering a higher demand for redistribution than low-spending countries. Finally, the negative effect of income inequality on the demand for redistribution is in contrast with expectations of the M-R hypothesis but, as argued, results differ depending on which research design is used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0958928712471225">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>The governmental protection hypothesis, the M-R model, and welfare regime theory suggest that macroeconomic and social conditions should affect the demand for redistribution. This paper includes five variables to capture cross-country differences in macroeconomic and social conditions: unemployment, consumer prices, economic growth (change in GDP), income inequality (as measured by the GINI coefficient), and total expenditure on social protection as a percentage of GDP. Unemployment, consumer prices, and economic growth capture macro conditions that may change at a comparatively fast pace and which may have an immediate impact on the demand for redistribution. As a consequence, and based on the governmental protection hypothesis, the likely scenario is that unemployment levels and consumer prices will have a positive effect on the demand for redistribution (thus reflecting a higher demand for redistribution in times with high unemployment and increasing consumer prices), while economic growth will have a negative effect (thus reflecting a lower demand for redistribution in good times). Furthermore, the M-R model predicts a positive effect of income inequality on the demand for redistribution (reflecting that utility-maximising agents seek to minimise the distance between the mean and the median income in their country). Finally, welfare regime theory predicts a positive effect of social expenditure on the demand for redistribution (thus reflecting that countries with high social expenditure instil in their populations a high demand for redistribution).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section7-0958928712471225">
<title>Data and variables</title>
<p>The paper analyses data from the ESS. The ESS is a comparative survey with representative samples of the adult population in more than 30 European countries. The present analysis includes data from 31 countries and from five ESS waves collected in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0958928712471225">2</xref></sup> The ESS is well-suited for this research because it includes an item measuring respondents’ support for redistribution in all five waves, thereby providing repeated cross-sectional data on popular demand for redistribution. Moreover, the ESS collects detailed individual-level information, which enables construction of socio-demographic groups that can be matched over time.</p>
<sec id="section8-0958928712471225">
<title>Constructing socio-demographic groups</title>
<p>A key assumption in this paper is that individuals with similar socio-demographic characteristics, for example, level of education, social class position and age, face similar social risks and, as a consequence, they are assumed to develop a similar demand for redistribution. This assumption is not unreasonable. For example, a literature in political sociology argues that social classes face different structural conditions and, as a consequence, they develop different demands for redistribution (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0958928712471225">Iversen and Soskice, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928712471225">Linos and West, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0958928712471225">Svallfors, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0958928712471225">2004</xref>). A literature in political economy argues that individuals with different levels of education and working in different industries face different exposure to global competition and, as a consequence, they develop different demands for distribution (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0958928712471225">Iversen and Soskice, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0958928712471225">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0958928712471225">Rehm, 2009</xref>). Finally, a literature argues that individuals belonging to different age groups, in particular net ‘receivers’ of benefits and services (for example, students and pensioners) and net ‘payers’ (for example, taxpayers currently active in the labour market), have different interests and opinions (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0958928712471225">Busemeyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0958928712471225">Goerres and Tepe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0958928712471225">Svallfors, 2008</xref>). Building on this literature, and in the absence of panel data at the level of individuals, this paper uses the ESS data to construct panel data at the level of socio-demographic groups comprised from individuals with identical socio-demographic characteristics (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0958928712471225">Girma, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0958928712471225">Verbeek, 1995</xref>). The idea is to construct socio-demographic groups that differ in regard to social risk exposure due to factors such as (lacking) educational qualifications, (precarious) labour market position and (old) age and, furthermore, to match these groups over time within countries.</p>
<p>The ESS data include information on respondents’ level of education (years of completed schooling), social class position (based on ISCO88 occupational codes) and age.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0958928712471225">3</xref></sup> This information can be used to construct a 3 × 3 × 3 classification of education, social class position and age, which results in 27 socio-demographic groups in each ESS country and time period. This classification is designed to maximise variation in social risk exposure across groups, while at the same time – and taking the typical sample size of each ESS country and wave into account (about 1000–2000 respondents) – ensuring that (almost) all 27 groups are represented in each country and time period.</p>
<p>Different criteria can be used to recode respectively education, social class and age into analytically meaningful groups. This paper relies on results from social stratification research to distinguish important socio-demographic groups that differ with regard to socioeconomic conditions, risks and interests (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928712471225">Erikson and Goldthorpe, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0958928712471225">Treiman and Ganzeboom, 2000</xref>). With regard to education, the threefold classification distinguishes respondents with up to and including 9 years of schooling (capturing respondents who completed primary education and who typically left school around age 16 years), respondents with 10–12 years of schooling (capturing respondents who completed secondary-level education, for example, high school) and respondents with more than 12 years of schooling (capturing respondents who completed some type of tertiary-level education, for example, university). With regard to social class, the classification relies on the widely used EGP social class scheme (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928712471225">Erikson and Goldthorpe, 1992</xref>) to map ISCO88 occupations into classes and to distinguish between the managerial class (EGP class I and II, that is, higher/lower-level managers), the middle class (EGP class III and IV, that is, routine non-manual occupations and the self-employed) and the working class (EGP class V–VII, that is, skilled and unskilled workers). Finally, with regard to age, the classification distinguishes respondents aged 18–35 years (that is, young people and people in the early stages of their career), aged 36–54 years (that is, people typically in the core labour force) and aged 55 years and up (that is, people late in their career and people who have left the labour market). With a total of 31 ESS countries (see Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0958928712471225">Table 1</xref> for a list of which countries participated in each ESS wave), 27 socio-demographic groups in each country, and five time points, the maximum number of observations which can be observed is 4185 (31 × 27 × 5). However, because not all countries participate in all ESS waves, and because not all socio-demographic groups are represented at each time point, the actual number of observations is about 3300. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0958928712471225">Table 1</xref> shows descriptive statistics for all variables used in the analysis.</p>

<title>Dependent variable</title>
<p>The dependent variable is based on an item asked in all five ESS waves that taps respondents’ demand for redistribution. Respondents were asked to state their level of agreement with the statement: ‘The government should take measures to reduce differences in income levels.’ The response categories are: (1) ‘disagree strongly’, (2) ‘disagree’, (3) ‘neither agree nor disagree’, (4) ‘agree’ and (5) ‘strongly agree’. The dependent variable used in the empirical analysis aggregates respondents’ answers on this item by socio-demographic group (‘Don’t know’ answers were treated as missing values), thus resulting in a dependent variable that captures mean demand for redistribution in each socio-demographic group in each ESS wave.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0958928712471225">
<title>Explanatory variables</title>
<p>Two sets of explanatory variables are included in the analysis: group-level variables and country-level variables. The group-level variables include each socio-demographic group’s score on an ESS item measuring subjective left/right orientation (based on a 1–10 scale with higher values indicating more left-wing orientation) and each group’s mean household income (a 1–10 scale measuring income in Euros). These variables are not of substantive interest but are included as controls.</p>
<p>The analysis includes five country-level variables. Each variable is measured in each year of ESS data collection, that is, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010 (some exceptions apply due to data limitations; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0958928712471225">Appendix Table 1</xref> for detailed information). Since the period of observation is comparatively short (2002–2010), the analysis includes country-level variables that may be expected to vary over a relatively short period of time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0958928712471225">4</xref></sup> The first variable measures the unemployment rate as a percentage of the total labour force (data from Eurostat). The second variable measures the annual change in the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) relative to the base year 2005 (with 2005=100; data from Eurostat). The third variable measures the percent change in GDP relative to the previous year (data from Eurostat). These three variables are included to capture short-term change in macroeconomic conditions. The fourth variable measures the GINI coefficient, that is, the level of income inequality (data from the World Inequality Database, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0958928712471225">United National University – World Institute for Development Economics Research, 2008</xref>). Finally, the fifth variable measures total expenditure on social protection as a percentage of GDP (data from Eurostat). Variables four and five are intended to capture variation in the overall level of income inequality and social protection. All empirical analyses also include dummy variables for survey year to capture time trends.</p>

<title>Analytical approach</title>
<p>The objective of the empirical analysis is to identify the effect of macroeconomic and social conditions on the demand for redistribution. Unlike previous comparative research that analyses individual-level outcomes, this paper uses socio-demographic groups as the lowest unit of observation. The main advantage of the synthetic cohort design proposed in the paper is that it provides panel data at the level of socio-demographic groups (up to five observations for each socio-demographic group). Furthermore, the design facilitates panel data at the level of countries because, in addition to varying across countries, the country-level variables also vary over time within countries. The main inferential challenge is that the observed country-level variables are likely to be correlated with unobserved characteristics of countries that also affect the demand for redistribution. For example, the unemployment rate in a country is likely to be correlated with the economic situation, the generosity of unemployment benefits and the overall structure of the labour market; all of which are factors that most probably also affect the demand for redistribution. As a consequence, it is difficult to isolate the effects of observed country-level variables from the effect of omitted country-specific characteristics that are correlated with the observed country-level variables.</p>
<p>This paper uses a fixed effect approach to address the problem of bias from omitted country-level variables. To illustrate how this approach works, consider the following multilevel regression model</p>

In addition to these observed variables, the model includes the overall intercept α, the country-specific effect <italic>c<sub>j</sub></italic>, the group-specific effect <italic>g<sub>ij</sub></italic> and the residual error term <italic>ϵ<sub>ijt</sub></italic>. Note that apart from the time dimension captured by subscript <italic>t</italic>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0958928712471225">equation 1</xref> describes a multilevel model similar to those used in most previous research.</p>
<p>The objective is to estimate the effect of the country-level variables on the demand for redistribution, that is <italic>β</italic>
<sub>2</sub>. A major inferential challenge when estimating <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0958928712471225">equation 1</xref> is that estimates of the effect of the country-level variables will be biased if the country-level variables <italic>z<sub>jt</sub></italic> are correlated with the country-specific effect, <italic>c<sub>j</sub></italic>. Intuitively, if such a correlation exists, the country-level variables capture not only their own effect, but also the effect of the omitted, country-specific characteristics summarized in <italic>c<sub>j</sub></italic>.</p>
<p>Multilevel data and methods allow researchers to include <italic>c<sub>j</sub></italic> in the analysis. Almost all previous research estimates a random effect specification of the multilevel model in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0958928712471225">equation 1</xref> (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928712471225">Blekesaune and Quadagno, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471225">Dallinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0958928712471225">Finseraas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0958928712471225">Jæger, 2006b</xref>). This specification treats the country-specific effect <italic>c<sub>j</sub></italic> as a latent variable and makes it possible to estimate the proportion of the total variance in the demand for redistribution that lies between countries. However, the random effect specification estimates the effects of the (group and) country-level variables on the demand for redistribution under the assumption that the country-specific effect <italic>c<sub>j</sub></italic> is uncorrelated with the observed country-level variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0958928712471225">Wooldridge, 2002</xref>). If this assumption does not hold, estimates of the effect of the country-level variables will be biased. Furthermore, since this assumption is unrealistic in most empirical applications, a more realistic identification strategy is desirable.</p>
<p>The fixed effect approach proposed in this paper addresses the problem of bias from omitted variables by controlling directly for the group- and country-specific effects (<italic>g<sub>ij</sub></italic> and <italic>c<sub>j</sub></italic>). A straightforward way of estimating the multilevel model in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0958928712471225">equation 1</xref> as a fixed (rather than a random) effect model is to include dummy variables for each socio-demographic group in each country (thus accounting for <italic>g<sub>ij</sub></italic>) and dummy variables for each country (thus accounting for <italic>c<sub>j</sub></italic>). This setup, which is known as the least squares dummy variable (LSDV) estimator, requires just over 800 dummy variables to account for the group fixed effects and 30 dummy variables to account for the country fixed effects (omitting one country as the reference group). In this model, the effects of the group- and country-level variables (<italic>β</italic>
<sub>1</sub> and <italic>β</italic>
<sub>2</sub>) are separately identifiable from the fixed effects <italic>g<sub>ij</sub></italic> and <italic>c<sub>j</sub></italic> because the group- and country-level variables, in addition to varying over groups and countries, also vary over time. This is not case with cross-sectional data in which it is not possible to include both the group-/country-level variables and the group-/country fixed effects when estimating <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0958928712471225">equation 1</xref>.</p>
<p>Given the comparatively small sample size in this paper, the LSDV approach is not practical. Instead, the paper uses a two-step procedure that yields the same result but is more practical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0958928712471225">Wooldridge, 2002</xref>). The first step is to rearrange the data in order to remove the group-specific fixed effect <italic>g<sub>ij</sub></italic>. Specifically, for each of the three variables measured at the group level (demand for redistribution, left/right scale and income), the first step requires subtracting the over-time mean for each socio-demographic group in each time period (that is, in effect ‘de-meaning’ each variable). This transformation, which is known as the within-group transformation, yields the same result as including dummy variables for each socio-demographic group in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0958928712471225">equation 1</xref>. The second step is to estimate <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0958928712471225">equation 1</xref> using the transformed group-level variables and including the country-level variables and dummy variables for each country (thus accounting for country fixed effects). This model specification estimates the effect of the group- and country-level variables on the demand for redistribution while controlling explicitly for both the group and country fixed effects. Furthermore, since the fixed effect multilevel model accounts explicitly for <italic>g<sub>ij</sub></italic> and <italic>c<sub>j</sub></italic>, estimates of the effect of the group- and country-level variables are unaffected by these variables being correlated with the group and country fixed effects.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The results section is divided into two parts. The first part presents results from a simple variance decomposition analysis that assesses the relative importance of cross-country and cross-time variation in the demand for redistribution. The second part presents results from multilevel regression models of the demand for redistribution on the group- and country-level variables. In addition to presenting results from the preferred fixed effect specification of the multilevel model, this section also presents results from an ordinary least squares (OLS) and a random effect specification of the model. Results from different model specifications are included in order to gauge the importance of the implicit assumptions inherent in different modelling strategies and their implications for substantive conclusions.</p>
<p>The first part of the empirical analysis presents results from the simple variance decomposition analysis. The idea is to obtain estimates of the relative importance of variation <italic>across countries</italic> in the demand for redistribution versus variation <italic>within</italic> socio-demographic groups over time. The variance decomposition model is a three-level random intercept specification of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0958928712471225">equation 1</xref> with no explanatory variables. This model decomposes the total variance in the demand for redistribution into three components: (1) variation across countries (that is, variance attributable to <italic>c<sub>j</sub></italic>), (2) variation within socio-demographic groups over time (that is, variance attributable to <italic>g<sub>ij</sub></italic>) and (3) variation across socio-demographic groups and countries (residual variation attributable to <italic>ϵ<sub>ijt</sub></italic>). The variance decomposition analysis shows that variation across countries is estimated to account for 47.8 percent of the total variance in the demand for redistribution, while variation within socio-demographic groups is estimated to account for 14.3 percent. Consequently, factors specific to countries (economic, political, social, cultural, and so on) explain about half of the total variance in the demand for redistribution, while factors specific to socio-demographic groups explain a much smaller (but non-trivial) part of this variation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0958928712471225">5</xref></sup> This result is of theoretical interest but also, as will become evident below, of conceptual interest because it demonstrates which sources of variation are used in different specifications of the multilevel model obtained in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0958928712471225">equation 1</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0958928712471225">Table 2</xref> shows results from regression models predicting the demand for redistribution as a function of the group- and country-level variables. The table shows estimates from three specifications of the multilevel model: OLS, random effect and fixed effect. The OLS model pools data from all five ESS waves and uses all available variation in the data, that is, variation across countries, groups and time. The OLS model, however, does not distinguish variation arising from different levels of nesting in the ESS data. In the OLS model, results for all country-level variables except social expenditure are in line with theoretical expectations: higher unemployment, consumer prices and income inequality are associated with a higher demand for redistribution, while higher economic growth is associated with a lower demand. The effect of social expenditure is negative, thus suggesting that high-spending countries have a lower demand for redistribution than low-spending countries. This result is in contrast with welfare regime theory, but it could reflect that individuals and groups prefer lower taxes and less redistribution to the higher taxes required to finance higher social spending. Results for the group-level variables fit theoretical expectations and results from previous research: being placed more to the left on the left–right political scale is associated with a higher demand for redistribution, while having a higher income is associated with a lower demand.</p>

<p>Results from the random effect specification also shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0958928712471225">Table 2</xref> are similar to the simple variance decomposition model presented above, with the difference being that the random effect model now includes explanatory variables. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0958928712471225">Table 2</xref> shows that the explanatory variables accounts for only a minor portion of the baseline differences in the demand for redistribution within groups and between countries (estimates of the share of the total variance that is attributable to respectively groups and counties decreases from 14.3 percent to 12 percent and from 47.8 percent to 41.8 percent). Furthermore, results for the country-level level variables now indicate that unemployment and consumer prices are unrelated to the demand for redistribution (results for the other country-level variables are similar to those reported for the OLS specification). Substantively, this result suggests that cross-country differences in unemployment rates and consumer prices are somehow linked with unobserved country-specific characteristics, and when the cross-country variance arising from these unobserved characteristics is taken into account, differences in unemployment rates and consumer prices do not have an independent effect on the demand for redistribution.</p>
<p>The fixed effect model is arguably the most robust among the three model specifications presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0958928712471225">Table 2</xref>. The fixed effect model is robust because it controls directly for the group- and country-specific fixed effects, thus explicitly accounting for the fact that idiosyncratic features of groups and countries may affect the demand for redistribution. Results from the fixed effect model suggest, first, that the level of unemployment does not affect the demand for redistribution. This result is in contrast with the governmental protection hypothesis and previous cross-sectional research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928712471225">Blekesaune, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928712471225">Blekesaune and Quadagno, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471225">Dallinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928712471225">Fraile and Ferrer, 2005</xref>). However, the results may reflect that, after controlling for country-specific characteristics that are correlated with the unemployment level and captured by the country fixed effects (for example, labour market regulation and the generosity of unemployment benefits), the unemployment level in itself does not affect the demand for redistribution.</p>
<p>Second, there is evidence of a negative effect of consumer prices on the demand for redistribution. Rather than demanding more redistribution in situations with high consumer prices, as suggested by the governmental protection hypothesis (and results from the OLS model), results instead suggest that the public demands less redistribution. An explanation of this finding might be that, in situations with high consumer prices, agents prefer to pay less tax (and keep more of their own income to cover increased costs of living) rather than to pay more tax to fund redistribution and better social protection. Consequently, even though the final level of social protection may be the same in either scenario (paying less tax and buying social protection versus paying more tax and receiving state-sponsored social protection), the results are consistent with the idea that agents prefer to keep a larger share of their own income.</p>
<p>Third, the results from the fixed effect model suggest that there is a negative effect of economic growth on the demand for redistribution. The standardized coefficient shows that an increase in economic growth of one standard deviation is associated with a decline in the demand for redistribution of almost 8 percent of a standard deviation. This result is in line with the governmental protection hypothesis that suggests that agents are less exposed to social risks (unemployment, income loss, and so on) in good times than in bad times and, as a consequence, they request less government redistribution and social protection. This result also fits with previous cross-sectional research, most of which reports a negative effect of economic growth on the demand for redistribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471225">Dallinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928712471225">Dion and Birchfield, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Fourth, results suggest that higher income inequality has a positive effect on the demand for redistribution. This result supports the M-R model, which argues that, as a consequence of the large distance between the median and the mean income in highly unequal societies, utility-maximising agents have an incentive to demand more redistribution to promote their relative position within the income distribution. Several previous studies find a similar result (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471225">Dallinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928712471225">Dion and Birchfield, 2010</xref>; note 1).</p>
<p>Finally, unlike in the OLS and random effect models, there is no evidence in the fixed effect model that social expenditure as a percentage of GDP has any effect on the demand for redistribution. Previous studies mostly report a positive effect of social expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712471225">Dallinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0958928712471225">Finseraas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0958928712471225">Jæger, 2006b</xref>), which is assumed to capture a socializing effect of welfare regimes on popular demand for redistribution. The insignificant result in the fixed effect model may reflect that social expenditure is a proxy measure for the ‘size’ of the welfare state. Thus, social expenditure is correlated with many other economic, political and institutional factors whose effects on the demand for redistribution are picked up by the country fixed effects. Once these characteristics are controlled, social expenditure has no independent effect on the demand for redistribution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0958928712471225">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Theories in political sociology and political economy argue that macroeconomic and social conditions affect the demand for redistribution. However, previous research that tests these theories relies on cross-sectional data and designs that include limited between-country variation and which are susceptible to bias from omitted country-level variables. This paper uses a synthetic cohort design to match socio-demographic groups over time that are observationally identical with regard to level of education, social class position and age. This synthetic cohort design provides panel data at the level of socio-demographic groups which, combined with a fixed effect approach, increases sample size and enables more robust statistical inference than that used in previous research.</p>
<p>The paper uses five country-level indicators to capture macroeconomic and social conditions (unemployment, consumer prices, economic growth, income inequality and social expenditure). Based on analyses of five waves of ESS data, the main conclusion is that macroeconomic and social conditions do affect the demand for redistribution, but also that results depend on the assumptions imposed by different model specifications. In accordance with theoretical expectations, the analysis shows that high economic growth decreases the demand for redistribution, while high income inequality increases this demand. These findings fit the governmental protection hypothesis arguing that agents are risk-averse and that they respond to good economic times by preferring less redistribution and to high inequality by preferring more distribution. Results also show that the unemployment rate and social expenditure has no effect on the demand for redistributions and, furthermore, that higher consumer prices are associated with a lower demand for redistribution. The latter result might reflect that when prices are high risk-averse agents themselves prefer to buy protection against social risks rather than to have the state facilitating this protection through higher taxes. Together, the empirical analysis provides some support for claims in political sociology and political economy that popular demand for redistribution depends both on individual and contextual risk factors.</p>
<p>Several limitations in the present analysis and perspectives for future research should be highlighted. First, the paper uses pseudo panel data and not real panel data. Unfortunately, there is no way of correcting this limitation because none of the major comparative surveys include repeated observations of the same individuals. Second, the time horizon in the paper is rather short (2002–2010). Although there are other datasets that go further back in time (for example, the ISSP surveys go back to the 1980s), the pseudo panel approach used in the paper rests on the assumption that the socio-demographic groups are comparable over time. A longer time horizon might compromise this assumption due to change over time in the composition of the socio-demographic groups. Future research should explore the feasibility of applying the pseudo cohort approach to a longer time horizon. Future research should also adopt a dynamic approach to analysing the effect of macroeconomic and social conditions on the demand for redistribution. Most research, including the present analysis, is static in the sense that it assumes that the demand for redistribution is driven exclusively by present macroeconomic and social conditions. A more realistic approach would treat the demand for redistribution in the present as a function of both past and present macroeconomic and social conditions.</p>

Results from studies that analyse aggregate data are inconclusive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0958928712471225">Bowles and Gintis (2000)</xref> find a negative relationship between income inequality and the demand for redistribution; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0958928712471225">Meltzer and Richard (1981)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0958928712471225">Aalberg (2003)</xref> find a weak positive relationship; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0958928712471225">Lübker (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0958928712471225">Kenworthy and McCall (2008)</xref> find no relationship. Studies that analyse the effect of income inequality on actual government redistribution (rather than public opinion) mostly find a positive effect of income inequality on redistribution (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0958928712471225">Alesina and Glaeser, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0958928712471225">Bénabou, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0958928712471225">Moene and Wallerstein, 2001</xref>).</p>

<p>The ESS records respondents’ household income using a 12-point bracketed scale (10-point scale in the 2008 and 2010 waves). Unfortunately, the income scale measures household income in absolute amounts (income brackets in Euros), which means that income distributions differ significantly across European countries. This design makes the income variable problematic in a comparative context. Instead, this paper uses the income variable as a control variable at the level of socio-demographic groups. This approach is less problematic since most of the substantive analysis is based on a fixed effect design that relies exclusively on within-group (and country) variation in income.</p>

<label>4.</label>
<p>Previous studies have included variables capturing countries’ political institutions, healthcare and educational systems, and religious and ethnic fractionalization. Unfortunately, there is insufficient cross-time variation in these variables to be useful in the present analysis. In addition, cross-national differences in more or less stable country characteristics are captured by the country fixed effects that are included in the empirical analysis.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0958928712471225">
<label>5.</label>
<p>Estimates from the variance decomposition analysis differ quite a lot from those presented in previous research (most previous studies find that variation between countries explains about 5–15 percent of the total variance in the demand for redistribution and other types of welfare attitudes). The reason why results differ is that the lowest unit of observation in the present analysis is socio-demographic groups rather than, as in previous studies, individuals.</p>

<p>The p value for the effect of social expenditure is 0.111. Consequently, given that the fixed effect model relies exclusively on cross-time variation (and discards all cross-sectional variation), it is possible that the effect of social expenditure would have been statistically significant with a larger sample size. Nevertheless, even if significant the effect of social expenditure is negative. As argued above, this result might reflect that agents prefer lower taxes and less redistribution to higher taxes and more redistribution.</p>
