<p>Civilization marks its beginnings to the moment, more than 14,000 years ago, humans first gathered into settlements, leaving behind their days as nomadic hunters and gatherers. Known as sedentarization, this phenomenon likely debuted in the Fertile Crescent of the Levant, followed by the Yangtze and Yellow River basins two millennia later, and eventually in Mexico, South America, and finally the eastern shores of the United States. At each point sprang up villages, cities, and, eventually, nations. Over thousands of years, fixed boundaries were codified and defended, often at great cost. Many borders have been drawn wisely, following natural formations like barriers of mountains or rivers. Many follow linguistic, ethnic, religious, or tribal boundaries. But others have been haphazardly imposed by outsiders with the stroke of a pen on some distant map. As empires fell and the speed of global trade and migration increased, boundaries became complex barriers to the free movement of people and ideas. Today, some provoke violent wars and revolutions, while others can be breached by brave individuals and new technologies—issues that <italic>World Policy Journal</italic> explores in our spring cover theme.</p>
<p>We begin with the Big Question—a selection of international experts reflecting on the central issue of just how boundaries should be drawn. Then, the secretary general of the Council of Europe, Thorbjørn Jagland, who also serves as chair of the Norwegian committee that awards the Nobel Peace Price, argues that leaders should think beyond borders, harnessing diversity to strengthen transnational communities. Our Map Room traces the emergence of the fabled Northwest Passage. As Arctic waters open up, northern countries are vying for oil that’s no longer imprisoned beneath a mantle of ice. Next, Carol Bellamy, longtime head of UNICEF, the Peace Corps, and now both the International Baccalaureate and the Global Partnership for Education, makes a passionate plea to prioritize the education of migrant children. For our Anatomy, we use a five-dimensional scale to rank the World’s Most Isolated Countries. Then, Courtney Brooks investigates the concept of just what constitutes a nation and answers the central question of who should sit in judgment. Veteran author and <italic>New York Times</italic>correspondent Marvine Howe, from her perch in Portugal, uncovers the role of Muslims on the Iberian Peninsula—those who are staying and especially those who are leaving. For our Conversation, we talk with billionaire Mo Ibrahim, the Sudanese telecom pioneer whose enterprises and eponymous foundation traverse borders across Africa.</p>
<p>In our Portfolio, the extraordinary Philippine photojournalist Veejay Villafranca captures the hunger crisis on the island of Mindanao, a legacy of decades of secular and religious conflict. Ned Parker, veteran Middle East correspondent for the <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> and <italic>World Policy Journal</italic> contributor, joins Reuters’ Raheem Salman to provide a groundbreaking profile of Iraq’s prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki—and the potentially malevolent prototype he represents for post-Arab Spring Islamist leaders. In a special roundtable, award-winning author and publisher Dave Eggers gathers three young Saudis—producer Mamdouh al-Harthy, photojournalist and musician Hasan Hatrash, and film director Haifaa al-Mansour—to discuss the roles of religion, art, and politics in the Middle East. From Brussels, Hungarian economist Zsolt Darvas describes southern Europe’s dismal predicament and presents his plan to exit the economic mess and unite a continent still divided between north and south. Khristina Narizhnaya chronicles Russian emigration trends, revealing a sick nation losing its best and brightest. And the rise of Pentacostalism as a political and social force in Europe is the focus of Damaso Reyes. Finally, in his Coda, <italic>World Policy Journal</italic> editor David A. Andelman examines the broad spectrum of justice and judicial systems, the first in his series evaluating how effectively government mechanisms respond to the needs and desires of the people they serve.</p>
