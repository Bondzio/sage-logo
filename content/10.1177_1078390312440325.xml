<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Acutely ill psychiatric patients experience symptoms and take medications that increase their risk of both falling and choking; however, nurses and other caregivers may not be keenly aware of these risks. Our experiences as clinicians and administrators at New Hampshire Hospital (NHH) have led us to recognize the prevalence and seriousness of episodes of falling and choking in the acute inpatient setting. We are committed to heightening risk awareness and promoting education and training, in an effort to mitigate these two serious and potentially fatal risks for psychiatric inpatients. NHH is a publicly funded, acute psychiatric inpatient facility that is affiliated with Dartmouth Medical School. It is the only state hospital in New Hampshire, serving children and adults of all ages, and admits more than 2,300 patients a year. The majority of patients are admitted involuntarily, directly from community hospital emergency rooms, because of dangerousness resulting from mental illness. More than 700 inpatients fell at NHH over the past 4 years (financial years [FYs] 2008-2011). Seventeen of those falls resulted in injuries that required more than first aid. The hospital’s fall rate for those 4 years is slightly higher than the Joint Commission’s National Benchmark Rate (3.02/1,000 patient-days) set for all hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390312440325">Joint Commission Resources, 2007</xref>). Over the same 4-year period (FYs 2008-2011), 33 NHH patients choked on food, and one of those patients died.</p>
<p>A review of the literature on falls reveals that the following are associated with increased risk of falling:</p>
<list id="list1-1078390312440325" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Prior fall history</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Deficits in gait and balance</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Issues with lower extremities</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Confusion/cognitive impairment</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Use of sedatives and hypnotics</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Need for assistance with activities of daily living</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Use of an assistive device (walker, wheelchair, cane)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Visual deficits</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Studies have identified falls as a major safety concern in the acute psychiatric setting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078390312440325">Blair and Gruman (2005)</xref> estimated that fall rates for inpatient psychiatric units can be three to four times higher than rates in general hospitals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078390312440325">Knight and Coakley (2010)</xref> reported that complex medication regimens, initiated to manage symptoms of acute psychiatric illnesses, can contribute to physiological instability that may not be easily identified by clinicians. In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078390312440325">Harlein, Haifens, Dassen, and Lahmann (2011)</xref>, patients with cognitive impairments were found to be three times more likely to fall than those without cognitive impairment. According to the widely used Hendrich II Fall Risk Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078390312440325">2006</xref>), patients who are confused, disoriented, or impulsive are considered to be at high risk of falling. Symptomatic depression, prescribed benzodiazepines, and/or antiepileptics increase the risk even more. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390312440325">Estrin, Goetz, Hellerstrein, Bennet-Staub, and Seirmarco (2009)</xref>, “there is a lack of well-researched and validated fall risk models specifically developed for populations of psychiatric patients” (p. 1245). Perhaps for this reason, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390312440325">Edmonson, Robinson, and Hughes (2011)</xref> developed a fall-risk scale, specifically for use in inpatient psychiatric settings, that takes into consideration the following factors that increase the risk of falling in psychiatric inpatients:</p>
<list id="list2-1078390312440325" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Ambulatory nature of psychiatric units</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Loss of appetite, inadequate nutrition, and poor eating habits</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Sleep deprivation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Anxiety, restlessness, and/or agitation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Diagnosis of depression or psychosis</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Medications that cause orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and/or decreased alertness</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Labile mental status, which can affect judgment and interpretation of environmental hazards</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Interventions designed to prevent falls often consist of medication review, coupled with environmental and physical assessments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078390312440325">Knight and Coakley (2010)</xref> reported a decrease in fall rates after implementing a program that included careful daily assessment of vital signs, initiation of a reporting tool, and a medication review process. In an effort to reduce falls and resulting injuries, exercise programs such as Tai Chi or low-impact aerobic movement have been successful in increasing strength and flexibility in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078390312440325">Li et al., 2008</xref>). However, many of these interventions are designed for community-dwelling individuals and not inpatients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390312440325">Akyol, 2007</xref>). Research reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078390312440325">Rao, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078390312440325">Sherrington et al., 2008</xref>) note that training to improve balance and/or muscle strengthening is preferable to exercise programs that focus only on walking. Partnering with allied health professionals can significantly improve outcomes for patients both during hospitalization and after discharge. Occupational therapists can be asked to assess a range of factors, including home safety, and to perform cognitive testing to assist medical providers in determining whether psychiatric inpatients are able to live independently. In the transition to discharge, occupational therapists often take patients into their community residence to assist with eliminating home hazards that could increase fall risk (e.g., removing throw rugs) and adding assistive devices that could reduce fall risk (e.g., installing grip bars adjacent to toilets and showers, adequate lighting, and raised toilet seats). In addition, referral to a physical therapist is crucial for gait assessment and exercise-program design.</p>

<title>Choking</title>
<p>Fall reduction has been one of the Joint Commission’s National Patient Safety Goals. Because many hospitals have prioritized these safety goals, nurses are more likely to be aware of fall risks than of risks for choking. Awareness of this issue was heightened at NHH by the tragic choking death of a patient. Clinicians realized that NHH staff members had been frequently recognized for life-saving events that involved patients who were choking on food.</p>
<p>A subsequent review found that the literature on the incidence and risk of choking in the psychiatric population is sparse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078390312440325">Hwang et al. (2010)</xref>, in a study on choking incidents in the Chutung Veterans General Hospital, noted that people with mental disorders experience a high incidence of choking, and they advocate heightened awareness. Studies in Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078390312440325">Corcoran &amp; Walsh, 2003</xref>), Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078390312440325">Fioritti, Giacotto, &amp; Melega, 1997</xref>), Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078390312440325">Yim &amp; Chong, 2009</xref>), and the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078390312440325">Craig, 1980</xref>) have confirmed Hwang’s concern, pointing out that patients with mental illnesses have between an 8- and 20-fold increased risk of choking than the general population. Another recent review of the literature and description of risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390312440325">de Nesnera &amp; Folks, 2010</xref>) showed that choking has been a recognized, although not highly publicized, cause of death in people with mental illness for many years.</p>
<p>There are many factors that increase a psychiatric patient’s risk of choking. The most common are the following:</p>
<list id="list3-1078390312440325" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Impaired swallowing</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dysphagia</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Poor dentition</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tachyphagia (rapid eating)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Comorbid neurological diseases, such as Parkinson’s</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tardive dyskinesia</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Physiological mechanisms associated with impaired swallowing include dopamine blockade, which produces central and peripheral impairment in swallowing, an impaired gag reflex, and/or anticholinergic effects leading to impaired esophageal motility. Medications with anticholinergic and dopamine blocking effects, such as those that cause extrapyramidal effects and parkinsonism, can increase choking risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078390312440325">Ruschena, et al., 2003</xref>). Lower potency antipsychotic medications have increased incidence of anticholinergic side effects, while higher potency antipsychotic medications cause more extrapyramidal side effects and parkinsonism. Some antipsychotic medications increase appetite and craving for food, leading to overeating and tachyphagia. Because tricyclic antidepressants have significant anticholinergic side effects, it can be assumed that they may increase choking risk in individuals with major depressive disorder who take these medications, but this potential risk is yet to be described in the literature. There has not been any evidence pointing to an increased risk of choking in patients on antiepileptic medications for treatment of mood disorders. Many individuals with severe mental illness (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder) have poor dentition (missing, broken, or very loose teeth), which makes chewing food well before swallowing increasingly difficult. The combination of dry mouth (due to anticholinergic effects of medications), parkinsonism, poor dentition, and tachyphagia places psychiatric inpatients at significant risk of choking.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390312440325">American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (n.d.)</xref> notes these general signs or symptoms of swallowing disorders that can lead to choking:</p>
<list id="list4-1078390312440325" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Coughing during or right after eating or drinking</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Wet or gurgly sounding voice during or after eating or drinking</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Extra effort or time needed to chew or swallow</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Food or liquid leaking from the mouth or getting stuck in the mouth</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Recurring pneumonia or chest congestion after eating</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Weight loss or dehydration from not being able to eat enough</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Strategies to minimize choking events in psychiatric inpatients include the following:</p>
<list id="list5-1078390312440325" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Assessing patients for a history of choking incidents and presence of swallowing problems</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Educating staff about patients who may be at higher risk of choking</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ensuring that all staff caring for patients are trained regularly in emergency first aid for choking victims, particularly the proper use of the abdominal thrust (commonly known as the Heimlich maneuver)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Minimizing polypharmacy of medications with anticholinergic and/or potent dopamine blocking properties</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>It is imperative that a referral to a speech language pathologist be made to evaluate individuals with any of the above signs. Professional evaluation can result in recommendations regarding posture, behavior, and oral movements during eating and drinking; enhanced medical testing; and specific food textures that are easier to swallow.</p>

<title>Education</title>
<p>Psychiatric nurses are well trained in the art and science of assessment, as well as in the common side effects of antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, and mood stabilizers. However, nursing students are not commonly taught that these side effects, in combination with symptoms of mental illness, create an especially high level of risk for the acute psychiatric patient to fall and/or choke on food. An informal survey of educators from several respected nursing schools in New Hampshire and Massachusetts revealed that this specific information is not routinely highlighted in psychiatric nursing curricula. A content review was conducted of 17 psychiatric nursing textbooks published over the past decade. A computer search used the Google Books website to search for “psychiatric nursing” textbooks and “preview page scans” to “search inside” for the words <italic>falls, fall risk, choking</italic>, and <italic>fast eating</italic>. Only two texts specifically mentioned the psychiatric patient’s increased risk for falls due to medications, and none mentioned the psychiatric patient’s increased risk for choking on food.</p>
<p>Psychiatric nursing curricula and employee training programs in acute psychiatric settings are, therefore, advised to stress that almost <italic>all</italic> inpatients are, by virtue of psychiatric symptoms and common treatment modalities, at higher than average risk of falling and/or choking. Efforts must be made to dispel the common misconception that falls are only a problem for older patients. A 20-year longitudinal study from the University of Pittsburgh (Mertz, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078390312440325">Simmons, 2010</xref>) showed that the likelihood of experiencing a fall within the past year does not vary with age. In addition, nursing staff must understand the importance of knowing how to effectively clear an airway and perform abdominal thrusts. These techniques are routinely taught as part of the American Heart Association’s Basic Life Support for Healthcare Providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390312440325">2011</xref>) Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) Program, and staff in acute psychiatric settings should be taught that they are much more likely to use techniques taught to help a choking patient than they are to resuscitate a patient in cardiac arrest. During the 4-year time period previously described (FYs 2008-2011), NHH staff used abdominal thrusts to rescue 33 patients from potentially lethal choking events. In contrast, staff used a hospital AED only once to rescue a patient from a potentially lethal cardiac event during that same 4-year period.</p>
<p>Nurses know about fall prevention techniques, such as teaching patients to use call bells and to ask for help, and they must remember to implement these and other prevention strategies that make sense in the psychiatric setting. Nurses must be taught to vigilantly observe patients for side effects of medications, especially after recent changes. Careful daily assessment and tracking of vital signs for patients on complex or new medication regimens may provide advance warning of physiological instability leading to falls. Nurses should be particularly concerned about postural blood pressure changes greater than 20 mmHg and pulse rates greater than 100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078390312440325">Knight &amp; Coakley, 2010</xref>). Timely referrals to occupational and physical therapy can also be extremely beneficial for patients. Teaching about these safety concerns is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>We have worked hard to increase staff awareness of the risks of falling and choking. We believe that many NHH patients have avoided injury largely because of the efforts of staff, who were aware of potential risks and paying close attention to the patients. Presentations about these risks have been held at nursing rounds and department meetings. Mandatory CPR classes and biannual refresher classes included special warnings, and information has been included in required annual employee education programs. The attention of staff and the public has been captured through new and innovative methods, such as having booths at the hospital’s wellness fairs, providing information about ways to prevent falls and choking. In addition, all new direct-care employees are taught about the increased risks of falling and choking during employee orientation. This information, as well as CPR, has recently been incorporated into classes on activities of daily living. Staff members are taught to be alert during meal times and to watch and listen carefully for signs that a patient may be choking. When teaching employees how to monitor vital signs, educators talk about the importance of notifying the nurse immediately if there is an elevated pulse rate or difference in postural blood pressure, because these findings may be warnings of impending fall risk. Staff members are also encouraged to survey the environment during safety checks to be sure that floors are not cluttered and access to bathrooms is unimpeded. Patients who have been assessed to be at risk of falling have blue stars beside their names on communication boards and on the doors to their rooms, which alerts all staff to their increased risk of falling.</p>
<p>Efforts to educate staff and raise awareness of the risks of falling and choking are having a positive effect. In FY 2011, NHH’s fall rate dropped almost a third, to 2.2 falls/1,000 patient-days, and there were only three injuries requiring more than first aid. In FY 2011, there were eight reported episodes of patients choking on food, and all eight patients were successfully rescued, with no adverse outcomes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The purposes of this article were to raise awareness of the special risks facing psychiatric patients, explain the reasons for those increased risks, and promote education and practices that will enhance patient safety in acute treatment settings. The unique issues related to risks of falling and choking have been largely unrecognized in inpatient psychiatric units. Yet the potential harm to patients makes these issues significant. It is clear that education about the risks of falling and choking needs to be highlighted in schools of nursing and reinforced during orientation and annually to employees. Further research needs to be conducted to identify which interventions are most effective in preventing falls and choking in patients with psychiatric disorders. There has been significant attention to falls in medical and long-term settings but less focus on specific interventions in psychiatric settings. The research related to choking is sparse. Increased education and research will contribute to increasing safety in inpatient psychiatric units.</p>
