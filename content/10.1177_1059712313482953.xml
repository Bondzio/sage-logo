<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>The enactive approach is a relatively young paradigm in cognitive sciences. Its name, for many, is associated with a revolutionary project that aims to transform in a radical way our understanding of mind and cognition. Bold theoretical moves such as the rejection of cognitive representations or the assumption of a deep (experiential) continuity between life and mind, among other conspicuous enactive ideas, justify this perception. When compared with the traditional cognitivist mainstream (both symbolic and connectionist), the enactive ideas and hypotheses look certainly radical and groundbreaking. Nonetheless, when we assume a broader historical paradigmatic perspective, including the long cybernetic tradition that preceded the emergence of cognitive sciences and that has developed in parallel to them until now (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059712313482953">Dupuy, 2009</xref>), the image of the enactive approach looks different. Put in the context of the paradigmatic shift that took place between first-order and second-order cybernetics (especially in the case of Maturana’s autopoietic theory), the enactive paradigm, so I will try to show in this work, appears rather like a conservative or revisionist project. Better said, it appears as a slightly hybrid paradigm, wherein original and progressive elements coexist with revisionist components.</p>
<p>Few could deny that one of the most direct antecedents of the enactive approach is Maturana’s autopoietic theory; a theory in which the very founder of the enactive approach, Francisco Varela, participated initially as main collaborator and spokesman.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1059712313482953">1</xref></sup> The core theses of autopoietic theory were incubated by Maturana mainly during the second half of the 1960s (well before the invention of the neologism ‘autopoiesis’ in 1970 and the collaboration with Varela)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1059712313482953">2</xref></sup> within the intellectual atmosphere of the so called ‘unfinished revolution’ of second-order cybernetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059712313482953">Müller &amp; Müller, 2007</xref>); a movement that shook the foundations of classic (first-order) cybernetics and opened at the same time a radically different path parallel to the then nascent cognitive sciences. Especially in Maturana’s version, this revolutionary process reached profound metaphysical and epistemological dimensions, challenging many of the (still) traditional views about living beings, cognition, evolution, mind and language.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1059712313482953">3</xref></sup> If one wanted to give an idea of the violence and scope of this revolutionary assault, one might briefly enumerate some of the most shocking theses in Maturana’s theory and wait for the reader’s reaction. Ready? (1) The nervous system is a closed system that neither receives nor processes information. (2) Our perception is not a representation of the external world. Not surprised yet? (3) Living beings live without the purpose of living. (4) Living beings can neither control their behaviour nor anticipate its results. Well, maybe something more metaphysical? (5) Nothing exists outside language. (6) Matter and time are linguistic constructions. There is more, but I will stop here.</p>
<p>Soon after having actively participated in the official appearance of autopoietic theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059712313482953">Maturana &amp; Varela, 1973</xref>), Varela started to feel intellectually unsatisfied with some autopoietic theses and initiated a slow process of revision and creative searching of new paths; a process that began with some methodological observations and conceptual reformulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059712313482953">Varela, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059712313482953">1981</xref>) and ended by abandoning or rejecting, on behalf of a new phenomenological alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059712313482953">Froese, 2011</xref>), several essential aspects of the original theory, whilst reintroducing elements that the revolutionary ardour of Maturana’s second-order cybernetics had attempted to eradicate (mainly the teleological and intentional interpretation of living beings). The final result was a whole new (and very original indeed) theoretical and reflective approach about life, cognition and consciousness – the enactive paradigm.</p>
<sec id="section2-1059712313482953">
<title>1.1 Purpose and scope of the paper</title>
<p>Many are the merits and potentialities of the enactive paradigm in cognitive sciences, many its virtues and, for the same reasons, many its followers and representatives. Yet here I am not going to talk about that. Instead, I want to offer an alternative interpretation of the enactive approach as a research program.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1059712313482953">4</xref></sup> An interpretation that does not aim to reveal any ‘truth’ about the enactive approach, but only contribute to a better understanding of its identity as a research program, its present and its possible future challenges.</p>
<p>If in this paper I contend that the enactive approach, <italic>when compared with one of its main theoretical roots</italic> (i.e., Maturana’s autopoietic theory), looks rather like a revisionist program, what I mean is exactly that <italic>and nothing more than that</italic>. Thus, although I have my own evaluation about the enactive approach, in this paper I will not attach any value judgment to its relative revisionist character. To start with, it should be clear enough that a revisionist program is not something necessarily bad (and that neither is a revolutionary program something necessarily good!); it all depends on the specific context within which the revision (or the revolution) takes place. Maybe the enactive approach is absolutely right in its revisionist attitude towards Maturana’s autopoietic theory, maybe not. Whatever the case, and interesting as the topic may be, in this paper I do not aim to address that discussion.</p>
<p>The main idea that I want to transmit here is that within the enactive paradigm there exists, <italic>along with</italic> a strong progressive vocation, a revisionist component that needs to be recognized and studied. Why? Basically because, according to my view, the said component generates a certain theoretical instability in the enactive paradigm that, in the long term, may be problematic for its own internal consistency as a research program.</p>
<p>The analysis that I will present, in a nutshell, is as follows. On the one hand, the enactive approach (in its canonical version) rejects the idea that biological systems operate on the basis of internal representations and information processing mechanisms (which is in complete agreement with autopoietic theses 1 and 2 aforementioned). On the other hand, enactive approach conceives of living beings as teleological adaptive systems, i.e., as autonomous agents capable of controlling and regulating their behaviour by means of mechanisms of anticipation and self-monitoring amongst others (a conception that is in complete disagreement with autopoietic theses 3 and 4 mentioned before). This latter idea about living beings, summarized in concepts such as <italic>agency</italic> or <italic>adaptivity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059712313482953">Di Paolo, 2005</xref>), seems to me revisionist because it contains all the basic ingredients (teleology, control, anticipation) that the conservative wing of embodied/enactive cognitive science – so called by those who claim to be radical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059712313482953">Chemero, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059712313482953">Hutto &amp; Myin, 2013</xref>) – uses for cooking its notion of <italic>minimal</italic> (action-oriented, goal-directed, context-dependent) <italic>internal representation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059712313482953">Clark, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059712313482953">Grush, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059712313482953">Wheeler, 2005</xref>, among others). My worry with this situation, as I see it, is whether the enactive approach (including its most radical versions)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1059712313482953">5</xref></sup> may or may not, consistently, remain loyal to its anti-representationalist dictum and, at the same time, subscribe to a conception of biological systems whose conceptual ingredients, when combined, seem to bring to life – almost as a natural result – the notion of internal representation.</p>
<p>As I will try to show toward the end of the paper, there seem to be within the enactive community, to say the least, ambiguous signals with respect to this situation. While some enactivists seem to declare holy war against any form of representationalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059712313482953">Hutto &amp; Myin, 2013</xref>), others seem to greet with friendly gestures the conceptual compatibility of certain forms of representationalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059712313482953">Thompson, 2011</xref>). And I interpret this ambiguity not as a mere accident or involuntary oversight, but rather as an internal instability that, given the revisionist component of the program, sooner or later had to appear. If this interpretation is more or less correct, then the enactive community has more than a minor task upon its shoulders. The task as I will outline it should, perhaps, be taken more as an opportunity to stabilize and consolidate the program than as a threat, or at least that is the sense that I would like to transmit here.</p>
<p>The first part of the paper will present, in a summarized way, the ontological framework of Maturana’s autopoietic theory, linking it, occasionally, with the broader context of the cybernetic tradition. The purpose of this section is simply to provide some conceptual elements to understand the anti-representational, anti-intentional, anti-teleological and anti-engineering stance of autopoietic theory. The second part of the paper will present, in a very general way, the manner in which Varela’s enactive approach departs from Maturana’s autopoietic theory (recovering the intentional, teleological and engineering interpretation of living beings), and the way in which this separation poses, at least potentially, some challenges for the internal coherence of the paradigm.</p>

<title>2 Ontological bases of Maturana’s autopoietic theory</title>
<p>Maturana’s autopoietic theory emerges within a broader ontological framework in which living beings are conceived as deterministic systems functionally closed on themselves. ‘A living being […] is a stable state-determined and strictly deterministic system closed on itself’, claims Maturana in 1970 (reprinted in Maturana &amp; Varela, 1980, p. 50).</p>
<p>While the deterministic conception of living beings was already well established in the cybernetic tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059712313482953">Ashby, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059712313482953">Rosenblueth, Wiener, &amp; Bigelow, 1943</xref>), the idea that the functional organization of biological systems constitutes a closed network of dynamic compensations was a breaking point with the typical functional analysis (in terms of inputs and outputs) held until then.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1059712313482953">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>These two ontological principles, i.e., determinism and functional closure, constitute the hard core of Maturana’s biological theory because they provide the proximate genus within which living beings are specified as autopoietic systems (i.e., they have ontological priority over the notion of autopoiesis). Let us examine first the deterministic conception of living beings.</p>
<sec id="section4-1059712313482953">
<title>2.1 Living beings as structurally determined systems</title>
<p>The principle of structural determinism, as such, is formally stated by Maturana during the 1970s and 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059712313482953">Maturana, 1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059712313482953">1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059712313482953">1987b</xref>). Nonetheless, one of the key ideas contained in said principle, at least in relation to living beings, had already appeared in Ashby early in 1960. The basic assumption, says Ashby in <italic>Design for a brain</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059712313482953">1960</xref>, p. 9), is that living beings behave in a certain way at a certain moment simply because their physical and chemical structure at that moment <italic>allows them no other action</italic> (Free quotation. Emphasis added). In the cybernetic thought of Ashby and Maturana, living beings are conceived as physical machines whose operational logic is strictly continuous with the rest of physical systems. Like the snow that melts under the sun, like the river that runs to the sea, living systems cannot avoid living how they live and doing what they do because, <italic>sensu stricto</italic>, they can never choose what to do.</p>
<p>In the same way, like the snow that melts without the purpose of melting and the river that runs without the purpose of running, so living beings live without the purpose of living. They are, like any physical system, purposeless systems. Maturana was clear about this point before coming to conceive of living beings as autopoietic systems: ‘A living being is not a goal-directed system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059712313482953">Maturana, 1970</xref>, reprinted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059712313482953">Maturana &amp; Varela, 1973</xref>, p. 50). Later, when the autopoietic theory was presented to the public, it just came to reinforce the same point. Excited about what he considered a major achievement, Sir Stafford Beer declared at that moment: ‘the […] reason why the concept of autopoiesis excites so much is that it involves the destruction of teleology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059712313482953">1980</xref>, p. 67).</p>
<p>Of course, Maturana was not destroying teleology (could anybody destroy it at all?), but only trying to reveal it as a property of certain explanatory artifices of the observer, and at the same time (and for the same reason), as an absent property in the operational dynamic of living beings as deterministic systems.</p>
<p>Independently of whether we accept or reject this deterministic ontology, it is important to clarify its meaning. Maturana does not deny that living beings behave in a distinctive way among physical systems; all that he says is that said distinctiveness is generated under conditions of structural determinism that are common to every physical system. A free falling pottery vase and a bird make contact with the ground in a very different way. The vase crashes into the floor and disintegrates while the bird gracefully lands with its legs. Where is the difference? One might be tempted to say that while the bird is able to control its position and movement according to a certain biological goal (say, to conserve its biological integrity), the vase is not. Or, that while the bird is an autonomous system (an agent), the vase is not. These interpretations, though attractive to commonsense, presume that the bird and the vase operate under different structural logics, which, according the cybernetic ontology above mentioned, is impossible. The principle of structural determination tells us that every physical system, natural or artificial, changes as it changes and does what it does following always its own structural legality. In other words, it tells us that every physical system is always a structurally autonomous system – a system whose changes of state follow the structural legality of the system itself, and where nothing external to the system can infiltrate such legality. Considered in their respective trajectories of structural changes, both the bird and the vase are systems equally autonomous. ‘But the vase cannot avoid crashing into the ground!’ the reader might object. ‘Yes’, the cyberneticist would reply, ‘so the bird cannot avoid landing in that way!’</p>
<p>This is also the spirit in the definition of living beings as ‘autopoietic <italic>machines</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059712313482953">Maturana &amp; Varela, 1973</xref>), which means that living beings are a peculiar closed organization (autopoietic organization) of trivially mechanical processes (machines).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1059712313482953">7</xref></sup> The main message in Maturana’s deterministic ontology is that living beings must be conceived of as ordinary natural systems, i.e., as systems without purpose or self-control. But that is not all. Living beings, adds Maturana, must also be understood as <italic>closed</italic> functional systems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1059712313482953">
<title>2.2 Living beings as functionally closed systems</title>
<p>Maturana claims that the functional organization of living beings must be understood as a closed circuit wherein there are no inputs or outputs. Maturana also claims that the observer, in her descriptions and explanations, must respect this closure and avoid introducing into the living being properties that may appear in her own cognitive domain as an observer. What does this mean? Put in a very simple way, it means that, when observing a living being, we must not take our point of reference as if it were the point of reference according to which the living being works. This is not because the living being has an alleged ‘own point of view’ (as the enactivist would like to say), but rather because the functional organization of the living being consists, essentially, in the maintenance of a set of internal correlations of activity in which, odd as it may sound, the section that we identify as ‘the environment’ or ‘the external world of the organism’ is, for the organism, only one more functional step, indistinguishable among many others, in its continuous dynamic of changes of state. Maturana, following this particular ontology, conceives of living beings not as systems open or oriented <italic>to</italic> the world but as systems that close on themselves <italic>through</italic> the world.</p>
<p>According to this idea, it is only from our perspective or descriptive domain that the living being appears ‘open’ to the world, having ‘sensorial windows’ through which it receives the necessary ‘inputs’ to compute a ‘response’. As observers, we behold the living being ‘in reference’ to an environment and we assume, as if it were a matter of fact, that the living being operates following said referential frame; we just ‘see’ the living being (its behaviour or its internal dynamic) as directed, oriented or referred to the environment. By doing this, continues Maturana, we open the closed functionality of the living system in a way that, although it may be convenient for us as observers, is entirely arbitrary for the system and its operational logic.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In the organization of the living systems the role of the effector surfaces [with or without a nervous system] is only to maintain constant the set states of the receptor surfaces, not to act upon an environment, no matter how adequate such a description may seem to be for the analysis of adaptation, or other processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059712313482953">Maturana, 1970/1980</xref>, p. 51)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Maturana contends that for the structural dynamic of the living being there is not such a thing as an environment upon which to act or respond, or with respect to which to maintain or improve its adaptation. What we see as the environment of the living being is something that, <italic>for the living being itself</italic>, proves to be operationally ‘transparent’ and does not exist as such.</p>
<p>Following this reasoning, Maturana claims that any intentional (in terms of directedness) or intensional (in terms of semantic content) description of living beings appears as conceptually empty and groundless. Nothing of what happens in the living being happens ‘in reference to’ or ‘directed at’ the environment. No state in the structural dynamic of the living being is ‘about’ any state of affairs in the environment. Almost needless to say, if living beings are conceived of as closed networks, the very idea that they work receiving informational inputs from the external world (upon which, eventually, they may elaborate representations, models or internal maps) does not make sense at all. Things do not get better either if we reduce the notion of information to a purely statistical concept (devoid of any semantic aspect) because, ultimately, the point at issue is not whether the environment in which we behold the organism is full of semantic information or full of information as plain co-variation (a difference that for Hutto’s radical enactive approach is crucial), but rather whether that which we identify as the organism’s environment exists or not as such to the organism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1059712313482953">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>3 From autopoietic machines to natural purposes: teleology and adaptivity</title>
<p>Francisco Varela, after collaborating with Maturana in the early 1970s, soon started to review the anti-teleological attitude of autopoietic theory. In 1979 and 1981, he is already negotiating the use of teleological explanations, mainly on behalf of a more pluralistic methodological attitude. Later, when Varela launches the enactive research program in cognitive sciences, teleology is already implicitly present in his conception of cognition, but not explicitly recognized as such. In fact, Varela remains during a long time, from the theoretical point of view, unaware of his own teleological ‘reconversion’. It is Evan Thompson, in a conversation in 1999, who forces him to confront the situation and triggers the explicit and definite reintroduction of teleology (the interesting details of this episode are given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059712313482953">Thompson, 2007</xref>, pp. 453–454). This episode coincides with the reading of Jonas and the final result is the article on ‘natural purposes’ co-authored with Weber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059712313482953">Weber &amp; Varela, 2002</xref>). At that point, the separation from the original anti-teleological formulation of autopoietic theory is total. Varela proposes a complete ontological reformulation of autopoiesis as <italic>embodied teleology</italic>: ‘if we follow the autopoiesis-Jonas inversion, if we accept autopoiesis as embodied teleology, we reintroduce the subject into biology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059712313482953">Weber &amp; Varela, 2002</xref>, p. 117). The reconversion is profound and its scope is deeply ontological: ‘Teleology, understood as <italic>intrinsic</italic> teleology, turns out to be [for the organism] its <italic>sine qua non</italic> condition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059712313482953">Weber &amp; Varela, 2002</xref>, p. 117. Emphasis partially modified).</p>
<p>Varela, somehow, revives what had been the original project of classic cybernetics, i.e., the naturalization of teleology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059712313482953">Rosenblueth, Wiener, &amp; Bigelow, 1943</xref>), but now the main inspiration is phenomenological, with Jonas as a hero – nothing to do with the cold mathematician’s eye of first-order cybernetics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1059712313482953">9</xref></sup> Nonetheless, all this work is just the first step, and the reintroduction of teleology is still in need of a full conceptual articulation. That is the moment at which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059712313482953">Di Paolo (2005)</xref> makes his contribution by introducing the notion of <italic>adaptivity</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section7-1059712313482953">
<title>3.1 Adaptivity: a Trojan horse for the enactive approach?</title>
<p>Taking into account the phenomenological inspiration of the enactive approach and the furious attack against classic cybernetics launched by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059712313482953">Jonas (1966)</xref>, the striking features of Di Paolo’s notion of adaptivity are its strong engineering accent and the use of the same classical notions of first-order cybernetics. First-order cybernetics (from the Greek <italic>kybernetes</italic>, which means steersman) saw living beings basically as control systems that regulate their own behaviour through monitoring mechanisms. Di Paolo presents adaptivity basically as ‘the capacity of an organism to <italic>regulate</italic> itself’, and specifies that the ‘different properties of adaptivity [are] <italic>selfmonitoring, control</italic> of internal regulation, and <italic>control</italic> of external exchanges’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059712313482953">Di Paolo, 2005</xref>, p. 430. Emphasis added).</p>
<p>One hears this and cannot avoid wondering whether the old cybernetic steersman, with his classical functions of controlling, monitoring and regulating, is not back again, this time dressed in costumes of enactive phenomenology.</p>
<p>The work of Di Paolo is important because it articulates and makes explicit what remains implicit in the reinterpretation of autopoiesis as <italic>embodied teleology</italic>. Like him, I also ‘suspect that some version of adaptivity was probably implicitly granted by Weber and Varela to autopoietic systems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059712313482953">Di Paolo, 2005</xref>, p. 439). And this sounds fairly familiar. It is the second time that someone else has to make explicit that Varela was assuming without full awareness. It was Thompson who realized that, with notions such as ‘original intentionality’, Varela had already introduced teleology in living beings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059712313482953">Thompson, 2007</xref>). Now it is Di Paolo who realizes that the normative character of the notion of sense-making presupposed adaptivity as a property of living beings. In other words, somehow, from the moment that Varela started to talk about sense-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059712313482953">Varela, 1984</xref>), he had already assumed, without acknowledging it, that living beings were <italic>teleological systems of control</italic>.</p>
<p>This is, nonetheless, the usual pattern in every revisionist movement. One starts by negotiating just a minimal point, by opening just a little window, and later one realizes that in order to remain internally coherent, one has to open another door and renegotiate further points, and so on. The hard problem is to know when, where and how to stop the negotiations. The enactive approach still conserves certain ‘non-negotiable’ epistemological principles that are in line with the autopoietic theory. One of the most important, in negative terms, is that cognition is fundamentally a non-representational phenomenon. According to the enactive dictum, the cognitive agent does not build representations of an external reality; it <italic>enacts</italic> or brings forth a world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059712313482953">Varela, Thompson, &amp; Rosch, 1991</xref>) according to its own way of sense-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059712313482953">Di Paolo, Rhode, &amp; De Jaegher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059712313482953">Thompson, 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, considering the history of the approach and the ‘unconscious’ manner in which it has introduced some of its key concepts, one might wonder whether the very notions so far ‘gained’ for the theory (e.g., teleology and adaptivity) do not presuppose in their turn a deeper, though largely unconscious, negotiation with the ‘representational enemy’. One wonders whether the enactive approach will be able or not, in the long term and for the sake of its own internal consistency, to resist the reincorporation of the notion of internal representation.</p>
<p>Maybe these considerations are just fictitious alarms, but we should pay attention to the deep ontological and epistemological assumptions entailed in notions such as teleology, adaptivity, control or regulation. They look innocent to the eye of the enactive scientist and philosopher today, but things can change. The image of living beings as teleological systems that control their behaviour is too close (I would say dangerously familiar) to some ‘embodied theories’ that see living beings in the same way and that posit the existence of ‘non-classical’ versions of internal representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059712313482953">Clark, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059712313482953">Clark &amp; Grush, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059712313482953">Grush, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059712313482953">Wheeler, 2005</xref>). What is more, there are already some worrying signals of initial negotiations with some of these theories. One of the main spokespersons of the enactive approach (actually one of its co-founders), Evan Thompson, has recently made some gestures that should active the alarms. Let’s review, to conclude, the case briefly.</p>

<sec id="section8-1059712313482953">
<title>3.2 Dangerous friendships</title>
<p>The emulation theory of cognition sees the nervous system as a control system that runs ‘internal models’ of action-perception. One of the key properties of these emulator systems is, according to Grush (the main spokesperson of the theory), the ability to anticipate and correct the final result of the organism’s movements. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059712313482953">Grush (2004)</xref> convincingly shows that these anticipatory mechanisms (if they are really anticipatory), qualify as genuine internal representations of motor activity. To anticipate and control a motor activity is, due to the necessary decoupling between the actual mechanism and the future result, to represent (or emulate) it.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059712313482953">Thompson (2011)</xref>, replying to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059712313482953">Foglia and Grush (2011)</xref> about whether the emulation theory of internal representation is compatible or not with the enactive approach, answers in this way:<disp-quote>
<p>Foglia and Grush […] ask whether I see the emulation account as a friendly clarification of my enactive account or as a challenge to it. The question arises because enactive accounts criticize representationalist theories of perception, and the emulation theory appeals to representations […]. The short answer to their question is that <italic>I welcome their account and see it as a friendly supplement</italic> […] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059712313482953">Thompson, 2011</xref>, p. 193. Emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The reason why Thompson, allegedly an anti-representationalist, accepts the Grush’s version of internal representation is given immediately in the next paragraph:<disp-quote>
<p>I argue against representationalist theories that separate perception and action, instead of recognizing their constitutive interdependence, and that neglect the ways autonomous agents bring forth or enact meaning in perception and action […]. Since the emulation theory does not require these typical features of representationalism, my objections to representationalism need not apply to the emulation theory. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059712313482953">Thompson, 2011</xref>, p. 194)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Thompson is here qualifying and distinguishing different kinds of representationalisms, making clear that he does not reject representationalism <italic>per se</italic> but just one of its versions. He rejects those representationalist theories that separate perception and action without recognizing their constitutive interdependence, and that neglect the way in which autonomous agents enact meaning in perception and action. Since, according to his view, the emulation theory is not based on these (wrong) theoretical assumptions, the emulation theory can be considered as a <italic>friendly</italic> representationalist theory of cognition.</p>
<p>Hearing Thompson’s words, it is not hard to imagine the way in which a smart and opportunist representationalist could dress up her theory so as to appear entirely innocent to the enactive community. After claiming that the nervous system builds and manipulates representations, one would just need to add that such representations do not separate perception and action in the organism but, on the contrary, contribute to their articulation, and that the meaningful content of such representations is not something passively received as a given product but rather something enacted by the very constitutive interdependence between perception and action. To make Thompson really happy, one could finish by saying that the way in which these neural representations emerge, i.e., as enactive processes, reveals and expresses the <italic>autonomy</italic> of the organism as a genuine cognitive agent.</p>
<p>By accepting the emulation theory of cognition, Thompson accepts tacitly the idea that the nervous system works as a representational system. He only seems to have some doubts about the specific way in which the internal representations are actually realized in the brain. The engineering fashion of the control theory embraced by Grush, with its neat distinction between ‘control’ and ‘plant’ sounds problematic to his ears. He prefers to see the nervous system as a complex self-organizing dynamical system (à la <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059712313482953">Kelso, 1995</xref>) without establishing hierarchies between ‘controllers’ and ‘plants’. Nonetheless, this is a minor architectonic point and the main concession is already done.</p>
<p>Could Grush play the same role, though involuntary, as Thompson and Di Paolo played in the past in the enactive approach? Could he trigger the acknowledgment of (so far) unrecognized representational commitments in the enactive approach? <italic>Adaptivity</italic> is presented in terms of control mechanisms and anticipation. The organism, thanks to adaptivity, is able to respond to future scenarios of viability, to potential (non-actual) conditions.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[A]daptivity works mainly on tendencies of states, it needs not wait until there is a direct contact between the organism and the autopoietically relevant encounter to start responding to its potential presence in an anticipatory manner. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059712313482953">Di Paolo, 2005</xref>, p. 442)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The point is not whether Di Paolo can maintain, from the purely terminological point of view, a non-representationalist account of adaptivity. Surely he can. The point is whether an anticipatory mechanism, if it is really anticipatory, can be consistently conceived as not involving <italic>any kind</italic> of representational aspect or component at all. If, as Di Paolo assumes, adaptivity entails the ability to respond to future (potential, possible) states of affairs, and if this idea is not merely a ‘way of speaking’ but expresses the way in which the organism effectively works, then it is not clear how the organism can respond to a future event other than by manipulating something that is not the future event <italic>in itself</italic> – on penalty of assuming that a future event, <italic>as such</italic>, can be effectively ‘present’ and ‘available’ for the organism in its here and now functioning (which sounds odd and contradictory) – but something that is taken as ‘standing in for’ said event. Put in another way: or the organism deals with a ‘presentation’ of the future event (i.e., the future event is literally ‘present’ and available for the current functioning of the organism, in which case it is not a future event anymore), or it deals with a ‘representation’ of said event; with something that stands in for the future event and in relation to which the organism can effectively respond here and now. Or, what could be a (remote) third possibility, enactivists do not really think that biological systems <italic>are</italic> teleological systems; they simply want to interpret them in that way because, following Jonas, that is the way in which the ‘existential interpretation of biological facts’ works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059712313482953">1966</xref>, p. ix).</p>
<p>I am not an advocate of internal representations, but it seems to me that, once agreed that a certain biological mechanism is genuinely anticipatory, and therefore teleologically oriented, the most natural manner of understanding said mechanism is by assuming that there is some (at least minimal) representational component involved there. As Clark and Grush put it: ‘Representation-talk […] is the glue that binds <italic>telos</italic> (purpose) to mechanism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059712313482953">1999</xref>, p. 8, original emphasis).</p>
<p>Maybe the gesture made by Thompson will invite someone else in the enactive community to articulate the processes involved in adaptivity (self-monitoring, self-regulation, anticipation, etc.) in their most simple and traditional form. That is, as control and communication mechanisms, as trafficking of information and as representation.</p>

<p>Although in the first works wherein Varela launches the enactive approach the word ‘autopoiesis’ never appears, most of the key notions that Varela uses there to explain and characterize the enactive conception of cognition (e.g., nervous system as a closed network, structural coupling, natural drift) come indeed from Maturana’s biological theory. Later, in any case, Varela ends by recovering the concept of autopoiesis as a central element for the enactive program under a new interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059712313482953">Weber &amp; Varela, 2002</xref>). The point, nonetheless, is not about Varela’s particular conceptual trajectory but about the enactive approach as a collective project. From that perspective, the presence of Maturana’s autopoietic theory in the enactive approach (whether to review it, discuss it, complement it, modify it or criticize it) still constitutes an important point of reference, as is clear in the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059712313482953">Thompson (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059712313482953">Di Paolo (2005)</xref>, Froese and Stewart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059712313482953">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059712313482953">2012</xref>), among others.</p>

<label>3.</label>
<p>This is, I think, the best sense in which one can say that Maturana’s theory belongs to the cybernetic tradition. If one says that Maturana’s theory is a (second-order) cybernetic theory because it is, to a large extent, a theory of the observer, Maturana – the author of titles such as ‘Ontology of observing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059712313482953">1987b</xref>) or ‘Everything said is said by an observer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059712313482953">1987a</xref>) – would accept the labelling without major resistance. If, instead, one says that Maturana’s theory is a cybernetic theory because, say, it follows the axiomatic and mathematical formalism of Ashby’s cybernetics, or because the notion of autopoiesis is based on, or inspired by, Ashby’s ultrastable systems, Maturana – the neurobiologist who has spent most of his life in the lab working with frogs and pigeons and whose idea of living beings as closed systems explicitly rejects Ashby’s functional analysis in terms of inputs and outputs – reasonably, is going to react and deny such a cybernetic affiliation. For an interesting discussion related to this topic see the series of articles Froese and Stewart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059712313482953">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059712313482953">2012</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059712313482953">Maturana (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059712313482953">Bich and Arnellos (2012)</xref>.</p>

<p>The enactive community has its own self-interpretation and historical reconstruction as a research program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059712313482953">Froese, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059712313482953">2011</xref>). This self-interpretation, naturally (and also legitimately!), tends to be slightly triumphalist. It presents the enactive approach as a sort of virtuous synthesis of different theoretical currents and methodological practices, i.e., as a sort of ‘happy end’ after a history of paradigmatic misunderstandings (a happy end that is at the same time a ‘new beginning’). The interpretation that I will offer here is ‘alternative’ in relation to this self-interpretation, which does not aim to disconfirm but only counterbalance.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-1059712313482953">
<label>5.</label>
<p>I am mainly thinking of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059712313482953">Hutto (2011)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059712313482953">Hutto and Myin (2013)</xref>, who, in spite of their self-proclaimed radicalism (REC), remain conservative about the alleged teleological and intentional character of living beings. Moreover, REC retains the notion of information as co-variation, under the (questionable) assumption that this version of the concept, which is voided of semantic aspects, is entirely innocent and non-problematic for our understanding of cognition (see in this paper the subsection <italic>Living beings as functionally closed systems</italic>).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-1059712313482953">
<label>6.</label>
<p>Notice that this closure refers to the functional organization of living beings, not to their circular organization as self-producing (i.e., autopoietic) systems. What is definitive of living beings, according to Maturana, is their organizational closure as molecular productive system, not their organizational closure as functional systems. Systems whose functional organization is closed but whose material composition is not self-produced are, for example, nervous systems and thermostats. In the same way, we must distinguish between functional closure and transformational closure (as presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059712313482953">Ashby, 1956</xref>). A transformation – in the cybernetic sense – is an abstract system of transitions (that may or may not represent the behavioural trajectory of a concrete dynamical system), and it is closed if all its transforms are also present as operands, or, what is the same, if it can be raised to any power without losing the definition of its transitions. This kind of closure is an exclusive property of certain formal systems. To recognize, as Ashby does, that for every concrete dynamical system (living or not) there exists, in principle, a closed transformation that is its formal model or ‘canonical representation’, is simply to recognize that material systems, as a general rule, do not disappear but transform. Maturana, clearly, is not talking about this metaphysical principle. Maybe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059712313482953">Froese and Stewart (2010)</xref> conflate these notions of closure in their ‘Ashbyan autopoiesis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059712313482953">Bich &amp; Arnellos, 2012</xref>).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-1059712313482953">
<label>7.</label>
<p>Maturana emphasizes the mechanistic nature of living beings, essentially, to prevent any form of vitalistic and/or teleological interpretation of biological systems, not to imply, as some critics have tended to think, the (rather naïve) idea that classical mechanics, as a particular branch of physics, is all that we need to understand the complex (thermodynamic and biochemical) realization of living beings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059712313482953">Maturana &amp; Varela, 1973</xref>, p. 89).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-1059712313482953">
<label>8.</label>
<p>Notice that this is not to play with the idea that the living being has its own (idiosyncratic) environment or external world, different from ours. It is not the kind of thought ‘If I had the fly’s eyes, how would the world look like?’ What Maturana questions is the very idea that the organism has an environment or external world.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-1059712313482953">

<p>This revival, of course, is a regressive move just regarding its general content, as its methodological and theoretical justification (phenomenology and complex systems theory, among others), scope (ontological rather than purely methodological) and motivations (to make room for our ‘lived experience’ in cognitive sciences) are entirely new with respect to classic cybernetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059712313482953">Froese, 2011</xref>).</p>
