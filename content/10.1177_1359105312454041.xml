<abstract>
<p>A model of multiple domains of health literacy was mapped to 30 practitioners’ accounts of their breastfeeding promotion practice in a region of Canada. Fundamental/basic literacy themes were consistent with earlier literature regarding practitioners’ discomfort in addressing literacy issues with their clients. Scientific literacy was reflected in practitioners’ dilemmas about using jargon and scientific evidence when discussing breastfeeding. Cultural literacy themes related to practitioners’ understandings of the sociocultural context influencing adoption of breastfeeding. Civic literacy was reflected in the use of advocacy for creating supportive breastfeeding environments. Building capacity for health literacy, however, was not a conscious focus of practice.</p>

<body>
<p>Policy statements from international, national, and provincial levels of government, as well as health professional bodies, emphasize the importance of providing information to enable women to make informed feeding choices—with the preferred choice being breastfeeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105312454041">World Health Organization, 2004</xref>). As stronger links are drawn between breastfeeding and prevention of disease throughout the life course, breastfeeding promotion is increasingly positioned as a priority of health agencies and among health professionals. Despite convincing evidence supporting the health benefits of breastfeeding, and a wide array of efforts by a range of professionals and lay practitioners supporting breastfeeding, many Canadian women do not breastfeed. This article addresses the extent to which lay and professional practitioners engage with notions of health literacy in their breastfeeding promotion practices in a rural area of Atlantic Canada where literacy levels and breastfeeding rates tend to be lower than national averages.</p>
<sec id="section1-1359105312454041">
<title>A multifaceted view of health literacy</title>
<p>While health literacy most commonly refers to the ability to access, understand, and use health information, it is seen to be a complex and evolving concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312454041">Nutbeam, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105312454041">Rudd et al., 2012</xref>). Current definitions in the literature depict health literacy as comprising many dimensions that extend beyond basic literacy skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312454041">Frisch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105312454041">Sorensen et al., 2012</xref>). Given the vast array of issues, settings, and contexts in which people interact with information today, it is not surprising that its conceptualization is fuelling discussion among researchers and practitioners internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312454041">Begoray et al., 2012</xref>). Increasingly, health literacy is viewed as an attribute of potential users and of systems including those who provide health information. Health literacy, therefore, is considered a key concern of the practitioners and policy makers within various systems of information provision—both inside and outside of health care. As emphasized by the US Institute of Medicine’s landmark document, <italic>Health Literacy: A Prescription to End Confusion</italic>: “Health literacy emerges when the expectations, preferences, and skills of individuals seeking health information and services meet the expectations, preferences, and skills of those providing information and services” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312454041">Nielsen-Bohlman et al., 2004</xref>: 2).</p>
<p>Early health literacy research and practice tended to focus on disease management involving patients and medical practitioners within clinical settings. Attention has turned to its relevance to public health issues and interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105312454041">Freedman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105312454041">Pleasant and Kuruvilla, 2008</xref>), and researchers have been called to explore the multiple health contexts in which individuals are required to apply health literacy skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312454041">Nielsen-Bohlman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105312454041">Rootman and Gordon-El-Bihbety, 2008</xref>). Even though the concept of health literacy has “made significant inroads into research, practice, and policy in health promotion in Canada and elsewhere” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105312454041">Rootman et al., 2007</xref>: 68), questions remain with respect to its place in health promotion practice and in addressing issues of public health concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105312454041">Peerson and Saunders, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105312454041">Zarcadoolas et al. (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312454041">2006</xref>) have argued that because individuals and health practitioners work in tandem to address health issues, the health literacy abilities of both are interconnected. As agents of the systems in which they interact with the public, health practitioners create health literacy demands and expectations within their various health settings. As such, providers are in positions to facilitate or impede the access, understanding, and use of health information by individuals in their various roles as patients, consumers, caregivers, and citizens. Ideally, practitioners could reduce situational barriers, thereby enabling individuals to apply their health literacy skills in better using—and maybe even changing—the system through which information is provided.</p>
<p>Building on the idea that a plurality of literacies is needed to function in today’s society, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312454041">Zarcadoolas et al. (2006</xref>: 76) define health literacy as “the wide range of skills and competencies that people develop over their lifetimes to seek out, comprehend, evaluate, and use health information and concepts to make informed choices, reduce health risks, and increase quality of life.” Their definition is similar to most definitions of health literacy in its inclusion of the core processes of accessing, understanding, and using health information. Notably, it also incorporates <italic>evaluating information</italic> as a core element. It thereby acknowledges the critical need for appraising information within the context of the abundance, complexity, and inconsistency of information people receive from a wide array of sources, and through multiple channels. This definition refers explicitly to the use of health information and concepts in making informed choices, reducing health risks, and increasing quality of life. It thus reflects the growing demands for easily understood, relevant health information in a range of settings characteristic of contemporary society, including those outside the health-care system.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312454041">Zarcadoolas et al. (2006)</xref> contend that individuals need a composite of skills and different ways of knowing about health to operate in today’s information-intensive environments. Their multidimensional model of health literacy integrates four interactive domains of literacy: science literacy, civic literacy and cultural literacy, which build on the fourth dimension of fundamental or basic literacy as the “keystone” of health literacy. These four dimensions are described in the findings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312454041">Zarcadoolas et al. (2006)</xref> consider their model particularly suitable for addressing complex public health issues.</p>

<title>Public health issue of breastfeeding promotion</title>
<p>There are striking disparities in the rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration among Canadian mothers, making some children more susceptible to poor health outcomes than others. Breastfeeding is not only associated with decreased risks of diseases during infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312454041">Ip et al., 2007</xref>) but also long-term conditions, such as higher blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and increases in obesity and Type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105312454041">World Health Organization, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>For decades, copious amounts of information have been directed to Canadian mothers to influence their decisions on how to feed their babies and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312454041">Nathoo and Ostry, 2009</xref>). While some improvements have been seen in breastfeeding initiation rates in Canada, duration rates are far from the currently recommended 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding. Based on 2003 data from the Canadian Community Health Survey, 85% of Canadian mothers initiated breastfeeding with only 17% exclusively breastfeeding at 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105312454041">Miller and Maclean, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105312454041">Statistics Canada, 2005</xref>). Breastfeeding initiation and duration, along with exclusive breastfeeding, tend to increase with mother’s educational level, age, and socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312454041">Nathoo and Ostry, 2009</xref>). Initiation and continuation rates are lowest in the Atlantic provinces, where initiation rates range from 63% to 77%, and rates of exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months range from only 9% to 14%.</p>
<p>Babies born to women in lower socioeconomic groups are more vulnerable to health problems in infancy and later in life. These children are likely to have less access to a nutritionally adequate diet as they develop because of poverty and household food insecurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105312454041">Dubois and Girard, 2003</xref>). Dubois and Girard argue that more attention needs to be directed to examining the extent and impact of social inequalities on infant feeding practices in Canada and to the development of public health interventions aimed at reducing them.</p>

<title>Research aim</title>
<p>The data reported here are drawn from a wider research project that sought to discover whether and how professional and lay practitioners incorporated dimensions of health literacy into their breastfeeding promotion practice. In this article, we examine the extent to which descriptions of their practices reflected multiple dimensions of health literacy as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105312454041">Zarcadoolas et al. (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312454041">2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Research context and methods</title>
<p>A case study was conducted in the Guysborough Antigonish Strait Health Authority (GASHA), one of nine health districts in the Atlantic Canadian province of Nova Scotia. For decades, the people living within the boundaries of this large rural health district have been experiencing the impact of poor social and economic conditions on their health. Morbidity and morbidity rates tend to be higher in GASHA than in the wider province and country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312454041">GASHA, 2005</xref>)</p>
<p>The study was set within the context of two district-wide policies. One policy framed health literacy as a determinant of population health. Previous research had drawn attention to health literacy concerns in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312454041">Gillis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312454041">Gillis and Sears, 2012</xref>). More recently, national survey findings pointed to disproportionately lower levels of health literacy in this health district than in the province overall, with 68% of the population within GASHA performing below the level three cutoff compared to 57% of Nova Scotians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312454041">Canadian Council on Learning, 2007</xref>). The other policy relevant to this study referred to breastfeeding promotion and specifically supporting the goal of exclusive breastfeeding for the duration of 6 months in keeping with provincial and national guidelines. In this health district, only 61% of babies were reported to be breastfed at hospital discharge compared to the provincial average of 69%, based on the 2004–2005 data from the Reproductive Care Program of Nova Scotia. Although no district-wide data were available on duration rates, only 12.4% of Nova Scotia mothers were reportedly exclusively breastfeeding at 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105312454041">Statistics Canada, 2005</xref>). Notably, there were no data comparing mothers’ level of literacy or health literacy with breastfeeding prevalence. The wider case study employed three qualitative research methods: interviews with professional and lay practitioners, observations of prenatal information-giving opportunities in three sites, and group interviews with mothers and practitioners. Prior to the collection of data, the proposed study was reviewed by the research ethics boards of the university of the lead researcher and the district health authority where the study was conducted. It was approved in adherence with the Canadian Tri-Council Policy on ethical conduct for research involving humans.</p>
<p>The analysis for this article draws from the practitioner interview dataset. In-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted with a purposefully selected sample of 30 professional and lay practitioners situated across the perinatal continuum of care throughout the district. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105312454041">Table 1</xref>, the sample reflects a wide diversity of practitioners. Criteria were established to guide purposeful sampling based on context and people as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105312454041">Murphy et al. (1998)</xref> and from findings of a systematic review that identified women’s homes, primary health-care units, hospital clinics, and community venues as prime settings for breastfeeding promotion interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312454041">Couto De Oliveira et al., 2001</xref>). Interviews were conducted from October 2005 to June 2006. Since then, no major policy changes have occurred, and no further research has explored practitioners’ perspectives on health literacy and their breastfeeding promotion practice.</p>

<p>Recruitment of participants was supported by health district senior administrators, managers responsible for various practice sites, and members of the district breastfeeding committee. From the list of potential informants generated through these contacts, the sample was selected according to the established criteria to include informants from a range of hospital and community settings throughout the district. After an initial contact by telephone, practitioners were mailed a letter outlining the project and inviting their participation. The interview was scheduled by telephone or e-mail. Interviews were usually conducted in the practice setting, with most lasting between 60 and 90 minutes. Written informed consent was given prior to each interview. All interviews were audio-taped, with occasional notes written on the interview schedule, and general impressions—including points to pursue in subsequent interviews—recorded in a journal. Data collection and analysis were concurrent processes. The sample was considered complete when it reflected the diversity of practitioners and settings and no new thematic threads were appearing.</p>
<p>In-depth personal interviews, in a conversational style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105312454041">Patton, 2002</xref>), were guided by a four-stage reflective process using the questions of “what,” “why,” “so what,” and “now what” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105312454041">Labonte and Feather, 1996</xref>). This process was intended to involve informants in describing their experiences, analyzing them, reflecting on them, and suggesting further action (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1359105312454041">Table 2</xref>). Most informants engaged in candid conversation about their practices, with breastfeeding promotion a more salient concern than health literacy. As the interview progressed, they were asked questions such as “so what about health literacy?” or “so what about those women who have difficulties with the written word?” Near the close of the interview, interviewees were asked directly how they would describe health literacy.</p>

<p>All interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were checked for errors and entered into Atlas.ti qualitative data analysis software. One of the authors (D.E.G.) led the analysis of the transcripts guided by a high-level framework using the four domains of the health literacy in the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312454041">Zarcadoolas et al. (2006)</xref>. The coding framework was generated from a concept map informed by the literature and themes emerging from initial analysis using an iterative process of constant comparison. Framework analysis consists of summarizing and classifying data within a thematic framework in a way that preserves the integrity of the respondents’ accounts throughout the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312454041">Green and Thorogood, 2004</xref>). The mapping of emergent themes onto this framework was discussed at ongoing meetings with E.M. and N.J.G. with insights from ongoing journaling by D.E.G. integrated as the analysis progressed and further discussed with the research team. This iterative analysis process enabled identification of the extent to which practitioners’ accounts of their breastfeeding promotion practices reflected dimensions of health literacy consistent with fundamental, scientific, cultural, and civic literacy.</p>

<sec id="section5-1359105312454041">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The primary quest in analysis was for similar themes across the diverse cohort of practitioners, rather than comparing one group against another. The identification of only three lay practitioners engaged in breastfeeding promotion in this health district, for example, precluded comparison of views held by professional and lay practitioners. This discussion of findings focuses upon similarities across the sample while noting exceptions where they occur.</p>
<p>There was no evidence of shared understanding of health literacy among practitioners, a finding that parallels the lack of consensus in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105312454041">Baker, 2006</xref>). When asked directly what health literacy meant, participants’ responses varied widely. For example, one physician said, “I think it means education, knowledge and the ability to get it” (P18, 233). A lay practitioner said, “I think knowing where to turn and how to use this information and if you don’t know how to use this information, who do you have to ask to answer your questions” (P20, 242). From the perspective of a public health nurse, it was
<disp-quote>
<p>Helping parents really understand and be able to be informed about a topic well enough so that they feel that they can do it if that’s what they want to do and the support is there after to help them breastfeed their baby if they’ve made that decision. (P16, 425)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Responses reflected health literacy both as a property of individual mothers and also of practitioners as agents of the system through which breastfeeding information was provided.</p>
<p>Although few practitioners spontaneously referred to “health literacy,” embedded within descriptions of their breastfeeding promotion practice were notions of health literacy consistent with the model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312454041">Zarcadoolas et al. (2006)</xref>. This discussion focuses on the extent to which practices reflected the multiple domains of health literacy, including fundamental, scientific, cultural, and civic.</p>
<sec id="section6-1359105312454041">
<title>Fundamental domain of health literacy</title>
<p>As a central component of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312454041">Zarcadoolas et al.’s (2006</xref>: 56) model of health literacy, fundamental literacy refers to basic reading and writing skills as well as speaking and computing as “fundamental ways people develop skills, acquire information and conduct daily life.” Practitioners in this study did not speak easily about literacy with comments reflecting different understandings of literacy as it related to their health promotion efforts. One hospital-based nurse said, “Literacy and reading that is all I think—literacy and reading” (P23, 446). In contrast, a medical specialist suggested, “I don’t necessarily see literacy as reading; it is just learning from many different ways” (P22, 242).</p>
<p>Most practitioners framed literacy from a deficit perspective with many describing how low literacy inhibited one’s access to health information. This public health nurse said, “I guess I just see information on any health topic being limited to people that have problems with literacy, whether it’s immunization or signing a consent form or infant feeding and breastfeeding would be a part of it<italic>”</italic> (P11, 494). The idea that literacy is often considered in terms of what people cannot do, rather than what they can do, was critiqued however by a primary care nurse, “I think the perception is a deficit. That is not the way I like to work with it though. I think it [literacy] is a capacity builder” (P29, 294).</p>
<p>That literacy is not sufficiently taken account of was referred to by this hospital maternity nurse: “We just assume that everybody can read that pamphlet that we hand them—which knowing the literacy levels of the community, we know not to be true” (P1, 112). These accounts reflect the difficulty that practitioners have in integrating concern about fundamental literacy within their breastfeeding promotion practice.</p>

<title>Scientific domain of health literacy</title>
<p>“Scientific literacy refers to skills and abilities to understand and use science and technology, including some awareness of the process of science” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312454041">Zarcadoolas et al., 2006</xref>: 77). It encompasses knowledge of fundamental scientific concepts, an ability to comprehend technical complexity, and an understanding of scientific uncertainty.</p>
<p>Most practitioners appeared to recognize the prevalence of scientific concepts in the information they provided about breastfeeding, the process of lactation, and feeding technique but not all saw the value of supporting scientific literacy in their clients. Several referred to the use of scientific concepts and medical terminology as problematic in communicating breastfeeding information because terms were not familiar or well understood by their clients. Frequently used terms such as “latch” or “lactation consultant” were reportedly not always understood. A public health nurse said, “I think [we] health care practitioners generally do have our own speakease. We communicate in a language that isn’t always understandable” (P21, 37). Another public health nurse said, “Well there’s all kinds of words—colostrum, areola, like you know there’s lactiferous sinuses …” (P16, 109). In referring to mothers’ knowledge of the composition of breast milk, one family physician said, “The most common knowledge is just the immunoglobulins and things like that maybe, but I don’t think a lot of them know that it could prevent you from having a lot of allergies” (P13, 177).</p>
<p>Whereas several practitioners suggested that it was important that clients understand the scientific concepts and the reasoning behind the information provided, a few disagreed. On the one hand, a First Nations health center coordinator insisted that women should be able to understand the reasoning behind advice given to them: “These are certain things that need to be explained. You can’t just leave it up to the fact that a doctor told you so” (P17, 113). In contrast, a public health nurse suggested that mothers did not want the scientific justification for advice given to them:
<disp-quote>
<p>But I find that a lot of the people that don’t get a higher education don’t want to hear that anyway. They don’t want to know all the technical, the background; they don’t really care how their body makes it [breast milk]. (P11, 284)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many practitioners gave examples of the demand for scientific literacy in their breastfeeding promotion practice with a few indicating that their clients lack interest in understanding the scientific basis of infant feeding information and advice provided. This viewpoint is not consistent with Zarcadoolas et al.’s notion that drawing upon scientific literacy is an essential aspect of being health literate—not only for providers but also for potential users of information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1359105312454041">
<title>Cultural domain of health literacy</title>
<p>Cultural literacy as a domain of health literacy refers to “the ability to recognize and use collective beliefs, customs, world-view and social identity in order to interpret and act on health information” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312454041">Zarcadoolas et al., 2006</xref>: 57). Zarcadoolas et al. contend that cultural literacy should be integrated into health literacy practice at the individual, practitioner, and organizational level.</p>
<p>Practitioners frequently talked about the significant role that sociocultural factors played in determining how mothers in this health district fed their babies. Many referred to the practice goal of normalizing breastfeeding and their concern that breastfeeding was not the cultural norm in their communities. Of particular and frequent note was the importance of a family history of breastfeeding in supporting breastfeeding, as exemplified by this public health nurse’s comment:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s so much more what people have been exposed to, what their mother did, what their sisters do, what their grandmother, you know, and of course we come from a long line of formula feeding with the previous generation so that has a tremendous influence. (P16, 253)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One physician attributed cultural differences to the greater acceptance of breastfeeding in a neighboring First Nations community in comparison to a rural French Acadian community. As he noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think the Native community values breastfeeding more than us and I’ve seen people doing breastfeeding in public in the Native communities and so maybe it’s something like a cultural thing. And here, being a small community, people know each other and usually they don’t want to be seen in public with this. (P13, 093)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312454041">Zarcadoolas et al. (2006)</xref> contend that understandings of demographic and cultural factors are crucial aspects of health literacy. A nutritionist involved in analyzing breastfeeding policy suggested that understanding the sociocultural context in which mothers feed their babies can help practitioners recognize the barriers to breastfeeding which mothers encounter in various settings such as their workplaces, communities, and with their families:
<disp-quote>
<p>To understand the barriers that mothers face, why they don’t breastfeed optimally and trying to help them overcome those barriers. … it’s working on the cultural acceptability of mothers’ breastfeeding in public if that is where they have their infants when they are hungry. And also working on the broader cultural influences on mothers, such as their in-laws, their families, and their grandmothers—others who influence their infant feeding practices. (P10, 050)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although practitioners did not explicitly refer to the term “cultural literacy,” their comments suggest an application of cultural literacy in understanding the sociocultural context of breastfeeding, identifying cultural barriers to breastfeeding in public, and recognizing the need to create more socially supportive environments for women to breastfeed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1359105312454041">
<title>Civic domain of health literacy</title>
<p>Civic literacy refers to the “skills and abilities that enable citizens to become aware of public issues, to participate in critical dialogue about them, and to become involved in decision-making processes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312454041">Zarcadoolas et al., 2006</xref>: 61). This domain of health literacy acknowledges a requirement for multilevel and multiple sector responses to complex health issues. As such, it draws upon knowledge of civic and government systems and processes, power, inequity and hierarchical relationships, and awareness that personal behaviors and choices affect others in a larger community and society.</p>
<p>Several practitioners appeared to be aware of channels through which they could advance breastfeeding as a population health issue and garner greater community support for breastfeeding in this district. A few reported specific examples of their engagement in supporting civic action. Several informants referred to the work of the district breastfeeding committee that was made up of professional and lay providers from inside and outside the health-care system. One public health nurse claimed that breastfeeding is not just an issue that pertains to women, but one that needs to be addressed through the collaboration of community groups: “I think that by building better partnerships in our community we can do that with more people so that it (breastfeeding) becomes a community concern, not just a woman’s concern” (P21, 360).</p>
<p>Although most practitioners described practices that focused on transmitting information to encourage individual mothers to breastfeed, there were notable examples of efforts directed toward effecting change at the broader community and societal level. The coordinator of a community-based prenatal nutrition program told of her efforts to support a breastfeeding mother who was asked not to breastfeed in a local restaurant. She enabled the mother to discuss her experience with other mothers that resulted in their organizing a protest through letter writing and a boycott of the restaurant. Their action led to a change in the restaurant’s practice which respected women’s right to breastfeed in a public place. As noted by the coordinator, “Everybody has a responsibility I guess to inform the community about the benefits and about workplace and about going to wherever, shopping or to a restaurant, that you have the right to breastfeed your baby” (P4, 290). She contended that community members and agencies—in this case local businesses and employers—must protect the rights of the mother to breastfeed in public, and that citizens have a responsibility to make them aware of these rights.</p>
<p>Another example of civic literacy concern was a public health nurse’s account of advocacy efforts aimed at changing policy concerning the hospital’s acquisition of free formula for newborns from formula companies. Institutional resistance to support breastfeeding was attributed to power relations operating within the health-care system in response to the influence of formula companies.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One of the big issues related to that [supporting breastfeeding by the health care system] is the power structure within health care itself and who’s controlling what and what other choices are out there for women and how much power is behind those choices and I’m referring specifically to formula companies. (P30, 205)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The above comments exemplify how practitioners can work through civic networks to create a more supportive environment for breastfeeding. Through their collaborative efforts, they were engaged in building social capital to address the complex public health issue of breastfeeding. Social capital “refers to the processes between people which establish networks, norms, and social trust, and facilitate co-ordination and co-operation for mutual benefit” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105312454041">World Health Organization, 1998</xref>: 19). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312454041">Zarcadoolas et al. (2006)</xref> have suggested that social capital is an important aspect of civic literacy and one that can contribute to health literacy.</p>

<title>Implications for practice</title>
<p>The case of breastfeeding promotion highlights the importance of engaging health practitioners with conscious notions of health literacy so as to support and improve interactions between providers and users of breastfeeding information. Practitioners offered a wide range of views on health literacy but with little suggestion of familiarity with concepts of health literacy as reported in the literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312454041">Zarcadoolas et al. (2006)</xref> argue that a wide array of skills and conceptual understandings, derived from many literacies, are needed to be health literate today. Practitioners in this study tended to engage more with some literacy domains of health literacy than others.</p>
<p>Findings suggesting that practitioners did not easily engage with fundamental literacy are consistent with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312454041">Kefalides, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312454041">Parikh et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105312454041">Wolf et al., 2007</xref>). While there was no shared understanding of literacy as it related to their practice, limited literacy was referred to as a barrier to accessing health information.</p>
<p>In their provision of breastfeeding information, practitioners appeared to draw frequently upon scientific concepts and terminology. There was, however, little evidence that practices were directed toward making accommodations if concepts were not familiar to clients. Furthermore, few examples of practices reflected enhancing scientific literacy as a way of building the health literacy capacity of their clients. A few practitioners explicitly voiced their opposition to incorporating scientific understandings when discussing infant feeding with individuals in their communities. Findings suggest that more attention needs to be given to how scientific literacy can be incorporated and enhanced as a domain of health literacy not only for practitioners but also for those to whom they are providing infant feeding information and advice.</p>
<p>The sociocultural complexity of breastfeeding suggests that drawing upon cultural literacy may be of particular value to practitioners in their breastfeeding promotion practices. Practitioners’ comments often reflected understandings of the sociocultural context in which information encouraging women to breastfeed their babies was provided. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312454041">Schmied and Lupton (2001</xref>: 236) have emphasized that “breastfeeding (or the decision to bottle feed) is structured through prevailing sociocultural meanings and economic conditions.” By framing the breastfeeding issue beyond that of providing information encouraging women to breastfeed to the broader sociocultural context in which they are making and acting on feeding decisions, mothers’ rights gain more prominence. Given the societal tendency toward moralization of mothers based on their choice to breastfeed or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312454041">Knaak, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105312454041">Murphy, 1999</xref>), cultural literacy appears to be an important aspect of practitioners’ health literacy—and one which they may feel more comfortable with in practice than fundamental or scientific literacies. Moreover, efforts to enhance the cultural literacy dimension of health literacy of the public may help increase a broader understanding of the sociocultural barriers to breastfeeding and increase public support for breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Findings also suggest that the level of civic literacy is important if practitioners are to address the policy and organizational changes required to create public support for breastfeeding and for breastfeeding-friendly workplaces and communities. Although not frequent, a few practitioners gave examples of efforts to effect social change through civic engagement. Enhancing mothers’ civic literacy, by supporting development of their advocacy skills, strengthened their capacity to argue for breastfeeding-friendly public spaces. Drawing on civic literacy as an aspect of health literacy, practitioners could extend their efforts from a focus on informing individual mothers about the benefits of breastfeeding to working with them in addressing the structural constraints to breastfeeding.</p>
<p>Because practitioners in this study seemed to interact with cultural and civic aspects of the breastfeeding issue, these dimensions of health literacy may be more accessible for practitioners to assimilate into practice than fundamental or scientific literacies. As such, this may be a way to leverage greater interest among practitioners in applying a health literacy model to their practice.</p>

<title>Limitations and strengths</title>
<p>By using a qualitative research approach, this study was able to provide an in-depth examination of the extent to which practitioners have integrated dimensions of health literacy within the area of breastfeeding promotion. Its planning and execution and the analysis and presentation of findings were embedded within, and responsive to, the circumstances in which the promotion of breastfeeding was undertaken and health literacy was emerging as a concern in one rural health district. While drawing data from the purposefully selected sample of practitioners from one health district limits the generalizability of findings, interview participants reflected the wide variety of practitioners from different disciplines and sectors involved in breastfeeding promotion efforts. A limitation of conducting the study in this rural health district was that there were few lay practitioners involved in the promotion of breastfeeding. It was also difficult to access some professional practitioners, especially family physicians, outside of the more populated centers.</p>
<p>The conceptual ambiguity and lack of empirical support in the literature describing dimensions of health literacy, coupled with ambivalence about literacy in practitioners’ descriptions of their breastfeeding promotion practices, made analysis of findings challenging. While this suggests a lack of engagement with notions of health literacy, there were rich descriptions of practices reflective of dimensions of health literacy as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312454041">Zarcadoolas et al. (2006)</xref>.</p>
<p>Whereas these findings are reflective of the practice perspectives, experiences, and contexts in one health district, insights from this study are likely of relevance and transferability to practitioners and researchers in other settings who are concerned about integrating the concept of health literacy into their practice and are also struggling with the complexities of breastfeeding promotion. Findings provide a base for further exploration of the incorporation of the concept of health literacy in breastfeeding promotion and in other areas of health promotion practice.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Breastfeeding promotion is a complex public health issue that requires the practitioner to be able to communicate scientific evidence supporting current recommendations with an understanding that breastfeeding is a sociocultural practice. Looking through the multifaceted lens of health literacy proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312454041">Zarcadoolas et al. (2006)</xref> has helped illuminate ways that practitioners involved in the promotion of breastfeeding engage with health literacy, and how practices could extend beyond information transmission to effecting social change to better enable women to act upon advice provided.</p>
<p>This study has explored the extent to which practices reflect practitioner engagement with dimensions of the complex and evolving concept of health literacy. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105312454041">Rudd et al. (2012)</xref>, most current definitions of health literacy do not fully address the capacity of practitioners to inhibit or enhance the skills of individuals and communities. More research that examines the practices of providers of information in various contexts addressing complex culturally embedded health issues, such as breastfeeding, can contribute to a better understanding of the range of capacities of providers and systems needed to support people and communities and ultimately to contribute to definitions of health literacy.</p>
