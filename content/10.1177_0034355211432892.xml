<abstract>
<p>Telecommunication offers a cost-saving alternative to face-to-face vocational rehabilitation (VR) service delivery, yet little is known about the current use. This article describes findings from an exploratory survey of 1,187 counselors, representing 13 VR agencies across the United States. The online survey explored agency, counselor, and client facilitators and barriers to telecommunication use during the VR process. Staff with training in telecommunication strategies reported significantly higher rates of email telecommunication (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Counselors with a higher rural caseload mix engaged in significantly less email telecommunication during the VR process, and rural clients as compared with urban clients were characterized as having less personal access to a computer with Internet. Although counselors use and rely on simple telecommunication methods such as phone and email to serve their clients, strategies to address barriers are needed to expand telecommunication use during the VR process.</p>

<body>
<p>Since the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) has administered state formula grants to vocational rehabilitation (VR) to assist people with disabilities to prepare for and engage in gainful employment. VR services are provided in all states, the District of Columbia, and the inland territories. Services include assessment, counseling, referral, physical and mental restoration, training and education, maintenance, and postemployment services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0034355211432892">U.S. Department of Education, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>VR agencies are under increased pressure to provide services more efficiently as budget constraints, growing caseloads, and rising operating costs create barriers to effective service delivery. Rural areas are particularly susceptible to these economic constraints, where distances from the VR office are substantial and transportation barriers limit counselor and client travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0034355211432892">Metzel &amp; Giordano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355211432892">Riemer-Reiss, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>One strategy to deliver services in a more economical manner is to rely on telecommunication for counselor–client interactions. Telecommunication offers an alternative to face-to-face visits, while also providing more flexibility to receive and exchange information during the VR process. In general, telecommunication refers to information technology (IT) applications that allow individuals and groups of people in different locations to engage with one another. Telecommunication includes asynchronous (e.g., email, Internet, fax, etc.) and synchronous (e.g., phone, cell phone, text messaging, videoconferencing, etc.) communication methods that reduce time, distance, and geographic constraints.</p>
<p>Several opinion articles describe how telecommunication might enhance VR practice. For example, the Institute on Rehabilitation Issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0034355211432892">IRI, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034355211432892">2002</xref>) study groups in 2000 and 2002 examined potential uses of telecommunication in the VR process. These included online VR marketing to reach potential clients, online assessment tools and training to assist with consumer job readiness and exploration, and online information seeking around job search, labor market data, and disability rights. The study group also highlighted how email could increase opportunities for counselor–client communication by providing a mechanism through which consumers and counselors can engage without having to schedule meetings or wait to share thoughts and concerns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0034355211432892">Patterson (2000)</xref> described similar opportunities for including the Internet at each phase in the rehabilitation process, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0034355211432892">Sampson, Kolodinsky, and Greeno (1997)</xref> described how telecommunication could increase client access to counseling and assessment services in rural areas and reduce scheduling burdens.</p>
<p>Despite the potential benefits of telecommunication use in VR, there is little empirical research for evaluating appropriate use. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0034355211432892">Patterson (2002)</xref> assessed Internet access beliefs and applications for rehabilitation counselors in 34 states (<italic>N</italic> = 1,034). She reported that 65% of VR counselors used email to communicate with clients and only 8% of counselors felt that the Internet should not be used. A small study examining the potential use of teleconferencing to deliver services to clients who are deaf in rural Utah (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0034355211432892">Johnson, 2004</xref>) reported increased opportunities for interactions, but also technical difficulties, such as blurred images.</p>
<p>Other studies describe potential barriers to using telecommunication that may apply to people with disabilities. For instance, persons who are older, have a low income, are less educated, or belong to minority groups use the Internet at lower rates than the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0034355211432892">Fox, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0034355211432892">Jones &amp; Fox, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0034355211432892">Lenhart et al., 2003</xref>), which may make it harder for these groups to access and use technology effectively. People living in rural areas may also have less access to certain telecommunication technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0034355211432892">Porter &amp; Donthu, 2005</xref>), and telecommunication methods may also present problems for people with limited writing, understanding, or communication skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0034355211432892">Oravec, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Research outside the VR setting provides information about the benefits and limitations to using telecommunication to provide counseling services. Positive aspects of online counseling include increased openness due to participant feelings of anonymity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0034355211432892">Anthony, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0034355211432892">Young, 2005</xref>), increased flexibility and convenience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0034355211432892">Anthony, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0034355211432892">Young, 2005</xref>), increased access to providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0034355211432892">Anthony, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034355211432892">Hanley, 2010</xref>), strong working alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034355211432892">Hanley, 2010</xref>), and increased feelings of participant control in what information gets conveyed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034355211432892">Hanley, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, studies report positive counseling outcomes via a variety of telecommunication methods including phone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355211432892">Baca, Alverson, Manuel, &amp; Blackwell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355211432892">Riemer-Reiss, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0034355211432892">Tait, 1999</xref>), email (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0034355211432892">Anthony, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355211432892">Riemer-Reiss, 2000</xref>), and real-time video/videoconferencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355211432892">Baca et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355211432892">Riemer-Reiss, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Identified barriers include loss of nonverbal communication cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0034355211432892">Bischoff, Hollist, Smith, &amp; Flack, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034355211432892">Collie, Cubranic, &amp; Long, 2002</xref>), misinterpreted meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034355211432892">Hanley, 2010</xref>), lack of privacy at home or in community locations when engaging in the online counseling process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034355211432892">Hanley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0034355211432892">Young, 2005</xref>), exclusion of people with lower socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034355211432892">Enders, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0034355211432892">Tait, 1999</xref>), lack of technology competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0034355211432892">Karlsudd, 2008</xref>), signal delays and technical difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355211432892">Baca et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0034355211432892">Bischoff et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034355211432892">Collie et al., 2002</xref>), security issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355211432892">Baca et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0034355211432892">Young, 2005</xref>), and obstacles resulting from government and private bureaucratic rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355211432892">Baca et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Findings from the online counseling literature have implications for telecommunication use in the VR setting, but more background is needed before recommendations and interventions can be developed. For instance, little is known about VR client access to technology, current use of telecommunication to deliver VR services, and problems VR counselors have encountered. This study was conducted to fill in knowledge gaps by identifying potential facilitators and barriers to effective telecommunication use during the VR process and to learn how telecommunication is currently used.

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0034355211432892">
<title>Survey Development</title>
<p>We did not find relevant measures for assessing the use of telecommunication within the VR system in the literature. As a result, survey development began with five informant interviews (three individual interviews with counselors and two group interviews with two different state VR agency teams) to explore (a) current use of telecommunications, (b) technology access issues in rural areas, (c) confidentiality issues, (d) perceptions about client barriers, (e) perceptions about client and counselor proficiencies regarding different telecommunications methods, and (f) counselor preferences for using different technologies by disability type. Building on these interviews, a draft survey was developed and reviewed by an advisory panel with representatives from workforce development, vocational rehabilitation, higher education, independent living, and the Research and Training Center on Measurement and Community Participation. After survey revisions, the survey was adapted for online delivery using SurveyGizmo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0034355211432892">Dillman, Smyth, &amp; Christian, 2009</xref>). We selected SurveyGizmo because it met the accessibility and usability standards outlined in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0034355211432892">SurveyGizmo, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0034355211432892">2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>We tested and revised the online survey using “think-aloud” interviews with nine VR counselors who were identified by VR directors from five geographically diverse state agencies. During think-aloud interviews, respondents verbally explained the thought processes that went into answering survey questions so that researchers could assess clarity of question wording, ease of format, and whether questions resulted in useful and expected information. The survey was also tested for accessibility by a former VR counselor with visual impairment using JAWS screen-reader software. Once the online survey was fully developed, the University Institutional Review Board reviewed and approved the procedures for the project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0034355211432892">
<title>Agency and Participant Recruitment</title>
<p>We recruited VR agencies through active and passive marketing methods. We sent personal invitation letters to, and conducted telephone follow-up with, 19 state VR directors asking if they would participate in one of two research projects. Seven agencies agreed to participate in the telecommunication project using this strategy. In addition, the Council of State Administrators of Vocational Rehabilitation (CSAVR) posted a description of the telecommunication research project on its website and six additional VR agencies self-selected into the study.</p>
<p>We asked VR administrators of the 13 participating agencies to send email invitations for completing the online survey to their entire counseling staff. Administrators also sent follow-up email messages approximately 2 weeks after the initial invitation, which increased response rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0034355211432892">Dillman, Symth, &amp; Christian, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0034355211432892">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>In total, we received data from 1,187 counselors representing 13 vocational rehabilitation agencies (Louisiana, Alaska, Colorado, Kansas, Alabama, Arkansas–Services for the Blind, Nebraska–Services for the Blind, Nevada, Oklahoma, Montana, Michigan, California, and Georgia). The combined response rate across participating agencies was 58% of invited counseling staff, ranging from 44% to 82% response rates within individual agencies.</p>
<p>Respondents were 30 years old or younger (8%), 31 to 40 (18%), 41 to 50 (26%), 51 to 60 (36%), and older than 60 (12%). The mean number of years respondents were VR counselors was 11 years; the median was 9 years. Respondents had bachelor’s (11%), master’s (87%), and doctorate’s (2%).</p>
<p>Counselors’ active caseloads averaged 114 clients. A total of 115 counselors (10%) served exclusively rural clients (town/city populations less than or equal to 10,000), and 363 counselors (31%) served exclusively urban clients (town/city populations greater than 10,000). Rural designations were based on nonmetro and noncore definitions from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0034355211432892">U.S. Office of Management and Budget (2000)</xref>. The remaining counselors (59%) served a mixed rural and urban caseload. Overall, counselors served approximately 38,508 rural clients, of which 21,413 (or 56% of all rural clients) were served through an itinerant relationship, where the counselor traveled to meet face-to-face with the client. Based on information provided by the respondents, this represented an estimated 192,013 travel miles per month (2,304,156 miles per year). In all, 26% of counselors who served both rural and urban clients said they made contact with their rural clients less frequently than with their urban clients, 8% said they made contact more frequently with their rural clients as compared with their urban clients, and 66% said they served the two groups at the same rate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0034355211432892">
<title>Survey Instrument</title>
<p>This exploratory survey was developed to evaluate the current use and feasibility of using telecommunication methods to provide VR services. We focused questions on telecommunication use specifically between counselors and clients. The survey instrument included 69 questions and was divided into six sections: counselor demographics, counselor access to telecommunications, client characteristics that may impede or facilitate telecommunication use, counselor attitudes about telecommunication to deliver services, current use of telecommunication at stages across the VR process, and counselor experiences.</p>
<sec id="section6-0034355211432892">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>Counselors provided background about their age, education, and counseling experience. We also asked questions about caseload size, caseload makeup, and percentage of caseload that came from rural communities (towns with a population less than 10,000).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0034355211432892">
<title>Counselor access and agency support</title>
<p>Counselors used check boxes to indicate which telecommunication methods they had access to, including phone/cell/TTY, texting, email, videoconferencing (Skype), and fax. Counselors also provided level of agreement with statements about agency and technical support for using telecommunication on a 5 point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 = <italic>agree completely</italic> to 5 = <italic>disagree completely</italic>. Counselors checked a box if they had received any training or education for using telecommunication methods during the VR process, and for those who had received training, a secondary screen asked for qualitative descriptions of the types of training received.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0034355211432892">
<title>Client barriers and facilitators</title>
<p>To use the computer to receive VR services, clients need access to technology and skills to use it. Using single-item questions, counselors estimated the percentage of their clients who (a) had access to a computer with an Internet connection, (b) knew how to use the Internet to find information, (c) knew how to use email, (d) could access free or low-cost computer training near their homes, and (e) could convey thoughts effectively in writing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0034355211432892">
<title>Counselor attitudes</title>
<p>Counselor attitudes are likely to influence telecommunication use in the VR process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0034355211432892">Porter &amp; Donthu, 2005</xref>). Using check boxes, counselors indicated which telecommunication methods posed significant risks to client confidentiality. Counselors also used check boxes to indicate which disability groups (blind/low vision, deaf/hearing impaired, physical, cognitive, and mental health) would have trouble communicating by phone/cell/TTY and email. If counselors indicated that a specific method would be hard for a particular disability group, an open-ended question asked why the counselor thought so.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0034355211432892">
<title>Telecommunication use</title>
<p>To estimate current use of telecommunication, counselors estimated how often (1 = <italic>never</italic>, 2 = <italic>some</italic>, 3 = <italic>often</italic>, and 4 = <italic>almost always</italic>) they used phone/cell/TTY, email, and face-to-face methods at different stages in the VR process including initial intake, Individualized Plan of Employment (IPE) plan development, IPE implementation, counseling and guidance, and job-related services. Counselors, who had access to videoconferencing and text messaging, also indicated whether they used these technologies at each stage in the VR process.</p>
<p>Values for email use were summed across VR stages to get a proxy for the level of email telecommunication use. Scores could range from 5 (if respondents indicated <italic>never</italic> for all five stages) to 20 (if respondents indicated <italic>almost always</italic> for all five stages). This proxy variable was used to test several study hypotheses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0034355211432892">
<title>Reported experiences using technology</title>
<p>Finally, counselors provided qualitative information about their experiences using technology. They responded to open-ended questions about how telecommunication has been helpful during the VR process and about problems or difficulties they have experienced.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0034355211432892">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>In addition to descriptive statistics, we explored study hypotheses with independent samples <italic>t</italic> tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). We also used paired samples <italic>t</italic> tests to compare counselor responses about rural and urban clients. All group comparisons were evaluated at an alpha level of .05. Data were analyzed using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0034355211432892">IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0 (2010)</xref>.</p>
<p>Qualitative responses were analyzed by question. Each written response for a specific question was coded into a main theme. Main themes were generally broad categories and encompassed the main points of individual responses. Within each main theme, responses received a subcode to group similar comments or ideas. Subcodes often emerged based on the type of technology, the person or disability group using the technology, or the type of problem or solution presented by the technology. A count within each main theme and subgroup allowed us to quantitatively estimate strength of response.</p>

<title>Agency and Counselor Facilitators</title>
<sec id="section15-0034355211432892">
<title>Agency support</title>
<p>Almost all counselors (98%) had agency-supported access to the Internet and email, and 31% had laptops with wireless Internet access. Smaller percentages had access to work-supported cell phones (16%), videoconferencing/Skype (14%), text messaging capabilities (6%), or handheld mobile devices such as Blackberries or iPhones (6%). Within this context, we were interested in understanding agency and counselor level characteristics that might facilitate telecommunication use.</p>
<p>In response to the statement, “My agency supports the use of telecommunication to deliver services,” counselors agreed completely (20%), agreed some (45%), disagreed some (16%), disagreed completely (6%), and did not know (14%). Likewise, in response to the statement, “I have access to technical support when I need it,” counselors agreed completely (29%), agreed some (38%), neither agreed nor disagreed (16%), disagreed some (12%), and disagreed completely (6%). We explored whether agency and technical support influenced email use within the VR process. First, we classified respondents into two groups based on agreement as compared with disagreement regarding agency support and technical support. Then we compared these groups based on the proxy of email use across the VR system. Respondents who agreed some or completely regarding agency support were not statistically different for groups who disagreed some or completely in terms of email use (<italic>M</italic> = 10.04, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.96 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 9.74, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.04, <italic>t</italic>(836) = 1.30, <italic>p</italic> = .189). Likewise, respondents who agreed some or completely regarding technical support were not statistically different from respondents who disagreed some or completely in terms of email use (<italic>M</italic> = 9.91, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.83 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 10.11, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.31, <italic>t</italic>(806) = 0.697, <italic>p</italic> = .486).</p>
<p>A total of 916 counselors (77% of all respondents) provided written clarification about how their agency supported or did not support the use of telecommunication. Of these qualitative responses, 44% (<italic>n</italic> = 407) said their agency provided and encouraged the use of telecommunication technologies and also explored ways to improve telecommunication access to more effectively deliver services. Nine percent (<italic>n</italic> = 84) commented that their agency was both supportive and unsupportive, most of whom noted that their agency provided some telecommunication technologies (such as email) but not other methods such as Blackberries or videoconferencing that would be useful for keeping in touch with clients. Forty-seven percent (<italic>n</italic> = 434) of qualitative responses described how the agency was not supportive of telecommunication or that support was limited. Issues reported by these counselors included the high cost of implementing telecommunication technologies for counselors and clients (<italic>n</italic> = 50; 5% of qualitative responses), the agencies desire for face-to-face delivery of services (<italic>n</italic> = 49; 5% of qualitative responses), confidentiality concerns (<italic>n</italic> = 31; 3% of qualitative responses), and agency firewalls that created barriers to using email and Internet resources (<italic>n</italic> = 9; 1% of qualitative responses).</p>

<title>Counselor training</title>
<p>A total of 215 counselors (18% of the total sample) said they had received training to deliver services using telecommunication methods. Of these, 72% (<italic>n</italic> = 156) provided clarification about the types of training provided. Counselors reported training in the use of TTY, speech-to-text programs, videophones, teleconferencing, videoconferencing, Microsoft Office, and various assistive technologies (<italic>n</italic> = 65; 42% of qualitative responses); general technology education through graduate school, staff training, colleagues, and seminars (<italic>n</italic> = 56; 36% of qualitative responses); and training on the Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0034355211432892">CRCC, 2002</xref>) Code of Ethics, ethical emailing, and phone and Internet etiquette (<italic>n</italic> = 35; 22% of qualitative responses).</p>
<p>To explore the hypothesis that technical training increases telecommunication use, we conducted independent samples <italic>t</italic> tests about counselor training. Respondents who received technical training reported significantly higher rates of email use during the VR process (<italic>M</italic> = 10.40, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.21) than respondents who did not receive technical training (<italic>M</italic> = 9.71, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.89), <italic>t</italic>(942) = 2.85, <italic>p</italic> = .005.</p>

<title>Counselor characteristics</title>
<p>We hypothesized that counselor characteristics, including age, caseload size, and service to rural communities, would impact telecommunication use. To test these hypotheses, we grouped data for each characteristic and compared email use during the VR process. Younger counselors (≤50) compared with older counselors (&gt;50) did not have statistically significant differences in email use (<italic>M</italic> = 9.95, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.01 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 9.70, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.89), <italic>t</italic>(951) = 1.27, <italic>p</italic> = .206, nor did counselors with smaller caseloads (≤100) as compared with larger caseloads (&gt;100; <italic>M</italic> = 9.76, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.01 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 9.90, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.81), <italic>t</italic>(940) = 0.726, <italic>p</italic> = .468. Counselors serving a substantial number of rural clients (≥20% rural) compared with counselors who predominately served urban clients (&lt;20% rural) did have statistically different rates of email use (<italic>M</italic> = 9.51, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.75 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 10.03, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.02), <italic>t</italic>(931) = 2.65, <italic>p</italic> = .008. In particular, urban counselors use email at higher rates during the VR process.</p>

<title>Communication skills</title>
<p>Aside from phone, email was the most prevalent telecommunication method available to VR counselors nationally. However, one necessary skill for effective email use is client ability to understand and convey thoughts in writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0034355211432892">Oravec, 2000</xref>). On average, counselors estimated that 53% of their clients could effectively communicate in writing. Counselors who indicated that the majority of their clients could communicate in writing reported significantly higher rates of email telecommunication during the VR process (<italic>M</italic> = 10.23, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.93) as compared with counselors who indicated that less than 50% of their clients could communicate in writing (<italic>M</italic> = 9.51, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.94), <italic>t</italic>(944) = 3.78, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>Counselors also compared the effectiveness of written communication as opposed to verbal communication with their clients. In all, 53% of counselors felt written communication was “less effective than” verbal communication, 39% felt written communication was “just as effective as” verbal communication, and 7% felt that written communication was “more effective than” verbal communication. Using one-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc comparisons, we found significantly higher rates of email telecommunication use based on counselor opinions about the effectiveness of written communication with clients, <italic>F</italic>(2, 950) = 15.44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Specifically, counselors rating written communication as “less effective,” <italic>M</italic> = 9.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [9.15, 9.64], gave significantly lower ratings to the use of email telecommunication than counselors rating written communication as “just as effective” (<italic>M</italic> = 10.18, 95% CI = [9.89, 10.47], <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Likewise, counselors rating written communication as “just as effective” gave significantly lower ratings of email telecommunication use than those counselors rating written communication as “more effective” (<italic>M</italic> = 11.14, 95% CI = [10.29, 12.00], <italic>p</italic> = .003). Counselor attitudes were not significantly different based on age, caseload size, or case mix characteristics.</p>
<p>When asked to explain their ratings about written communication as compared with verbal communication, 646 counselors (54%) responded. The majority (<italic>n</italic> = 560; 87% of qualitative responses) gave explanations as to why they preferred verbal communication. A total of 297 counselors (45% of qualitative responses) stated that reading and writing are often difficult for their clients, especially clients who are deaf or have visual or cognitive impairments. Issues included client inability to access printed text, illiteracy, comprehension problems, and English as the clients’ second language. In all, 255 counselors (39% of qualitative responses) stated that face-to-face verbal communication was essential for client understanding and assessment of client body language, which was especially important for clients who have hearing, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments. Twenty-six counselors (4% of qualitative responses) said they preferred using both written and verbal communication with clients. For these counselors, verbal communication was preferred as the primary means of communication, and written communication was used to supplement. Sixty-five counselors (10% of qualitative responses) stated that they preferred written communication with clients. These counselors said that clients often do not listen to, or can misconstrue, verbal instructions. They also stated that using written communication was helpful because it provided a record of instructions or dialogue for future reflection or clarification.</p>

Email telecommunication use was not statistically different based on counselor opinion about risks to confidentiality, but it did approach significance (“no risk” <italic>M</italic> = 9.96, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.94 vs. “risk” <italic>M</italic> = 9.58, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.94), <italic>t</italic> = 1.83, <italic>p</italic> = .068.</p>

<title>Telecommunication Use</title>
<p>Counselors provided data about their telecommunication use at different stages in the VR process. For analysis purposes, we divided the VR process into five phases: Initial Intake (conducting client interviews and intakes, etc.), IPE Development (developing goals, formulating plans, etc.), IPE Implementation (conducting client follow-ups, making referrals, etc.), Counseling and Guidance (i.e., therapeutic counseling), and Job-Related Services (completing resumes, job searches, etc.). Counselors estimated how often (1 = <italic>never</italic>, 2 = <italic>some</italic>, 3 = <italic>often</italic>, and 4 = <italic>almost always</italic>) they used phone/cell/TTY, email, and face-to-face methods to implement each phase. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0034355211432892">Figure 1</xref> shows average scores for each stage.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0034355211432892-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>The figure shows that at intake and IPE development stages, most counselors rely on face-to-face methods to communicate with their clients. As clients move through the VR process, however, there is more use of phone/cell/TTY and email for counselor–client communication. A decline in email use during the counseling and guidance phase may indicate that “real-time” contact is preferred or necessary for this phase.</p>
<p>On average, counselors indicated that they could provide effective therapeutic counseling using email telecommunication to about 24% of their clients. Younger counselors (≤50) rated the feasibility of providing effective counseling via email higher than did older counselors (28% vs. 20%; <italic>t</italic> = 5.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .000), yet there were no significant differences in actual use rates (as reported previously).</p>

When asked to explain, 192 counselors provided qualitative feedback. In all, 85 counselors (44% of qualitative responses) said that they see their urban clients more frequently in a face-to-face format during all phases of the VR process when compared with their rural clients and have less frequent contact with their rural clients than their urban clients. A total of 55 counselors (29% of qualitative responses) noted that access to transportation created barriers to VR services and employment options for their rural clients. Fifty-one counselors (27% of qualitative responses) also commented that services were delivered differently to rural clients because these clients often live in areas where there is no cell phone coverage or Internet access. Urban clients, however, had more access to technology even if they did not personally own it. According to the counselor comments, limited technology coupled with the lack of adequate transportation can make it much more difficult to serve rural clients than their urban counterparts.</p>

<title>Counselor Experiences</title>
<sec id="section28-0034355211432892">
<title>Positives</title>
<p>Overall, most counselors (73%) agreed that telecommunication has enhanced their ability to deliver VR services. In fact, only 6% of counselors disagreed with this statement. When asked how using telecommunication was helpful, 962 (81%) counselors provided qualitative feedback. In all, 436 counselors (45% of qualitative responses) reported ways that computers and email have been helpful. Commonly, counselors preferred email because it eliminated potential transportation barriers for clients and was a quick way to check in or answer client questions. Counselors also described email as especially useful for communicating with clients who are deaf and those attending postsecondary education programs.</p>
<p>A total of 188 responding counselors (20% of qualitative responses) noted that using the phone to communicate with clients has been helpful. According to counselors, the phone provided a quick and easy way to stay in touch with clients and saved on travel time and expenses. They used the phone to provide clarification, answer questions, and to evaluate the client’s mood. Twenty-one counselors (2%) mentioned that texting capabilities have been very useful, especially for communicating with younger clients or clients who are deaf. Thirty counselors (3%) also said that videophones have been invaluable for communicating with clients who are deaf because it allows for communication using American Sign Language (ASL).</p>
<p>In all, 349 counselors (36% of qualitative responses) described ways that having access to any telecommunication technology was helpful for service delivery. For instance, technology increased communication and contact with clients, created several avenues for clients to stay in touch with counselors, saved on money and time, and allowed counselors to serve rural clients, to accommodate various disability or impairment groups, and to follow-up with clients.</p>

<title>Problems or difficulties</title>
<p>Forty-one percent of counselors reported technical difficulties when using telecommunication to provide services. Of these, 38% (<italic>n</italic> = 454) provided qualitative feedback. Over a third of qualitative responses (<italic>n</italic> = 175, 38%) related to technical difficulties while using the phone, such as dropped calls, voicemail messages not being received by clients, and a lack of cell phone service in certain areas. A total of 308 (68% of qualitative responses) focused on technical difficulties using the computer or Internet. These problems included frequent issues with servers, networks being down, slow and sometimes nonexistent Internet connections, undeliverable emails, and firewalls. In addition, 35 counselors (8% of qualitative responses) mentioned technical difficulties while using videophones, including networks being down, frozen screens, and blurry images.</p>
<p>In addition to technical problems, 201 counselors (44% of qualitative responses) said that their main problem with telecommunication has been that either they or their clients or both do not have access to needed technologies. Other access issues included frequent changes in client contact information (<italic>n</italic> = 36; 8% of qualitative responses) and the financial cost of telecommunication technologies for both counselors and clients (<italic>n</italic> = 18; 4% of qualitative responses).</p>
<p>Fifty-seven counselors (13% of qualitative responses) noted that using telecommunication technologies often led to miscommunications with clients, especially those with cognitive or mental health impairments. Forty counselors (9% of qualitative responses) commented that there was a need for face-to-face communication with clients to assess client body language and understanding.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although telecommunication methods appear to be used in the VR counseling process, the eventual uptake of technology depends on many factors. The goal of this study was to identify potential facilitators of and barriers to effective telecommunication use during the VR process and to learn how telecommunication is currently used.</p>
<sec id="section31-0034355211432892">
<title>Facilitators and Barriers</title>
<sec id="section32-0034355211432892">
<title>Agency and counselor factors</title>
<p>Our hypotheses that agency and technical support would predict level of email telecommunication between clients and counselors were not supported in the data, nor were hypotheses about counselor age or caseload size. Counselors who had received training on the use of telecommunication, however, were significantly more likely to use email telecommunication with their clients.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, very few VR counselors (18%) were actually trained in distance counseling methods. Because most counselors do use the phone, email, and other methods to deliver VR services, in-service training related to strategies for developing online relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0034355211432892">Anthony, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0034355211432892">Cho &amp; Berge, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355211432892">Riemer-Reiss, 2000</xref>), building written rapport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0034355211432892">Anthony, 2000</xref>), compensation strategies for loss of nonverbal cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0034355211432892">Bischoff et al., 2004</xref>), or development of effective online and phone counseling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355211432892">Baca et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355211432892">Riemer-Reiss, 2000</xref>) may improve delivery practice. The use of technology to deliver services could also be expanded as a required competency in Rehabilitation Counseling degree programs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section33-0034355211432892">
<title>Access to technology</title>
<p>The literature we reviewed cited several access barriers to telecommunication use including exclusion of the technology poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034355211432892">Enders, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0034355211432892">Tait, 1999</xref>), particularly in rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0034355211432892">Porter &amp; Donthu, 2005</xref>). These barriers were reinforced in the study. For instance, counselors estimated that approximately 50% of their rural clients did not have access to a computer with Internet or know how to use the Internet to find information. Many counselors also indicated that rural clients received fewer opportunities to communicate with their counselor using both face-to-face and telecommunication methods. This discrepancy in access to VR services represents a problem for rural clients. For instance, a large qualitative study (<italic>N</italic> = 1,346) conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0034355211432892">Hein, Lustig, and Uruk (2005)</xref> suggested that more frequent client/counselor communication would improve client employment outcomes. While access barriers need to be considered, increased use of available telecommunication methods remains one strategy to facilitate communication.</p>
<p>One possible avenue for addressing rural access barriers is to help clients establish an email account using a computer located at their local library. In 2008, approximately 58% of public libraries were housed in rural locations with populations less than 10,000. These libraries housed 33,311 personal computers with Internet access and experienced higher per capita Internet use levels than urban locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0034355211432892">Henderson et al., 2010</xref>). It is possible that itinerant counselors could assist rural clients to develop and practice using email at a public library during one face-to-face meeting to facilitate future communication rates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section34-0034355211432892">
<title>Communication skills</title>
<p>Other cited barriers to telecommunication use relate to communication barriers. For example, loss of nonverbal communication cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0034355211432892">Bischoff et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034355211432892">Collie et al., 2002</xref>) and misinterpreted meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034355211432892">Hanley, 2010</xref>) are described in the literature. In all, 53% of counselors in this study felt that written communication was less effective than verbal communication with clients, due to a lack of nonverbal cues, client literacy issues that make written communication problematic, and difficulties checking on client understanding. In addition, many counselors felt these barriers were particularly problematic for clients with cognitive and mental health impairments.</p>
<p>In their exploration of telecommunication methods to deliver alcohol counseling in rural areas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355211432892">Baca et al. (2007)</xref> found that real-time methods such as phone, tele-video, or text messaging were superior to asynchronous telecommunication methods such as email or faxes because they addressed communication barriers such as client misunderstandings. One strategy to increase synchronous exchange within the VR system is to expand web-based videoconferencing—an underused method in this study. Videoconferencing allows for real-time visual and verbal communication between remote locations and may be a particularly relevant telecommunication strategy in the counseling and guidance process for disability groups that have more intensive communication needs. Videoconferencing via Skype has similar capabilities as videophones but is less expensive for clients with existing Internet access. Videoconferencing may be more difficult to use in rural areas, however, because client access to technology may be lower, and public access sites such as libraries may not support the needed technology to make video transmission possible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section35-0034355211432892">
<title>Assistive technology</title>
<p>Counselors also noted that certain telecommunication methods were inappropriate for some types of disabilities because clients lacked the necessary assistive technology. For instance, almost a third of the counselors felt that email communication was difficult for clients who are blind/visually impaired because they lack access to screen readers. The apparent lack of accessible equipment or assistive devices was a surprise because VR has the capacity to provide assistive technology, such as screen readers, voice recognition software, or computers to help people secure and maintain employment. Given that phone and email communication is a requirement of many jobs, VR might expand provision of assistive technologies to help consumers use telecommunication equipment to better compete for available employment opportunities, while also facilitating VR client–counselor communication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section36-0034355211432892">
<title>Confidentiality</title>
<p>A major concern of telecommunication use is that client privacy may be jeopardized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355211432892">Baca et al., 2007</xref>). About one third of the counselor respondents indicated reservations about client confidentiality. In keeping with the American Counseling Association (ACA) Code of Ethics, there are several steps counselors might use to reduce confidentiality threats. For instance, using an informed consent form, counselors might describe specific threats to confidentiality when using various telecommunication methods, allowing clients to understand the risks and benefits of different methods prior to use. Counselors might also use encryption software for sensitive email communication and establish specific methods for ensuring client identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0034355211432892">American Counseling Association, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section37-0034355211432892">
<title>Technical difficulties</title>
<p>Technical difficulties are described as a major barrier to telecommunication use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355211432892">Baca et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0034355211432892">Bischoff et al., 2004</xref>; Collie et al., 2001). This finding was supported in this study, where 41% of counselors described technical problems. Although some issues, such as limited cell phone coverage or bandwidth in rural communities, are outside VR’s control, there are steps that VR agencies could take to facilitate better telecommunication between counselors and clients. For instance, technology departments could relax spam firewalls that block client emails and engage in more regular spam checks to assess what mail is blocked. Settings related to email attachment sizes might be increased to facilitate information exchange, and better procedures might be put in place for ensuring client confidentiality.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section38-0034355211432892">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Despite a large and representative sample, the study had several limitations. First, due to the exploratory nature of the study and lack of established measures, survey questions were not psychometrically tested. Second, self-report data collection methods posed response bias issues. For instance, counselors may have over- or underestimated their use of telecommunication based on their individual agency’s policies and expectations. Third, several questions asked counselors to make estimates about their client’s access to and use of telecommunication, which undoubtedly introduced errors into the estimates. Future studies will likely build on the exploratory findings presented, to provide a more refined picture of VR telecommunication use.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section39-0034355211432892" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Counselors already use and rely on some simple telecommunication methods to serve their clients, and for most counselors, telecommunication is viewed as a facilitator to VR service delivery. Additional methods, such as text messaging, appear to be an important avenue for development, particularly for serving clients who are deaf or hearing impaired. Likewise, videoconferencing may be an appropriate method for communicating with clients who have cognitive or mental health disabilities because it provides real-time communication and opportunities to assess nonverbal cues.</p>
<p>For rural clients, it is likely that expanding the use of telecommunication can be offset by reduced travel expenses for the agency. Counselors in this sample traveled an estimated 2.3 million miles per year to serve rural clients, which translates into approximately US$1.2 million per year in gas costs and approximately 51,000 hr in staff travel time—an estimate that excludes agency costs associated with client travel reimbursements to attend in-person meetings at the agency. While nothing can replace face-to-face contact, telecommunication provides one avenue for increasing VR service delivery opportunities in a time of reduced budgets.</p>
