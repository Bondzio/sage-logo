<p>This handbook is a practical guide for both the novice and experienced user research practitioner. The book lays a foundation for the background of user research and the intersection of disciplines of which practitioners should be aware. It also defines user research in many ways and displays the distinction between utility and usability and among user acceptance testing, usability testing, user research, and market research. Topics range from introductory to in-depth details about how to conduct user research and potentially problematic issues researchers should be aware of. The expert authors cover best practices as well as case studies and anecdotes.</p>
<p>As the title implies, the book covers worldwide research. The discussions about international issues when conducting user research are thorough, but they do not overrun the book. Wide page margins beg for note-taking, and the headers on each page (including chapter numbers and titles) allow the reader to easily navigate through the content.</p>
<p><italic>Handbook of Global User Research</italic> is well organized, according to a typical project timeline, and I can imagine a novice researcher following the book during project planning, implementation, and analysis. One thing I especially liked were the guidelines for evaluating quality in-country user research services. The guidelines begin with sending out a request for proposals, which is usually the first step, and a table in the book details “good” and “bad” reactions. I found that this table summed up many of my own experiences with good and bad facilities, and I wish I had seen this earlier in my career!</p>
<p>For me, the best thing about this book is that it does not cover <italic>only</italic> usability testing, as many other useful practitioner guides do, but also addresses many user research methods. I appreciate having them all in one place. Any seasoned or novice practitioner will find the user research examples and details very important to their studies.</p>
