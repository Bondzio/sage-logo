<title>Background</title>
<p>A large number of people are living with chronic diseases and thus need skills for managing their everyday life. Different types of self-management programmes have been reported to improve such skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812449925">1</xref>]. One approach to teach self-management skills is the solution-focused approach (SFA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812449925">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812449925">3</xref>], an empowerment-based approach focusing on solutions instead of problems. The aim of SFA is to help people find their skills and strengths by identifying and scaling their dreams and goals.</p>
<p>One way to convey a message is to use metaphors. They can be effective tools and are found to be effective in communicating with patients about illness and its treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812449925">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812449925"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812449925">6</xref>]. They are also used by lay leaders in self-management programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812449925">7</xref>]. However, we have found no study investigating the experience of using metaphors in conveying the principles of SFA.</p>
<p>At a hospital-based patient education centre in Central Norway, SFA was a part of self-management programmes for patients with musculoskeletal disorders, diabetes, as a 3-hour session divided on 2 days. The educational material developed for this session included a booklet for the instructor, 14 slides and a “Change Cube” (a 10×10 cm dice) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812449925">Table I</xref>); available online in English, Norwegian, and Finnish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812449925">8</xref>]. The pictures were accompanied with SFA questions and the metaphor used was “Captain of the ship”.</p>

<p>During the session the patients were invited to consider that they were the captain of their own ship. The session started with a phase where the participants were asked to identify and share something going well in their lives. Then they were given the Change Cube, and invited to discuss their strengths, dreams, and the exceptions: i.e. the periods when problems were less or did not exist. As homework, they were asked to create reachable goals.</p>
<p>The aim was to explore how participants taking part in a session based on solution-focused approach to enhance self-management skills experienced the metaphor “Captain of the ship” used in the educational material.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1403494812449925" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This was a qualitative study with semi-structured focus group interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812449925">9</xref>]. The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Ethics in Central Norway. The data were collected from April 2009 to May 2010.</p>
<p>The participants were strategically selected from self-management programmes that included the “Captain of the ship” session. Individuals attending different courses for patients with diabetes or musculoskeletal disorders were invited to participate. Everyone in the study signed a written consent before participation.</p>
<p>A total of five focus group interviews were held, four of these immediately after the self-management programme with patients from two groups on diabetes and four groups on musculoskeletal disorders, using an interview guide (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494812449925">Table II</xref>). One focus group follow-up interview was conducted 4 months later with two persons from the diabetes groups, and three persons from the musculoskeletal disorders groups.</p>

<p>The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Firstly, the first and second author independently made a summary of the first interviews to obtain an overall impression, and quotes relevant for the research question were organised into emerging categories on flipcharts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812449925">9</xref>]. These categories were discussed between all authors until all the material was analysed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1403494812449925" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 32 individuals invited, 16 agreed to participate. They were aged between 37 and 67 years, nine had diabetes and seven had musculoskeletal disorders; seven were men. The reasons given for not participating were practical obstacles. A fifth interview was performed with two persons with diabetes and three with musculoskeletal disorders.</p>
<p>Most of the participants said that they found the metaphor “Captain of the ship” very helpful. They reported that it was easy to remember, enhanced the learning process, and could be used as a practical tool in everyday situations. Furthermore, they reported that the metaphor helped them become more aware of their own responsibility for self-management. The follow-up interview confirmed that this process continued 4 months later.</p>
<sec id="section8-1403494812449925">
<title>Metaphors enable reflections</title>
<p>Most patients perceived the questions as helpful to reflect, plan their future, and make priorities in daily life. It was especially emphasised that the illustrations boosted ideas about the skills and solutions needed to reach the goal: “Seeing the illustration of ‘Hitting a reef’ [see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812449925">Table I</xref>] makes you prepared for facing some difficulties, and that makes them easier to overcome” (Female, 37 years, musculoskeletal disorder).</p>
<p>However, some found the illustrations childish and the change cube to be unpractical. Nevertheless, all said that the questions and illustrations fitted well together. Some of the participants viewed the Change Cube as a “reminder”: “The illustrations make you reflect about the topic. I didn’t like the illustrations, childish. The questions are really good, you can ask yourself again and again, think a bit, perhaps you have the answer tomorrow” (Female, 45 years, diabetes).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1403494812449925">
<title>Becoming aware of own responsibility</title>
<p>The most prominent comment was that the metaphors had helped them to see the importance of being “a captain” of their own life and to reflect on how this could be achieved. They said that the metaphors made them remember the SFA questions and thus helped them to think differently about problems. Several reported to change their attitude from passive to more active: “I see that I’m responsible for what I eat and for deciding what to do with my health situation” (Male, 67 years, diabetes).</p>
<p>The participants reported that they found a positive focus more helpful than talking about problems when trying to find solutions to everyday challenges. Furthermore, it was easier to identify resources in the creation of a solution when situations were viewed differently. One example was a participant that found that making goals for the future affected the attitude and led to a change from being “crew” to become “captain”: “The mindfulness process started when we were here. I had to make a decision: should I be a drug addict, or do my exercises? I chose the last one” (Woman, 37 years, musculoskeletal disorder, follow up).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It is long known that metaphors can have a powerful influence on the practice of medicine and the experience of illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812449925">10</xref>]. However, although obviously frequently used in self-management programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812449925">7</xref>], there is very little research on the metaphors and self-management, and even less research on metaphors and SFA. This study is the first to investigate these aspects.</p>
<p>As expected, the participants reported that they easily understood the metaphor “Captain of the ship”. It was used to convey the SFA message about using good experiences to look for solutions that improve self-management skills. The main finding was that the SFA session with the use of the “Captain of the ship” metaphor was experienced as leading to reflections and taking responsibility. This confirms findings in other studies that metaphors are helpful in getting persons to process their feelings and access inner experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812449925">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812449925"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812449925">13</xref>]. However, metaphors can also lead to misunderstandings, e.g. about medical information in cancer consultations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812449925">14</xref>], but it is not likely that a metaphor like “Captain of the ship” would obscure the SFA message.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1403494812449925" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The metaphor “Captain of the ship” was experienced as strengthening the messages from a solution-focused approach. This was confirmed in interviews 4 months later. The findings from this study support the notion that the use of metaphors like “Captain of the ship” can be helpful for patients attending self-management programmes, by making them aware of their own responsibility to improve their self-management skills.</p>
