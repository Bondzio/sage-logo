<abstract>
<p>The present study examines the respective roles of determiners and noun endings in four to ten-year-old French children’s gender attribution choices. In the context of an elicited production task, participants were introduced with determiner–noun pairs where the gender form of the article and the probabilistic gender value of noun suffixes were discordant. Results showed that suffix-congruent choices were never above chance: they were far below chance in the case of feminine suffixes and either below or at chance in the case of masculine suffixes. Results are discussed with respect to a well-known phonological scenario for French gender acquisition and with respect to the masculine as default strategy recently put forth by Boloh and Ibernon (2010).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>French is amongst those languages that have a grammatical gender system. In those systems, the noun category is subdivided into two or more subclasses such that noun subclass membership has formal consequences for members of other syntactic categories in the spoken sentence – a requirement described as agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142723711422621">Hockett, 1958</xref>). Because not all languages are gendered languages, a logically prior problem for the child is to discover whether the ambient language has a grammatical gender, which entails an initial determination of the number and defining criteria of the language’s gender subclasses (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142723711422621">Braine, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0142723711422621">Brooks, Braine, Catalano, Brody, &amp; Sudhalter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142723711422621">Carroll, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142723711422621">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142723711422621">Frigo &amp; McDonald, 1998</xref>). Among the many further problems the child will have to solve is the attribution problem: as lexical development proceeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142723711422621">Bassano, Eme, &amp; Champaud, 2005</xref>), the grammatical gender of every new noun will have to be determined readily and memorized. This latter task is known to be an almost error-free area of acquisition in French children: occasional gender attribution errors may be seen in spontaneous productions but not at a rate different from that of adults’ production slips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142723711422621">Carroll, 1989</xref>, p. 568).</p>
<p>While this could be a relatively straightforward task in languages where grammatical gender subclasses are defined conceptually, this could not be so in a language such as French. Except for about 10.5% of French nouns where natural gender corresponds to grammatical gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0142723711422621">Séguin, 1969</xref>), French gender is semantically arbitrary. Strictly speaking then, French gender subclasses appear to be distributionally defined through class dependencies: masculine nouns are nothing but nouns that co-occur with a given set of determiners – the masculine set, and likewise for the feminine nouns. However, a number of phonological and morphological regularities have been described such that noun endings or suffixes could act as probabilistic cues to noun gender subclass (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142723711422621">Lyster, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0142723711422621">Tucker, Lambert, &amp; Rigault, 1977</xref>). The French gender system would therefore fall in the category of morphophonological systems assorted with a semantic residue (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0142723711422621">Corbett, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>A well-known thesis regarding acquisition is precisely that French children would rely on such regularities to solve the attribution problem and that they would do this quite early (we do not consider here studies in the vein of Tucker et al. Those are discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711422621">Boloh &amp; Ibernon, 2010</xref>, pp. 2–3). In her classic studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723711422621">Karmiloff-Smith (1979</xref>, pp. 148–169), reported elicited production data showing that, as early as age 3–4, French children rely on the phonological form of noun endings to attribute gender to nonce nouns (experiment 8, p. 160). The phonological procedure was strong enough to overcome alternative sources of information, such as the article gender form (up to age 6, experiment 9, p. 161) or the natural gender (up to age 9, experiment 10, p. 162). According to Karmiloff-Smith, this was found to be because ‘it is through phonology that gender presents the most consistent patterns’ (pp. 167–169). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142723711422621">Karmiloff-Smith et al. (1997)</xref> later offered a slightly modified scenario: children would first have to induce the gender values of noun endings on the basis of article-noun pairs that would have to be learnt by rote. This modified account surely is more plausible: children obviously cannot start with an a priori knowledge of the gender value of French noun endings.</p>
<p>As argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711422621">Boloh and Ibernon (2010)</xref>, this induction process requires that most nouns in the input appear most of the time with an overtly gender-marked determiner and that children pay attention to it. Were either one of those two conditions not satisfied, the induction would be impossible or biased. The question, then, is why the child would bother inducing dozens of probabilistic phonological assignment rules to then rely on them to find out which gender form of the article should be used if this form is actually provided most of the time, if not always, by the input. A further, related question is whether French children’s and adults’ sensitivity to noun endings should be regarded as a mere consequence of gender learning or, depending on how it is experimentally probed, as evidence for how children learn it.</p>
<p>With respect to this latter issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711422621">Boloh and Ibernon (2010)</xref> reported elicited production data that spoke against the phonological scenario. In a task where nonce noun endings were the sole cue to gender, four to ten-year-olds and adults massively opted for the masculine gender (nonce nouns were introduced with the gender-neutral numeral <italic>trois</italic> ‘three’ and they referred to artificial objects). Suffix-congruent choices for nouns with masculine suffixes (i.e., masculine articles) were always at ceiling. Suffix-congruent scores for feminine suffixes were never above chance although their predictive values and frequency values were similar to those of masculine suffixes (the frequency of suffixes issue is addressed in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711422621">Boloh &amp; Ibernon, 2010</xref>). This led the authors to suggest that French children might learn the gender of nouns through a ‘masculine as default’ tactic: they would set the masculine as the default gender and would only bother learning and memorizing the gender of feminine nouns on the basis of determiner–noun pairs. Under this view, sensitivity to ending-gender regularities would thus only emerge as a by-product of gender learning.</p>
<p>Given those results, the responses of younger participants in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723711422621">Karmiloff-Smith’s (1979</xref>, p. 161) experiment 9 are puzzling. Children were presented with pairs such as <italic>un goltine</italic> ‘a <sub>masc</sub> goltine’ or <italic>une plichon</italic> ‘a <sub>fem</sub> plichon’ where the determiner and noun ending were discordant cues to gender. A majority of gender attribution choices were based on suffixes up to age four in the latter case, and up to age five in the former one. Responses then shifted to article-based response. More precisely, of five cases where suffix-based responses were a majority, four were actually close to chance level (ranging from 54% to 63%) while only one was clearly above chance (81%): the five-year-olds’ scores for items such as <italic>un goltine</italic>. For a variety of reasons, this trend from early suffix-based choices to later article-based ones is nevertheless striking.</p>
<p>First, the initial step logically cannot be one where gender attribution choices are suffix-based to the detriment of the article: children cannot know the gender values of suffixes in advance. Second, recent evidence actually has shown that even 25-month-olds are perfectly able to use gender information on determiners when processing and comprehending subsequent nouns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0142723711422621">Van Heugten &amp; Shi, 2009</xref>). Third, these results clearly do not fit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711422621">Boloh and Ibernon’s (2010)</xref> results for feminine suffixes: those suffixes never elicited suffix-based scores above chance level. It would therefore be surprising that it could be so in a situation where the article is provided. Fourth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723711422621">Karmiloff-Smith’s (1979)</xref> results apparently were not replicated in Karmiloff-Smith et al.’s (1997) 4;6–5;11-year- old TD controls: those participants abided by the gender form of the experimenter’s article 95% of the times. Comparing the two studies is not straightforward, however: Karmiloff-Smith et al.’s study did not report separate scores for the masculine vs. feminine items. It combined a coding scheme for attribution and one for agreement (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142723711422621">Boloh, Ibernon, Royer, Escudier, &amp; Danillon, 2009</xref>, on this issue). Finally, participants in the 1997 study were required to repeat the determiner–noun pairs before the experiment could proceed further, and this requirement was not explicitly said to hold in the 1979 study.</p>
<p>To clarify the issue, we ran two elicited production studies similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723711422621">Karmiloff-Smith’s (1979)</xref> experiment 9. We presented four to ten-year-olds with determiner-nonce noun pairs where gender cues were discordant: the probabilistic value of noun endings pointed to a gender opposite to the determiner’s. Suffixes were those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711422621">Boloh and Ibernon’s (2010)</xref> study and all had high type- and token-predictive values.</p>
<p>If <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723711422621">Karmiloff-Smith (1979)</xref> is right, one should observe a majority of suffix-based attribution choices in younger children both in the masculine and in the feminine cases (even up to age five in the case of nonce nouns with feminine suffixes such as -<italic>ine</italic>) and this should be followed by a shift to article-based ones in older participants.</p>
<p>Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711422621">Boloh and Ibernon’s (2010)</xref> results, a straightforward prediction for items with feminine suffixes is that article-based choices and not suffix-based attribution choices should be observed at all ages. This follows directly from their results for feminine suffixes and from their proposal that the gender of feminine nouns is learned on the basis of determiner–noun pairs.</p>
<p>The case for masculine suffixes is not as clear as there might be two qualitatively different reasons why suffix-congruent choices might occur, to some extent, in the present experiment. Recall that suffix-congruent scores were at ceiling at all ages for masculine suffixes in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711422621">Boloh and Ibernon’s (2010)</xref> and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723711422621">Karmiloff-Smith’s (1979</xref>: experiment 8) studies.</p>
<p>First, assuming that these were true suffix-based choices, one might expect such choices to occur in case if participants failed to pay attention to or to sustain attention to the (feminine) article provided by the experimenter: if so, participants might fall back on suffixes as cues to gender. However, under this view, any tacit knowledge of (masculine) suffix gender values could only have stemmed from prior rote learning of article-noun pairs and this would have required that attention be routinely and automatically paid to the gender form of the article. Thus such choices should not be dominant, in principle.</p>
<p>Second, assuming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711422621">Boloh and Ibernon’s (2010)</xref> proposal that the masculine is the default gender (and not a suffix-based response), one could also expect some suffix-congruent choices to happen in the case of masculine items. As such, the default is supposed to be blocked where reliable evidence for gender is detected. Because the (feminine) article form will be provided to participants, one would therefore expect a majority of (feminine) article-based choices in cases of nonce nouns with masculine suffixes. However, participants’ failure to sustain enough attention to the provided (feminine) article would of course pave the way for the (masculine) default response. Although both accounts make room for some suffix-congruent choices in the case of masculine items, they both predict that such choices should never be dominant and that they should vanish with participants’ increasing attention skills.</p>

<title>Experiment 1</title>
<sec id="section3-0142723711422621">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>One hundred and nine typically developing children from varied socioeconomic backgrounds participated in the experiment. They came from four age groups: 28 children (14 boys) aged 3;8 to 4;6 (<italic>M</italic> = 4.4, SD = .24), 28 children (15 boys) aged 4;8 to 5;8 (<italic>M</italic> = 5.1, SD = .33), 28 children (14 boys) aged 6;6 to 7;4 (<italic>M</italic> = 7.0, SD = .29) and 25 children (13 boys) aged 9;5 to 11;1 (<italic>M</italic> = 10.3, SD = .58). Children were recruited from French schools. All were monolingual French speakers of Caucasian origin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0142723711422621">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>Participants were individually interviewed and introduced to nonce nouns referring to artificial objects. They were asked to describe actions performed by an experimenter on those objects. While previous studies used pictures of objects, we used 3D artificial objects made of simple materials such as cardboard, balls, and matches, to ensure that participants referred to the object rather than the image depicting it. Six trios of objects were prepared. In each, one exemplar was green, the other was white and the third was purple.</p>
<p>The linguistic material was the one used and described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711422621">Boloh and Ibernon’s (2010)</xref> study. All nonce nouns were bi-syllabic. To guard against possible gender bias, the first syllables of nonce nouns were syllables that were either rare or non-existent as initial syllables in the French lexicon (from the <italic>Petit Robert</italic> dictionary; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0142723711422621">Rey-Debove &amp; Rey, 1993</xref>): <italic>kib</italic>- (one entry), <italic>fit</italic>- (no entry), <italic>baj</italic>- (two entries), <italic>tid</italic>- (no entry), <italic>vam</italic>- (no entry) and <italic>mav</italic>- (no entry). None violated French phonotactic rules.</p>
<p>The second syllable was to be informative regarding the gender subclass membership of the nonce noun. We therefore only selected endings with mean informative values above 90%. All endings were suffixes, although of course not all French nouns sharing those endings are suffixed nouns. The three masculine endings were -<italic>o</italic>, -<italic>on</italic> and -<italic>ier</italic>. The three feminine endings were -<italic>ette</italic>, -<italic>ise</italic> and -<italic>ière</italic>.</p>
<p>The following measures were assessed: <italic>Type predictivity</italic> refers to the proportion of noun types of the dominant gender relative to all noun types with this suffix or ending. <italic>Token predictivity</italic> refers to the proportion of noun occurrences of the dominant gender relative to the total number of occurrences of nouns with this ending or suffix (the relevant frequency measures are reported and discussed at length in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711422621">Boloh &amp; Ibernon, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>To compute these measures, we used the three following sources. First, we combined an analysis of the lexical input of Philippe and of Stephane, children whose verbal production and verbal input were recorded from age 1;1 to 3;3 for Philippe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0142723711422621">Suppes, Smith, &amp; Léveillé, 1973</xref>) and from age 2;3 to 4;9 for Stephane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0142723711422621">Rondal, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0142723711422621">Rondal, Bachelet, &amp; Peree, 1985</xref>). Both corpora were made publicly available through the CHILDES project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142723711422621">MacWhinney, 2000</xref>). Combining the two inputs (henceforth, P&amp;S input), yielded a lexical database of 1810 types (57% masculine and 43% feminine) and 26,470 tokens (55% masculine and 45% feminine). We categorized nouns according to gender and suffix/ending type, only removing special, highly frequent words such as <italic>maman</italic> ‘mommy’, <italic>papa</italic> ‘daddy’ and so on.</p>
<p>Second, we used the CD-ROM version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142723711422621">Le Robert Junior Illustré (1999)</xref>, a 20,000-word dictionary specifically designed for 8–12-year olds (henceforth, RJ). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142723711422621">Lyster (2006)</xref>, we deemed it more suitable than Tucker et al.’s tables. Because Lyster made a number of coding decisions specifically aimed at French L2 learners, we repeated the tallies using computerized search facilities, allowing us to assess type predictivity of suffixes/endings from a database of 10,967 nouns. Finally, we used the database described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0142723711422621">New, Brysbaert, Veronis, and Pallier (2007)</xref> – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142723711422621">New, Pallier, Ferrand, &amp; Matos, (2001)</xref>, a corpus of 52 million French words taken from film subtitles (henceforth, Freq Film).</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0142723711422621">Table 1</xref>, the mean type-predictive values were above 90% and similar for masculine and feminine suffixes. Tokens’ predictive values were higher for feminine than for masculine suffixes.</p>

<p>Twenty-four lists of six different nonce nouns were prepared such that each initial possible syllable (of six) and each possible suffix (of six) appeared only once in each list. Each list was subdivided into two sets of three nonce nouns, with two nouns with masculine suffixes and one noun with a feminine suffix in one set and two nouns with feminine suffixes and one noun with a masculine suffix in the other set. Each participant in each age group was presented one of the 24 lists. Within the constraints indicated above, the particular suffixes appearing in each set were systematically varied across participants. Finally, the order of sets within a list was systematically varied across participants.</p>
<p>The participant was told that he or she and the experimenter would send new objects to another person. The participant’s role would be to record a message indicating to this person in which bag (a big bag, a medium bag or a little bag) each of the three exemplars (the white one, the green one and the purple one) would be sent. Thus, while participants would focus their attention on the relation between the colors of the object, the size of the bags and the experimenter’s successive actions, their answers would reveal which gender forms they tacitly selected for the article and the adjective.</p>
<p>In order to attract and maintain younger participants’ attention we added a fictional context. The person to whom objects were sent was an imprisoned fairy who needed magical objects with special powers to escape. The participants’ task was thus to help her by indicating in which bag each object with its associated power would be found.</p>
<p>Each trio of objects was presented to the participants along with the concocted noun for the objects. Nouns were repeated three times. However, no repetition of the determinant-noun pair was required from participants. In doing so, we did not follow what was done in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142723711422621">Karmiloff-Smith et al. (1997)</xref> study, which apparently was not done either in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723711422621">Karmiloff-Smith’s (1979)</xref> study. Children of those ages have been shown to be able to learn new nouns on the basis of three occurrences only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0142723711422621">Markson &amp; Bloom, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, we deemed this option qualitatively closer to what French children are normally exposed to in natural settings, that is, if not regarding quantitative aspects, at least regarding the repetition requirement of the determiner–noun pair.</p>
<p>Nonce nouns were introduced with an indefinite article with a gender form opposite to the one suggested by the noun ending, as follows: <italic>Voici une kibon, une autre kibon et encore une kibon. Maintenant je mets chaque objet dans un sac et tu dis où je les mets</italic>. (‘Here is a <sub>fem</sub> kibon, another <sub>fem</sub> kibon and one <sub>fem</sub> more kibon. Now I put each of them in a bag and you say where I put them’.). Nouns with feminine endings would appear with a masculine determiner, for example, <italic>un bajette</italic> (‘a <sub>masc</sub> bajette’).</p>
<p>Participants were given the first set during a morning session and the second during an afternoon session. Finally, to ensure that participants understood the game and knew the color adjectives, two pre-tests/trainings were given to them with familiar objects, one referred to with a masculine noun and the other referred to with a feminine noun: three pens (<italic>stylo</italic> ‘pen <sub>masc</sub>’) and then three erasers (<italic>gomme</italic> ‘eraser <sub>fem</sub>’). No feedback on gender was given.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0142723711422621">
<title>Scoring</title>
<p>The dependent variable was the number of times a participant chose a definite or indefinite article whose gender form fitted the probabilistic value of the noun suffix (e.g., choosing <italic>un</italic> ‘a <sub>masc</sub>’ or <italic>le</italic> ‘the <sub>masc</sub>’ to refer to a <italic>kibon</italic>, or choosing <italic>une</italic> ‘a <sub>fem</sub>’ or <italic>la</italic> ‘the <sub>fem</sub>’ to refer to a <italic>bajette</italic>). The adjective form was not taken into consideration in scoring for attribution (on this issue, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711422621">Boloh &amp; Ibernon, 2010</xref>). Given that French has only two genders, the only available responses are a masculine article or a feminine article. Due to the pragmatics of our experimental situation, there were no alternative responses such as a plural or a numerical adjective. For a given ending, scores could range from 0 to 3. For the three masculine endings as well as for the three feminine endings, scores could range from 0 to 9.</p>

<p>Preliminary inspection of the data revealed no sex differences. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0142723711422621">Table 2</xref>, suffix-congruent scores were in the 30–50% range for masculine suffixes, without meaningful variation with age: scores were either at chance or below chance (<italic>t</italic> tests). Suffix-congruent scores were almost non-existent for feminine suffixes, ranging from 5–13% and they were always below chance. These data were submitted to a 4 (age group) by 2 (suffix gender) mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA), with repeated measures on the latter factor. This analysis yielded a non-significant main effect for age, <italic>F</italic>(3,105) = 1.58, ns, <italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = .02, and a significant main effect of the gender value of suffixes, <italic>F</italic>(1, 105) = 57.26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, <italic>η</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = .96.

<p>Non-parametric analyses (Mann-Whitney) of the effect of age on scores for individual suffixes yielded no significant results. Sign tests (with Bonferroni correction) run-on data pooled across age showed no difference between items with masculine suffixes and only one significant difference between items with feminine suffixes: there were more suffix-congruent choices in the case of -<italic>ette</italic> than in the case of -<italic>ière</italic> (<italic>p</italic> = .012). Every masculine suffix got higher suffix-congruent scores than feminine suffixes (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0007, at least), except in the case of the -<italic>ette</italic> vs. -<italic>o</italic> comparison.</p>
<p>Thus, as predicted, participants almost never supplied suffix-based choices in the case of items with feminine suffixes: whatever the age group, they consistently relied on the gender form of the provided article. Suffix-congruent choices were observed for items with masculine suffixes, but they were never above chance. Before generalizing, it is wiser, however, to first increase the suffix sample size. To expand the database, we now examine the possible effects of another set of six suffixes on gender attribution choices, including the -<italic>ine</italic> suffix for which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723711422621">Karmiloff-Smith (1979</xref>, experiment 9) found very high suffix-based scores in five-year olds. Because there was no effect for age in Experiment 1, Experiment 2 will only report data from the most relevant age groups, i.e., four to seven-year olds.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723711422621">Karmiloff-Smith (1979</xref>, experiment 9) reported elicited production data which, she claimed, showed that, up to age five, French children would rely on noun ending rather than on the provided article to attribute gender to nonce nouns. They would then shift to article-based attribution choices. Our results did not support her claim: whatever the age group, the kind of suffixes <italic>(</italic>i.e., masculine or feminine) or the particular individual suffixes, suffix-congruent choices were nowhere above chance level.</p>
<p>The clearest discrepancy with Karmiloff-Smith’s results was found for feminine suffixes. Recall that her five-year-olds supplied 81% suffix-congruent scores in this condition. Our suffix-congruent scores never went above 13%, without variation with age. This is precisely what we predicted from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711422621">Boloh and Ibernon (2010)</xref> results: because feminine suffixes were unable to elicit suffix-congruent scores above chance in their study, such scores should have been even lower in a condition where the article was provided. Indeed, children just abided by the experimenter’s article gender form and disregarded feminine suffixes as potential cues to gender, whatever the tacit knowledge one assumes they might have accumulated about them at a given age.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we did find a number of suffix-congruent choices in the case of masculine suffixes. The pattern of data obtained by Karmiloff-Smith in this age range was not replicated, however: suffix-congruent choices were not dominant in four-year-olds and there was no subsequent trend towards article-based choices. In fact, suffix-congruent scores showed no meaningful variations with age, they were never above chance and they were below chance in the five-year-old group in Experiment 1 and in the five- and seven-year-old groups in Experiment 2. More generally, our results in the masculine case could only provide scant support for the phonological scenario for gender acquisition in French: assuming that suffix-congruent choices had been true suffix-based choices in the current experiment, they nowhere won over the article.</p>
<p>As discussed above, suffix-congruent choices for masculine suffixes are regarded as default responses and not as true suffix-based ones by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711422621">Boloh and Ibernon (2010)</xref>. The current experiments were of course not designed to decide between those two alternatives. However, from this perspective, our results also suggest that this (masculine) default cannot be so easily blocked by a couple of occurrences of (feminine) determiner–noun pairs: increasing amount of exposure or increased attention would be required. Regarding the latter issue, there are reasons to consider that matters of attention were at stake in our experimental situations.</p>
<p>Although our participants tended to be either suffix-congruent or article-congruent for a given ending, the distributions of scores for the grouped data from masculine nonce nouns were not bimodal, except in seven-year-olds in Experiment 1: there was no stable dichotomy such that, across items, some children would have been suffix-congruent while others would have been article-congruent. Rather, there were within-participant variations from item to item. Because all masculine suffixes had similar type- and token-predictive values and because the input statistics are presumably the same for all children, this would suggest that the resulting groups’ scores might also have been due to a lack of attention: on some occasions, children might have failed to pay enough attention to the experimenter’s (feminine) article or they may have failed to sustain this attention while answering. This would have paved the way for the default gender which would have popped in on any occasion.</p>
<p>Arguably, a suffix-based account combined with effects of attention can also be considered. For example, one could claim that because concocted nouns were new while determiners were not, participants paid more attention to the noun phonological shape than to the determiner’s. For lack of sufficient attention to the latter, they fell back on the noun’s suffix for gender attribution. However, being ‘new’ is just the characteristic of every (new) noun that arrive in the child’s input at every step of his or her lexical development. Therefore, the difficulty would be to explain why participants would have devoted more attention to endings than to determiners, given that the extraction of suffix gender values can only stem from attention to determiners during prior rote learning of determiner–noun pairs. Because this logical priority to determiners must have had a long developmental history, further empirical support for this suffix-based view would be required here. For example, an increase with age of suffix-congruent responses for masculine items could have provided such a support. As indicated, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723711422621">Karmiloff-Smith (1979)</xref> actually found the converse trend in the 4–10 age range, while our data showed no age effect within the same age range.</p>
<p>Relevant to this issue however, are the 15-year-old controls’ data from Boloh et al.’s (2009) Williams syndrome study: 15-year-olds’ suffix-congruent scores for items with masculine suffixes in the very same condition dropped to 20%. Whatever TD participants might know and do with masculine suffixes, it would be paradoxical that their tacit knowledge of the probabilistic gender values of those suffixes would impoverish with age. Rather, it is more likely that older participants (i.e., the 15-year-old TDs) simply were more able than younger ones (i.e., our 4–10-year olds) to sustain the required attention to the (feminine) provided article, which, in turn, led to a more efficient blocking of the (masculine) default gender.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have shown that there is no developmental stage in the 4–10 range such that children rely mainly on noun suffixes to the detriment of the article. This was abundantly clear in the case of items with feminine suffixes. Data from items with masculine endings also did not support anything close to a strong phonological scenario for French gender acquisition. Rather, the pattern of data obtained here is consistent with the interpretation that French children rely on a strategy whereby they assume the masculine as the default gender.</p>
<p>This latter proposal is only meant to work for languages whose gender systems are very close to the French one, and surely not for any gender system not even for two-gendered languages, for which a default could apply (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0142723711422621">Roca, 1989</xref>): as each language confronts the child with a particular problem-space, different scenarios might be recruited for acquisition (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723711422621">Karmiloff-Smith, 1979</xref>, p. 235). For example, the protracted acquisition of a complex two-gendered system such as Welsh might follow a piecemeal, item-by-item route rather than a rule-based one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0142723711422621">Thomas &amp; Gathercole, 2007</xref>). In the case of French, where gender attribution is virtually error-free, item-by-item learning of determiner-pairs would be required for feminine nouns and these would block the masculine default rule. While phonological regularities might play a strong role in gender attribution per se in a language such as Spanish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0142723711422621">Pereiz-Pereira, 1991</xref>), their primary role in a language such as French would be to assist the child in discovering that the ambient language has a gender system to begin with, a rather different problem (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142723711422621">Braine, 1987</xref>). The reason why the masculine ends up as the default gender in French might stem from the particulars of this phonologically based discovery procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723711422621">Boloh &amp; Ibernon, 2010</xref>, for further details).</p>
