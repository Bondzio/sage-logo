<abstract>
<p>Cerebral hemorrhage is a common disease of older adults, which could increase the risk of cognitive impairment. Electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics can be analyzed to investigate the applied value in the assessment of cognitive impairment of the patients with cerebral hemorrhage. One hundred eighty-two patients (including patients with cognitive impairment [CHCI] and patients with cognitive normality [CHNC] with cerebral hemorrhage, and 120 normal healthy persons [control; CN]) were recruited between July 2008 to March 2012 at the department of neurology. All patients were analyzed by EEG, and analysis results were compared to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale, using the methods of correlation analysis, clustering analysis, and concordance analysis. The results indicated that patients with CHCI had significantly lower EEG beta power (0.814 ± 0.113 mcV<sup>2</sup>) relative to CHNC (1.601 ± 0.186 mcV<sup>2</sup>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) or CN group (1.713 ± 0.201 mcV<sup>2</sup>, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Significant negative correlation was found between the beta power and hemorrhage region, age, hemorrhage size, hemorrhage amount (<italic>r</italic>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage is a subtype of intracranial hemorrhage that occurs within the brain tissue. Cerebral hemorrhage can be caused by brain trauma, or it can occur spontaneously in hemorrhagic stroke. Nontraumatic cerebral hemorrhage is a spontaneous bleed in the brain tissue.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412471336">1</xref>
</sup> Cerebral hemorrhage may disrupt cerebral circuitry, impact function on specific cognitive abilities, and cause cognitive dysfunction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412471336">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412471336">3</xref>
</sup> Cognitive impairment refers to a syndrome in which a cognitive loss, typically in the domain of semantic memory, is measurable on neuropsychological test batteries, and is of sufficient strength to cause serious social, vocational, or other functional impairment to the patient.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059412471336">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059412471336">5</xref>
</sup> In contrast to well-documented cognitive consequences of ischemic stroke,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059412471336">6</xref>
</sup> frequencies and diagnosis of cognitive impairment after cerebral hemorrhage have not been systematically studied.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1550059412471336">7</xref>
</sup> In recent years, cognitive impairment post cerebral hemorrhage has become a hot topic, but study is in the preliminary stage, and no cognitive function assessment system is identified in China.</p>
<p>EEG is a relatively cheap, widely available, noninvasive diagnostic tool reflecting cerebral function, which may be useful for the evaluation of cognitive impairment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059412471336">8</xref>
</sup> Although EEG records lack specific findings in more common causes of cognitive complaints, it may still have value when there is diagnostic doubt. For example, signs of diffuse EEG slowing are useful in differentiating healthy humans from patients with Alzheimer disease (AD).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059412471336">9</xref>
</sup> Smits et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1550059412471336">10</xref>
</sup> showed that specific types of EEG abnormalities are associated with different cognitive profiles in AD. Therefore, EEG may provide biological support in terms of brain functioning for variability in cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>We selected the abnormality of beta power of EEG to study cognitive impairment post cerebral hemorrhage. Intergroup statistical comparisons of EEG bandwidth power of patients with CHCI and patients with CHNC revealed significant differences limited to the beta frequency range. There were no significant differences between the patients with CHCI and CHNC for other bandwidth, delta, theta, alpha, and gamma. There are no other studies of the relationship between EEG abnormality and cognitive impairment in cerebral hemorrhage. In this study, a specific pattern recognition technique (<italic>K</italic>-means clustering algorithm) was utilized to classify patients with cerebral hemorrhage compared to CN. EEG characteristics were analyzed, and the applied value was investigated in the assessment of cognitive impairment of patients with cerebral hemorrhage.</p>
<p>EEG recordings were done within 24 hours post cerebral hemorrhage, when computed tomography (CT) scan is often noninformative, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not available on the first day.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>One hundred eighty-two patients with cerebral hemorrhage disease were recruited from July 2008 to August 2012 at the department of neurology. One hundred eighty-two patients with cerebral hemorrhage were included. For the CHCI group, the average age was 59.57 + 10.7 years, including 63 male and 50 female cases. The course of disease was 8.68 + 1.12 hours, and the educational level was 8.13+0.63 years. For the CHNC group, the average age was 61.37 + 6.64 years, including 39 male and 30 female cases. The course of disease was 7.05 + 1.31 hours, and the educational level was 7.09+0.49 years. The mean age of the CN group was 60.46 +11.2 years, including 71 male and 49 female cases, and the educational level was 7.58+0.35 years. Informations such as hypertension and hyperglycemia are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1550059412471336">Table 1</xref>. There were no significant differences among CHCI, CHNC, and CN groups for each parameter. The amount of hemorrhage in CHCI was more than the CHNC group, and the difference was significant (P = .014). The size and age of the hemorrhage in CHCI were also bigger than the CHNC group (P = .006 and .013, respectively).</p>

<title>Diagnostic Criteria and Trial Grouping</title>
<p>Inclusion criteria (1) according to the Chinese national cerebral hemorrhage diagnostic code; (2) normal social behavior and having no mental sickness before the disease; (3) onset for the first time according to the CT scanning and MRI; and (4) no cognitive impairment diagnosed before cerebral hemorrhage. Exclusion criteria included (1) history of cognitive impairment caused by other explicit pathogenesis such as Parkinson disease; (2) infection, tumor, and autoimmune disease; (3) use of psychoactive drugs; (4) inability to communicate, juvenile-onset psychosis; (5) other psychiatric diseases; (6) uncooperative; and (7) current or previous uncontrolled or complicated systemic diseases (including type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus).</p>
<p>A series of standardized diagnostic and severity instruments were employed, including MoCA Beijing version, Hamilton Depression Scale (to exclude depressive disorder), instrumental and basic activities of daily living, clinical Dementia Rating Scale, and the Hachinski Ischemic Scale (to exclude AD). In addition, patients also underwent diagnostic neuroimaging procedures by MRI. Using the above diagnostic methods, other causes of cognitive impairment were ruled out.</p>
<p>All patients underwent a Beijing version MoCA assessment at 12 weeks post cerebral hemorrhage, including (1) orientation to time and place; (2) executive functions; (3) short-term memory recall, and so on. Totally, 30 points are performed in the MoCA test, and the score of 26 or more is considered normal. MoCA testing lasts approximately 10 minutes. In all, 113 scored less than 26, accounting for 62%, and were classified as CHCI; 69 cases scored more than 26, for 38%, and were classified as CHNC.</p>
<p>One hundred twenty cases selected from health examination were included as the CN group, with no history of psychoactive or neurological disease, brain injuries, and other important organ diseases and no neurological system or body abnormalities. No abnormalities were found by CT and MRI inspection. MoCA scores more than 26 were classified CN.</p>

<sec id="section5-1550059412471336">
<title>The EEG Recordings</title>
<p>EEG electrode placement (Jasper 10-20 electrode placement) was used to record EEG activity continuously from 16 channels. (Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, F4, F8, T3, C3, C4, T4, T5, P3, P4, T6, O1, and O2). Left and right mastoids served as reference, and ground electrode was in front of Fz. Data were recorded with a bandpass filter of 0.5 to 50 Hz and digitized at a sampling rate of 250 Hz (BrainAmp, BrainProducts, Germany). Electrode–skin impedance was set below 5 kΩ. Horizontal and vertical electrooculogram (0.5-50 Hz bandpass) monitored eye movements. EEG data were then analyzed and fragmented off line in consecutive epochs of 2 seconds, with a frequency resolution of 0.5 Hz.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059412471336">11</xref>
</sup> The average number of epochs analyzed was 140. EEG epochs with ocular, muscular, and other types of artifacts were preliminarily identified by a computerized automatic procedure. Sporadic blinking artifacts were corrected by an autoregressive method validated by Moretti et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1550059412471336">12</xref>
</sup> Three independent experimenters, blind to the diagnosis, visually confirmed the EEG segments to be accepted for further analysis.</p>

<title>The EEG Analysis Techniques</title>
<p>Applying a set of digital filters, the EEG signal was divided into alpha, beta, delta, and theta bandwidths. These analyses yielded average power estimates for each frequency range, at 16 EEG channels for each participant. Patients with CHCI had significantly lower beta power relative to the CN group in 12 of the 16 channels. Only 4 channels, 2(F3-C3), 4(P3-O1), 7(C4-P4), and 14(F8-T4), did not differ between CHCI and NC in relative beta power. Eight channels (1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 16) exhibited the largest differences in relative beta power. Beta bandwidth signals of the above 8 EEG channels were selected for patients with post cerebral hemorrhage. First, an 8-dimensional characteristic vector was obtained, then measuring every individual to obtain a characteristic vector array. The <italic>K</italic>-means clustering algorithm was used to classify the characteristic vector array. This algorithm assumes a user-specified number of classification categories, and then calculates the centroid (mean EEG power) for each category (group or cluster). The value of the centroid is then iteratively adjusted until the differences between data points and the centroid for each group is minimized. The steps in the algorithm are as follows according to Baker’s report:<sup>

<title>Clustering Analysis</title>
<p>The beta power of 182 patients with cerebral hemorrhage was mapped on the 3 higher channels, 1, 10, and 12, to display the 3-dimensional map of EEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1550059412471336">Figure 3</xref>). Relative beta power from 67 cases out of the total cognitively normal (MoCA scores more than 26) post cerebral hemorrhage (69 cases) distributed in interval I (0.8, 1.5); and 110 cases out of the total cognitive impairment (MoCA scores less than 26) post cerebral hemorrhage (113 cases) distributed in interval II (0, 1.0).

In all, sixty-seven cases with cognitive normality, analyzed by EEG, were consistent with the MoCA scoring, and sensitivity was 97.1%. With Kappa analysis, we found that there was a better concordance between beta power analysis (interval II) and MoCA cognitive impairment (Kappa = 0.851,<italic> P</italic>&lt; .001).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cerebral hemorrhage can cause different degrees of cognitive impairment. Neuropsychological testing is the most commonly used tool in clinical diagnosis for cognitive impairment. A person’s score can be affected by different diagnostic codes in different neuropsychological scales. Yoo et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1550059412471336">14</xref>
</sup> used the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to assess cognitive impairment in 211 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. In the present study, MoCA scoring was employed, and the cognitive impairment rate was 62%. Other scientists found that MoCA is more valuable in predicting vascular cognitive impairment than MMSE (0.667 vs 0.626), suggesting it would be best for clinical practice in the Chinese population.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1550059412471336">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>EEG abnormality can reflect many kinds of disease-caused cognitive impairment such as cerebral infarcts, AD, Parkinson disease, etc.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1550059412471336">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1550059412471336">17</xref>
</sup> Kamei<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1550059412471336">18</xref>
</sup> also found that EEG could identify subtle functional changes preceding structural or metabolic deficits in progressive cognitive impairment. Automated pattern recognition EEG techniques can also identify mild cognitive impairment progressing to the other diseases.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1550059412471336">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the present study, we selected 8 EEG channels to study cognitive impairment. There were significant differences of beta power between CHCI and CN or CHCI and CHNC. Therefore, we conclude that beta power analysis can be used to reflect cerebral hemorrhage in patients with and without cognitive impairment. Beta power was negatively correlated with 4 factors: hemorrhage region, age, hemorrhage size, and hemorrhage amount. Poels et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1550059412471336">20</xref>
</sup> also found that cerebral microbleeds with different hemorrhage amount, size, and region jointly contribute to cognitive impairment, consistent with our results.</p>
<p>Patients with cerebral hemorrhage were divided into 2 subgroups based on their EEG profiles, using the <italic>K</italic>-means clustering technique. By employing this algorithm, 67 of the 69 CHNC patients were categorized as members of subgroup 1 (interval I), and 110 of the 113 CHCI patients were categorized as subgroup 2 (interval II). The classification used the 8 EEG channels (1, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 16) exhibiting the largest differences in relative beta power. We noted that beta power of patients on the highest channels (1, 10, and 12) displaying the 3-dimensional graph showed the difference directly. <italic>K</italic>-means clustering analysis for cognitive impairment or normality were more consistent with CoMA scoring, and sensitivity was 97.3% and respectively. We also analyzed concordance between beta power clustering analysis and CoMA scoring (Kappa = 0.899). Kappa value more than 0.75 was thought to be a better concordance. Therefore, <italic>K</italic>-means clustering analysis showed better concordance with MoCA scoring of cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>We speculated that the beta power difference among patients with cerebral hemorrhage may distinguish those patients with cerebral hemorrhage who are likely to progress to cognitive impairment from those less likely to do so. Our preliminary results also indicate some promise for such an approach. Assessment of beta power in interval III, including 3 patients who were identified as cognitively impaired by MoCA scoring, however, did not indicate progression to cognitive impairment in follow-up. Two patients with cerebral hemorrhage, in beta power interval III and assessed by MoCA, developed cognitive impairment. This suggests that EEG beta power may avoid the false positives or false negatives indicated by MoCA. Interestingly there was an exception (marked with the circle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1550059412471336">Figure 2</xref>): a patient, with a larger hemorrhage, 2 hemorrhage regions and higher hemorrhage amount, had EEG beta power relatively higher than those with similar symptoms. Whether beta power could predict long-term cognitive impairment of those patients with cerebral hemorrhage needs further study. Beta power was helpful even before any clinical signs or behavioral manifestations of cognitive impairment were actually exhibited in the patients with cerebral hemorrhage.</p>
<p>In conclusion, EEG holds considerable promise for the assessment of cognitive impairment post cerebral hemorrhage, which is related to the hemorrhage region, hemorrhage size, hemorrhage amount, and age.</p>
