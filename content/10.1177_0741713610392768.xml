<abstract>
<p>The author identifies six flaws that commonly occur in explanations of transformative learning, and suggests that transformative learning may not exist as an identifiable phenomenon. He proposes that we abandon the term <italic>transformative learning</italic>, and adopt the straightforward term <italic>good learning</italic>. Good learning, he argues, has nine aspects.</p>

<p>Several years ago, two friends of mine sought major changes in their lives. Both were in their early 50s, had jobs, but felt they were coasting. One went to a weekend workshop organized by an enterprise with the word “transformation” in its title. It unsettled her badly. She tried amateur acting, having been told the experience would take her out of herself, went on stage, and came away deflated.</p>
<p>The other friend enrolled in a university and, over a period of years, completed a degree in botany. She entered the program as someone who was not a botanist and emerged as someone who was. She changed status, changed her sense of self, and changed the way she related to the world. Even so, she did not go through the process described in the literature as “transformative learning.” She did not identify and critically reflect on her assumptions, revise those assumptions, and then set about acting on these new understandings. She studied botany.</p>
<p>I know that an anecdote proves nothing. But it does make me think this mutinous thought: perhaps there is no such thing as transformative learning; perhaps there is just good learning.</p>
<sec id="section1-0741713610392768">
<title>Looking for Examples</title>
<p>Sharan Merriam, Rosemary Caffarella, and Lisa Baumgartner (2007) talk of transformative learning as a “dramatic, fundamental change” (p. 130). Their language is strong but then <italic>transform</italic> is a strong word. The definition in the <italic>Oxford English Dictionary</italic> is uncompromising. <italic>Transform</italic> means to change the form of, to change into another shape or form, to change in character and condition, to alter in function or nature, to metamorphose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741713610392768">Simpson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741713610392768">Stephen Brookfield (2000)</xref> uses biblical and geophysical imagery. For him, transformative learning has “connotations of an epiphanic, or apocalyptic, cognitive event—a shift in the tectonic plates of one’s assumptive clusters” (p. 139). Jack Mezirow, in his earlier writing, uses the language of imprisonment and escape. He talks of how we are “caught” in our own history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741713610392768">Mezirow, 1978</xref>), of the psychocultural assumptions that “constrain” us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741713610392768">Mezirow, 1981</xref>), and of the “libidinal, linguistic, epistemic, institutional, or environmental forces that limit our options” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741713610392768">Mezirow, 1991</xref>, p. 87). Transformative learning is a process of “emancipation” from these kinds of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741713610392768">Mezirow, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741713610392768">1991</xref>).</p>
<p>But does the practice ever match up to the rhetoric? Claims can often be met by counterclaims. Here, for example, are the titles and my (very brief) extracts from three papers in the proceedings of the <italic>Sixth International Conference on Transformative Learning</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0741713610392768">Vlosak, Kielbaso, &amp; Radford, 2005</xref>):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Fostering Transformative Learning Through Faculty Development: A professor was worried about her ignorance of classroom technology, but she took up the challenge, and by the end of a development program was using technology extensively, giving presentations about her teaching strategies, and acting as a resource to others. She had “raised the bar” for her colleagues, and “changed.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741713610392768">Anderson &amp; Kimmel, 2005</xref>, pp. 9-14)</p>
<p>Cooperative Inquiry as a Tool for Transformative Learning: Five community organizers engaged in six cycles of reflection and action to help people be “more strategic, creative and conceptual in their thinking.” They reported that they had “learned a great deal,” “transformed their practices,” and put “ their new knowledge to work in training models, lesson plans, organizing meetings and even sermons.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741713610392768">Alcantara, Yorks, &amp; Kovari, 2005</xref>, pp. 5-8)</p>
<p>Transformation as a Sociocultural Phenomenon: Participants completed a leadership program “believing they had a deeper understanding of themselves . . . a recognition of some of the hidden biases that had been shaping their beliefs and behaviors, and a new understanding of the value and power of diversity and collaboration.” One graduate learned to trust others; another recognized that his ego was keeping him from participating in teamwork; and a third gained confidence in the value she provided to the group. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741713610392768">Connor, 2005</xref>, pp. 71-77)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In all three papers, claims are made that the learning was transformative, against which I can make the counterclaim that, from the evidence presented, it was not. Some of the learners experienced significant change, but there is nothing exceptional about that. The one constant in all definitions of learning is change. And the changes are of the kind to be expected from well-resourced and competently delivered programs. The university professor set about gaining <italic>knowledge.</italic> The community organizers took time out to enhance their organizing <italic>skills.</italic> And the graduates of the leadership program developed new <italic>attitudes</italic>, of trust, humility, and confidence, respectively. Effective learning took place, and I can adequately comprehend it in terms of those old evaluation stalwarts: knowledge, skills, and attitudes.</p>
<p>Kathleen King intersperses her book <italic>Bringing Transformative Learning to Life</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741713610392768">2005</xref>) with 15 narratives, which she presents as examples of transformative learning; and again all I can do is offer a contrary view. The programs and sessions described are examples of good educational practice. And the stories about individual learners, except for one who gets drawn into a personal tussle with her religious faith, follow a familiar pattern of adult learning: the learner enters the program with a mix of apprehension and anticipation, acquires new knowledge and skills, and grows in confidence and self-esteem. In some cases the confidence feeds on itself, the process becomes reflexive, and the learning becomes profound; but even so, I do not have to go to transformative learning theory to explain it.</p>
<p>And again, in a book called <italic>Transformative Learning in Practice</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741713610392768">Mezirow, Taylor, &amp; Associates, 2009</xref>), there are accounts of good practice; of challenging, introspective teaching and learning; of learning leading to changes in professional identity; and of educational interventions resulting in political mobilization. But in none of them can I find an example of learning resulting in what I would dare describe as a metamorphosis.</p>
<p>But . . . but . . . there must be examples of genuinely transformative learning, since the literature about it is voluminous. Perhaps the problem resides in the fact that Jack Mezirow set the bar too high. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741713610392768">Mezirow (1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741713610392768">1991</xref>) developed his theory of transformative learning based on research in the early 1970s into women participating in college reentry programs. Some of these women, particularly those who had already been leading adult lives in the 1950s and 1960s, must have undergone significant change, simply to get to the campus gates. For long periods of adulthood, they would have lived as second-class citizens, subservient to the men who were their partners, employers, politicians, priests, and public commentators, and they would have been obliged to accept second-class expectations in their professional and personal lives. But a time had come when they found these gratuitous and punitive restrictions intolerable, and they had sought out a college education as an expression of, or a means to achieve, major change in their lives. Among the women interviewed, there must have been glorious stories of emancipation.</p>
<p>In an article published in 1981, Mezirow discusses agency. In some cases, a person shifts allegiance from one reference group to another but does so without exercising agency. The change is made uncritically and the person remains, in effect, an object of social history. Some religious conversions can be like this. The group the person is taking orders from may be new, but she or he is still taking orders. In contrast, Mezirow describes shifts of allegiance made in contractual solidarity with a new reference group. In this case the person acts with agency, exercises independence of judgment, and negotiates any commitments with the new group on her or his own terms. This person assumes the role of subject and plays a creative part in constructing her or his own life.</p>
<p>Ironically, by paying regard to this concept of agency, we can reinterpret Mezirow’s original research, casting doubt on the transformative nature of the experience of some, at least, of the women interviewed. These women had returned to learning in a period marked by the growing force of the women’s movement. Mezirow’s research took place just after the publication of massively influential books by writers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741713610392768">Germaine Greer (1970)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741713610392768">Kate Millett (1970)</xref>. Women’s consciousness-raising groups were springing up across the “Western world.” The magazine <italic>Spare Rib</italic>, that superb mouthpiece for the English women’s movement, was up and running in London. In Australia, feminists, quickly nicknamed “femocrats,” were applying for strategic posts within the public service to influence government policy on issues of gender. In 1971, <italic>Le Nouvel Observateur</italic>, a leading French weekly magazine, published a manifesto signed by 343 prominent women, all admitting to complicity in an illegal abortion and calling on their government to decriminalize the procedure. Could it be that the women in Mezirow’s study (or some of them) were responding to the trends of the day? Could it be that, despite appearances, there was little agency in their actions? Could it be that they were not subjects but objects, being swept along by the flow of social history, as we all are much of the time, changed by accident and not by design?</p>

<title>Verifying Transformative Learning</title>
<p>My suspicion that transformative learning does not exist is strengthened by the fact that the resulting transformations can only be verified by the learners themselves. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741713610392768">King (2009)</xref> has developed a survey to evaluate transformative learning and, in the course of discussing it, she provides the following list of affirmations from adult learners “who have experienced a ‘perspective transformation’ . . .” and who “are empowered and radically changed because of it”:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I see things really differently now.</p>
<p>I am much more open-minded to views other than mine.</p>
<p>I never understood what my career really meant.</p>
<p>I have had such a radical change in my view of issues.</p>
<p>I have more self-confidence than I ever dreamed possible. (p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Affirmations have no guaranteed validity. We cannot assume that people have undergone a radical change because they say they have undergone a radical change. (Witness the claims of repeat perpetrators of domestic violence.) And we cannot assume that people have taken on more power—that they are now more able to carry out their own will despite resistance, to use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0741713610392768">Max Weber’s (1968)</xref> definition of power—simply because they say they see things differently.</p>
<p>The substantive questions in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741713610392768">King’s (2009)</xref> survey elicit answers that are based on self-assessment, and so the answers will be subjective. This is in keeping with other research in the field. Edward Taylor published two reviews of research into transformative learning, one in 1998 and another in 2007. He found that research processes had become more sophisticated during the intervening years but that the majority of studies continued to use “qualitative research designs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741713610392768">Taylor, 2007</xref>, pp. 176-177).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741713610392768">Patricia Cranton (2000)</xref> accepts that gathering “objective experimental or scientific evidence” is “a methodology inappropriate to understanding transformative learning” and argues for “a broader definition of empirical—that which is derived from observation and experience” (pp. 191-192). I take this to mean that, when push comes to shove, researchers must rely on getting learners and teachers to tell their stories.</p>
<p>Stories can provide a window on to insight, but they contain invention as well as record. They are unreliable and that is their delight. As I said of my anecdote above, stories prove nothing. This leads me to wonder whether transformative learning only exists in the realm of theory. Perhaps it is a plaything of the mind, about which we can argue the toss, but which has little or no basis in everyday practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0741713610392768">
<title>Degree or Kind</title>
<p>Whether transformative learning happens or not, there is a literature constructed on the belief that it does, and I suggest that this literature has several commonly occurring flaws. The first is in the form of a false premise: that transformative learning differs from other learning in kind rather than degree. Mezirow made this claim in 1978:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There are certain challenges or dilemmas in everyday life that cannot be resolved by the usual way we handle problems—that is, by simply learning more about them or learning how to cope with them more effectively. Life becomes untenable, and we undergo significant phases of reassessment and growth in which familiar assumptions are challenged and new directions and commitments are charted. (p. 101)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But any learning effectively done involves reassessment and growth. The learner recognizes that she or he knows something new, that she or he could not perform a certain task and now can, or that she or he has a new viewpoint. Teach a person to strip down and reassemble an irrigation pump, and that person has changed. Like the botanist, from nonknower the person has become knower.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741713610392768">Robert Kegan (2000)</xref> distinguishes between “informative learning,” which brings about changes in “<italic>what</italic> we know,” and “transformative learning,” which brings about changes in “<italic>how</italic> we know” (p. 50). But the distinction is not so easily made in practice. In any effective act of learning, cognition and metacognition both occur—we come to know, and we become aware of our coming to know—and it is difficult to isolate one process from the other. Kegan talks of “two kinds of learning,” but I consider it more realistic to see his informative and transformative learning as two manifestations of the one activity. In the same discussion, Kegan makes an associated distinction between “socialized” and “self-authoring” epistemologies; and again I do not think the distinction works. Received knowledge and personally constructed knowledge inevitably mesh and become indistinguishable, both in our understanding of our world and ourselves, and in any theory we might adopt about the origins and nature of knowledge.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741713610392768">Cranton (2006</xref>, p. 1) tells us that in her programs on transformative learning she and her students “inevitably” come to a point in their discussions “where everything seems transformative.” In effect, the students are making the point that all learning involves change. And they are challenging the idea that one form of learning that results in significant change is deemed “transformative” and another that also results in significant change—learning a new computer skill and learning to read are examples given—is not. Cranton goes on to say that it takes her and her students some time to work their way out of these dilemmas. And I am not surprised. If group after group <italic>inevitably</italic> come to an early conclusion that all learning is essentially of the same kind, then there may be something in what they say. Of course, if we abandon the distinction between transformative and nontransformative and accept that all acts of learning share basic characteristics, then those characteristics can be celebrated. If we abandon the word <italic>transformative</italic>, we do not have to spend time working our way out of a dilemma because the dilemma no longer exists. Differences become a matter of degree.</p>
<p>Thirteen years on and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741713610392768">Mezirow (1991)</xref> does not soften his claim that transformative learning is categorically different:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Not all learning is transformative. We can learn simply by adding knowledge to our meaning schemes or learning new meaning schemes with which to make interpretations about our experience. . . . Transformative learning involves reflectively transforming the beliefs, attitudes, opinions and emotional reactions that constitute our meaning schemes. (p. 223)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The assumption of difference in kind was unambiguously stated in the inaugural editorial of the <italic>Journal of Transformative Education.</italic> In response to their own musings on the need for their journal, the two editors wrote, “No, not yet another journal on education. JTE is the journal of another education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741713610392768">Markos &amp; McWhinney, 2003</xref>, p. 4). It is an uncompromising position, and it traps the journal into uncritically promoting the idea of difference in kind, since the journal’s continued existence depends on the claim being beyond debate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0741713610392768">
<title>Identity and Consciousness</title>
<p>The second flaw in the literature is the failure to make a clear distinction between identity and consciousness. Identity is the more superficial of the two. It is the face, the mask, the persona we present to the world. And like any presentation, we can alter it. We may adjust elements of our character when we enter into a new relationship, change our behavior when we take on a new job, and change the way we speak according to the social context. Identity manifests itself in our actions, the context and companions we choose, our physical appearance, and the objects we gather around us. It is an aspect of the self that we can deal with rationally; and from an early age on we become adept at adjusting and even changing it significantly.</p>
<p>Consciousness is another phenomenon altogether. It is fluid, utterly insubstantial, and not so easily subject to rational control. It is the experience of existence. We develop our consciousness in the continual encounter between our self and the social and material world. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741713610392768">Marx and Engels (1846/1998</xref>) would have it,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The phantoms formed in the brains of human beings are also, necessarily, sublimates of their material life process. . . . It is not consciousness that determines life, but life that determines consciousness. (p. 42)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Consciousness is a project in the making from our earliest days until our death. It becomes the medium through which we apprehend the self and give meaning to the world the self inhabits. In this sense, consciousness is a relationship between entities, and not an entity in itself. And in another sense, consciousness is all encompassing, infinite. It is literally all we have, and without it neither the self nor the world exists.</p>
<p>A lot of what is described as transformative learning is the reworking of our identity. It tinkers with our being. But learning can do more than that. Whether profound or superficial, any learning effectively done contributes to the continuing creation of our consciousness.</p>
<p>We can see the contrast between identity and consciousness if we compare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741713610392768">Mezirow’s (1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741713610392768">1991</xref>) “perspective transformation” with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741713610392768">Paulo Freire’s (1972a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741713610392768">1972b</xref>) “conscientization.” Perspective transformation is depicted as an individual, even “lonely” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741713610392768">Daloz, 2000</xref>, p. 105) experience. It is often triggered by a crisis in the learner’s life, involves intense self-examination, and results in changes in the person of the learner. Mezirow emphasizes role in the process. From his research he identified 10 phases in the transformative learning process, 3 of which he describes as, “Exploration of options for <italic>new roles</italic> [italics added], relationships, and action,” “Provisional trying of <italic>new roles</italic> [italics added],” and “Building competence and self-confidence in <italic>new roles</italic> [italics added] and relationships” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741713610392768">Mezirow, 2009</xref>, p. 19). This emphasis on role infers an associated emphasis on identity. The roles we take on in life—parent, plumber, artist, village head, extrovert, healer, or hedonist—contribute to our identity. If we emerge from a process with new roles, we will inevitably emerge with changes to our identity.</p>
<p>In contrast, <italic>conscientization</italic> is depicted as a collective activity, in which learners examine their common condition. It is both visceral and intellectual. The learners shift from an unthinking, unspoken acceptance of things as they are to an articulate and passionate participation in a world they can change. Freire envisages a fusion of reflection and action, which he calls <italic>praxis.</italic> In the process of coming to see our world authentically—naming it for what is—we achieve a heightened form of consciousness in which we <italic>feel</italic> and we <italic>think</italic> and we <italic>do</italic> with clarity and intensity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0741713610392768">
<title>Finite or Flowing</title>
<p>The third flaw is the false assumption that learning can be a finite experience. This depiction may not be intended but comes across forcefully in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741713610392768">Mezirow’s (2009)</xref> 10 phases of transformative learning. The first phase is a new experience, sometimes sudden and shocking, causing what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741713610392768">Mezirow (2009)</xref> famously describes as “a disorienting dilemma,” and the final phase is “a reintegration into one’s life on the basis of conditions dictated by one’s new perspective” (p. 19). Despite caveats that the phases do not necessarily occur in the order given, the process is presented as having a clear start, and a clear finish.</p>
<p>This position is tenable if we see learning as a change in identity. If I change from physiotherapist to ambulance officer, say, there will be a period of adjustment, of formal and informal learning, but once I am employed as an ambulance officer, the process of identity change will be complete.</p>
<p>The position is untenable, however, if we see learning as an engagement with our consciousness. Learning is subsumed into the learner’s continuous experience of being. There is a flow to life, and the learning becomes part of that flow.</p>
<p>There is an associated problem in the concept of reintegration into one’s life. Reintegration implies an essentially unchanged life that is there to be reentered; but common sense tells us that this is not so, whether the life referred to is our personal life, or the social and material world of which we are a part. The world in all its components—objective, social and subjective—is in continual change.</p>
<p>I find affinities in Laurent Daloz’s developmental interpretation of transformative learning. Daloz pours cold water on the idea of a single dramatic disorienting dilemma. He draws on a study conducted into the lives of 100 “socially responsible people” and states that the study made “very clear” that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>although a single event may catalyze a shift or a particular story might dramatize a transformation, closer examination reveals that change or shift was long in coming and its possibility prepared for in myriad ways, generally across years. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741713610392768">Daloz, 2000</xref>, pp. 105)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Not only does learning that engages with the consciousness have no discernible ending, it has no discernible beginning either. Daloz quotes Nelson Mandela writing about his commitment to the liberation of his people:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I had no epiphany, no singular revelation, no moment of truth, but a steady accumulation of a thousand slights, a thousand indignities, a thousand unremembered moments. (Mandela as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741713610392768">Daloz, 2000</xref>, p. 106)</p>

<p>Daloz suggests that disorienting dilemmas will be many, will often go unremembered, and will have a cumulative effect over time. Our lives are not so much marked by occasional major events, as by the continual encounter with a multitude of minichallenges.</p>
<p>I am left wondering why Daloz uses the phrase <italic>transformative learning</italic> at all since he is, in effect, arguing against its claim to be a special phenomenon. As his choice of the Mandela example demonstrates, he is talking about the whole gamut of learning that contributes to our development as human beings.</p>
<p>Of course we change during our lives, and some of the changes—from child to adult, from single person to partner, from novice to expert—will be radical. But I still consider it wrong to talk of <italic>transformation</italic> in the course of our development as human beings. Barring severe mental illness, damage, or terminal deterioration, our consciousness has about it an inexorable continuity. I may be 71, but I can still wince at the memory of an embarrassment I experienced as a teenager. We are, internally, profoundly, the same person as the child of our earliest memories.</p>

<title>Discourse</title>
<p>The fourth flaw is to do with the discourse said to be “central to the process” of transformative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741713610392768">Cranton, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741713610392768">Mezirow (2009)</xref> proposes seven conditions that participants ideally require to engage in discourse. Five of them, such as “accurate and complete information” and “freedom from coercion,” seem worth trying for in any encounter with others, but I find it difficult to accept the third and the seventh on his list. The third condition requires me to have “empathy and concern about how others think and feel.” But there are detestable people who do not deserve my empathy, and who are quickly identifiable as enemies of principles such as equity or, in the case of advocates of rendition, the presumption of innocence.</p>
<p>The seventh condition requires me to demonstrate a “willingness to seek understanding, agreement and a tentative best judgement as a test of validity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741713610392768">Mezirow, 2009</xref>, p. 20). In effect Mezirow is asking me to accept a consensus—he uses the word <italic>consensus</italic> in a previous version of his list (1991)—but whether I can enter into a consensus depends on the composition of the group. Why would I, even temporarily, seek understanding, let alone agreement, if I found myself the odd person out in a group of homophobes?</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741713610392768">Mezirow (2000a)</xref> gives the graduate seminar as a model of group discourse. But this does not work. So long as a member of faculty is present and has anything to do with assessment, participants will perform. And part of that performance will be a specious good behavior. People with irrelevant ideas will be given equal time. People with appalling prejudices will be allowed their say. A person from a minority group will be treated with mealy mouthed courtesy, undermining the value of her or his contribution. Honest contestation will not happen. In search of an elusive transformation by discourse, the participants will miss out on the rumble-tumble, maddening, creative, stimulating and, yes, sometimes destructive discourse that happens when we argue about causes close to our heart.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741713610392768">Mezirow (2000a</xref>, p. 12) argues that “feelings of trust, solidarity, security and empathy are essential preconditions for free full participation in discourse,” but his preconditions are unattainable. Trust is an absolute and we accord it to remarkably few individuals during our lives. We either trust or we do not, and if we have to make the slightest effort to trust someone, then we actually <italic>distrust</italic> that person. I read the newspapers and know that pathological people exist. And the stories of individuals poisoning organizations are legion. Like it or not, we need to be constantly on guard against these people, and to temper trust with distrust. We are equally miserly about entering into solidarity with people. Solidarity is based on a deeply shared commitment to a common cause; it can take us years to establish; and it implies a readiness to support our friends to the bitter end in utter denial of our self-interest. It is highly unlikely that any temporarily assembled group could generate this sheer, exigent kind of loyalty. Genuine security is only possible if there is wholesale trust. And I have already worried aloud about empathy.</p>
<p>Discourse surrounding significant issues can be a bruising business. There will be anger at those who oppose. There will be likes and dislikes. There will be shifting alliances, sudden clashes, and lingering, sometimes bitter conflicts. Some people will fall by the wayside, and others may be pushed. But conflict can be good for us. Unless we panic, we are often at our most imaginative when face to face with a vigorous opponent. Under pressure, we go looking for, and often find, original responses.</p>
<p>Mezirow uses the phrase <italic>critical-dialectical discourse</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741713610392768">Mezirow, 2003</xref>) in place of <italic>rational discourse</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741713610392768">Mezirow, 1991</xref>) or <italic>discourse</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741713610392768">Mezirow, 2000a</xref>). I find <italic>critical-dialectical</italic> an apt descriptor for the bruising discourse I have just alluded to. The discourse is dialectical because the world is seen in terms of contradistinctions—women to men, self to society, North to South—and it is critical because these contradistinctions are interpreted in terms of (“mediated by,” if I use the language of dialectical analysis) the use and abuse of power.</p>

<sec id="section7-0741713610392768">
<title>Mobilization</title>
<p>Despite the title, many of the case studies that appear in <italic>Transformative Learning in Practice</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741713610392768">Mezirow et al., 2009</xref>) are simply examples of good adult education practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741713610392768">Brookfield (2009)</xref> describes a workshop in which, using an inventive array of exercises, he encourages people from the corporate world to critically examine dominant ideologies, but nowhere does he suggest that they leave their jobs. Some of the case studies are examples of introspective teaching and learning. Elizabeth Tisdell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0741713610392768">Tisdell &amp; Tolliver, 2009</xref>) describes how she encourages students to analyze the cultural messages they have internalized, but nowhere does she suggest that the students should, or could, abandon one cultural background for another. Some of the case studies involve changes in identity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741713610392768">Cranton (2009)</xref> describes a program for tradespeople becoming teachers of tradespeople, but nowhere does she suggest that the participants change the substantive knowledge—of welding, carpentry, or mechanics—that underwrites these two identities. And some of the case studies are examples of mobilization.</p>
<p>A fifth flaw in the literature can occur when mobilization is mistaken for transformation. A person or group of people engages in learning and subsequently takes action; and this change in behavior is seen as evidence of a transformation in understanding. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741713610392768">Peter Easton, Karen Monkman, and Rebecca Miles (2009)</xref> write about a program dealing with democracy, women’s rights, and local development that took place in a Senegalese village in the late 1990s. Following the program, a number of participants decided to urge the village to abandon the practice of female genital cutting. They succeeded, and took their action into the neighboring villages that made up their “marriage community.” A social movement was launched and by 2007 more than half of the 5,000 villages that condoned female genital cutting had joined alliances to abandon the practice.</p>
<p>The authors report that the program facilitators did not anticipate the participants’ decision to mount a campaign. And they also tell of a local religious leader coming to the village in the early days of the campaign to learn more. On his return home the leader talked to his women relatives for the first time about their own experiences of genital cutting “and they gave him quite an earful” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741713610392768">Easton et al., 2009</xref>). Clearly, the women in the village and the religious leader’s relatives already had a thoroughgoing understanding of the dangers, the pain, the trauma, and the gross injustice of the practice. The course, it would seem, gave them confidence to talk about this normally forbidden subject and to begin mobilizing.</p>
<p>The authors tell an inspiring story, but it is not about transformative learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741713610392768">Jurgen Habermas (1968/1987</xref>) argues that we generate knowledge to meet certain “human interests.” There are two “knowledge constitutive interests,” which we meet by generating knowledge about our objective and social worlds. And there is a third “emancipatory cognitive interest” in “autonomy and responsibility,” which is manifested in “the will to reason freely” (pp. 197-198). When learners mobilize, educators may be tempted to think that their intervention has kindled a desire for liberation. But they may have played an auxiliary role and, as looks to be the case in that Senegalese village, helped the learners go about meeting an emancipatory interest that was already there.</p>

<sec id="section8-0741713610392768">
<title>Spirituality</title>
<p>The final and, for me, the most troubling flaw is to do with the way some writers have associated spirituality with transformative learning. Spirituality is thrown into the mix as if its inclusion were unproblematic. The editors of the <italic>Journal of Transformative Education</italic> list “transformative learning, new career training, programs for humanitarian service, rehabilitation, and <italic>spiritual</italic> [italics added] renewal” as contexts for transformative education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741713610392768">Markos &amp; McWhinney, 2003</xref>, p. 4). In the Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Transformative Learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0741713610392768">Vlosak et al., 2005</xref>), 11 out of 83 papers have spirituality as a major theme. And in <italic>Learning in Adulthood: A Comprehensive Guide</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741713610392768">Merriam et al. (2007)</xref> include a chapter on transformative learning carrying a section titled “Emerging sociocultural perspectives: The cultural-<italic>spiritual</italic> [italics added], race-centric and planetary approaches” (p. 14).</p>
<p>There are three strands to this literature on transformative learning and spirituality. All three can sometimes be identified in the work of one author, but they are different nonetheless. The first is a restatement of a progressive humanist philosophy of education. The word <italic>spirituality</italic> is used to indicate an inquisitive open-mindedness to one’s self and the world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741713610392768">John Miller (2002</xref>, pp. 100-101) says that spiritual learning is transformative “in that it allows us to see the world anew.” It requires humility and a readiness “to assist others in awakening.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0741713610392768">Tisdell (2003)</xref> lists the assumptions she makes about spirituality, among which are that spirituality is about an awareness of the wholeness and connectedness of all things, that it is fundamentally about meaning making, and that spiritual development involves moving toward a more authentic self. Miller’s and Tisdell’s sentiments would fit comfortably into a discussion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741713610392768">Carl Rogers’s (1983)</xref> ideas on education and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741713610392768">Malcolm Knowles’s (1980)</xref> later, more inclusive, discussions of andragogy.</p>
<p>The second strand makes reference to “deep” psychology. Writers examine the use of image, symbol, metaphor, archetype, myth, and dreaming to help learners delve into their psyches in search of self-understanding and change. The word <italic>spirituality</italic> is again lightly used, or replaced with words such as <italic>grace</italic> (Graves as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741713610392768">Merriam et al., 2007</xref>) and <italic>soul</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741713610392768">Dirkx, 2001</xref>). Dirkx talks of making ourselves open to symbols from our “inner world,” and calls this process “soul work” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741713610392768">Dirkx, Mezirow, &amp; Cranton, 2006</xref>). The language is spiritual, yet most of what is described would fit comfortably into a discussion of how we might study aesthetics, or lay the ground for insight through the use of image, metaphor analysis, critical incident exercises, and certain kinds of role-play.</p>
<p>The flaw occurs in the third strand. Here writers envisage a supernatural force, be it a god (or gods) with a name or the more general idea of a godhead. Leona English, Tara Fenwick, and Jim Parsons (2003) talk of seeking communion with “that mysterious realm sometimes described as connectedness, Spirit, the divine, holiness or the cosmos” (p. 36). Dirkx argues that the inner self, when apprehended by soul work, gives rise to “questions and wonder about God” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741713610392768">Dirkx, Mezirow, &amp; Cranton, 2006</xref>, p. 127). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0741713610392768">Tisdell (2003)</xref> uses the term <italic>Life-Force</italic>, and makes this sweeping claim:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Given that the Life-force is everywhere and the process of meaning-making is happening all the time, people’s spirituality is always present (though usually unacknowledged) in the learning environment. (p. 31)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is a no-lose statement. The word <italic>given</italic> implies that the first part of the sentence is known, determined, and cannot be challenged; and if I dispute the second part, saying spirituality is not present, my claim can be countered by the comment, “Yes it is. You simply have not acknowledged it yet!” The philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741713610392768">A. J. Ayer (1936/1971)</xref> maintains that statements such as “The Life-force is everywhere” cannot be verified and so are neither true nor false. In his terms they are “literally senseless” because they do not derive from “sense experience” (p. 41).</p>
<p>Discourse about godhead is a subset of metaphysics. Metaphysical arguments, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741713610392768">Ayer (1936/1971)</xref> maintains, start from abstract ideas, that is, effectively from nowhere, and so cannot effectively arrive anywhere. They are utterances with no literal significance, even for the people making them. This is not to belittle metaphysical discourse. Metaphysics is an array of analytical propositions, a set of arrangements of “symbols” into innovative and pleasing “equations.” Religious discourse, too, is the organization of symbols into equations, such as “God is great” or “God is love,” which are neither true nor false, have no literal significance, and owe their existence not to reasoning but to faith.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0741713610392768">Jane Vella (2000</xref>, pp. 7-16) writes about “the spiritual dimensions of adult education,” “a spirited epistemology” and a transformation she calls “metanoia,” which the <italic>Oxford English Dictionary</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741713610392768">Simpson, 2010</xref>) defines as “penitence,” “repentance,” or “spiritual conversion.” She says that learning “is either a spirited partnership or domination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0741713610392768">Vella, 2000</xref>, p. 14), and so appears to be claiming that, in the world of learning with its myriad manifestations and multitude of practitioners, there are only two possible relationships—one based on spirituality and the other on domination. But in the adult context, perhaps the most common of all learning relationships is the financial one—I will pay you if you teach me piano, botany, or poker. And more often than not the learner submits to the authority of the teacher voluntarily—as a novice scuba diver does in preparation for her or his first dive. Because the relationship is a financial one, it is secular. And any subordination is based on a respect for the teacher as expert, a concern for safety, and the learner’s pragmatic desire to get value for money.</p>
<p>A statement using <italic>either-or</italic> exhausts the universe. There is no third option. So Vella seems to be saying that if adult educators do not nurture spirituality, they <italic>of necessity</italic> engage in domination. This is a harsh call for those secular educators in social movements who commit their professional and sometimes their personal lives to promoting democracy in learning. But Vella’s statement does not appear to be a slip of the keyboard. Later in the same publication she calls for a “spiritual revolution” in education and argues that, unless we teach one another as “spiritual, human beings,” we will feed “a domination system that will be our death” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0741713610392768">Vella, 2000</xref>, p. 15). It is difficult to see a place for the secular in Vella’s brave new world, other than as an object of fear.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741713610392768">English et al. (2003)</xref> urge adult educators “to think and act ethically” (p. 3), and go on to say, “Ethical choices implicitly include a basic recognition of the person as spiritual” (p. 4). But surely the corollary to this statement is that those who do not recognize the person as spiritual are denied, or unable to make, ethical choices? By linking ethics to spirituality, the authors appear to have excluded a whole sector of the population from the realm of ethical behavior. And they have also ignored moral philosophers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0741713610392768">Peter Singer (2000)</xref> whose writings on ethical choices are secular. Singer could not be clearer: “I don’t believe in the existence of God,” he says (p. 320).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741713610392768">English et al. (2003)</xref> go on to say,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Given that spirituality is a part of life stage and other adult development theory, spiritual elements are an integral part of a holistic approach to learning. Similarly, transformative learning theory, theories of cognition, and experiential learning theories are linked to writings on spirituality. (p. 10)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These generalizations do not stand up to scrutiny. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741713610392768">Kegan (1982)</xref> writes about life stages, and I cannot find any reference to spirituality in his groundbreaking text, nor in his contribution to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741713610392768">Mezirow (2000b)</xref>. I found one reference to spirituality in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741713610392768">Daloz’s (1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741713610392768">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741713610392768">2000</xref>) theorizing on adult development but it was fleeting. And I can find no references to (let alone links to writings on) spirituality in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741713610392768">Mezirow’s (1991)</xref> major text on transformative learning theory, in cognitive psychologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741713610392768">Martin Seligman’s (1998)</xref> influential book, or in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741713610392768">David Kolb’s (1984)</xref> classic text on experiential learning.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741713610392768">Peter Jarvis (1997</xref>, p. 165) argues that “desire . . . lies outside the realm of education.” So, too, in my view, does faith. The act of faith can be neither taught nor learnt. Faith grows out of our attempts to combat the existential solitude to which we are all condemned. We are trapped inside our own consciousness. We reach out, driven by a desire to make contact with others, but the contact will only ever be imperfect. Some are unwilling or unable to live with this imperfection. They desire more, and seek out, or create, a godhead with whom their relationship will be perfect, and their communication complete. They welcome the divinity, so the rhetoric goes, into their lives. They take it inside their consciousness, to succor them, to be at one with them. This experience lies beyond the reach of reason, and has no place in educational practice except as the subject of dispassionate examination.</p>

<title>All Things to All People</title>
<p>Perhaps transformative learning theory is on the wane, and has been for a decade. This is not to say that the amount written about it has diminished, far from it, but that the literature has grown repetitive and the theory too generalized. The acceptance of spirituality, with its imprecision and inferences, into the discourse may be just one example.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741713610392768">Taylor (2007)</xref> argues that transformative learning “seems to have replaced andragogy as the iconic educational philosophy in the field” (p. 189). Andragogy was promoted as an explication of all learning in adulthood, whereas transformative learning theory began as an explication of a particular part of adult learning. However, if transformative learning theory has <italic>replaced</italic> andragogy, then it is assuming the mantle of a universal theory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741713610392768">Kegan (2000)</xref> suggests that this indiscriminate use of the term is already established. He argues that Mezirow has made the concept so appealing that it has been taken up and used far too widely: “Transformation begins to refer to any kind of change or process at all” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741713610392768">Kegan, 2000</xref>, p. 47). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741713610392768">Brookfield (2000</xref>, p. 141) worries that the word “transformative” is experiencing “the twin dangers of evacuation and reification of meaning,” that is, that the word is being leeched of meaning through overuse, or is taking on a new existence unassociated with its original meaning. But we should not be surprised at the corruption of the word. It was an inappropriate label in the first place.</p>
<p>While the label is corrupted, unwittingly and by genuine enthusiasts, the exposition of the theory has become increasingly unwieldy. In 1981, Mezirow talked of transforming “a meaning perspective,” which he defined as “a structure of psychocultural assumptions,” already a multifaceted concept. In 2003, he talks of transforming “frames of reference—sets of fixed assumptions and expectations (habits of mind, meaning perspectives, mindsets)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741713610392768">Mezirow, 2003</xref>, p. 58). Now there are six concepts, some of them arranged between parentheses inside another set of parentheses, and a number of them multifaceted in themselves. In a single paragraph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741713610392768">Cranton (2000</xref>, p. 183) talks of “habits of mind,” “habitual set of expectations,” “frames of reference,” “orienting frame of reference,” “orienting predisposition,” “meaning perspective,” “psychological meaning perspectives,” “psychological characteristics,” “characterological preferences,” and “personality preferences.” I become bewildered. And just how many forms of reflection do we need? In 1998, Mezirow proposed a taxonomy made up of two forms of objective critical reflection, and six forms of subjective critical self-reflection, making eight in all.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0741713610392768">
<title>Back to Basics</title>
<p>In 1979, just a few years after Mezirow’s initial research, Jane Thompson set up a program called “Second Chance for Women” at Southampton University in the United Kingdom and, over the next 10 years, helped many women turn their lives around. She challenged the patriarchal nature of conventional academic disciplines but she used conventional academic practice to do so. Instead of subjects, Thompson encouraged the women, almost all of them working class, to examine themes such as health and work and, through a combination of reading, discussion, analysis, and writing, helped them take control of their own learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0741713610392768">Thompson, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>The experience was both individual and collective. Thompson encouraged each woman to affirm her individual identity, but to do so in the company of other women and, by locating that affirmation within a feminist analysis, to do so conceptually in the company of every woman on the planet. I am back to my example of the botanist. The learning the women did with Thompson was quite simply <italic>good</italic> learning, and I do not have to go to transformative learning theory to understand that.</p>

<title>Aspects of Learning</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741713610392768">Brookfield (2000)</xref> describes transformative learning in extreme language to emphasize that its occurrence will be rare, and in the same passage explains that he has consistently refrained from using transformative learning “as a central point of analysis” in his own writing (pp 139-141). I am not alone in my reservations. But I want to go one step further, and propose that we strike the phrase <italic>transformative learning</italic> from the educational lexicon altogether.</p>
<p>The word <italic>learning</italic> has been around for a while, so it seems reasonable to assume that it refers to a single phenomenon; and that the different kinds of learning identified in the literature, be they drawn from the humanists, cognitivists, behaviorists, transformative learning theorists or whomsoever, are actually different <italic>aspects</italic> of that single phenomenon. Elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0741713610392768">Newman, 1999/2007</xref>) I proposed eight aspects, but now I am proposing nine: instrumental, communicative, affective, interpretive, essential, critical, political, passionate, and moral. In different acts of learning different aspects will dominate, but when all nine are present we will have, with all the ambiguity the word implies, <italic>good</italic> learning.</p>
<p>So the <italic>instrumental</italic> aspect is to do with skills and tasks. We learn, as best we can, to manage the physical environment that science has described, the technological environments we have created, and our social, economic, legal, and political worlds. The environment, whether material or social, is perceived as inanimate, subject to cause and predictable effect, and there to be used.</p>
<p>The <italic>communicative</italic> aspect helps us combat our existential isolation and make contact, whether lightly or profoundly, with others. We learn to convey grand ideas and engage in gossip, persuade and please, manage and manipulate, listen and respond, organize and collaborate, and negotiate and engage in disputes.</p>
<p><italic>The affective aspect</italic> is to do with how we react to people and events. We come to understand what emotions are, the range of emotions we are capable of, and how we might manage them. It helps us bring the way we feel to the way we think, and so provides a balance to the way we respond to the world.</p>
<p>The <italic>interpretive</italic> aspect helps us understand what makes us tick. We identify our prejudices and predilections, our doubts and certainties, and our weaknesses and qualities. This aspect makes us see through ourselves and helps us see through others. It is to do with interpreting the human experience in all its pettiness and all its magnificence.</p>
<p>The <italic>essential</italic> aspect is about apprehending the essence of things. We understand a painting, a partner, an idea, or an action, even if we remain unable to explain that understanding. It is to do with insight and aesthetics. We discern symbolic significance, value, and beauty (or otherwise) in people, objects, and events around us.</p>
<p>The <italic>critical</italic> aspect is to do with appraisal. We learn to take nothing for granted. We separate out “truth” from “ideology,” acknowledge conflicts of interest, and ask, “In whose interests was this statement made or that action taken?” This aspect helps us understand that relationships, however benign, are expressions of power.</p>
<p>The <italic>political</italic> aspect is about examining conflicts of interest and expressions of power in order to make judgments. In making judgments we take sides. And in taking sides we join with others to take action. This aspect helps us decide how we can help our friends, work with our allies, and deal with our enemies.</p>
<p>The <italic>passionate</italic> aspect is about emotions again, but they are passions such as love, hate, joy, anguish, envy, anger, and rage that can propel us into intense activity, or overwhelm us and wreak havoc. Passions have their own kinds of ecstasy, and this aspect helps us harness and put these ecstasies to use in ways that are wise.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the last on my list. The <italic>moral</italic> aspect of learning has to do with coming to know what is right and wrong, good and bad, and wise and unwise. Ideally it involves an ongoing debate with ourselves and others, in which we tease out the convictions that inform the judgments we make, and subject these convictions to repeated and rigorous appraisal.</p>

<title>Finally . . .</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0741713610392768">Taylor (2009</xref>, p. 3) claims that “fostering transformative learning” involves “the most significant learning in adulthood.” Again, all I can do is offer a contrary view. For a young worker, the most significant learning may well be the specialist skill of welding aluminum (ask any welder), because that skill will secure the worker a lifetime career in a specialist shipyard. For a homeless woman, the most significant learning may well be a few elementary facts about legal rights, which will save her from being regularly and unjustly locked up. And for a young mother in a maternity ward, being instructed on how to bathe her newborn child may remain the most significant moment of learning in her life.</p>
