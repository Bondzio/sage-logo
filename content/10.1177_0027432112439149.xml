<title>Feeling the Spirit</title>
<p>The December 2011 issue of Music Educators Journal focused on the very important issue of spirituality in music. It is an important issue because without it, we teach about a subject that is sterile and incapable of regeneration.</p>
<p>We teach for spirituality in music when we value expressive performance. There is no adequate verbalization to explain expressive performance, but we can teach our students to breathe at sensible places and to use implied dynamics in melodic lines. We can teach them when they should lead and when they should follow the inferences of prominent lines in ensembles. We can talk to them about observing standard performance practices of historical eras, even though we’re never quite sure how much expression is too much.</p>
<p>We can’t easily verbalize what expressive performance does for music, but we know that it makes for a more convincing performance and that, somehow, it allows us, our students, and our audiences to transcend the bonds of reality and time as we are temporarily lifted to a spiritual realm. The experience is not quantifiable, and that is where we run into trouble with those who would quantify, standardize, and evaluate every action of teachers of music.</p>
<p>Expressive performance is the most important component of music learning, but since it is by its very nature subjective, it is also the most difficult to evaluate in an objective manner. Those who wish to hold teachers accountable will believe they’ve accomplished their goals when they see neat lesson plans, experience a pleasant ambience in the classroom, and witness a teacher’s supportive manner.</p>
<p>They’ll never know that those things are only steps along the way to the most important part of music. It is expressiveness in music and the resultant transport to spiritual realms that keep all of us coming back for more, but they won’t evaluate any of that.</p>
<p>Our students aren’t any better than we are at explaining it, but they know it when they feel it. Our audiences know it, too, but it won’t count on evaluations because the evaluators don’t know how to assign numbers to it.</p>
<p>Teaching is ultimately an art, and great teachers of any discipline always transport their students into a realm of spirituality and passion for the subject. Art and the artist will never be quantified, and therein lies the difficulty of designing evaluation instruments that will come anywhere close to being effective for anything other than the stepping stones along the way.</p>
