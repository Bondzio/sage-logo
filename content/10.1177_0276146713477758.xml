<p>Since the end of World War II, the US government has banned some product advertising (e.g., cigarettes) and has regulated a number of dubious practices (e.g., false or deceptive claims, nondisclosure of information). Yet, advertising as an institution has largely been accepted as a necessary component of the free enterprise system. To be sure, critics ranging from John Kenneth Galbraith to Vance Packard to Naomi Klein have lambasted advertising for its shortcomings, but their impact on policy has been minimal. During the late 1930s, in contrast, many journalists, economists, members of Congress, officials in the Roosevelt Administration, and much of the public at large seriously questioned the contribution of advertising to the economy. An mortal, political threat loomed over the industry. In her new book, <italic>Advertising at War: Business, Consumers, and Government in the 1940s</italic>, Inger L. Stole explains how this hostile environment was transformed into a far more receptive one in just a few short years.</p>
<p>By the 1920s, economists had come to recognize significant changes in the nature of American business competition and in the concentration of its markets. The impersonal markets of economic theory had been replaced by oligopolies where companies struggled fiercely for sales and market share, not through pricing, but through advertising campaigns. Not coincidentally, a consumer movement began to emerge from the muckraking of writers such as Stuart Chase, F. J. Schlink, and Arthur Kallet who questioned the efficiency and fairness of marketing practices. With the reputation of capitalism damaged by the great depression, ordinary Americans became receptive to this thinking reinforced by advocacy groups, such as Consumer’s Research and Consumers Union. In 1938, Congress passed the Wheeler-Lea Amendment to the Federal Trade Commission Act and, in response to the “Roosevelt Recession” of 1937–38, formed a Temporary National Economic Committee (TNEC) to scrutinize the effects of current business arrangements on the economy and society, in particular, the use of advertising to restrict competition. To help smaller manufacturers, TNEC considered the possibility of imposing grading standards on a variety of products. In early 1940, the Federal Trade Commission conducted its own study on the cost of distribution and, specifically, the cost of national advertising. With the growing prospect of war and a defense economy, leading critics, such as Consumers Union president Colston Warne, deemed much advertising to be superfluous and recommended disallowing the deduction of advertising expenses from corporate income taxes.</p>
<p>Advertisers, ad agencies, the trade press, and sponsored media in general found this political environment highly disturbing. Manufacturers wanted to continue advertising to maintain their consumer share of mind even when their goods became scarce because of rationing or simply unavailable due to the redirection of production toward war materiel. The other industry players obviously benefited from robust advertising expenditures. The Association of National Advertisers and the American Association of Advertising Agencies, which had been defending advertising for years, organized a big meeting at Hot Springs, Virginia in November 1941 to discuss the role of advertising and the economy and how the industry could better manage its public relations. This led in early 1942 to the formation of the Advertising Council, Inc., an organization comprised of representatives from advertisers, agencies, and the media and dedicated to helping the government win the war. A few months later, it changed its name to the War Advertising Council (WAC).</p>
<p>One of the first federal agencies to approach the WAC was the Treasury Department, which sought assistance in promoting War Bonds. Following this precedent, a new public–private partnership rapidly emerged where the WAC would receive requests from government agencies, form a pro bono task force to create campaigns, and then persuade the media to contribute free space and time and companies to donate money for expenses. During its first seven months, the WAC helped create over 4,000 ads for campaigns to encourage home front consumers to salvage scrap metal, recycle fats and grease, plant “Victory Gardens,” and drive efficiently to conserve gasoline and tires. Formerly critical government agencies began to see the value of advertising in the war effort and before long the Treasury sided with advertisers in the debate over tax deductions. Between August 1942 and 1943, newspaper advertising jumped by 19.2 percent, magazines by 57.3 percent, and network radio by 58.0 percent (p. 74).</p>
<p>Most WAC campaigns were noncontroversial, but in 1944 blowback ensued from efforts to reduce the incidence of venereal disease (VD). During the First World War, almost 13 percent of new recruits carried some type of VD and the War Department launched communication campaigns to deal with the problem. This information did not reach the general population, however, and as sexual mores loosened in the 1920s and 1930s these diseases persisted. In 1938, a National Venereal Disease Control Act was passed, but the incidence of VD increased sharply during WWII and by 1944, the estimated number of new cases rose to over 5 million. Thus, in conjunction with the Office of War Information (OWI), the WAC developed a campaign using the slogan “Help Stamp Out VD.” Angry Catholic organizations, newspapers, and clergy along with other right-wing forces attacked the campaign as an affront to decency for having approached VD as a health issue rather than a moral failing. Despite a stout defense from <italic>Advertising Age</italic>, the WAC quickly dropped the campaign in 1944.</p>
<p>When peace returned in 1945, the WAC reverted to its original name, the Advertising Council, Inc. With a budget of $30 million, it continued to promote the causes of a variety of government agencies and private organizations. A famous slogan created in 1947 for the US Forest Service, “Remember … only YOU can prevent forest fires,” was used for over five decades. Yet, beneath the surface, the Ad Council was injecting pro-business ideology into its social advertising. A highway safety campaign talked about individual responsibility, but neglected to mention automobile and highway designs as causes of traffic deaths. More overtly, the Ad Council administered a million dollar propaganda campaign in 1948 touting the “American Economic System.” Partly a response to the gathering anticommunist crusade, it was aimed at both the industrial labor and the general public. Prodded by Congress and the Truman administration, the Ad Council went international with its August 1951 launch of the “Crusade for Freedom” campaign using the slogan “Help Truth Fight Communism” to solicit donations for Radio Free Europe.</p>
<p>Stole’s research clearly shows how the advertising institution—through its trade journals and industry associations—manipulated the US political environment in the WWII period. She concludes that:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… advertising’s role in our culture is not the result of careful public debates, and informed consent does not provide the basis for the industry’s existence or prominence. Our commercial landscape is the result of a series of well-designed public relations strategies, and advertising’s position has been maintained through a constant massaging of public opinion. (p. 186)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This finding supports historical research published in the <italic>Journal of Macromarketing</italic>. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0276146713477758">Schwarzkopf (2011</xref>) traces the ideological development in the 1930s and 1940s of the notion of the consumer as sovereign citizen who lives in a democracy of goods. He shows how this doctrine was little more than mythology building created to advance corporate interests. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146713477758">Clampin and Noon (2011</xref>) examine how the British firm Tate &amp; Lyle, in the period from 1949 to 1952, resisted attempts by the post-war labor government to nationalize the sugar refining industry. Tate &amp; Lyle developed a campaign featuring “Mr. Cube,” a cartoon lump of sugar appearing in ads and on sugar packets, which invited consumers to defy big government nationalization through the consumption of a staple food product.</p>
<p>
<italic>Advertising at War</italic> is well written and documented. The author has made good use of the source material from the Advertising Council Archives at the University of Illinois. However, the chronology of events is sometimes a bit difficult to follow and some relationships, such as that between the WAC and the OWI, are not explained especially well. Moreover, how did WAC campaigns relate to other communications efforts, such as the widespread dissemination of poster art on the home front (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146713477758">Witkowski 2003</xref>)? The discussion of the Ad Council’s attempts to coordinate with commercial advertising also could have been better delineated. Indeed, in <italic>Madison Avenue Goes to War</italic> Frank W. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0276146713477758">Fox (1975</xref>) gives a more compelling account of the abuses of boastful, even offensive early war advertising. General Electric, for example, bragged that a Mazda brand light bulb survived the sinking of the battleship Oklahoma and the Florida Citrus Commission could not resist saying, “Just ask a Jap what it feels like to be up against men who are fortified with ‘Victory Vitamin C’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0276146713477758">Fox 1975</xref>, 36). In general, Stole’s narrative would have been more interesting had it engaged more directly with the copy and illustrations in the ads depicted.</p>
<p>These shortcomings aside, <italic>Advertising at War</italic> contributes to the macromarketing literature by showing, through well-documented research, how the advertising component of the US marketing system has had a long lasting impact on the larger political and societal environment. These past events have strong parallels with the situation in the early twenty-first century. Right-wing groups such as the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and the US Chamber of Commerce contribute ideological talking points and ample funding to efforts favoring the interests of rich people, corporations, and the so-called <italic>free market</italic>. Sunday morning talk shows in the United States are replete with commercials touting the oil and coal industries and their major companies. Today, these incessant pro-business campaigns tend to drown out the voices of consumers, environmentalists, and other left-leaning interest groups, just as they did in the 1940s.</p>
