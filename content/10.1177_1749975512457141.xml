<abstract>
<p>Based on focus groups and interviews with first-time voters in the UK, this study reflects critically on the role of popular culture as a resource of political engagement. Unlike previous studies, it looks at a wide range of popular culture and suggests that entertainment television, video games and popular music provide young citizens with some of the resources they need actively to engage in the public sphere. Young citizens struggle to see the relevance of formal politics in their everyday lives, yet they see themselves as part of a political community and connect with its concerns. They use media texts to learn about social and political issues and to explore the moral values that underpin the society in which they live. While some critics have suggested that the media disconnect citizens from their communities, the findings of this study suggest that media texts are a resource which prepares young people for their engagement in the public sphere.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This paper contributes to an an emerging field of scholarship which seeks to take seriously the role of popular culture in strengthening, rather than undermining, political engagement. The role of news media in providing a platform for debate about matters of public importance is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1749975512457141">Livingstone and Markham, 2008</xref>: 360), and in recent years the role of entertainment media too has become acknowledged. Instead of distracting from serious politics and civic engagement, it seems that satirical talk shows offer audiences the possibility of ‘meaningful engagement with the political process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1749975512457141">Jones, 2006</xref>: 367). The reading of detective fiction has become identified as a political cultural practice and a domain in which readers ‘deploy a sense of self and of identity’, of their ‘place in society’, the obligations they have and the rights that are due to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1749975512457141">Hermes and Stello, 2000</xref>: 219). Popular culture, it has been argued, is an authoritative source of cues about the relevance of political and social issues and offers scripts which audiences, and young people in particular, use to play at being citizens. Through popular culture young people ‘play-act their way not only into the web of power relations that constitute personal identity but also into the disciplines and values of larger entities’ (Barnhurst, 1999: 207). With this paper we want to broaden the scope of current analysis in this field. Existing research tends to be more concerned with overall patterns of media consumption than audience engagement with specific media texts and their modes of delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1749975512457141">Livingstone and Markham, 2008</xref>). Studies that do look at individual texts and genres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1749975512457141">Jones, 2005</xref>) focus on texts that are still quite explicitly about politics in the traditional sense. By contrast, in our study we wanted to ask whether media texts that do not make explicit references to formal politics have the potential to provide young people with the resources they need for political engagement.</p>
<p>The research reported here is part of a wider project which, through a combination of focus groups, interviews and textual analysis, aims to discern the particular ways in which young people use different forms of popular culture to connect with issues of public concern. In this paper we are particularly concerned with the results of our audience research, which included focus groups and interviews with pupils in the UK. We talked to our respondents about a wide range of television genres, including talent shows, soap operas, drama, news and documentaries. We witnessed conversations about popular music and video games, two forms of popular culture whose relationship to politics is less frequently explored than that of television. The focus on these media forms makes sense because of the central role they play in young people’s everyday lives. People between the ages of 16 and 24 watch over 18 hours of television every week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1749975512457141">Ofcom, 2006</xref>). Additionally, 71 per cent regularly listen to music and 47 per cent regularly play computer games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1749975512457141">Ofcom, 2009</xref>: 7). Claims for the political nature of popular music form part of what might almost be described as a conventional wisdom (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1749975512457141">Eyerman and Jamison, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1749975512457141">Mattern, 1998</xref>), but to date there is relatively little empirical evidence on which to ground these claims. Similarly, while the potential of digital games as stimuli for learning and development of social roles has been recognized (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1749975512457141">McFarlane et al., 2002</xref>: 13; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1749975512457141">Gee, 2003</xref>), there is no large-scale study available which asks whether video games have the potential to be a resource young people can use for political engagement. Our research participants were between 16 and 17 years old. This age-group is of particular interest as<disp-quote>
<p>even though there is a lack of clear and reliable evidence for a decline in young people’s participation at general elections, there is a definite perception among journalists, researchers, politicians and others that the extent of young, first-time voter non-participation is now higher than ever before. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1749975512457141">Kimberlee, 2002</xref>: 86)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Implicit in this public perception of young people as apolitical is the assumption that voting is an activity by which we can measure the extent to which someone is politically engaged. It is a traditional approach which defines political engagement as trying to influence or otherwise engaging with the institutions and principles by which a political community is governed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1749975512457141">Linde and Ekman, 2003</xref>: 394). This can include institutions of the state but also civil society organizations, or what has been referred to as ‘third sector’ organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1749975512457141">Kendall, 2000</xref>). If in our study we were to work with this ideal type of political engagement we would have to agree with the findings of other researchers who have suggested that young people are disconnected from politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1749975512457141">Fahmy, 2003</xref>). The following example illustrates what emerged across the majority of interviews and focus groups. For our respondents, formal politics is a world of which they feel they know little and to which they have little to contribute:

</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A:</speaker>
<p>No I don’t.</p>
<p>(Focus group 3)</p>
</speech>
</p>
<p>Respondents described formal politics as difficult to comprehend, dominated by a combative mode of communication, and as a domain or concern for people older than our respondents. As we have argued elsewhere in more detail, our respondents perceive politics as a world in which expertise and authority are signalled in very conventional ways. The picture of a successful politician that emerged across focus groups and interviews was one of a serious, argumentative and mature person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1749975512457141">Inthorn and Street, 2011</xref>). Our respondents clearly feel distant from politics in the traditional sense of the word and do not engage in the kinds of activities that are traditionally considered to be important for democracy.</p>
<p>Yet as others have demonstrated, just because young people may be disengaged from formal politics and live lives deeply emersed in popular culture, that does not necessarily mean that they are apolitical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1749975512457141">Buckingham, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1749975512457141">Barnhurst, 1998</xref>). Moreover, the cultural forms that young people seem to enjoy and are comfortable with do not necessarily limit the extent to which young people are politically engaged. In our study we wanted to do both: to take seriously the potential of popular culture to be a resource young people can use to engage in politics, and to be open to the possibility that political engagement can mean other things than voting or writing a letter to one’s Member of Parliament. In order to do so we had to take something of an epistemological leap. We had to assume that content which does not make explicit references to formal politics might also be understood as ‘political’ and be a valuable resource for political engagement. We also had to assume that activities that once might have been considered ‘unpolitical’ may in fact be forms of political engagement, or at least an early manifestation of such engagement. In the following paragraphs we will outline this approach in more detail.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1749975512457141">
<title>Defining Politics and Political Engagement</title>
<p>Along similar lines to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1749975512457141">Nash (2001)</xref> we argue that politics involves the contestation of relations of power and is an inherent aspect of all social relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1749975512457141">Nash, 2001</xref>: 84), including the public and the private sphere. Feminist scholars have applied this approach to the analyses of media use in the home, demonstrating the ways in which the routine interaction of couples can be seen as ‘a systematic re-creation and reinforcement of social pattern’ through which ‘women and men are creating and affirming themselves and each other as separate and unequal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1749975512457141">Walker, 1996</xref>: 820). Once we accept the premise that politics manifests itself at the micro-level of everyday life, we can widen the range of cultural and social practices which become the subjects of our analysis. It becomes possible to explore the ways in which the seemingly mundane, such as a dispute over what to watch on TV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1749975512457141">Walker, 1996</xref>), or a woman’s choice of hairstyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1749975512457141">Weitz, 2001</xref>), is a negotiation of power.</p>
<p>We recognize that this approach has been criticized for rendering the concept of politics meaningless. Fiske’s reading of youths hanging around shopping malls as ‘urban guerillas’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1749975512457141">Fiske, 1998</xref>), for example, has been criticized as an example of ‘decorative sociology’, which is characterized by ‘over-politicized readings of cultural life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1749975512457141">Rojek and Turner, 2000</xref>: 637). Central to such criticism, it seems to us, is the concern that researchers fail to demonstrate how the cultural practices they observe are connected to politics in the traditional sense of the word; that is, the institutions and policies that govern people’s lives. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1749975512457141">Nash (2001)</xref>, we do not suggest that the state is irrelevant to politics. We also want to retain boundaries between actions or statements that are political and those that are not. The key lies in the extent to which actions are connected with wider structures of power, which may include but are not exclusive to those exercised by the state (Nash, 2000: 85). In order for a verbal or non-verbal action to be political it needs to have an element of public orientation. We find this idea in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1749975512457141">Couldry et al. (2007)</xref>, who use the concept of ‘public connectedness’ for their definition of political engagement. Public connection captures ‘an orientation to <italic>any</italic> of those issues affecting how we live together that require common resolution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1749975512457141">Couldry et al., 2007</xref>: 6). This definition demarcates non-political issues from political ones. Political issues affect large sections of society and require collective action. Non-political ones do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1749975512457141">Couldry et al., 2007</xref>: 6). This does mean that experiences which a traditional and narrow definition of politics would identify as non-political can in fact be considered as political. An example would be a woman who complains to her husband about his habit of hogging the remote control <italic>and</italic> who makes the family’s television viewing habits part of a wider argument about gender. It is because she is referring to wider social structures and has identified a public issue that requires collective action that her statement is political.</p>
<p>There are many ways in which a person can make a connection with an issue of public concern. Engagement in government and network politics is recognized by many writers as a contribution to the public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1749975512457141">Castells, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1749975512457141">Ingelhart and Norris, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1749975512457141">Putnam, 2000</xref>). Yet just as we want to argue that there is more than one way of conceptualizing politics, in this study we want to suggest that there is more than one way of engaging in politics. Actions that seemingly have very little conection with formal politics may indeed be a form of political engagement. We are particuarly interested in exploring the argument put forward by writers like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1749975512457141">Livingstone (2005)</xref>, who suggest that talk, even in its smallest and tentative forms, may prepare us for participation in the public sphere:</p> <p>‘We need an account of the formation of public opinion and of citizens – early expressions of interest, exploration of experience, tentative trying out of viewpoints. This may not happen in the public sphere but the public sphere depends on its happening’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1749975512457141">Livingstone, 2005</xref>: 28–9). Taking this idea on board, we argue that if in their everyday conversations young people talk about something as an issue of public concern, then we can say that they are engaging in politics.</p>
<p>Yet in this study we want to do more than find out if young people are engaging in politics when talking. We are particularly concerned with the ways in which popular culture might help young people to engage in politics. In short, we want to explore whether popular culture can provide the ‘fuel’ that is necessary to engage in politics. In order to do so, we draw on the work of Dahlgren and others who have highlighted how someone who engages in politics has certain capacities. Much of this work is about and uses the terms ‘citizenship’ and ‘civic engagement’, which are commonly understood to be activities which pertain to the democratic character of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1749975512457141">Dahlgren, 2009</xref>: 59). The term ‘political engagement’, in contrast, tends to imply some dimensions of conflict and captures <italic>any</italic> activity that is ‘oriented toward influencing government action in some way’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1749975512457141">Dahlgren, 2009</xref>: 59), including potentially anti-democratic ones. While we take inspiration from work that focuses on civic engagement, we work with a broad concept of politics and political engagement, which is why in our study we use the term political engagement rather than civic engagement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1749975512457141">
<title>What Is Necessary for Political Engagement?</title>
<p>We agree with writers such as Dahlgren who argue that democracy resides in ‘the interaction of citizens with each other and with power-holders of various kind’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1749975512457141">Dahlgren, 2006</xref>: 274). Central to this approach is the idea that political engagement is informed by knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1749975512457141">Dahlgren, 2006</xref>: 275). The role of the media is to provide the balanced and diverse range of information that is necessary in order to form rational opinions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1749975512457141">Barnett, 2002</xref>: 400; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1749975512457141">McNair, 2000</xref>: 197). One form of such knowledge relates to the actions of political and social elites. The media act as a watchdog, holding to account those in power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1749975512457141">McNair, 2008</xref>: 239) and providing the resources an individual may need to develop a relationship with sources of power in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1749975512457141">Buckingham, 1999</xref>). Yet the media’s role is not limited to that of moral guardian or watchdog. Drawing on cultural citizenship theory, we argue that political engagement involves a willingness to encounter, recognize and accept cultural diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1749975512457141">Stevenson, 2001</xref>: 2). The media help facilitate encounters with this diversity of interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1749975512457141">Buckingham, 1999</xref>). Numerous studies have documented how media discourse constructs concepts of, for example, gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1749975512457141">Ferguson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1749975512457141">Crewe, 2003</xref>), sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1749975512457141">Arthus, 2004</xref>), race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1749975512457141">Downing, 2006</xref>) and class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1749975512457141">Lawler, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>It is through the dialogue of identities that a political community establishes and re-appropriates the norms that bind it and by which it is governed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1749975512457141">Benhabib, 2006</xref>: 49–50). Having such values is another key element of political participation. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1749975512457141">Dahlgren (2009</xref>: 110) says, democracy ‘will not function if such virtues as tolerance and willingness to follow democratic principles and procedures do not have grounding in everyday life’. Crucially, these values do not refer exclusively to institutional frameworks. Democracy ‘is as much about a democratic society – how people live together and treat each other – as it is about a system of institutional frameworks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1749975512457141">Dahlgren, 2009</xref>: 112). Many writers stress the importance of tolerance as a collective political value. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1749975512457141">Livingstone (2005</xref>: 25) points out, this emphasis privileges an ideal type of democratic culture. The definition of politics that we use in our study certainly means that we could interpret a sexist statement as a political act. If, going back to our example of the couple on the sofa, the husband told his wife that women should not be in charge of technology because they are natural carers and allowing them to take control over machines threatens the institutions of family and marriage, we may not like what he says, but we would have to recognize that he has identified a collective value by which, in his opinion at least, society should be governed. In this study, when we speak of political values we refer to those values that envision how the members of a given society should relate to each other.</p>
<p>The resources that fuel political engagement do not need to be rational. Political engagement also has a subjective side. Traditionally, liberal democratic theory has dismissed the role of emotions in politics. Yet more recently, scholars have returned to this issue and have argued that emotions are central to democratic politics and may even motivate political action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1749975512457141">Marcus et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1749975512457141">Wahl-Jorgensen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1749975512457141">van Zoonen, 2004</xref>). In our study we are particularly interested in those kinds of emotions that make individuals associate with the interests of often distant others, which is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1749975512457141">Dahlgren (2003</xref>: 159) calls ‘affinity’. Citizenship theory speaks of civic solidarity or ‘we consciousness’ and citizens’ sense of in- and outsiders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1749975512457141">Tambakaki, 2009</xref>: 11). In our study, when we speak of expressions of ‘affinity’, we refer to moments in which someone expresses a sense of group membership that extends beyond their immediate personal context. Political engagement may be motivated by a sense of connectedness with distant others on the grounds of a (possible imagined) shared set of characteristics. We find a similar idea in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1749975512457141">Anderson’s (1991)</xref> work on the ‘imagined community’ of the nation, which describes a horizontal comradeship that is felt and articulated by people who are and are likely to remain strangers to each other.</p>
<p>In summary, we identify knowledge, collective values and affinity as essential preconditions of political engagement. Young people may have the preconditions we have identified, but they may not always put them to use. A young person may feel affinity towards distant others, but might never act on these feelings. Our research focuses on the essential preconditions of political participation and we did not set out to test the correlation between evidence of young people having knowledge, affinity or values and the whole range of their political activities. Yet we do not deny that there is an active dimension to political engagement. As Dahlgren notes: ‘political participation is more than a feeling one has, it involves some “activity”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1749975512457141">Dahlgren, 2009</xref>: 81).</p>
<p>Traditionally, citizenship theory has tended to emphasize the public orientation of such an activity. Participation in national, cross-class, face-to-face, chapter-based organizations of civil society, such as occupational associations or veterans’ organizations, are often held up as the ideal form of political participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1749975512457141">Schudson, 2006</xref>: 594). Without wanting to reject the political potential of these activities, in our research we focus on the role of talk and its contribution to the politics of the public sphere. We want to suggest that the exchange of viewpoints on which the public sphere and political participation depend may start in the private sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1749975512457141">Livingstone, 2005</xref>: 28–9). This argument is reflected in our decision to analyse young people’s conversations about popular culture, but it also shows in the way in which we sought to structure these conversations. We invited our respondents to talk to us about times when they were engaged in conversations about popular culture, but we also aimed to start these conversataions ourselves within the setting of interviews and focus groups.</p>

<p>We conducted 13 semi-structured 30-minute focus groups of four to seven participants each, followed up by 26 in-depth interviews with pupils in the UK counties of Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex. Our participants were 16 to 17 years old. We opted for a qualitative research methodology which can be more sensitive than a quantitative study to the complexities and details of how people think about their connections to the public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1749975512457141">Couldry et al., 2007</xref>). Focus groups allowed us to prompt answers while at the same time giving respondents the opportunity to engage with each other’s ideas. Interviews were useful tools to explore in more depth the patterns suggested by our focus group data. We started all our conversations by asking respondents to identify the media texts they liked best and why. In focus groups these questions often led to a debate among participants about the quality of a particular media text, which meant we were also able to gather data on the cultural categorizations of our respondents. Working with these examples we then moved on to explore how social and political groups and issues are depicted in the media and whether these had ever instigated action by our respondents. While we tried to make participants’ cultural tastes central to our study, we did ask them to talk about factual television and reality television programmes. We did this in recognition of previous studies’ emphasis on the potential of these media texts as sources of political learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1749975512457141">Livingstone and Markham, 2008</xref>) and of the experience of public engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1749975512457141">Coleman, 2003</xref>). Further, we prompted answers on political engagement and feelings of political efficacy, to help us contextualize respondents’ engagement with the political meanings of media and to ascertain whether respondents were engaged in any political activities of the traditional kind. The number of focus groups and interviews was large enough for us to reach saturation of data after approximately two-thirds of the focus groups and interviews had been completed.</p>
<p>Before we can go on to present the findings of our research, however, we need to acknowledge the limitations of our study: We recruited participants with the help of their sixth-form teachers and relied on a convenience sample of geographically close schools, which had agreed to participate in our study. This approach produced a sample which, while balanced in terms of gender, consisted predominantly of participants who came from white British backgrounds. Furthermore, the catchment areas of all the schools were generally middle-class. This meant that the responses we gathered did not allow us to explore fully the extent to which experiences of social marginalization other than by age or gender may impact on young people’s engagement with popular culture and its political meanings. While the role of such socio-political differences is an important question for future research, with our project we aimed to pursue a more basic but no less fundamental question. Before investigating how social identities such as gender or race impact on the ways in which young people use popular culture as a resource for political engagement, our research asks whether popular culture can ever be such a resource in the first place.</p>

<title>Knowledge, Collective Values and Affinity</title>
<p>Many of the young people we talked to showed that they valued knowledge by attaching importance to learning. What this means in practice is complex and sometimes contradictory:<speech>
<speaker>D:</speaker>
<p>What? Don’t you care about what’s going on?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A:</speaker>
<p>No I do.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>D:</speaker>
<p>Don’t you want to know what’s going on?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A:</speaker>
<p>I don’t know, I just, like, when I turn on the news it’s really boring and they are always behind desks and they are like looking into the camera … don’t know, it’s not interesting if they are saying it but if my friend is saying it.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>D:</speaker>
<p>No, but if you just watch it, you probably haven’t even listened to what they say, you have to watch it for more than like 5 minutes to actually know what’s going on.</p>
<p>(Focus group 13)</p>
</speech></p>
<p>This tension between the values and pleasures of watching the news occurred frequently across focus groups. Watching the news and finding out, as one respondent put it, ‘what’s going on’ for many is something they see as important. They even criticized others for not seeing the point in gathering this kind of knowledge about the world, and measured the extent to which someone cares about the world by their willingness to learn.</p>
<p>However, only a few respondents described themselves as interested in news programmes and none declared an interest in the news without being prompted. Yet, un-prompted by us, many respondents expressed an appreciation of opportunities to gain knowledge about institutions of power and the experiences of diverse social groups in fictional narratives, such as soap operas. Even when they rejected media content for not being what they described as a true reflection of the real, these young people suggested that they use the media to reflect on issues of public concern:<speech>
<speaker>A:</speaker>
<p>There is not really like a mix of ages or anything [in <italic>Hollyoaks</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1749975512457141">2</xref></sup>] so it is all like kids. And they portray them as being like really horrible.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>B:</speaker>
<p>But that’s the point though.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, but not all kids are like that. And I think they give it a really bad …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>B:</speaker>
<p>Do you think? I don’t think it’s like that at all – it’s a really wide span of people. What was that Hannah who had the whole eating disorder thing and Amy who has got the domestic violence with Steve.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>C:</speaker>
<p>And college is meant to be aimed at young people and it’s not like it’s deliberately not having all different age groups from like uni students downwards and I think it’s really good for people of our age to see things like the anorexia, drug use and teenage pregnancies. Basically everything.</p>
<p>(Focus group 1)</p>
</speech></p>
<p>What this exchange shows is that while some of our respondents rejected the mode of presentation of some programmes and soap operas in particular, they nevertheless recognized that fictional narratives are a potential source of learning. Moreover, they identified issues that they deemed to be of relevance for a wider collectivity. In the last example, anorexia, drug use and teenage pregnancy were identified as issues that young people ought to know about.</p>
<p>In their talk about popular culture, our participants identified issues of public concern, but they also discussed how these issues ought to be dealt with by society as a whole. For example, a discussion about the judges on the television talent audition show <italic>Britain</italic>’<italic>s Got Talent</italic> led to an exchange about the acceptable way to treat children:<speech>
<speaker>A:</speaker>
<p>I don’t like it on stuff like <italic>Britain’s Got Talent</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1749975512457141">3</xref></sup> now – I don’t like it when he [Simon Cowell] is nasty to kids though.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>B:</speaker>
<p>If they have talent then you shouldn’t be horrible to them – they should go on there.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A:</speaker>
<p>But no, they are kids and you don’t know.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>B:</speaker>
<p>No, no, no.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>C:</speaker>
<p>They shouldn’t be treated differently just because of their age.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A:</speaker>
<p>Yes they should.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>B:</speaker>
<p>No they shouldn’t – if they haven’t got talent.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A:</speaker>
<p>If you’ve got an 8 year old on there who thinks he can sing and his parents are too stupid to tell him that he can’t – then standing out on stage and [judge] Simon [Cowell] is like yelling at him. …</p>
<p>…</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>B:</speaker>
<p>But he tells adults as well and I don’t see why it should be any different if they’re a child.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A:</speaker>
<p>But adults can take it.</p>
<p>(Focus group 1)</p>
</speech></p>
<p>Exchanges likes this demonstrate that our respondents are grappling with notions of responsibility towards strangers. These young people clearly explored the question of how people should treat each other and they sought to apply a set of values to a community of people which included people whom they might never meet. They made the question of how adults should treat children an issue of wider public concern.</p>
<p>Discussions about one’s responsibility towards strangers cropped up in particular whenever conversations turned to the topic of video games. Many identified the opportunity to challenge social norms and to act in immoral ways as a pleasure they derive from gaming:<speech>
<speaker>C:</speaker>
<p>It sounds really bad, but it’s really fun killing <italic>The Sims</italic>. Because, like if you put them in a room with like a fireplace and take out the door then they can’t get out and the fire …</p>
<p>[Laughing]</p>
<p>(Focus group 2)</p>
</speech></p>
<p>The ability to control and even kill characters in <italic>The Sims</italic> is clearly identified as one of the pleasures of the game. However, this pleasure is not revealed without the signal that murder is understood as morally wrong. In conversations about the pleasures of violent games our respondents made a distinction between the ‘real’, where social norms apply, and the ‘unreal’ or imaginary, where they do not. In making this distinction, our respondents maintain that in the ‘real world’, there should be certain principles that govern people’s behaviour towards others. Moreover, they signalled that they subscribe to these principles themselves. To us this is evidence that when talking about popular culture our respondents express their political values. Our respondents’ answers suggest they use the media to gather knowledge about the world they live in, to encounter unfamiliar social identities and playfully to explore the principles that govern how people live together. To us these were moments when, in talking about popular culture, our participants built up and worked through some of what we have identified as key preconditions of political engagement.</p>
<p>Earlier in this paper we suggested that at moments when young people consider their social responsibility towards others, or when they express an interest in the experiences of diverse social groups, they may be motivated by feelings of affinity. A young person might express these feelings by vocalizing an interest in the lives of others, but inherent in this interest is a sense that their life and their interests are somehow connected with those of others. We suggest that political engagement may be informed by the feeling of belonging to a wider collectivity. The role of popular culture here is twofold: It offers the feeling of being represented, but also of feeling part of a wider collectivity and its shared cultural practices.</p>
<p>When describing what popular culture means to them, some respondents expressed a strong sense of cultural identity and belonging. In the following example, our respondents strongly identify with Asian culture and describe music as central to the expression of their ethno-cultural identity:<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Do you think your music tells people something about yourself?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>B:</speaker>
<p>I think they do.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A:</speaker>
<p>Yeah.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>B:</speaker>
<p>Because, like you get some people who are Asian but they don’t listen to Asian music so you know they are not as …</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A:</speaker><p>In touch with their culture.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>B:</speaker>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>(Focus group 4)</p>
</speech></p>
<p>As this last example illustrates, some of our respondents expressed a sense of connectedness with others by talking about particular cultural practices. Others expressed this feeling by referring to a concept of a collectively shared ‘homeland’, as the following exchange about public voting on talent reality shows reveals:<speech>
<speaker>B:</speaker>
<p>And everyone goes on the fact of where that person comes from, if you get someone from Newcastle, like if someone was from Norwich and even if I didn’t know them, I probably would vote for them just because it would be great.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A:</speaker>
<p>Just because they are from Norwich.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Would you? Why?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>D:</speaker><p>They’re from Norwich.</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>B:</speaker>
<p>Just because they are from Norwich, I mean, why not. If they won, we would end up holding, it’s nothing like about pride of Norwich, it’s just the fact that they are from Norwich. Like everyone was fascinated by that one off <italic>Big Brother</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1749975512457141">4</xref></sup>, what was his name? Craig? Just because he was from Sheringham.</p>
<p>(Focus group 6)</p>
</speech></p>
<p>When our respondents constructed their sense of self in this way, they did not explicitly talk about citizenship. However, they imagined the geographic as well as the cultural foundations of their community and they placed themselves within it. In this way many expressed a sense of belonging to Norfolk, Essex and Suffolk, the counties in which they live. To us such statements have a clear public dimension and suggest that popular culture offers our participants ways into developing and strengthening a sense of connectedness with other members of a public community. While the last example appears to illustrate their affinity to people from specific geographic areas, the following extract from a discussion about comedy illustrates another key theme that emerged in many focus groups and interviews in which respondents drew on a discourse of national identity. Mapping the world into distinct cultural collectivities, they distinguished between a cultural Self and Other:<speech>
<speaker>A:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, some of the jokes as well, especially when they make jokes about some kind of person that obviously us in Britain don’t really know about because for like Americans they, and I’m sure some things in <italic>Eastenders</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1749975512457141">5</xref></sup> they won’t understand because they don’t know the kind of, they don’t live in the country. (Interview 23)</p></speech></p>
<p>Respondents who drew the boundaries of their communities in this way appeared to work with a traditional mapping of the world in which local identity and nation matter most. Yet in some conversations the young people we spoke to also expressed a sense of connectedness with a wider global community. For some of our respondents media representations of human suffering in televised fundraising events like <italic>Comic Relief</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1749975512457141">6</xref></sup> invited them to express affinity with distant others:<speech>
<speaker>A:</speaker>
<p>Yeah, I always ring up. Like in <italic>Comic Relief</italic> when they have the little bits about like the children suffering and things like that, it makes me feel like guilty, like I don’t really do much, I usually ring up. (Interview 8)</p></speech>
</p>
<p>Telethons such as <italic>Comic Relief</italic> of course have been criticized for proffering the notion that charitable acts are a solution to social and political problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1749975512457141">Devereux, 1996</xref>: 48), and also for offering audiences the role of the powerful benign figure that helps the relatively powerless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1749975512457141">Devereux, 1996</xref>: 64–5). It can be argued that telethons sanction a collective gazing at people who are already politically and economically marginalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1749975512457141">Longmore, 2005</xref>). Yet while it is important to recognize that this particular television form may offer a problematic approach to issues such as international development and poverty, popular cultural texts such as telethons need to be recognized for the ways in which they may offer moments that invite audiences to take into account ‘the rest of humanity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1749975512457141">Szerszynski and Urry, 2006</xref>: 116–17). In the last example from one of our interviews, our respondents clearly indicated that images of starving children on television make them connect with these children and their concerns. This moment of connectedness may be brief, but it is there nevertheless.</p>

<title>Using the Resources for Citizenship for Political Engagement?</title>
<p>Picking up the phone and donating money may not in the eyes of some be a particularly significant form of political action. As we suggested in the introduction to this paper, we recognize that for many writers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1749975512457141">Putnam, 2000</xref>) political engagement is more than watching <italic>Comic Relief</italic>. However, in our study we wanted to take seriously the political potential of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1749975512457141">Livingstone (2005</xref>: 28–9) calls ‘early expressions of interest, exploration of experience, tentative trying out of viewpoints’. Talk helps young people to identify and think through issues of public concern and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1749975512457141">Livingstone (2005)</xref> suggests, this activity should be taken seriously for the way in which it might help prepare young people for their participation in the politics of the public sphere. The artificial setting of an interview or focus group cannot recreate moments of such exchange as they happen in everyday life. Yet our set of qualitative data suggests that at least some of our respondents engage in such talk among themselves:<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Do you ever talk to your friends about lyrics?</p></speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A:</speaker>
<p>All the time! I’m annoyed because I’m always like, ‘listen to it properly’ and what you think?’ Because I always try and relate it to my life because I’m really sad, but yeah, always, we’re always talk[ing] about it, me and the girls, not so much with my boyfriends as such but if we’re talking about something, especially because we’re like, if we’ve got problems we just sit in class and like, ‘listen to this song, how much does it remind you of it’ and it just makes you even sadder. But we always talk about lyrics and think.</p>
<p>(Interview 14)</p></speech></p>
<p>What examples like this indicate is that by talking about the meanings of a media text, young people may engage each other in conversations about political issues. The politics of this dialogue may not always be explicitly about institutions of the state or political parties, but as we have argued throughout this paper, talk about the interest of social groups and how they live together is talk about political issues. Media texts that traditionally are not considered to stimulate political engagement, such as a pop song or a video game, stimulate these exchanges of ideas. Future research can reveal the frequency with which such exchanges actually take place in young people’s lives and whether they ever lead to political engagement in the traditional sense. Yet our findings are sufficient to show that in order to grasp the many different ways in which young people may be politically engaged, we need to take seriously the possibility that media texts that are primarily designed for entertainment and diversion may engage young people in conversations about political issues, which to us is an important political activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1749975512457141" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Many young people feel disconnected from formal politics and struggle to see the connection between formal politics and their own lives. Yet such apathy should not be mistaken for indifference. In our study even young people who expressed a lack of interest in government politics engaged in conversations about social responsibility and the interests of diverse social groups. It was talk about popular culture that stimulated these conversations. Our findings suggest that popular culture can provide young people with key resources they need to engage in politics. From our study it seems also clear that, for many, thinking through the meaning of what they see and hear in popular culture is not always a solitary experience. Discussion is a political activity and the young people in our study seem often to engage in talk with each other. Rather than leading young citizens to ‘bowl alone’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1749975512457141">Putnam, 2000</xref>), popular culture provides them with at least some of the resources they need to actively engage in the public sphere, even if those are conventionally not understood as political.</p>
<p>While we feel that our study lends further support to the argument that popular culture can help people to engage in politics, at the same time we want to add a note of caution. Our study echoes the findings of others who have argued that young people remain alienated from formal politics. Much of this perception of formal politics and political participation may be mediated itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1749975512457141">Buckingham 1999</xref>: 176). Social and political elites with the resources to produce strong and effective PR still dominate news reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1749975512457141">Lewis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1749975512457141">Davis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1749975512457141">Allan, 1999</xref>: 70–75), and in news reporting at least, members of the public rarely feature as active contributors to the policy-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1749975512457141">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>). Our data does not allow us to make any strong claims about the extent to which such experiences of powerlessness stem from encounters with media representations of political activism in fictional narratives. However, given that young people use popular culture to explore the geographic and cultural (including normative) boundaries of their political community and to identify issues of public concern, it seems plausible to suggest that representations of political activism not only in the news, but in entertainment television, popular music and video games, may end up undermining its potential to invigorate the public sphere.</p>
