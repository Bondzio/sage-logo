<p><bold>Objective</bold>: To establish the effects of a 12-week, community-based group exercise intervention for people moderately affected with multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p><bold>Design</bold>: Randomized controlled pilot trial.</p>
<p><bold>Setting</bold>: Two community leisure centres.</p>
<p><bold>Participants</bold>: Thirty-two participants with multiple sclerosis randomized into intervention or control groups.</p>
<p><bold>Intervention</bold>: The intervention group received 12 weeks of twice weekly, 60-minute group exercise sessions, including mobility, balance and resistance exercises. The control group received usual care.</p>
<p><bold>Main outcome measures</bold>: An assessor blinded to group allocation assessed participants at baseline, after eight weeks and after 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was 25-foot (7.6 m) walk time, secondary outcomes assessed walking endurance, balance, physical function, leg strength, body mass index, activity levels, fatigue, anxiety and depression, quality of life and goal attainment.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: The intervention made no statistically significant difference to the results of participants’ 25-foot walk time. However the intervention led to many improvements. In the intervention group levels of physical activity improved statistically between baseline and week 8 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and baseline and week 12 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.005). Balance confidence results showed a significant difference between baseline and week 12 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.013). Good effect sizes were found for dynamic balance (<italic>d</italic> = 0.80), leg strength (<italic>d</italic> = 1.33), activity levels (<italic>d</italic> = 1.05) and perceived balance (<italic>d</italic> = 0.94).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: The results of the study suggest that community-based group exercise classes are a feasible option for people moderately affected with multiple sclerosis, and offer benefits such as improved physical activity levels, balance and leg strength.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>For those with multiple sclerosis, a long-term condition which often strikes individuals in early adulthood,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511423946">1</xref></sup> it is important to encourage exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle. Doing so may help manage the many disabling symptoms often associated with the disease including muscle weakness,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511423946">2</xref></sup> reduced balance,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511423946">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511423946">4</xref></sup> reduced mobility,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511423946">3</xref></sup> reduced exercise tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511423946">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511423946">6</xref></sup> and fatigue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511423946">7</xref></sup> Cumulative evidence suggests that exercise may help improve some of these symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511423946">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511423946"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511423946">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The benefits of exercise in those with multiple sclerosis have been investigated in relation to aerobic interventions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511423946">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511423946"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511423946"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511423946"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511423946">15</xref></sup> resistance interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511423946">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511423946"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511423946"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511423946"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511423946"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511423946">21</xref></sup> or balance interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511423946">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511423946">22</xref></sup> Some studies have investigated combined exercise which includes aerobic, resistance and/or balance components in each session.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511423946">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511423946"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511423946"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511423946"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511423946"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511423946">28</xref></sup> In addition, the optimum length of the intervention has yet to be clarified, as previous studies have evaluated interventions varying in length from three weeks to over three months.</p>
<p>Few studies have investigated combined exercise specifically with participants who are moderately affected with multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511423946">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511423946">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511423946">28</xref></sup> Freeman and Allison<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511423946">23</xref></sup> reported that 10 weeks of weekly sessions, comprising 30 minutes of general standing exercises, and 30 minutes of floor-based stretching exercises, increased balance, mobility and improved fatigue in their participants. However only 10 participants took part and no control group was included. Hayes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511423946">27</xref></sup> carried out a randomized controlled study comparing two groups of participants, both undertook 12 weeks of combined exercise (aerobic, upper limb resistance, stretching and balance exercise) for 45–60 minutes thrice weekly, with the intervention group also doing lower limb strengthening exercises. Hayes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511423946">27</xref></sup> found improvements in strength, fatigue and balance in both groups of participants. Cakt et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511423946">28</xref></sup> reported, from a randomized controlled trial, that two months of resisted cycling exercises followed by balance exercises twice weekly for around 60 minutes improved many assessed outcomes, including participants’ mobility, physical function and fatigue levels. Thus combined exercise programmes appear to offer an effective training option for those moderately affected with multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>Current healthcare practice highlights the need for those with long-term conditions to remain as active as possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215511423946">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511423946"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511423946">31</xref></sup> This is particularly relevant for those moderately affected by their multiple sclerosis symptoms who, due to problems such as mobility impairments, may not be able to easily access standard community-based exercise options aimed at those more able-bodied.</p>
<p>This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness (as defined by an improvement in disease signs and symptoms) of a group, community leisure centre-based combined exercise (aerobic, resistance and balance exercises) intervention for people moderately affected with multiple sclerosis.</p>

<sec id="section2-0269215511423946" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A pretest-posttest randomized controlled trial was designed to compare the effects of 12 weeks of twice weekly community-based exercise with 12 weeks of usual care in people moderately affected by multiple sclerosis. This was a phase II trial as described by the Medical Research Councils Framework for Complex Interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215511423946">32</xref></sup> NHS Ayrshire and Arran hold a register of all patients known to the multiple sclerosis service. Participants were recruited from this register. Participants had a confirmed diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, an Extended Disability Status Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215511423946">33</xref></sup> score of 5 (ambulatory without aid or rest for about 200 m) to 6.5 (constant bilateral assistance required to walk about 20 m without resting), stable rehabilitation and drug therapy for 30 days before entry into the study, cognitive scores of over 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215511423946">34</xref></sup> and access to the intervention sites using their own or public transport. Potential participants were excluded if they had experienced exacerbation of their multiple sclerosis symptoms three months prior to the study, or had any medical condition which may preclude them from taking part in the exercise intervention. Ethical approval was provided by the West of Scotland Research Ethics Committee and all participants provided written informed consent.</p>
<p>Of the 873 patients on the clinical register for multiple sclerosis 159 patients were deemed suitable for the study. These people were sent invitation letters and participant information sheets. Forty-three potential participants expressed an interest in participating. From initial telephone consultation five people did not fit the inclusion criteria, three had relatively high levels of mobility, and two were interested but could not commit the time. Thus 36 people were invited for screening.</p>
<p>The screening appointment established eligibility: adequate cognition using the Mini-Mental State Examination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215511423946">34</xref></sup> and disability using the Extended Disability Status Scale,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215511423946">33</xref></sup> a frequently used measure of disability in multiple sclerosis research which bases scores primarily on mobility. Four potential participants were excluded: two with Extended Disability Status Scale scores of 4.5, one who was suffering relapse and one who could not commit the time. Thus 32 people with multiple sclerosis, 23 female and nine male, participated in the study. Demographic information, including sex, age, Extended Disability Status Score and time since disease onset are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215511423946">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The intervention took place at two different geographical locations (Site A and Site B). From those living near Site A a list of potential participants (<italic>n = </italic>16) was created and, to maximise class occupancy, 10 potential participants were allocated to Site A’s intervention group. A computer program (Microsoft Excel 2003) was set up to randomly assign the 10 people to the exercise group and 6 to the control group. A similar system was used for Site B (which had a class capacity of 12), for which a list of potential participants (<italic>n = </italic>20) was created.</p>
<sec id="section3-0269215511423946">
<title>Outcome measures</title>
<p>Outcome measures were carried out within the local hospital’s rehabilitation unit. They were taken at baseline, after 8 and 12 weeks of the intervention period (i.e. either the exercise class or usual care). One assessor, an experienced physiotherapist, blinded to group allocation, carried out all physical assessments. To counteract the potential effects of fatigue, three versions of the assessment protocol were used, with tests carried out in different orders. The version used was randomly allocated at baseline to each participant, with the same version of assessment subsequently used at weeks 8 and 12. Participants requiring assistive devices did so as required; this was noted to allow for consistency at week 8 and 12.</p>
<p>The Timed 25-Foot Walk Test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269215511423946">35</xref></sup> was chosen as the primary outcome measure. The Timed 25-Foot Walk Test measures walking speed over a short distance and has shown good reliability and validity in the multiple sclerosis population as an individual component of the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite disability assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269215511423946">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269215511423946">37</xref></sup> Two lines 25 feet (7.6 m) apart were marked on the floor; to allow for acceleration and deceleration, participants started walking one step behind one marked line and walked past the second line. The time taken to walk the marked 25-foot (7.6 m) distance was recorded with a stopwatch. This was repeated three times and the mean of the three times recorded.</p>
<p>The following were included as secondary outcome measures: body mass index (weight (kg)/[height<sup>2</sup>](m)) was calculated. The six-minute walk test,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269215511423946">38</xref></sup> a test of endurance, was undertaken following established protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269215511423946">39</xref></sup> The distance walked during the 6 minutes was recorded.</p>
<p>Dynamic balance was assessed using the Berg Balance Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269215511423946">40</xref></sup> Fourteen functional balance tasks were performed and rated by the assessor, using a four-point scoring scale, producing a total score between 0 and 56, higher scores being indicative of better dynamic balance. Physical function was measured with the Timed Up and Go test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269215511423946">41</xref></sup> The time to stand up from a standard chair, walk around a cone placed 3 m away and return to sit on the chair was recorded. This was repeated three times and the mean of the three times recorded</p>
<p>Quadriceps strength of the weaker leg (established at baseline by measuring both legs) was measured using a ‘break test’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269215511423946">42</xref></sup> with a hand-held dynamometer (Manual Muscle Tester, Model 01163, Lafayette, IN, USA). For the test participants sat with their back and feet unsupported and their hips and knees at 90 degrees. The dynamometer was placed anterior to their ankle joint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269215511423946">43</xref></sup> and the length of the lever arm (i.e. the distance from the proximal surface of the dynamometer to the apex of their patella) was recorded. The maximum isometric force generated by the participant over 4 seconds was recorded in kilograms. At each assessment three scores from the weaker leg were recorded and converted to torque in newton metres ((kg output × 9.81) × lever-arm length) and the mean score was recorded.</p>
<p>Activity levels were measured using the PhoneFITT questionnaire,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269215511423946">44</xref></sup> this interview format asks participants to provide information on the time spent and how often, in a typical month, they undertake six specific common household tasks and 11 particular forms of physical activity with the option to include other personal activities not included in the questionnaire. Higher scores indicate higher levels of activity.</p>
<p>Self-perceived balance confidence was assessed using the Activities Balance Confidence questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269215511423946">45</xref></sup> Fifteen questions ask participants to rate on a 10-point Likert scale their confidence in their balance when performing daily tasks, yielding a total score 0–150. Higher scores are indicative of better self-confidence in balance. Fatigue was assessed with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269215511423946">46</xref></sup> on which participants rate their agreement to nine fatigue-related questions on a seven-point Likert scale, producing a mean score (0–7) with lower scores indicative of lower fatigue. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269215511423946">47</xref></sup> was used to assess anxiety and depression. Participants rate 14 items on a 4-point scale, generating a total score of 0–42. Higher scores indicate more anxiety and depression. Quality of life was assessed using the Leeds Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269215511423946">48</xref></sup> which asks participants to rate eight health-related questions on a 4-point scale, in relation to the past month, producing a score between 0 and 24. Lower scores are indicative of higher quality of life.</p>
<p>The Goal Attainment Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269215511423946">49</xref></sup> is a method of assessing individual participants’ goals. The Goal Attainment Scale was modified in accordance with the methods of Turner-Stokes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269215511423946">50</xref></sup> (i.e. by creating a list of 11 possible goals, with a 12th ‘personal’ goal). Expected achievement of each goal was established from the literature and through discussion with the research team, thus creating a 5-point scale (between −2 and +2) for each goal. The participants chose three goals, from the list of 12, to be achieved by the end of the 12-week intervention. Each participant also listed their chosen goals in order of importance (from 1 to 3) and weighed the possibility of achievement (from 1 to 3). The overall Goal Attainment Scale score was calculated using an automated Microsoft Excel spreadsheet which applies a standard mathematical formula,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269215511423946">50</xref></sup> to produce baseline scores and, after the 12-week intervention, achieved scores. The difference between these (achieved minus baseline) was used for analysis with higher scores indicative of greater personal goal achievement.</p>

<title>Intervention</title>
<p>Participants assigned to the intervention group attended a leisure centre-based exercise class, twice weekly for 12 weeks. Each group was led by two instructors (one physiotherapist and one fitness instructor). The same physiotherapist was present at both sites; however fitness instructors were different between sites. The group session involved a 10-minute warm-up of aerobic and stretching components, 30–40 minutes of circuit exercises (Appendix 1 on-line), designed to train aerobic endurance, resistance and balance, and a 5–10 minute cool-down, involving aerobic work, stretching and relaxation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269215511423946">51</xref></sup> Participants completed a circuit of 8–12 different exercises for 1 minute each, having a rest (of a minimum of 1 minute) before moving to the next exercise. Not all exercises were performed at all classes, and in week 9 a fifth level of difficulty was added to some of the exercises to encourage progress. Instruction cards, with photographs, demonstrating the four different levels of skill/difficulty were used at both sites. Through discussion with the instructors, participants chose which level of each exercise they deemed appropriate and also when and how each exercise should be progressed. Participants worked at a self-regulated pace for each exercise. Participants were provided with exercise progress cards and were asked to record which level they performed each exercise at each session. Attendance of participants at each class was recorded.</p>
<p>Participants assigned to the control group were advised to continue their usual routine, seeking any healthcare as required. They were asked to avoid beginning any new exercise regime for the 12 weeks of the study.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data were analysed using Minitab version 16 and SPSS version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) statistical packages. For demographic variables which were found to be parametric (e.g. body mass index) independent sample <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to determine differences, and for non-parametric outcomes (e.g. age) a Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test was used. All outcome measures were analysed on the basis of intention to treat, with all variables summarized and comparisons made between groups and over time. Data were analysed using a univariate general linear model analysis of variance (ANOVA) which allowed for missing data, possible differences over time (baseline, week 8 and week 12) and possible differences between groups (intervention and control) to be assessed. The ANOVA assumption of normality was assessed using the Kolmoroff-Smirnoff test. For variables found not to be normally distributed, natural logarithmic transformations were used and these are presented. Significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. The impact of the intervention effect size was calculated using Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> analysis with weak effect size &lt;0.5, moderate effect size 0.5&lt;0.8 and good effect size ≥0.8 being used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269215511423946">52</xref></sup> Clinical effectiveness was also calculated as percentage change for all outcome measures after the 12 weeks for both groups.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Twenty participants were allocated to the intervention group with 12 participants to the control group. The intervention group comprised 5 men and 15 women, with 4 men and 8 women in the control group. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215511423946">Table 1</xref> shows that, at baseline, there were no statistical differences between the two groups in terms of age (<italic>P</italic> = 0.893), years since disease onset (<italic>P</italic> = 0.687) or any of the assessed outcome measures. The recruitment, withdrawals and missing data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511423946">Figure 1</xref>.

<p>Including those who discontinued participation, the total attendance at the classes was 340 sessions out of a possible 480 (71%) with participants missing classes due to other appointments, family/work commitments, transport problems, holidays or mild ill-health (e.g. common cold).</p>
<p>For the primary outcome measure, the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, the ANOVA results demonstrated no statistically significant difference over time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511423946">Table 2</xref>). Although there was no statistically significant improvement in the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test the mean scores improved by 7.2 seconds (24%) in the intervention group compared with the 3 seconds (19%) in the control group. Large standard deviations were present in both groups. After 8 weeks and 12 weeks of the intervention weak effect sizes of <italic>d</italic> = 0.30 and <italic>d</italic> = 0.23 respectively were seen for the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test scores.</p>

<p>In terms of activity levels (PhoneFITT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269215511423946">53</xref></sup>), the results of the ANOVA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511423946">Table 2</xref>) revealed a statistically significant difference between the groups (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) with the group behaviour, over time, being significantly different (<italic>P</italic> = 0.009), warranting post-hoc analysis. In the intervention group there was a statistically significant difference between the results at baseline and week 8 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and baseline and week 12 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.005). In the control group there were no significant differences between any of the time points.</p>
<p>For balance confidence (Activities Balance Confidence), the ANOVA results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511423946">Table 2</xref>) revealed a statistically significant difference between the groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001) and the group behaviours over time were near significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.059), thus post-hoc analysis was performed. In the intervention group there was found to be a significant difference between the results at baseline and week 12 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.013) only. Furthermore, in the control group there were no significant differences between any of the time points.</p>
<p>For all other outcome measures the results of the ANOVA suggested there was no evidence that the intervention had any effect (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511423946">Table 2</xref>). However for most outcome measures the intervention groups improved to a greater extent than the control group, as suggested by the clinical effect results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511423946">Table 2</xref>), for example weaker leg strength almost doubled in the intervention group, from 27.9 Nm to 54.5 Nm (increase of 95%), compared with a smaller improvement, from 28.3 Nm to 34.3 Nm (increase of 21%), in the controls.</p>
<p>Furthermore, despite no significant effect over time, effect sizes were calculated and it was found that most of the outcome measures improved more after the 12 weeks than after the 8 weeks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511423946">Table 2</xref>). For example, after 8 weeks leg strength showed a weak effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 0.2), but after 12 weeks of the intervention a good effect was found (<italic>d</italic> = 1.33). Other outcome measures showing good effect sizes at week 12 included the Berg Balance Scale (<italic>d</italic> = 0.8), PhoneFITT (<italic>d</italic> = 1.05) and Activities Balance Confidence scale (<italic>d</italic> = 0.94), with a moderate effect size for Fatigue Severity Scale scores (<italic>d</italic> = 0.67). However, this was not true for all the outcomes, with some showing a better effect at the week 8 assessments (e.g. the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test and the activity levels of participants).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215511423946">Table 3</xref> summarizes the collective goals chosen by the participants via the Goal Attainment Scale. Improving fatigue scores was the priority goal for most participants (<italic>n = </italic>7), closely followed by improving weaker leg strength, balance and walking endurance. There was an overall improvement in mean group scores for set goals, with a 9% clinical improvement (from a mean score of 5.5 to 5) to accompany the moderate effect size in fatigue scores.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a leisure centre-based combined exercise intervention for people moderately affected with multiple sclerosis comparing results against a cohort of age, sex, and disability level-matched controls with multiple sclerosis who received usual care. Although there was no evidence that the intervention had any statistically significant effect on the primary outcome measure, the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, overall findings suggest improvement in all outcome measures for those in the intervention group. Participation in the exercise intervention led to statistically significant improvements in physical activity levels (PhoneFITT) and perceived balance confidence (Activities Balance Confidence scale). Good effect sizes were also found for dynamic balance (Berg Balance Scale), leg strength (weakest quadriceps strength), activity levels (PhoneFITT) and balance confidence (Activities Balance Confidence scale).</p>
<p>One of the key findings of the present study was an increase in physical activity levels both at week 8 and at week 12 in the intervention group. This result is perhaps unsurprising as participants were taking part in an exercise programme. The PhoneFITT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269215511423946">44</xref></sup> considers a variety of daily life and exercise activities and captures data on frequency, intensity and time spent on each activity. It has been used in few studies, primarily in healthy older people,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269215511423946">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269215511423946">54</xref></sup> thus we are unable to directly compare our physical activity results with other studies.</p>
<p>Few studies looking at exercise interventions for people with multiple sclerosis have included physical activity levels within their outcome measures. Mostert and Kesselring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511423946">12</xref></sup> used the Baecke Activity questionnaire to investigate the effects of aerobic exercise specifically on activity levels in people with multiple sclerosis. Activity levels increased in their participants by on average 4%, far less than the 47% increase in our study. An increase in activity may be beneficial to a disease population previously found to be more sedentary than their healthier peers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511423946">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269215511423946">55</xref></sup> helping to manage both multiple sclerosis-related symptom deterioration, such as muscle weakness and reduced balance, and also to aid prevention of other comorbidities associated with inactivity, such as cardiovascular problems, obesity, diabetes, psychological ill-heath and cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269215511423946">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Results from our study suggest that both balance confidence and dynamic balance improved with the exercise intervention. Although there was no statistically significant improvement in dynamic balance (Berg Balance Scale) we found a good effect size in our intervention participants. Previous studies on the effect of exercise on balance in people with multiple sclerosis have reported significant results for this assessment. Freeman and Allison<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511423946">23</xref></sup> found a significant improvement in Berg Balance Scale scores (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02) at the end of their 10-week, twice weekly, combined exercise intervention in a single cohort of participants who had an average Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 5. Hayes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511423946">27</xref></sup> demonstrated a significant difference in Berg Balance Scores between two groups (undertaking two different balance interventions) following 12 weeks of combined exercise in participants with a mean Extended Disability Status Scale score of 5.2. Cattaneo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511423946">3</xref></sup> studied three groups of people with multiple sclerosis who had balance problems (&lt;53 points on the Berg Balance Scale), of whom less than half required walking aids. Two groups received inpatient balance-related rehabilitation (either motor and sensory training, or motor training only) and one inpatient group acted as controls. Cattaneo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511423946">3</xref></sup> found Berg Balance Scale scores were significantly different between groups following the three weeks of 10–12 45-minute sessions. However, participants in these studies had lower levels of disability than those in our study.</p>
<p>Other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511423946">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511423946">22</xref></sup> which have used the Activities Balance Confidence questionnaire have reported differing results to the present study. Cattaneo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511423946">3</xref></sup> did not find any significant difference in the results of the Activities Balance Confidence questionnaire over time, nor did Freeman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511423946">22</xref></sup> whose participants (with a similar disability level to our participants) followed eight weeks of one to one outpatient physiotherapy core balance sessions, with additional home exercises. The Activities Balance Confidence includes questions in relation to everyday experiences (e.g. ‘get into or out of a car’) and as the study by Cattaneo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511423946">3</xref></sup> investigated inpatients the Activities Balance Confidence may not have been an appropriate outcome measure. As balance is noted as being a common problem among those with multiple sclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511423946">4</xref></sup> and an important goal for many of the participants involved in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215511423946">Table 3</xref>), it is desirable that more emphasis is placed on both the assessment of balance and exercise interventions to improve individuals’ balance and prevent falls, a common problem for those with multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269215511423946">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the Goal Attainment Scale results it could be seen that reducing fatigue was a goal of many of the study participants. However, although our exercise intervention failed to significantly improve fatigue scores over time, perhaps due to a ceiling effect with baseline scores, a moderate effect size was noted as was a small clinical improvement. Furthermore, the exercise intervention did not appear to increase participants’ levels of fatigue.</p>
<p>Our results also indicated that the exercise intervention increased the muscle strength of participants’ weaker leg, although this failed to reach statistical significance. This finding is similar to that of Hayes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511423946">27</xref></sup> who reported clinical improvements in their participants’ leg strength. Others using a resistance-specific intervention have found more significant results. White et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511423946">19</xref></sup> and Gutierrez et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511423946">18</xref></sup> reporting results from the same study, showed that eight weeks of twice weekly progressive lower limb strengthening, in a fitness centre, resulted in significant strength gains for knee extensor and ankle plantar flexor muscles. Taylor et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511423946">16</xref></sup> found significant gains in general leg muscle performance following an eight-week, thrice-weekly intervention which focused solely on upper and lower body resistance training. This evidence suggests that while strength gains are possible from a combined exercise programme, a resistance-specific exercise programme may be required to achieve significant improvements in muscle strength.</p>
<p>The present study was undertaken in two community leisure setting, this is one of the first studies to utilise this format and, as there is a trend toward longer term rehabilitation and symptom management in the community in the UK,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215511423946">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215511423946">31</xref></sup> the results of this study are timely. Due to the success of the programme the local leisure services decided to continue the multiple sclerosis exercise class led by two fitness instructors who have undergone training from physiotherapists on exercise for those with multiple sclerosis. Thus one of the main benefits of this study has been the establishment of a regular, local, multiple sclerosis-specific exercise class.</p>
<p>The initial interest in the study was not as good as anticipated, perhaps due to the commitment of a twice-weekly class for 12 weeks, and thus group numbers were not equal, resulting in the small sample size being one of the limitations of this study. Despite this, the class attendance rates were reasonable, with reasons such as other appointments, family/work commitments, transport problems, holidays or mild ill-health (e.g.common cold) given for non-attendance or discontinued study participation. On initial inspection our attendance rates (71%) appear lower than other studies with similar class-based methodology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511423946">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511423946">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511423946">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511423946">28</xref></sup> all of whom reported greater than 80% attendance. Our data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis, and if data from the three participants who discontinued participation was excluded, our attendance rates were 77% and thus almost comparable with other similar studies. However participants in these other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511423946">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511423946">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511423946">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511423946">28</xref></sup> had fewer mobility problems.</p>
<p>People with moderate multiple sclerosis present with a wide range of balance, fatigue and mobility problems, consequently large standard deviations were seen throughout the results, perhaps resulting in our primary outcome measure, the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, not achieving more significant results. Other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511423946">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511423946">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511423946">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511423946">23</xref></sup> which have included participants with similar levels of disability have also reported large standard deviations. Thus, even with a narrow Extended Disability Status Scale range (5–6.5) heterogeneity was evident within the sample. For studies of people moderately affected by multiple sclerosis it may be advisable to narrow the Extended Disability Status Scale range further. For example, using the results of the present study, but narrowing the Extended Disability Status Scale range to 5–6, only 30 participants in each group would be required to achieve a power of 92% (with significance set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), for an improvement of more than 2 seconds in the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test results to be significant. However, narrowing the inclusion criteria may jeopardize recruitment numbers further. The onset of physical fatigue during the assessments was evident during our study and may be seen as a limitation, however we anticipated this and three versions of the assessments protocol (alternating the order of mobility, balance and strength assessments) were utilised to counteract the potential effect of fatigue on the results.</p>
<p>Past studies have evaluated interventions varying in length from three weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511423946">3</xref></sup> to over three months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511423946">15</xref></sup> By taking outcome measures at week 8 and week 12 our study aimed to assess the optimum length of exercise intervention required. No conclusive findings emerged, perhaps due to the small sample size; therefore it is not possible to make specific recommendations. However, as more of the outcome measures improved after 12 weeks of the intervention, than after only 8 weeks, a longer exercise period may be more beneficial.</p>
<p>This study demonstrated that a leisure centre-based group exercise class combining aerobic, resistance and balance exercises is feasible. Results suggested the intervention was effective in improving activity levels, balance and strength in people moderately affected with multiple sclerosis, with no worsening of their fatigue levels. Larger scale studies in those moderately affected with multiple sclerosis are required.</p>
