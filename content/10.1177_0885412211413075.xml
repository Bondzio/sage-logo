<p>Based on a set of commissioned papers for a Brookings Institution conference in 2009, this volume is intended to help policy makers and scholars judge the effectiveness of various urban and regional policy interventions. Noting that debates on urban policy often are short on evidence about the impacts of those policies, the editors asked the well-qualified set of contributors “to take a fresh and unfettered look at the area and conceptualize (or reconceptualize) the issue and the questions that should be asked to inform intelligent public debate” (p. 2). The contributors successfully meet this challenge, providing balanced and incisive treatments of five key policy topics. The chapters are relatively lengthy in comparison to ordinary journal-length papers, allowing the authors an opportunity to ask tough evidentiary and methodological questions about past research and to provide nuance in their conclusions about what advice can and cannot be confidently offered to policy practitioners. If there is any overarching theme, it might be described as a need to scale back our expectations regarding the efficacy of urban policies—even those that the research community had put forward with great enthusiasm in the past.</p>
<p>Two of the chapters are particularly relevant to planners. G. Thomas Kingsley provides an overview of how neighborhoods and governments are coping with the burgeoning problem of foreclosures. He finds that something of an “experts' consensus” exists on the steps that should be taken to stabilize foreclosure-heavy areas (with different treatments for different types of neighborhood conditions). But implementation of these ideas has been difficult because of a familiar array of problems: the difficulties of vertical and horizontal coordination among agencies and layers of government (significant because of the need for metro-wide strategies to address foreclosures), a lack of quality information and data systems, and the lack of fiscal and organizational capacity of local governments to either directly acquire and manage vacant properties or to compel private landowners to take remedial actions.</p>
<p>Genevieve Giuliano and Ajay Agarwal investigate how much evidence is there to support the idea that rail transit investments lead to more compact urban form, in the already decentralized metropolitan areas typical of the United States. Evaluating a range of research studies and approaches, they provide a mixed picture regarding the impacts of transit, although acknowledging that many studies have been too short term to reveal the full effects of rail systems. Still, the overall impression that emerges is not an encouraging one for those who would pin their hopes on transit-oriented development as a centerpiece of a smart-growth transformation. Giuliano and Agarwal argue that the ubiquity of the existing road network means that transit’s gains in relative accessibility advantages from new investments are frequently minimal.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Robert Baade provides a thorough, readable account of why subsidies for stadiums and other sports facilities very rarely provide a favorable benefit/cost payoff, and highlights the types of flaws made in conventional impact studies, typically leading to inflated measures of economic development benefits. Ron Zimmer and his coauthors note some of the painstaking research design considerations that are involved in fairly evaluating charter schools and school voucher programs. Findings on the effects of choice remain somewhat of a muddle, and Zimmer et al. advise researchers to delve more closely inside the black box of how schools actually operate to tease out which particular practices might influence student outcomes. Robert Wassmer reviews theory, and the limited body of evidence, about the use of commuter taxes to fund central cities. He finds the commuter tax a generally poor substitute for such alternatives as regionalizing the cost of city services that have spillover benefits, or allowing more annexation by central cities.</p>
<p>In a particularly interesting section of the introductory chapter, the editors briefly describe why serious policy research usually fails to influence real-world policy debates. Research falls short of making an impact in part because of the characteristics of researchers (their emphasis on technique and methodology, the lack of academic credit given to overviews of policy research, and the focus on statistical rather than substantive significance); and in part due to characteristics of policy makers (short political time horizons, lack of comfort with abstractions or “messy” findings, and preference for simple narrative story lines). Ironically, while this volume was created with a keen awareness of this disconnect between researchers and policy makers, it was nonetheless fashioned as a traditional book featuring five disparate policy topics—not the best vehicle to make this valuable information available in a timely fashion to the busy legislative staff, bureaucrats, and advocates toiling in each policy area. One wonders why Brookings did not instead release each analysis separately as an online report with an accompanying press release and glossy policy brief.</p>
