<abstract>
<p>In response to the absence of entrepreneurial action on behalf of non-actors, micro-oriented scholars typically tend to refuse to allocate entrepreneurial capacities to the ‘others’ of entrepreneurship. However, in contesting this explanatory practice, macro-oriented scholars counter that ‘others’ do not lack power but opportunity. This article suggests how recurrent dualisms may be fruitfully surpassed within a conceptual framework that accommodates the ontological intuitions of both theorizing tendencies. Guarding against the temptation to deny the existence of either unexercised powers or unexploited opportunities not only allows us to resist the seduction of dualisms, but also allows for the emergence of an expanded worldview that enables a more dynamic conceptualization of the entrepreneurship phenomenon. The analysis closes by recommending directions for meta-theoretical research aiming at the identification of factors that may be hindering entrepreneurship scholarship from cognizance of realist (and realistic) insights.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>In his seminal article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611425838">Gartner (1989a)</xref> forcefully rejected the question of the entrepreneur, a question which <italic>inter alia</italic> means: what is the nature of the intrinsic qualities that allow only some people to engage in entrepreneurial activity? In refutation of views inspired by a heroic conception of entrepreneurial action, Gartner countered that there is nothing special conditioning entrepreneurial activity. From this renewed perspective, just as there is nothing to be learned about dancers aside from the fact that they dance (Yeats in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611425838">Gartner, 1989a</xref>: 47), there is nothing unique to be found in individuals who just exercise entrepreneurial action: ‘an entrepreneur is what an entrepreneur does’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266242611425838">Casson, 2003[1982]</xref>: 19; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266242611425838">Cooper, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0266242611425838">Sarasvathy and Venkataraman, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Under explicit analysis, it becomes obvious that a central aspect of this critique rests upon rejecting the presumption that entrepreneurs are born (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0266242611425838">Nicolaou et al., 2008b</xref>) – a supposition that logically translates into the thesis that unless you are born with some entrepreneurial “stuff” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611425838">Gartner, 1989a</xref>: 61), you cannot act entrepreneurially. Departing from this view, Gartner argues that anyone can act entrepreneurially, in effect raising the expectation that if appropriate conditions are in place, then entrepreneurial action will be the case (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266242611425838">Gartner, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242611425838">1989b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266242611425838">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242611425838">1995</xref>). Against this conceptual landscape, the absence of entrepreneurial action was implicitly attributed to the lack of appropriate situational conditions, and the implicit assumption was that so-called non-entrepreneurs also would react entrepreneurially, had they been exposed to the same environmental contingencies. Similarly, the non-dancers would dance had, say, the music or the hall allowed for dancing to take place.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, although it seems that Gartner’s critique would conclusively silence interest at the individual level of analysis, closer attention to situational variables has led to a ‘renewed interest in the individual within entrepreneurship research’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242611425838">McMullen and Shepherd, 2006</xref>: 149). In particular, it is often argued that even in cases in which it appears that more people could have acted upon opportunities, few actually do. While the macro-oriented turn has raised the expectation that the presence of external stimuli would be sufficient for the possibility of entrepreneurship to occur, it is now contended that not all people respond to the stimuli they encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0266242611425838">Mitchell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0266242611425838">Shane, 2000</xref>). In addition, given that ‘circumstances external to the entrepreneur’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242611425838">Gartner et al., 2003</xref>: 104) have been captured under the concept of opportunity, why is it the case that only some discover or exploit entrepreneurial opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0266242611425838">Shane and Venkataraman, 2000</xref>)? The music is being played, yet only a handful dance. It is in this spirit that micro-oriented scholars argue that the reduction of action to environment neglects basic questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266242611425838">Baron, 2007</xref>), and given that so many people do not ‘respond to the situational cues of opportunities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0266242611425838">Shane and Venkataraman, 2000</xref>: 219), suggest that a second, post-Gartnerian research wave into unique entrepreneurial traits should be launched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266242611425838">Alvarez, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Having documented that from a logical standpoint, this novel research wave is essentially a revival of earlier work, the present article endeavours to address the following knot: to explore how we might resist the methodological drawback of resuscitating the ‘only some can’ presumption without having to solve the puzzle of the non-actor by supposing that opportunity must have been absent. Instead of dealing with the puzzle of the non-actor by swinging the pendulum between two deterministic responses that essentially tackle that puzzling absence by rejecting the ontological intuitions at the heart of the other respective approach, I recommend a more detailed exploration of the so basic, yet under-theorized, category of the ‘non-entrepreneur’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0266242611425838">Ramoglou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0266242611425838">2008</xref>). This would allow us to clearly appreciate that neither must be the case. Rather, the case may be that neither the presence of opportunities nor the presence of agential powers are alone or conjointly sufficient for action to happen. Just as a non-blind person in a sunny landscape will still be in the dark when the eyes are shut, there may be better or worse reasons keeping a no less capable agent from exploiting a truly existing opportunity.</p>
<p>Similarly, neither need it be that the non-dancing individual is paralysed, nor must there be something wrong with the song, the volume or the dancefloor, since there may be better or worse reasons keeping an able dancer from dancing. Put differently, as a conceptual antidote to the revival of the (old) answer of the non-entrepreneur, or the presumption that only context matters, it is recommended that we break free from modes of thought that suppose a functional relationship between opportunity–existence and its exploitation. Instead, we should try to understand what may be keeping an able agent, who may just be not exploiting an entrepreneurial opportunity, from doing so.</p>
<p>It is worth emphasizing that taking the non-actor more seriously by questioning the sufficiency of agential powers to actualize in the face of an opportunity does more than simply allow us to move beyond a sequence of unfruitful dualisms of a deterministic nature (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266242611425838">Drakopoulou and Anderson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242611425838">McMullen and Shepherd, 2006</xref>). Rather, the highlighted solution allows us to move towards an ‘expanded consciousness that takes in the world more fully’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0266242611425838">Nagel, 1986</xref>: 5): a conceptual landscape in which deterministic answers on the individual or environmental level of analysis vanish, thus permitting the dawn of a more dynamic worldview – that is, a view in which unexploited opportunities may neatly coexist with unexercised agencies. Notably, this represents a move towards an ontologically advanced conception, given that this worldview does more justice to the basic ontological insight that we live in a world in which the actual appears to be no more than a metaphysical slice of the possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242611425838">Ayers, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266242611425838">Bhaskar, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242611425838">Lawson, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The structure of this article is as follows. The first section documents how the ‘others’ of entrepreneurship were treated in the pre-Gartnerian era, reviews the critique offered by Gartner, and identifies the macro-oriented modes of explaining the non-actor following the post-Gartnerian turn. The second section documents how the old treatment of the ‘non-entrepreneur’ has revived the question of the entrepreneur, in order to identify the limitations of the macro-oriented turn and, in so doing, paves the way towards what emerges as a more promising pathway for moving forward. The third section aims to raise levels of understanding by trying to lower the level of abstraction in favour of a more concrete illustration of how rational (and irrational) reasons can help us to understand what may be keeping no less able agents from acting accordingly.</p>

<title>The ‘question of the entrepreneur’ and the ‘non-entrepreneur’</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0266242611425838">McClelland’s (1961)</xref> work on achievement motivation, or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266242611425838">Collins and Moore’s (1964)</xref> ‘enterprising man [sic]’, are prototypical examples of the first wave of interest in the carriers of entrepreneurial action,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0266242611425838">1</xref></sup> commonly referred to as the trait tradition. As Baron puts it:
<disp-quote>
<p>[T]he basic premise underlying such research was simple: Entrepreneurs are different from other persons with respect to certain traits, and it is these differences that lead them to recognise opportunities, to pursue them, and so on. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266242611425838">1998</xref>: 26)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>According to Holmquist:
<disp-quote>
<p>The type of questions normally posed shows this: what characteristics are demanded for an entrepreneur to succeed and what separates entrepreneurs from non-entrepreneurs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266242611425838">2003</xref>: 75)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In support of Holmquist’s claim about the ‘type of questions normally posed’, we may cite Gartner’s observation regarding the ‘why’ questions guiding the early wave of person-centred research. After all, Gartner’s critique will be a prime focus of this article, since it provides a critical contribution to entrepreneurship scholarship. More than two decades ago, Gartner wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>Much research in the entrepreneurship field has focused on the person of the entrepreneur, asking the question, why do certain individuals start firms when others, under similar conditions, do not? Asking <italic>why</italic> has led us to answer with <italic>who</italic>: Why did X start a venture? Because X has a certain inner quality or qualities. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611425838">1989a</xref>: 47; emphasis in original)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Three points should be emphasized from the outset. The first concerns the explicit identification of the puzzle that the question of the entrepreneur aims to render intelligible: viz. the puzzling absence of entrepreneurial activity on behalf of so-called ‘others’ who, ‘under similar conditions’, do not act accordingly. It appears that the logical sequence implicit in the question of the entrepreneur is as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0266242611425838" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Non-actors do not act because they cannot.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>They cannot because they are non-entrepreneurs (and not entrepreneurs).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Therefore, they must lack some special enabler.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>This enabler must be rooted in some intrinsic trait(s) of entrepreneurs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We may unlock the mystery of entrepreneurial action by finding ‘stuff’ that only entrepreneurs possess.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The answer to the question ‘Who can be an entrepreneur?’ lies in the identification of this special ‘stuff’.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In short, it is having treated non-actors as ‘non-entrepreneurs’ that the puzzling absence of action is put to rest, and the question of the entrepreneur arises. In fact, the question of the entrepreneur translates as: ‘What would a non-actor have to be in order to be capable of acting accordingly?’</p>
<p>Second, the realization that the search for special qualities is foundationally meant to explain why others cannot behave accordingly may allow us to appreciate more clearly that what needs critical attention pertains principally to the underlying conviction that entrepreneurs ‘must have special personal qualities’ (Cole, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611425838">Gartner, 1989a</xref>: 57) rather than the ways through which pertinent research practices are undertaken per se. The definition of being entrepreneurial may vary, and the nature of substantive research orientations that aim to demystify the postulated capacity need not be unanimous (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242611425838">Lawson, 1999</xref>). Of principal interest is the conviction that ‘some people had a capacity for being entrepreneurial, and others simply did not’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266242611425838">Aldrich, 2005</xref>: 454). Therefore, methodologically our scope of interest will be directed to the logical underpinnings that motivate pertinent research agendas, rather than issues of method and research technique immanent in research efforts already committed to the answer of the ‘non-entrepreneur’.</p>
<p>Third, a further salient point is that this sense of the question of the entrepreneur concerns itself with explanatory issues, since it calls for causal insight capable of rendering intelligible a set of observations on the surface of unfolding events. This observation is crucial, principally for reasons of clarity, given that there is a plethora of research interests that may be housed in research agendas which, <italic>prima facie</italic>, may appear to be identical.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611425838">Gartner (1989a)</xref> appears to be aware of the multiplicity of assumptions and research demands immanent in pertinent research efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266242611425838">Gartner, 2001</xref>), since his critical assault has multiple targets. Most notably, the aphorism ‘“Who is an entrepreneur?” is the wrong question’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611425838">1989a</xref>: 47) is not merely a rejection of the ‘Who can be an entrepreneur?’ sense of the question. It is also a rejection of the ‘What does an entrepreneur “look like”?’ sense of the very same question.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0266242611425838">2</xref></sup> As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242611425838">Gartner (2008)</xref> put it more recently, a basic practice informing his celebrated critique concerns research efforts struggling to fit varieties of entrepreneurs into clear-cut categories and largely mind-dependent, if not distorting, generalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242611425838">Gartner, 2008</xref>). In opposition to this theorizing attitude, he contends that his view has always been that ‘There is no average in entrepreneur’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266242611425838">Gartner, 2008</xref>: 359; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242611425838">Gartner, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0266242611425838">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, what should be explicitly identified is that our present interest lies in the ‘Who can be an entrepreneur?’ sense of the question: that is, the question concerned with the ontological presuppositions informing the trait agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242611425838">Lawson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0266242611425838">Maki, 2001</xref>). To put this from a complementary standpoint, we are interested in the use of the word trait in its causal rather than descriptive sense. Of course, this is not to say that the other sort of critique regarding the behavioural characteristics of entrepreneurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0266242611425838">Thornton, 1999</xref>) is not promising or important. This choice basically stems from the motivation of this article to engage with the resuscitated interest in the person of the entrepreneur; an interest which, as we will see in due course, does not principally lie in the request for crude generalizations as in the desire to slip back into a deterministic explanation of ‘others’. Having heightened levels of clarity, we may now turn to examine the way that Gartner engages with the causal insinuations dictating scholarly engagement with the target phenomena.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0266242611425838">
<title>Gartner’s critique</title>
<p>Regardless of the persuasiveness of modes of thought regarding the ‘who can?’ of entrepreneurship, or their consistency with theoretical propositions maintained by founding theorists of the entrepreneurial discourse, the chief problem identified by Gartner is that they have been explanatorily unsuccessful. Epistemologically, the question is attacked basically due to its predictive failure. Whereas ‘[a] theory predicts by suggesting causality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242611425838">1989b</xref>: 29) and the validity of the theory is backed by confirmatory instances, the hypotheses offered in the trait genre have simply proved ‘inadequate to explain the phenomenon of entrepreneurship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611425838">1989a</xref>: 48).</p>
<p>This conception of scientific method is rooted in the covering law model of event explanation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266242611425838">Hempel, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266242611425838">Hempel and Oppenheim, 1948</xref>), underpinning the so-called symmetry thesis: the explanatory validity of a causal account is to be evaluated by its predictive power (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266242611425838">Hempel and Oppenheim, 1948</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242611425838">Mill, 1970[1843]</xref>). Put simply, if we know the cause of an event, we know that we should expect the event when the cause is present, and when the event in question occurs, we additionally know its cause. This prevailing model of explanation descends from Hume’s most famous definition of causation: ‘we may define a cause to be an object followed by another, and where all the objects, similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to the second’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266242611425838">1958[1748]</xref>: 76).</p>
<p>The main reason that person-centred explanations have been met sceptically is that ‘the function of an empirical hypothesis is to provide a rule for the anticipation of experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266242611425838">Ayer, 2001[1936]</xref>: 23), and person-centred explanations of entrepreneurship have sustained empirically unfertile hypotheses. Whereas explanations of the nature of the entrepreneur have equipped researchers with the expectation that the causal agent of future entrepreneurial acts should possess specific traits, experience continued to broaden the class of characteristics of the individuals who exhibited entrepreneurial behaviour, to the extent that an entrepreneur appeared to be ‘someone so full of traits that (s)he would have to be a sort of generic “everyman”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611425838">Gartner, 1989a</xref>: 57).</p>
<p>From an explanatory standpoint, the main source of scepticism does not seem to have been that people with presumed entrepreneurial qualities did not exercise action. It is relatively easy to ‘protect’ this theory from falsification by appealing to commonsense reminders, such as the fact that not all people desire to engage in this type of economic activity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0266242611425838">4</xref></sup> The deepest worry seems to have been that individuals without the postulated traits were continually being discovered. This means that the ‘following objects’ (entrepreneurial acts) could not be traced back to some perennial ‘causal object’ (the entrepreneurial quality), but rather that disparate causal agents were continually recognized. From a logical viewpoint, this means that whatever the (logically possible) causal role of postulated traits, it could have not been necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0266242611425838">Mill, 1970[1843]</xref>).</p>
<p>From a phenomenological standpoint, the surprise came from the recognition that while theories have equipped researchers with particular expectations of who could act entrepreneurially, it has been unexpected people who exercise action. Instances of actions on behalf of people without the posited characteristic rightly disconfirmed the hypothesis that specific traits provided the necessary conditions for entrepreneurial action. It was just acknowledged that ‘entrepreneurs come in every shape, size, colour, and from all backgrounds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266242611425838">Hatten, 1997</xref>: 40), and this surprising moment promoted our understanding by helping us to realize that we should have never expected that only uniquely endowed people could engage in entrepreneurial activities.</p>
<p>An important lesson to retain from Gartner’s assessment of the research conundrums of person-centred research is that we should not have abandoned the ‘all can’ presumption so cursorily. After all, progress in understanding does not necessitate the discovery of previously unknown aspects of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266242611425838">Lawson, 2003a</xref>); rather, progress may lie in the recovery of understandings that may have been previously abandoned or simply remained unutilized. As Lawson puts it:
<disp-quote>
<p>[I]t may be the case that the surprise or shock of an unexpected contrast encourages us to examine our current understanding and realise that we already have an explanation of it … [A] development which shocks or surprises or otherwise interests us may (whatever the precise cause) lead first and foremost to introspection or self-reflection, and thus to a resolution by way of understandings already (if only tacitly) possessed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266242611425838">2003a</xref>: 97)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>What we always have known is that it is not that reasonable to maintain that some special quality should be a prerequisite for entrepreneurial action. Put simply, we should have never been surprised by the presence of entrepreneurial activity, because we should not have let our empirical expectations be burdened by the category of the ‘non-entrepreneur’. From an ontological standpoint, the basic point that, for the purposes of the present article, we should keep from Gartner’s critique concerns the complete rejection of the view according to which the possibility of entrepreneurial action is conditioned by some exceptional inner quality or qualities. The following section elaborates briefly on the lines of thought and research practice that culminated during the era marked by his critique. This is crucial for evaluating the suitability of responses available, and for the development of a clearer understanding of the reasons that seem to underpin dissatisfaction with the post-Gartnerian turn on behalf of micro-oriented scholars.</p>

<sec id="section5-0266242611425838">
<title>The post-Gartnerian turn</title>
<p>Following Gartner’s appraisal, behavioural approaches dominated entrepreneurship studies: ‘entrepreneurship is a role that individuals undertake’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611425838">Gartner, 1989a</xref>: 64). Here, let me delineate two research avenues in response to this behavioural reorientation. The first pathway was concerned with the reorientation of research practice indicated by Gartner himself as a positive component complementing his critical contribution. In particular, this research orientation consisted of readjusting interest from the <italic>who</italic> to the <italic>how</italic> of entrepreneurship. This pathway was promising as it managed to move beyond the fixation on some ‘statistical average’ of ‘the entrepreneur’. While the noted research pathway appears to have emerged as a constructive extension following Gartner’s devastating critique of the ‘entrepreneur’, nonetheless there is a second research path that came to prominence: the extra-individualistic interest in (meso) macro-oriented factors conditioning the possibility of entrepreneurship. In opposition to the ‘tendency to underestimate the influence of external factors and overestimate the influence of internal or personal factors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266242611425838">Gartner, 1995</xref>: 70), explanations of entrepreneurship now draw attention to socio-temporal variables that made the role of entrepreneurship possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266242611425838">Aldrich, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0266242611425838">Scott, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0266242611425838">Thornton, 1999</xref>). For example, such factors can include the significance of asymmetric possession of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266242611425838">Hayek, 1945</xref>), the salience of network embeddedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266242611425838">Burt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266242611425838">Granovetter, 1973</xref>) or the role of prior experience and expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0266242611425838">Shane, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0266242611425838">2003</xref>).</p>
<p>From this standpoint, theoretically anyone is eligible to become an entrepreneur so long as they are exposed to the proper environmental stimuli. Entrepreneurs are simply the product of the environmental context in which they are embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266242611425838">Koppl and Minniti, 2003</xref>: 99): ‘There is no dichotomy between the entrepreneur and the non-entrepreneurs; with the right stimulus, the most unexpected people can become entrepreneurs’ (Birley, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0266242611425838">Wright, 2001</xref>: 37–38). This means that literally everyone possesses the ‘stuff’ required for entrepreneurship and thus, is expected to act, so long as the stimulus is present. The necessary conditions for the possibility of entrepreneurship are present in almost anyone, but are not sufficient in themselves. Note that while the former pathway emerged through the conscious reorientation of research practices, the latter seems to have emerged indirectly, in particular due to the shift of the ontological presuppositions effected by Gartner and the simultaneous need to render intelligible the puzzling absence of action on behalf of ‘others’. These points require elaboration.</p>
<p>Gartner’s refusal to assume a difference between X and Y encouraged the view that it is environmental contingencies that must account for the possibility of entrepreneurial action. For while research studies focusing on the process aspects of entrepreneurship have certainly been insightful and informative, they are silent or, at any rate, inadequate when explanatory insight into the puzzling absence is required. Thus, the question of <italic>why</italic> they are the only ones who engage in such behaviours (which in turn may be studied by <italic>how</italic> questions) remains unanswered.</p>
<p>Given the crude matter of fact that only some and not others act entrepreneurially, and that the search for an explanation at the individual level of analysis has been discouraged, it is perfectly understandable why researchers following Gartner’s critique so naturally came to think that the solution to the puzzling absence must lie in extra-individualistic factors. It could be said that Gartner’s attack contributed to the relaxation of the ‘under similar conditions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611425838">Gartner, 1989a</xref>: 47) dimension at the heart of the trait agenda. The absence of action on the part of people who do not act was no longer explained by the absence of the required powers, but by the absence of the appropriate environmental particularities. Logically, the distance between the ‘could have’ of others and the absence of action on their part is explained implicitly by the absence of appropriate external conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0266242611425838">5</xref></sup> While the turn to processual dimensions of ‘entrepreneuring’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0266242611425838">Steyaert, 2007</xref>) has offered an antidote to crude taxonomic tendencies of such a multifaceted phenomenon, environmental contingencies emerged as the proper antidote in response to the refutation of the ‘Who can be an entrepreneur?’ question.</p>
<p>Let me reiterate the basic points of the present section. Initially, it was stressed that the question of the entrepreneur emerged in order to explain the puzzling absence of others. Later, we saw that an important aspect of Gartner’s critique consisted of the realization that the deterministic treatment of the non-actor as a non-entrepreneur led to documenting the surprising presence of entrepreneurial activity on behalf of those people previously identified as non-entrepreneurs. Finally, Gartner’s assault on the entrepreneur/non-entrepreneur dichotomy encouraged the view that we should have never been surprised by the absence of action on behalf of others – not because they were non-entrepreneurs, but because they were simply not situated appropriately. The following section documents how revival of the old surprise regarding the absence of action reflects dissatisfaction with the potential for environmental explanations to render intelligible the absence of action on behalf of others.</p>

<title>At the critical moment: Micro/macro dualisms and beyond</title>
<p>The concern of the present section may be put as: on the one hand, we face the revival of an old surprise in the form of a recalcitrant question, but on the other, we do not want to fall back on the old answer of the ‘non-entrepreneur’ and effectively forget an old lesson. The basic motivation here is to identify the nature of the macro-oriented manoeuvre at hand in order to highlight its limitations and, in so doing, to underscore the promising credentials of the response to be developed in the subsequent section. A complementary motivation lies in exposing that the research into the person of the entrepreneur, motivated by the domination of the discovery approach, shares the very same logical underpinnings of the pre-Gartner agenda – in effect, explaining why it is making a second wave in the rhythm of the early wave undermined by Gartner. A final incentive for this section relates to the need to bring basic aspects of the discovery approach centre-stage, given that this will form the locus of attention in the final section.</p>
<sec id="section7-0266242611425838">
<title>The return of the old question: ‘Why not “others” as well?’</title>
<p>Although it seemed that the behavioural turn would conclusively silence trait-discourse, it has led to observations which have resuscitated interest unexpectedly in the person of the entrepreneur. In particular, this resurgent interest has been accompanied by the emergence of old surprises typically expressed in questions of the type: ‘if it is just contextual factors that account for entrepreneurship, why is it that only some of the people encountering identical environmental stimuli exhibit entrepreneurial behaviour?’</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0266242611425838">Shane and Venkataraman’s (2000)</xref> conceptual framework has significantly contributed to the robustness of ‘why’ questions of this type. Adjusting the focus on the individual-opportunity nexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0266242611425838">Shane, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0266242611425838">Shane and Venkataraman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0266242611425838">Venkataraman, 1997</xref>) has led to the documentation of an interesting and rather persistent observation in patterns of action on (seemingly) externally controlled circumstances. This is because placing the concept of opportunity at the core of the entrepreneurial worldview provides a conceptual standard for the control of external conditions in cases of entrepreneurial behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266242611425838">Gartner et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, we encounter resuscitation of the old ‘why’ question that, according to Gartner, motivates person-centred research.</p>
<p>More specifically, given that ‘entrepreneurship is concerned with the discovery and exploitation of profitable opportunities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0266242611425838">Stevenson and Jarillo, 1990</xref>: 25; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0266242611425838">Krueger, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0266242611425838">Shane and Venkataraman, 2000</xref>), why is it that only some, and not others, discover and exploit them (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266242611425838">Baron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0266242611425838">Mitchell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0266242611425838">Shane and Eckhard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0266242611425838">Simon, 2005</xref>)? Indeed, if it is only contextual factors that explain action, how do we explain that it is not all people who share identical environmental stimuli at a given point in time that discover or exploit entrepreneurial opportunities? Notice that the ‘why’ questions that postulate the revival of research interest in entrepreneurs are strikingly similar to the ‘why’ question that Gartner had cited as that guiding the early person-centred agenda: ‘Why’ do certain individuals start firms when others, under similar conditions, do not?’ And just like early researchers who treated non-actors as non-entrepreneurs channelled their attention to entrepreneurs after ‘some intrinsic quality or qualities in X’; we may now observe a new wave of research similarly assuming that the answer should be found in identifying the intrinsic qualities of entrepreneurs. It would seem that the question, ‘who can be an entrepreneur?’ has resurfaced with a vengeance. Of course, scholars are quick to distance themselves from earlier naive research efforts. This new-wave research appears to have learned from earlier failures and invests heavily in issues of method (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266242611425838">Baum et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, utilizing state-of-the-art research techniques is often thought to be a promising direction for unlocking entrepreneurial mystery (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0266242611425838">Nicolaou and Shane, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0266242611425838">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>The present dilemma</title>
<p>The dilemma facing us may be framed as follows. On the one hand, micro-researchers complain that external stimuli are insufficient for a complete understanding of entrepreneurial action. On the other hand, they are quick to forget an important lesson offered by Gartner concerning the sustainability of old ontological commitments, and effectively vulnerable to recur to the answer of the non-entrepreneur. No doubt, regarding research, we are certainly better equipped than a couple of decades ago. Yet, existential questions (something exists) precede those of substantive insight (What is the nature of the postulated ‘stuff’?) and, <italic>a fortiori</italic>, questions of method (the possibility of uncovering its nature thus). Should the suspicion that not everyone exploits entrepreneurial opportunities so easily allow us to fall back on ontological preoccupations governing scholarly understandings of the pre-Gartner epoch? Should we abandon so easily the ‘all can’ presumption and commit our scholarly energy and resources to a project erected on the deterministic treatment of others? After all, what if the intensification of research efforts after some necessary condition of action in entrepreneurs simply adds to a notoriously failed research record? What if digging deeper through the use of state-of-the-art research techniques leads us to the old surprise ascertained by Gartner: namely, that there does not seem to be anything unique about people who act entrepreneurially? Put more figuratively, what if this research orientation only paves the way for a future Gartner to point out that entrepreneurs come not only ‘in every shape, size, colour, and from all backgrounds’, but also in every imaginable genetic configuration?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0266242611425838">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>It should have been fairly clear by now that the present article accepts the Gartnerian lesson as a methodological victory by utilizing it as a starting point of analysis. However, even if we counter that all can do it, how are we supposed to deal with the puzzling absence of action on behalf of ones who do not do it? That is, how should the sceptic deal with micro-oriented scholars who point to the explanatory inadequacy of context? Arguably, the most obvious manoeuvre is that we place under critical scrutiny once more the ‘similarity of external conditions’ assumption. Indeed, in doing so we attack the soundness of the basic ‘why’ question at its core, because we imply that it is not that environment-level considerations are explanatorily inadequate, rather that it is concrete cases that fail to satisfy the requirement of external control.</p>
<p>The present article cautions us not to accept this response. It recommends, instead, that we accept the soundness of the leading ‘why’ question and turn directly to tackle the puzzle of the ‘non-entrepreneur’ via developing our understanding of what may be keeping them from acting accordingly. In so doing we are neither dismissive of basic research interest and background presuppositions guiding scholarly attention, nor do we fall back on the old question. The upcoming section examines more closely the potential of dealing with this puzzling absence along the abovementioned lines of thought. However, before continuing, it is worth elaborating on why the indicated pathway is more promising than the macro-response readily at hand, by bringing to scholarly attention the strategic, methodological and philosophical issues involved with the latter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0266242611425838">
<title>Limitations of the macro-oriented manoeuvre</title>
<p>Admittedly, it always may be argued that an opportunity is not present for all, since one may question the similarity of environmental conditions. It is possible, indeed, that the cases under scrutiny are not as controlled as micro-oriented researchers tend to think, but that there are extrinsic differences that have simply escaped our attention. After all, it is arguably a truism that in an open and complex world, no pair of individuals can ever be exposed to identical stimuli.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the vulnerability of the example that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242611425838">Fisher and Koch (2008)</xref> provide in order to claim that not just anyone can become an entrepreneur, because ‘entrepreneurs are born’:
<disp-quote>
<p>Two individuals (Mary and Jane) who otherwise are identical in terms of cognitive ability, income, family backgrounds, education, and the like often react quite differently to entrepreneurial opportunities. Mary may relish risk-taking opportunities and an uncertain, but tantalizingly promising future, while Jane may shrink from such situations. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242611425838">Fisher and Koch, 2008</xref>: 10)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Notably, Fisher and Koch’s spirit is akin to that of the natural scientist who observes the unfolding of events in well-controlled laboratory settings. However, it is not as persuasive as the practices of the scientist who, having controlled for all imaginable causal influences, infers that there must be intrinsic differences in the objects of study – the only pending question being the nature of that stuff that allows only Mary to do what Jane does not. Clearly, Fisher and Koch engage in a thought experiment that abstractedly isolates a multitude of causal processes that define real-world situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0266242611425838">Lawson, 2009</xref>). Needless to say, modes of argumentation of this sort are unrealistic and always open to challenges that appeal to the dissimilarity of external circumstances. Put differently, one could always argue that we intensify our search for more environment-level differences. Though atempting manoeuvre, closer consideration may allow us to appreciate why it is not as promising as it may appear, <italic>prima facie</italic>.</p>
<p>To start with, rejecting the plausibility of micro-oriented solutions due to denying the existence of opportunity is dogmatic, and more specifically a manifestation of the methodological dogma that ‘all causes must be extrinsic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266242611425838">Bhaskar, 1978</xref>: 79). When made explicit, it should be quite obvious that this dogmatic rejection of presuppositions that are not susceptible to objective settlement is neither a sign of appropriate academic conduct, nor an exemplar of adequate methodological practice. However, most saliently and upon closer consideration, it should be evident that possible rejection of the opportunity existence premise would expose the vulnerability of the post-Gartnerian request that we accept the unexercised agency premise (implicit in the all can presumption). That is, why should a micro-oriented scholar be expected to accept the unexercised agency premise rather than demand that the macro-oriented one accepts the unexplolited opportunity presumption? There is no objective basis for grounding claims of this sort. Either mode of reasoning would basically require substituting a dogma with a dogma of a different shade.</p>
<p>However, what merits underscoring most of all is that the macro-oriented response is essentially a manifestation of the very same kind of deterministic modes of thought underpinning the micro-oriented response. By paying close attention to the logical underpinnings of both explanatory modes, it should be obvious that they are both (tacitly) committed to a deductivist mode of thought of the type: if an opportunity is present, then it will be exploited. The basic difference lies in the fact that in the absence of entrepreneurial action, what is questioned within the micro-perspective is the existence of powers, whereas macro-oriented scholars are more likely to question the existence of opportunity. Nonetheless, what neither perspective questions is what appears to be the deepest root of the conundrum: namely, commitment to the rule of thumb that suggests that opportunities are inevitably exploited. Neither perspective seriously considers the possibility that the non-actor could do it, but both rely on the presumption that had it been possible, it would have been the case. It is this common denominator, in turn reflected in a (tacit) cannot, which underlies the metaphysical prejudices projected either at an individual or environmental level of analysis.</p>
<p>To pursue this point further, if the micro-response treats non-actors as blind, the macro-oriented response would be most likely to treat non-actors as though they must be in a dark room. Nonetheless, both inferences are informed by an if-then logic that encourages us to treat absences as impossibilities, by committing to a mode of thought according to which what could be, would necessarily be the case (i.e. if possible, then actual). From a philosophical standpoint, the logical skeleton beneath both theorizing perspectives is indicative of Hobbesian or Humean epistemologies: namely, theories of knowledge that collapse potentialities to actualities to jump to ‘the conclusion, that, if a man [sic] does not do an action, then either he lacks the capacity or lacks the opportunity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266242611425838">Ayers, 1968</xref>: 105). In short, if the pre-Gartnerian research agenda can be condemned from an ontological viewpoint for its deterministic treatment of the non-entrepreneur, the macro-oriented response is no less deterministic, arguably because it fails to break free from the if-then form of reasoning at the heart of the trait agenda.</p>
<p>This logical insight proves invaluable for the dialectical resolution of the underlying dualism, since it affords an objective standpoint for moving forward. This is because by resisting the reductionist tendencies driving the extremities of both explanatory avenues, we may clearly appreciate their logical compatibility by showing that it is entirely intelligible that non-actors do not do it – not because they must lack the capacity, or because they must lack the opportunity. A synthetic potential may be realized by inserting question marks with regard to the sufficiency of powers to materialize in the face of opportunity. In other words, we can question whether it is reasonable to expect that powers will be inevitably exercised when an opportunity is present.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can take the others of entrepreneurship more seriously by wondering: even if we accept that an opportunity was there, why should we suppose that had one been capable, one would have inevitably exploited it?, and, why may it not be the case that a capable person, who lacked neither the desire, resources, etc., simply did not exploit it? Having forewarned against the limitations and limited promise of the macro-oriented critique, I now turn to recommend another way of dealing with the surprising absence at the heart of the micro/macro debate. In particular, I try to explain why it is unreasonable to be surprised by an absence of uniformity in the exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities, but not because not all can do it.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section10-0266242611425838">
<title>From ‘why incapable?’ to ‘why no less capable as well?’</title>
<p>The conceptual landscape emerging from the analysis pursued in the previous section may be depicted as follows; we are at a moment at which the surprising absence of action on behalf of Y may lead us to suppose that opportunities were absent, or to regress to the pre-Gartnerian epoch by presuming that extraordinary capacities had been absent. I presently underscore a novel conceptual pathway that allows understanding to advance via a portrayal in which it is possible for action to be absent, despite the existence of both unexercised agencies and unexploited opportunities. It is a mode of rendering the puzzling absence intelligible, not by questioning the existence of powers or opportunities, but by questioning whether there are individually or conjointly sufficient conditions for entrepreneurial phenomena to obtain. The primary element of the analysis underscores the understated explanatory significance of rational reasons for inaction. The last shares some final thoughts among which lie the theoretical possibility and explanatory potential of irrational reasons for inaction.</p>
<sec id="section11-0266242611425838">
<title>Questioning the ‘ought to’ and recovering the rationality of inaction</title>
<p>We commence by highlighting that a tacit assumption underlying the cannot of entrepreneurs is that they ought to have done it. Judgements suggesting that someone cannot perform a type of activity are simply unintelligible without a presupposition of belief that they should have acted accordingly. In fact, this is precisely the reason that it makes sense to question an inference of the type: ‘these people cannot dance’ by asking ‘how do you know that they believe that they should dance?’ without having further information. In other words, even in the scenario in which we have not explicitly heard the bearer of this claim state that dancers believe that they should do so, it is simply taken for granted.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is also in virtue of understandings immanent in our social and human nature that we would naturally raise this sceptical question and resist taking at face-value the inference that the non-dancer must lack dancing abilities. In effect, we would reasonably complain that perhaps they can, yet, they do not because they do not believe that they ought to. Even if we did not question their desire, we should consider the possibility that the non-dancer may simply doubt that they ought to dance. Why? Because this form of life is arguably part of the corpus of understandings that constitutes the riverbed of social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0266242611425838">Wittgenstein, 1969</xref>). From this vantage point, the naturally emerging question regarding the category of the non-entrepreneur is; what if they do not lack some special quality, but simply choose not to exploit opportunities that they also identify because they have good reasons to believe that they should not do so? Although this article is chiefly concerned with the contemporary wave of individual-level research, it would be worthwhile to examine initially (and briefly) the way in which the category of the non-entrepreneur is treated along modes of understanding dictated by the early wave.</p>
<p>In the first wave of research, non-entrepreneurs were portrayed as agents who did not engage in entrepreneurial activities; for example, by not becoming self-employed, or by starting one’s own firm but choosing instead to remain in managerial positions (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0266242611425838">Stewart and Roth, 2007</xref>). To the extent<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0266242611425838">8</xref></sup> that relevant approaches rest on the supposition that the non-actor is somehow ontologically inferior, they rely on the tacit presupposition that activities denominated as entrepreneurial: (a) cannot but be superior to other alternatives; and/or (b) must be perceived as such from the agent’s viewpoint (comprising values, meanings, etc.). Non-actors do not do so basically because they lack what it takes in order to become an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Indeed, this theorizing mode seems to overlook the fact that, as a matter of fact, non-actors may conceive of a managerial position as a better means for achieving their goals. For example, according to their subjective understandings, they may feel that self-fulfilment is more likely to be attained or that managerial occupations offer more satisfactory financial returns in the long-run, and/or that the entrepreneurial choice is unlikely to lead to equally desirable outcomes. Moreover, choices of this sort need not unfold within the narrow scope of financial criteria (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0266242611425838">Walker and Brown, 2004</xref>), not to mention that individual interpretations of risk are unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0266242611425838">Miner and Raju, 2004</xref>: 10) or that managerial status may be conceived as a means for meeting one’s need for enhanced levels of achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0266242611425838">Stewart and Roth, 2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0266242611425838">Stewart and Roth, 2001</xref>). In fact, the very category of necessity entrepreneurs (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0266242611425838">Thompson et al., 2010</xref>) exposes the presumptuousness of the underlying voluntarisms guiding pertinent modes of reasoning. This basically implies that had potential agents had different options available, they would have simply abstained from choosing to become entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>In short, what lends rhetorical force to the ought to presumption is an unrealistic sense and/or a crude generalization of who the others of entrepreneurship are or should have been. From this standpoint, it could be said that, just as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611425838">Gartner (1989a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242611425838">2010</xref>) has admonished the tendency to generalize regarding the character of the entrepreneur, we should be no less cautious of the varieties likely to be involved in the category of the ‘non-entrepreneur’. Let us now turn to examine how an inadequate – if not unrealistic conceptualization – of the non-entrepreneur seems to be driving the renewed interest in individual-level analyses back to the extravagances of the pre-Gartner era.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0266242611425838">
<title>The ‘ought to’ in the new research wave</title>
<p>The new wave of research appears more sophisticated in that it does not uncritically adopt the crude sociological assumptions characterising earlier research waves, because discovery theorists base their expectations on Kirznerian or Schumpeterian socio-ontological insights captured typically under the concept of opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0266242611425838">Shane and Venkataraman, 2000</xref>). However, it now appears that the ought to sneaks in due to inadequacies in theorizing the uncertainty involved in the decision to exploit entrepreneurial opportunities (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0266242611425838">McMullen and Shepherd, 2006</xref>). For illustrative purposes, it will help to consider a concrete case informing the core of discovery theory.</p>
<p>Commenting on a case in which lots of people were exposed to a technological opportunity, Shane says:
<disp-quote>
<p>Although many people were exposed to information about the invention of the 3DP™ process, very few entrepreneurial opportunities to exploit the technology have been discovered. Since its invention in 1989, 3DP™ has been described in patent applications, conference presentations, publications, a website, MIT technology licensing office mailings, and industry consortium meetings. Several trade and popular publications – including <italic>Fortune</italic>, the <italic>Financial Times</italic>, and <italic>The Economist</italic> – have written stories about it. Yet only eight opportunities for the 3DP™ process have been discovered. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0266242611425838">2000</xref>: 455)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Why does Shane suppose that all but eight must have been blind to the opportunity for the 3DP™process? Even further, why should the case be that those leaving discovered opportunities unexploited somehow must be inadequate for not acting upon them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266242611425838">Fisher and Koch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0266242611425838">Shane, 2003</xref>)? What if others of sorts simply doubt that pursuing an opportunity is a rational thing to do? Strikingly ignored in this type of reasoning are sensible reasons for not doing what would have been done (could is presupposed here), had they believed otherwise. Specifically (and remarkably), what is overlooked is the possibility that interested agents may have been uncertain whether doing a particular thing would be a rational course of action. In retrospect it may have proved that this was truly an opportunity. However, this was arguably not so obvious an opportunity before its successful exploitation. At least, it need not have been seen in this way from an agent’s viewpoint. In this regard, it is worth considering Herbane, who observes:
<disp-quote>
<p>[T]he act of curtailing growth opportunities where the risk of doing so is perceived by the owner to expose the organization to greater operational uncertainty (in financial terms). In other words, there are instances in which managers may choose not to take on new business for fear of jeopardizing existing business.

<p>Herbane proceeds to quote a firm’s owner, saying: ‘[W]e’ve turned down more work than we’ve taken on which I know surprises some of our clients as well, and where I’ve bent that rule, I’ve lived to regret it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611425838">2010</xref>: 52). What if, in Shane’s case, other organizational decision makers simply chose ‘not to take on new business for fear of jeopardizing existing business’? How may they have known that this would not be the case? In addition, if anti-entrepreneurial decisions surprise some of our owner’s clients, how excusable is the surprise on behalf of entrepreneurship scholars who, after all, should be far more aware of the reality of business failure or even acquainted with numerous regretful entrepreneurs?</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is less clear whether one should exploit this technology, even if one could know the outcomes of doing so. For even <italic>post</italic>-action, evaluating whether the integration of this process improves the strategic position of an organization need not be that ‘unequivocal and readily apparent’ (Meyer, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0266242611425838">Shane, 2000</xref>: 448). At least it is always susceptible to critical scrutiny, since the complexity of organizational worlds renders the business of aetiological inference notoriously complicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266242611425838">Cyert and March, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0266242611425838">Tsoukas, 2005</xref>). The vast profit margins of a newly-founded firm may leave little space for questioning the existence of an opportunity. However, whether the integration of a new technology is truly an opportunity (in a broader sense) is not that clear-cut; not to mention the fact that there are competing logics or interests that render such cognitive endeavours intractable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0266242611425838">Seo and Creed, 2002</xref>), and at the same time add weight to the rationality of inaction thesis.</p>
<p>Notably, the aforementioned points hint that the reasonableness of inaction may be overshadowed due to the obscurity surrounding the concept of opportunity. For while, on the first occasion, it is often presupposed that opportunities are knowable prior to their successful exploitation, on the latter, there is inadequate reflection of what constitutes successful exploitation of an opportunity (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242611425838">Gartner, 2010</xref>: 14). Moreover, what needs further attention is whether an opportunity for action should suffice for its meaningful conceptualization as an opportunity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0266242611425838">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>Directions for meta-theoretical research</title>
<p>From the developed perspective, ‘others’ do not lack the capacities, but may simply doubt that they should exercise an existing entrepreneurial potential.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0266242611425838">10</xref></sup> If so, what is wrong is not the blindness of non-entrepreneurs, but the blindness of our theoretical preoccupations responsible for underpinning ‘should have done it’ type of expectations. From this vantage point, interesting research questions emerge not only of a theoretical but most crucially of a meta<italic>-</italic>theoretical nature. In particular, what we principally need to understand is not what allows only some to discover opportunities or exploit discovered opportunities, but what may be rendering us oblivious to the realization that, in such an uncertain and complex world, one need not lack unique foresight or the required qualities of character when choosing to remain inactive.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242611425838">Blackburn and Kovalainen (2009</xref>: 135) argue that it is ‘too much empirical work’ without analogous levels of research reflexivity that may be responsible for grievances about the quality of small business and entrepreneurship research, urging that we become more reflective of the ways through which ‘linguistic, social, political and institutional forces come together to generate knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242611425838">Blackburn and Kovalainen, 2009</xref>: 132). Pursuing this thread of enquiry, we may turn to reflect briefly upon the ways through which non-epistemic but ideological, metaphysical and linguistic prejudices appear to encourage us to misconceive non-actors, by imposing a rather unreasonable demand on what a normal individual should have done.</p>
<sec id="section14-0266242611425838">
<title>Ideological prejudices</title>
<p>As an example of the ways through which latent ideological drives may deteriorate the quality of entrepreneurship research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242611425838">Blackburn and Kovalainen (2009)</xref> point to the arguably excessive, if not naive (let alone inconsistent with Schumpeterian insights) view that business closure cannot but constitute an unfortunate happening (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266242611425838">Blackburn and Ram, 2006</xref>). In the case animating the present article, the underlying normative presumption seems to be that entrepreneurial action cannot but be desirable; a patently unrealistic demand, given that <italic>inter alia</italic> it stands at odds with the ways that agents may perceive entrepreneurship (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266242611425838">Herbane, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Needless to say, if excessively optimistic theories implicitly presuppose or require that non-actors share analogous levels of optimism, it is far more likely that there is something wrong with our theoretical demands rather than with non-actors. In this vein, it is reasonable to suspect that ideological presumptions of what is normal or desirable encourage a pro-action bias, thus distorting our understandings of non-actors and, effectively, jeopardizing the quality of entrepreneurship research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0266242611425838">
<title>Methodological preoccupations</title>
<p>Methodological preconceptions of what constitutes proper scientific conduct may prove insightful in the quest to uncover the sources responsible for the perseverance of unrealistic views. The insight that the reliance on inappropriate methodological tools (itself made possible by inadequate meta-theoretical reflection) hinders scholarly progress has proved highly fruitful in other domains of scholarly activity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0266242611425838">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the domain of entrepreneurship studies, this spirit is demonstrated practically by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242611425838">Gartner (2010)</xref> in his recent observation that quantitative tools of statistical inference have not only entrapped entrepreneurship scholarship in a probably vain quest for averages, but have camouflaged further the uniqueness of entrepreneurial phenomena. If reliance on statistical forms of reasoning has encouraged the ‘What do entrepreneurs look like?’ sense of the question of the entrepreneur, it would be potentially fruitful to study how inadequate meta-theoretical reflection on what constitutes scientific knowledge or explanation may have encouraged the ‘Who can be an entrepreneur?’ facet of the question, by promoting reliance upon deductivist modes of reasoning. In this regard, one should bear in mind that realist philosophers of science are well aware of the ways through which ill-conceived conceptions of scientific explanation encourage metaphysical distortions of the type ascertained in the present analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266242611425838">Hesketh and Fleetwood, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266242611425838">Lawson, 1999</xref>). Elaboration of this point would require writing a new article: let me only note that the deterministic treatments of non-actors may be nicely explained by entrepreneurship scholarship’s ‘tendency to be dominated by positivism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0266242611425838">Xheneti and Blackburn, 2011</xref>: 386; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266242611425838">Grant and Perren, 2002</xref>). A side-effect of positivist meta-theories is an imposition of conditions of prediction as a criterion of theory assessment, something that encourages (if not requires) the employment of deductive modes of reasoning which, in turn, require that we treat the world as a system comprised (solely) of event regularities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266242611425838">Lawson, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0266242611425838">2009</xref>). Such a line of research would benefit from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266242611425838">Blackburn and Kovalainen’s (2009)</xref> efforts to import pertinent philosophical insights into the domain of entrepreneurship studies.</p>

<sec id="section16-0266242611425838">
<title>Linguistic obstacles</title>
<p>Analytical philosophers of the Wittgensteinian tradition could prove invaluable to the end of enhancing levels of linguistic reflexivity. Specifically, one could ponder the linguistic practices that may conspire to convince us that opportunities are somehow discovered prior to their exploitation and, as such, cannot be rationally doubted. It seems promising in this regard that we enquire into the ways through which reifying opportunities may encourage us to downplay the truism that opportunities are susceptible to doubt, or the explanatory or analytical significance of relevant experiential states. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0266242611425838">Wittgenstein’s (1969)</xref> epistemological insights into the ways through which phenomenological aspects may be lost in physicalist discourse emerge as potentially illuminating. Moreover, it would be interesting to enquire into further sources that may be bewitching our intelligence in impelling reification of the concept of opportunity and treating opportunities as though they existed in ways comparable to the existential mode of trees or coins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0266242611425838">Wittgenstein, 1958</xref>).</p>

<title>Final thoughts</title>
<p>Finally, along a different line of thought, let me emphasize that the question of the entrepreneur is conditionally a wrong question, in the sense that it is fine to explain the absence of action at an individual level of analysis, so long as we do not explain away the non-actor as a helplessly impotent non-entrepreneur. However, what further may be made explicit from the pursued conceptual reorientation is the realization of research pathways into non-rational reasons for inaction. As such, we should refrain from dogmatically rejecting the plausibility of irrational sources of inaction by leaning towards a view that only unreasonable demands are responsible for the resurgence of the question of the entrepreneur. For just as non-dancing individuals may have good reasons for abstaining from the dance, equally they may forfeit their agentic potential, say, by being blinded by the false belief that there is not enough space in the room. To put it <italic>à la</italic> Bandura, success in dancing may not be guaranteed, yet unnecessary failure in trying to succeed is certainly guaranteed.</p>
<p>So, intensifying research along the philosophical and methodological lines stressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266242611425838">Cope (2005)</xref>, and extending forms of phenomenological enquiries into the experiential aspects involved in the decision to not act entrepreneurially would be useful. Of course, this is not to imply that one ought to have acted. It is to say that one should have not remained inactive for the wrong reasons. For example, by asking ‘intelligent questions [aiming] to understand why a particular innovation was not perceived as an opportunity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266242611425838">Krueger, 2000</xref>: 8), we may gain access to deeper beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266242611425838">Krueger, 2007</xref>) that may impose unnecessary blocks on entrepreneurial behaviour.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The pretext for this article was documenting the revival of surprise surrounding the non-actor: an observation that sustains the question of the entrepreneur rejected most famously and influentially by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611425838">Gartner’s (1989a)</xref> seminal attack. Having argued that the stimulus for a new wave of research is fairly identical to that of the former wave, I have attempted to explain why the pendulum should not swing back mechanically. However, it was also crucial to underscore why questions calling attention to the individual level of analysis should not be easily dismissed by an (unwitting) appeal to environmental determinisms. As a way forward and out of this explanatory puzzle and scholarly conundrum, it was suggested that closer attention should be paid to the others of entrepreneurship by understanding them rather than treating them as non-entrepreneurs or inappropriately situated individuals who would or should have acted, had they been appropriately positioned. In effect, this requires breaking free from tacit determinisms of different substantive expressions wedded to the metaphysical conviction that what could be the case, inevitably would be the case.</p>
<p>To this end, it was recommended that we may render experience less unanticipated by rethinking whether we have good reasons to expect that an opportunity must be exploited by a non-blind or distinctively gifted individual. In effect, we may improve our understandings of the world by tackling the core surprise through less voluntaristic explanations of absence, rather than by having to recover the old dichotomy or reject the plausibility of the unexploited opportunities supposition. Moreover, as I have noted, the way to make future experience less surprising (how is it possible for a capable person to not do so?) need not be delimited to the discovery of hitherto unidentified causal factors. It also may lie in rethinking the plausibility and adequacy of theoretical preoccupations dictating our expectations of what must normally be the case.</p>
<p>To conclude, ‘Who is an entrepreneur?’ is not unconditionally a wrong question; it is so only when it emerges alongside the semantic corpse of the ‘non-entrepreneur’. Beyond that, the leading ‘why’ question may be highly fruitful on both a theoretical and a meta-theoretical front.</p>

<p>The present understanding of entrepreneurial action aligns with the Schumpeterian conceptualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242611425838">Schumpeter, 1983[1934]</xref>), more specifically with the way that this understanding informs the discovery approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266242611425838">Baron, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0266242611425838">Shane, 2000</xref>); namely, an inter-subjectively agreed and historically contingent definition of the deeds counting as deviant socioeconomic behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0266242611425838">Zyglidopoulos et al., 2009</xref>: 66). Thus, an entrepreneur may be best conceived as the agent who does ‘things that are not generally done in the ordinary course of business routine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242611425838">Schumpeter, 1983[1934]</xref>: 7), while such things could be the opening a new restaurant in a neighbourhood where none had previously existed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0266242611425838">Shane, 2003</xref>), or the choice of ‘a new crop rotation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0266242611425838">Schumpeter, 1983[1934]</xref>: 79).</p>

<p>Although Gartner’s critique puts both types of questions under critical scrutiny, it is worth noting that rejecting one question does not necessitate rejecting the other. It is perfectly intelligible for one to accept that all can be entrepreneurs, yet resist scepticism about the existence of common behavioural traits. Analogously, one may question the ‘all can’ presumption, yet contend that the variation of (causal and/or behavioural) traits is too extensive to fit into clear-cut categories.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242611425838">Gartner (2010)</xref> recently acknowledged that it was the frantic search for commonalities among entrepreneurs that principally motivated his seminal intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266242611425838">Gartner, 1989a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266242611425838">1989b</xref>; see especially, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266242611425838">Gartner, 2010</xref>: 8–10). However, the scope of his contribution clearly touches upon the ‘Who can be an entrepreneur?’ as well. Thus, even if this was not the prime target of his assault, what matters chiefly for our present purposes is the influence that this dimension of his critique has had for the course of entrepreneurship scholarship (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0266242611425838">Smith, 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>Admittedly, it is not too often that one finds scholars explicitly defending views of this type: for example, that opportunities must be absent or that others must lack the required powers. However, what matters is not what is formally said or what may be believed in less academic moments. What is under critical scrutiny in meta-theoretical analyses of this sort are the tacit presuppositions formed in the course of development of cognitive practices of sorts, and despite the fact that often these may be at odds with our intuitions or our formal commitments (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266242611425838">Lawson, 2003b</xref>: 176; Runde in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266242611425838">Boettke et al., 2006</xref>: 322). Moreover, our ontological presumptions are in principle discernible, and most reliably ascertainable in inevitably conjectural exercises aiming at deciphering the logic governing our cognitive practices. In our case, for example, we may confidently know that non-actors are treated as helpless non-entrepreneurs, on the realization that had this not been the underlying commitment, research interest of micro-oriented scholars would have been dovetailed by a presently absent research practice. In particular, had this <italic>not</italic> been the case, the surprising absence of action would have motivated research enquiry into what is keeping the presumed powers from actualizing. At any rate, what should be kept from this parenthesis is that the meta-theoretician puts far more trust in deeds rather than words.</p>

<label>6.</label>
<p>It merits highlighting that the surprise concerns the absence on behalf of others to either discover opportunities or, once discovered, act upon them. It is for that reason that the absence of opportunity-seeing faculties is typically attributed to the absence of the required cognitive properties or intelligence, while the absence of action upon discovered opportunities is explained through the absence of the required personality traits or genetic makeup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0266242611425838">Shane, 2003</xref>).</p>

<p>Obviously, this subject cannot be adequately elaborated within the scope of the present article. Nonetheless, it should be evident that more attention is required regarding the notion of entrepreneurial action and the ways through which lack of reflection on subtle features involved in the category of human action may relate to conundrums animating entrepreneurial discourse (on the intricate philosophical issues involved in theorizations of human action, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0266242611425838">Townsend et al.
