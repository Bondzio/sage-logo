<abstract>
<p>This study provides estimates of Pakistan’s tax gap by type of tax. We adopt a bottom-up approach that provides detailed estimates of the tax gap by type of tax of the sort that are useful for tax administration. For fiscal year 2004–05, we estimate Pakistan’s federal tax gap to be about 40 percent of potential tax revenue. We estimate the tax gap for direct taxes to be about 60 percent of potential direct tax revenue and for indirect taxes about 25 percent of potential indirect tax revenue. Direct and indirect taxes account for about 30 percent and 70 percent, respectively, of actual tax collections. When potential tax revenues are used to measure Pakistan’s tax structure, the proportions are 45 percent and 55 percent, respectively. If the indirect tax system is more regressive than the direct tax system, then Pakistan’s tax system is less progressive in practice than by design.</p>

<p>A country’s tax gap is the amount of tax that goes uncollected due to noncompliance with the tax system.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1091142113475697">1</xref>
</sup> Tax noncompliance is the result of deliberate efforts to avoid paying tax and the result of mistakes due to carelessness, poor record keeping, and faulty understanding of the relevant tax law. Deliberate or not, tax noncompliance undermines the performance of a tax system by decreasing the revenue yield, economic efficiency, and interpersonal equity, both horizontal and vertical, of a tax system. Furthermore, there is a substantial body of empirical evidence showing that the level of tax noncompliance depends on a country’s tax structure (tax rates and tax bases), enforcement strategies (audit and penalty rates), and tax morale.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1091142113475697">2</xref>
</sup> For these reasons, it is important to have reliable estimates of a country’s tax gap. The challenge, particularly in developing countries where data are often sparse, is to estimate the tax gap in sufficient detail and with sufficient accuracy to provide meaningful guidance to policy makers and tax administrators interested in improving the performance of their tax system.</p>
<p>This study provides estimates of Pakistan’s tax gap by type of tax and describes the methodologies and data used to produce these estimates. As such, it makes three contributions to the existing literature on tax compliance. First, there is little solid evidence on the size of tax gaps in developing countries, particularly by type of tax. Tax professionals suspect that they are quite large, but exactly how large and for which taxes are often left to speculation. We provide detailed estimates of the tax gap by type of tax for an important developing country, namely, Pakistan. Second, the methodologies for estimating tax gaps by type of tax are scattered throughout the literature. We bring these methodologies together in one place and show how they can be used to provide detailed estimates of the tax gap, even for a country where data are sparse. Finally, we illustrate the value of careful tax gap analysis by discussing some of the policy and administrative implications of our findings.</p>
<p>We measure the tax gap in Pakistan as the difference between potential and actual tax revenue. Since actual tax revenues are readily available from government reports, the difficulty in estimating the tax gap is to obtain reasonably accurate measures of potential tax revenue by tax type.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1091142113475697">3</xref>
</sup> Our basic strategy is to use microsimulation models to estimate potential tax revenue by type of tax. As discussed in greater detail below, this bottom-up approach requires reasonably accurate measures of the relevant tax bases (i.e., income, consumption, and the value or quantity of excisable and dutiable goods) and tax calculators designed to simulate tax liabilities using these data.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1091142113475697">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>For fiscal year (FY) 2004–05, as reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1091142113475697">Table 1</xref>, we estimate Pakistan’s federal tax gap to be about Rs 397.4 billion (US$4.2 billion), or approximately 40 percent of potential tax revenue of Rs 987.5 billion (US$10.3 billion). We estimate the tax gap for direct taxes to be about Rs 262.8 billion (US$2.7 billion), or approximately 60 percent of potential direct tax revenues of Rs 445.9 billion (US$4.7 billion) and for indirect taxes about Rs 134.6 billion (US$1.4 billion), or approximately 25 percent of potential indirect tax revenues of Rs 541.6 billion (US$5.7 billion).</p>
<p>The remainder of this article is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief overview of Pakistan’s tax system. The methodologies, data, and tax gap estimates are discussed in the third section. The final section concludes with a discussion of the policy implications of this study.</p>
<sec id="section2-1091142113475697">
<title>A Brief Overview of Pakistan’s Tax System</title>
<p>Pakistan collected approximately Rs 590.4 billion (US$6.2 billion) in total, net of refunds, federal tax receipts in FY 2004–05, or about 9.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). For a country with Pakistan’s level of development, the tax to GDP ratio is rather low. Direct taxes account for about 30 percent (Rs 183.1 billion, US$1.915 billion) of federal taxes, and the remaining 70 percent comes from indirect taxes. The proportion of federal tax revenues from indirect taxes is rather high by international standards. For the reader’s convenience, we proceed below with a brief overview of the main features of Pakistan’s current federal tax system.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s direct tax system consists of a classical income tax, which subjects dividends to double taxation, and some other minor taxes on income, namely, a profits tax that is dedicated to the workers welfare fund (WWF) and the workers profit participation fund (WPPF), and a capital value tax (CVT). Approximately 94 percent of direct tax revenues in FY 2004–05, or Rs 172.5 billion (US$1.8 billion), comes from the federal income tax. The income tax on salaried individuals accounts for 2.3 percent (Rs 13.3 billion, US$0.139 billion) of net total federal tax receipts. The income tax on nonsalaried individuals accounts for 8.1 percent (Rs 47.8 billion, US$0.5 billion), and the income tax on corporations accounts for 18.9 percent (Rs 111.4 billion, US$1.2 billion) of net total federal tax receipts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1091142113475697">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The income tax system is enforced through an extensive network of “withholding” measures that include many forms of presumptive taxation. The designated withholding agents include the federal government, a company other than a small company, an association of persons (AOP), a foreign contractor or consultant, a consortium or joint venture, and an exporter or export house. We believe that Pakistan’s withholding tax regime can be usefully divided into three separate regimes. First, there is a conventional set of withholding taxes where income tax is withheld at source. There is a second set of withholding taxes that are essentially presumptive taxes, such as the treatment of compressed natural gas (CNG) and construction contracts. Finally, there is a third set of withholding taxes that are essentially excise taxes that are creditable against personal income tax (PIT) liabilities and can therefore be regarded as advanced payments. However, it is not clear that individuals keep the necessary records to claim the refunds on these withholding excise taxes, particularly those people whose primary source of income is wages and salary subject to withholding at source.</p>
<p>The indirect tax system consists of a sales tax, which is a conventional credit-invoice, destination-based, value-added tax, a conventional set of federal excise taxes (FET), and import duties. Sales tax revenues account for 40.4 percent (Rs 238.5 billion, US$2.5 billion) of net total federal tax receipts; FET account for 9 percent (Rs 53.1 billion, US$0.6 billion); and customs duties account for the remaining 19.6 percent (Rs 115.4 billion, US$1.2 billion).</p>
<p>Sales tax is imposed on all traders having a turnover above the registration threshold of Rs 5 million (US$52,300). There are a number of exempt sectors, including the government and service sectors. Agriculture, fisheries, and forestry are effectively zero rated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1091142113475697">6</xref>
</sup> A zero rate applies to exports and to a number of other sectors and activities. Currently, the standard rate of the sales tax is 15 percent. The federal excise tax base consists of forty-eight excisable goods. These can be grouped into six categories, vegetable oils, carbonated beverages, tobacco products, cement, and seventeen different types of oils and fuels, and certain luxury items (toiletries and cosmetics).</p>
<p>Finally, duties are applied to the value of imports. The tariff schedule generally provides for duty rates, ranging from 0 to 25 percent in 5 percentage point increments. There are exceptions to this general rule, such as the rates applying to imported automobiles, automobile parts, beverage alcohol, and tobacco products, which are subject to duty rates upward of 100 percent. Free trade agreements were recently concluded with China and Sri Lanka, and talks on a preferential trade regime with Malaysia are currently underway.</p>

<title>Pakistan’s Tax Gap</title>
<p>We are finally in a position to discuss our tax gap estimates and the data and methodologies used to produce them. We calculate the tax gap for the following federal taxes: income tax (on salaried individuals, on nonsalaried individuals, and on corporations), sales tax, FET, and import duties. As previously noted, we do not estimate the tax gap for some minor taxes, namely, the taxes dedicated to the WWF and WPPF, and the CVT, nor do we estimate the tax gap for provincial taxes. Since the WWF, WPPF, and CVT account for only 1.8 percent of federal tax receipts in FY 2004–05, we effectively cover 98 percent of federal tax revenue. We choose to use FY 2004–05 federal tax receipts as our benchmark for this exercise because of the availability of microeconomic data for that year.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1091142113475697">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We proceed in the following by describing the methodologies used to estimate the tax gap for each federal tax. We begin with the individual income tax.</p>
<sec id="section4-1091142113475697">
<title>Direct Tax Gap</title>
<p>As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1091142113475697">table 1</xref>, we estimate the direct tax gap to be Rs 262.8 billion (US$2.7 billion), with a voluntary compliance rate (VCR) of 41.1 percent of potential direct tax revenues of Rs 445.9 billion (US$4.7 billion). We estimate the tax gap for the income tax on salaried individuals to be about Rs 13 billion (US$0.136 billion), with a VCR of 50.6 percent of potential tax revenues of Rs 26.3 billion (US$0.3 billion), and, for the income tax on nonsalaried individuals, we estimate the tax gap to be approximately Rs 7.3 billion (US$0.076 billion), with a VCR of 86.8 percent of potential tax revenues of Rs 55.1 billion (US$0.6 billion). Finally, we estimate the corporate income tax (CIT) gap to be approximately Rs 242.5 billion (US$2.6 billion), with a VCR of 31.5 percent of potential corporate tax revenues of Rs 353.9 (US$3.702 billion). We proceed next by describing the methodologies used to make these estimates.</p>

<title>Income tax on salaried individuals</title>
<p>To estimate the revenue potential of the individual income tax under current law, we need an objective measure of the tax base, or at least a measure that is not subject to intentional reporting errors for tax purposes. It is important to have individual-level data in order to account for the tax threshold and graduated rate structure. Pakistan’s Federal Bureau of Statistics periodically conducts two household surveys that are useful for this purpose, namely the Household Integrated Expenditure Survey (HIES) and the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The sample size of the HIES is 14,776 households. The sample is drawn from 1,045 primary sampling units of which 486 are urban and 449 are rural. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1091142113475697">FBS (2006)</xref>, the sample size is considered sufficient to produce estimates of key variables, including household income by source, at the national level with a 5 percent to 7 percent margin of error.</p>
<p>In the HIES, we have individual reports of income by type in the “E” data file. Individuals report their type of work (paid, self-employed, agriculture, nonpaid) and their earnings for the previous month. They also report how many months they worked in the previous year. We estimate annual wage income by taking the product of these two amounts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1091142113475697">8</xref>
</sup> Using the individual-level estimates of taxable wage income for each observation in the sample, a tax calculator is used to estimate income tax liabilities based on FY 2004–05 tax law for each observation (with positive taxable income) in the sample.</p>
<p>The Income Tax Ordinance 2001 includes an extensive list of exemptions and tax concessions that take up seventy pages of the <italic>Income Tax Manual</italic>. The largest exemptions include capital gains income, pension payments, fringe benefits and emoluments, and income from agriculture. Our data permit us to account for all major tax exemptions and tax credits, including those listed earlier. However, there are some relatively minor exemptions, concessionary tax rates, and tax credits that our data do not allow us to account for in our simulations. Rather than making arbitrary adjustments for these special treatments, we ignore them in the simulations.</p>
<p>Once the calculation is made, we aggregate over households and apply the household weights to obtain an estimate of the population tax liability on wages. The result is reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1091142113475697">table 2</xref> as model 1, Rs 39.6 billion (US$0.4 billion), with a VCR of approximately 39.6 percent of potential income tax from salaried individuals. There are other data in the HIES that are useful for this analysis, too. The HIES household income file (section H file and section N file) contains summary information on total household income by source. These data are the basis for the statistics reported in official government publications.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1091142113475697">9</xref>
</sup> Using household data, we are not able to be as accurate in estimating income tax liabilities because of the impact of the tax threshold. Our estimate of income tax liability using the household income data is Rs 36.6 billion (US$0.4 billion), which is labeled model 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1091142113475697">table 2</xref>. Using this estimate of potential tax revenues from salaried individuals, the resulting tax gap estimate is Rs 23.3 billion (US$0.2 billion), with a VCR of 57.1 percent. Using the LFS, we estimate potential income tax from salaried individuals to be Rs 27.4 billion (US$0.3 billion).</p>

<p>Utilizing the LFS estimate of potential income tax revenue from salaried individuals and subtracting the estimated cost of charitable contributions, the estimated potential income tax revenue for wage and salary income is Rs 26.3 billion (US$0.3 billion), which is labeled model 6 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1091142113475697">table 2</xref>. This estimate of potential income tax revenue results in a tax gap of Rs 13 billion (US$0.136 billion), with a VCR of 50.6 percent of potential income tax revenue from salaried individuals. This is our preferred estimate of noncompliance with the individual income tax on salaried individuals for FY 2004–05.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1091142113475697">10</xref>
</sup> By any reasonable standard, this is a very large tax gap, and undoubtedly reflects, at least in part, the fact that small corporations are not required to withhold tax on the wages and salaries of their employees.<sup>

<title>Income tax on nonsalaried individuals</title>
<p>The income tax on nonsalaried individuals includes the self-employed, small businesses (unincorporated), rental income, and other sources, including the withholding tax on interest and dividends as well as other items. In FY 2004–05, the total revenue from these sources was Rs 47.8 billion (US$0.5 billion). Using data from the HIES, it is possible to estimate the potential income tax from some of these sources, using a method similar to that for the wage portion of the individual income tax.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1091142113475697">12</xref>
</sup> In some respects, the disaggregation of tax for this component is cleaner than that for wages because, for many households, only one member reports these forms of income. In addition, receipts for some of these income items (dividends and interest) come largely from bank withholding.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1091142113475697">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The largest portion of this item is for AOP, other self-employed persons, and noncorporate businesses. In the HIES, these individuals are classified as self-employed or employers. Applying a tax calculator to these data, we estimate potential self-employment income tax of Rs 41.2 billion (US$0.43 billion). The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) reports actual income tax revenue for this group of Rs 38.2 billion (US$0.4 billion). This implies a tax gap of Rs 3.0 billion (US$0.03 billion), or 7.85 percent of actual income tax revenues from this group. Given the reported sampling error for the HIES of 5 percent to 7 percent, this estimate is statistically indistinguishable from zero at conventional levels. Since we lack information on other sources of self-employment income in the HIES, we assume the same rate of noncompliance (7.85 percent of actual tax revenues from self-employment income). Applying this rate to actual income tax revenues from nonsalaried individuals of Rs 47.8 billion (US$0.5 billion), we estimate potential revenues of Rs 55.1 billion (US$0.6 billion), and the resulting tax gap estimate is Rs 7.3 billion (US$0.08 billion), with a VCR of 86.8 percent of potential tax revenues.</p>
<p>This analysis suggests an astonishingly small amount of noncompliance among the self-employed. The self-employed are notoriously difficult to tax, particularly in developing countries, like Pakistan, with large informal sectors. There are several possible explanations for this surprising result. It may be the case that the self-employed are not accurately reporting their employment status or their earnings in the HIES. The Pakistan Economic Census 2005 reports 3.2 million enterprises in the small and medium enterprise sector which is rather large. Thus, there is evidence that there is money out there, although some of this activity is from firms assuming the corporate form. Using the HIES, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1091142113475697">Wahid and Wallace (2009</xref>) estimate that there are 4.6 million households reporting self-employment income greater than Rs 40,000 (US$418). Using the LFS, they also report 7.8 million individuals identified as self-employed, but this survey does not report earnings from self-employment and therefore cannot be used to provide an alternative estimate of the tax gap for the income tax on nonsalaried individuals.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation for this surprising result is Pakistan’s extensive system of withholding, presumptive taxation, and taxation at source. We estimate that 60.8 percent of actual income tax revenues from nonsalaried individuals are the direct result of the withholding tax regime.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1091142113475697">14</xref>
</sup> The withholding tax regime is a significant revenue spinner; approximately 64.6 percent of actual income tax receipts is due to the withholding tax regime. Furthermore, the withholding taxes on telephone bills, electricity bills, and bank withdrawals undoubtedly collect significant revenue from the self-employed and employees, alike. Therefore, attributing all of the revenue from these collection heads exclusively to nonsalaried individuals may be leading us to significantly understate the tax gap for the self-employed and overstate the tax gap for salaried individuals.</p>

<title>Income tax on corporations</title>
<p>We use a detailed I-O model of Pakistan’s economy for FY 2004–05 to estimate the potential revenue from the CIT.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1091142113475697">15</xref>
</sup> Not only does the model provide information on total use or gross sales for each of the eighty-one sectors of the I-O model, but it also provides crucial information on business expenses that are deductible from corporate taxable income, specifically the costs of inputs, compensation of employees, and indirect taxes. We adjust the figures reported in the I-O table for fixed capital consumption. We use data on gross capital purchases by economic sector over the past ten years and apply tax depreciation rules to simulate capital allowances by economic sector for tax purposes.</p>
<p>Based on these simulations, we estimate the tax depreciation allowances to be approximately 2.5 times the estimated capital allowances in the national accounts. This reflects the sharp decline in fixed capital formation in particular economic sectors over this period as well as the accelerated depreciation allowances provided in the tax code. The resulting estimate of depreciation allowances is likely to be on the high side. Since depreciation allowances are subtracted from taxable income, overstating depreciation allowances results in a conservative estimate of corporate taxable income and thus a conservative estimate of the potential revenue from the CIT.</p>
<p>Some of the eighty-one sectors in the model are not subject to the CIT because either the sector is exempt, such as electricity, or the sector is dominated by enterprises that do not take the corporate form and are therefore not subject to the CIT. Examples of such sectors include handicrafts, textiles, and light manufacturing. To err on the side of caution, we exclude estimated profits from these sectors. We also exclude profit from the government sectors, namely the central monetary authority, public administration and defense, and education and health care. We should point out that income from agriculture is exempt from the federal income tax, so the profits of this sector also are excluded. After eliminating these sectors, we are left with twenty-four sectors that are subject to the CIT.</p>
<p>Although we estimate the tax gap using disaggregated data, for the reader’s convenience, we aggregate these data into eight major economic sectors, specifically mining, chemicals, cement, metal products, equipment manufacturers, construction, transportation and communications, and financial services. We report our estimates of gross receipts, the major deductions (e.g., cost of inputs, compensation of employees, indirect taxes, and depreciation allowances) for each of these eight economic sectors in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1091142113475697">table 3</xref>. We assume that all activity is subject to the large corporation rate of 35 percent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1091142113475697">16</xref>
</sup> Finally, we apply the 6 percent presumptive tax rate to our estimate of gross receipts from the construction sector. Based on these assumptions, we estimate potential CIT revenues to be about Rs 353.9 billion (US$3.7 billion), compared to actual CIT revenues of Rs 111.4 billion (US$1.2 billion). The resulting estimate of the tax gap is Rs 242.5 billion (US$2.5 billion), with a VCR of 31.5 percent of potential CIT revenues in FY 2004–05. Interestingly, we estimate the tax gap for the construction sector to be approximately Rs 1.9 billion (US$0.02 billion) or only 5.5 percent of actual withholding tax on construction contracts of Rs 34.7 billion (US$0.4 billion).</p>

<p>We believe that our estimate of the corporate tax gap is a conservative one because we eliminate sectors that may include some corporatized firms, such as the textile sector, and the estimate of depreciation allowances appears to be rather high as a percentage of gross receipts. Although a VCR of 31.5 percent is very low, we believe this finding is justified by the data. There are also other signs of low compliance with the CIT. For example, only 3,000 firms in a country of 190 million pay CIT. Clearly, the number of nonfilers in the corporate sector is very large. In addition, CIT returns are rife with form use and math errors.</p>

As previously noted, Pakistan’s registration threshold is very small (Rs 5 million or US$52,300); consequently, the value of sales by firms below the registration threshold is likely to be small, as well. Nevertheless, we adjust the VAT tax base for the percentage of sales by firms below the threshold in order to provide conservative estimates of the sales tax gap.</p>
<p>To estimate the sales tax base, we make a number of adjustments to the figures in the I-O table.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1091142113475697">17</xref>
</sup> Pakistan’s sales tax is a credit-invoice, destination-based, consumption-type VAT; however, the tax base of Pakistan’s sales tax is essentially that of a manufacturing excise tax. Consequently, a number of sectors that would ordinarily be fully taxable are either exempt or zero rated. More specifically, the government and service sectors are exempt from the sales tax, including education, health care, financial services, real estate, and sales of land and new residential and commercial construction. To account for these features of Pakistan’s sales tax, we reduce the VAT base by the sum of the value added by the exempt sectors. Since Pakistan’s sales tax is destination based, we subtract the value of net exports from the VAT base. For a consumption-type VAT, purchases of capital goods are not taxable and are removed from the VAT base. However, the value of capital goods purchased by exempt sectors is added to the base, as tax credits would not be available to these sectors. Finally, we account for the fact that agriculture, textiles, and certain utilities are zero rated.</p>
<p>We do not account for the tax cascading that would result when an exempt firm sells its output to a taxable sector. To do so would require extensive knowledge of firm supply chains by sector, acquiring such information was beyond the scope of this study. However, it is not clear ex ante whether this results in significant measurement errors to our estimates. Since unregistered firms cannot claim credits for taxes paid on inputs, they have an incentive to purchase inputs from other unregistered firms. Such behavior would tend to minimize the influence of tax cascading when exempt firms sell inputs to taxable firms. Clearly, this is an important issue for the measurement of value-added tax gaps as well as the efficiency and equity of a VAT; therefore, it certainly merits future study.</p>
<p>The most recent I-O table of Pakistan’s economy is for 1989–90.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1091142113475697">18</xref>
</sup> We update this table to reflect the level of economic activity by sector to values for 2004–05 from the national accounts, using the input-use coefficients from the 1989 to 1990 I-O table. Undoubtedly, the accuracy of our sales tax gap estimates suffers because the I-O table does not fully capture the current structure of Pakistan’s economy.<sup>

<p>From the HIES, we obtain estimates of the value of total consumption for four of the ten broad categories of excisable goods, specifically aerated water and beverages, tobacco products, edible oils, and cosmetics and perfumes. Since the values of consumption reported in the HIES reflect final retail sales, and the FET is collected at the manufacturing stage, we take 80 percent of the HIES values to account for markups by wholesalers and retailers. The value of these commodities, adjusted for the retail and wholesale markups, account for approximately 52 percent of total FET revenues in FY 2004–05. We multiply the adjusted HIES reported value of consumption by the statutory excise tax rate to estimate potential revenues. We apply the household weight to the sum of the sample values to obtain estimates of the corresponding population values.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1091142113475697">20</xref>
</sup> Finally, we compare actual revenues to our estimate of potential revenues for FY 2004–05 to estimate the tax gap for the excisable commodities for which we have information. For those commodities for which there is no HIES category, we assume that the tax gap on these goods is equal to the average tax gap for the excisable goods for which we have data.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1091142113475697">Table 5</xref> summarizes the estimated potential tax revenue, actual tax revenue, and tax gap by commodity. Based on the four items that we are able to analyze based on available data, the FET tax gap is approximately Rs 19.2 billion (US$0.2 billion), with a VCR of 59.1 percent of potential FET revenues of Rs 46.9 billion (US$0.5 billion). We assume an average tax gap of 69 percent of actual tax revenues. Based on this assumption, we obtain a total federal excise tax gap of Rs 36.7 billion (US$0.4 billion), with a VCR of 59.1 percent of potential FET revenue of Rs 89.8 billion (US$0.9 billion).</p>
<p>If this estimate of potential FET revenues strikes some as unrealistically large, we would observe that, according to the FBR’s data, all the FET revenue from edible oils comes from imports. In other words, to take just one potentially egregious example, the FBR does not report any excise tax collections from domestic sales of edible oils. To be fair, there are valid arguments on both sides of the issue, as to whether our methodology under- or overstates the “true” FET tax gap. On the one hand, many excisable goods are used exclusively for intermediate use. If producers of such goods are more likely to be monitored by the FBR, such firms may be more tax compliant than producers of the four excisable commodities for which we have data. On the other hand, producers have a lot to gain by not paying their full excise tax liabilities because doing so increases their costs that may threaten their competiveness in the marketplace, particularly if their competitors are not paying their full excise tax liabilities.</p>

<title>Import duties</title>
<p>We estimate the tax gap for import duties, using detailed information on trade between Pakistan and her leading trade partners, specifically China, Germany, India, Japan, Malaysia, and the United States. These six countries collectively account for approximately 50 percent of Pakistan’s imports by value in FY 2004–05. To estimate potential dutiable value of imports, we use the reported values of exports from the six countries in our sample that are reported to be destined for Pakistan. Clearly, firms have an incentive to underreport the dutiable value of imports to avoid paying duties. However, firms do not face the same incentives to misreport exports. Therefore, we treat the export values destined for Pakistan as the “true” dutiable value. However, in some cases, exporters may be subject to incentives to misreport exports that may influence our tax gap estimates, as discussed in greater detail in the following.</p>
<p>We use detailed information on the reported value of imports for the destination country (Pakistan) and exports for the six origination countries in our sample, at the six-digit commodity level. We obtain these data from the United Nations Comtrade database. Using eight-digit commodity-level data on imports from each country, which was provided by the FBR, we calculate effective duty rates at the six-digit commodity level for each country. We estimate potential and actual tax revenues by multiplying export values as reported by the origination country and import values as reported by the destination country in our sample by the corresponding effective duty rates.</p>
<p>We report our main findings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1091142113475697">table 6</xref>. It is evident from examining the data in this table that we have a wide variety of conflicting results. For example, the estimated import duty gap for China is Rs 12.0 billion (US$0.1 billion), with a VCR of 54.7 percent of potential import duties of Rs 26.6 billion (US$0.3 billion). In contrast, the estimated tax gap for the United States is Rs −0.5 billion (US$0.005 billion), meaning that, for the United States, our estimate of potential import duties is less than the estimate of actual import duties. In addition to the United States, we estimate “negative” tax gaps for India, Japan, and Malaysia. We tried a number of strategies to solve this puzzle. For example, we tried lagging the export data to account for the time that it takes for goods to be transported from the country of origin to Pakistan, but this does not resolve the problem.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1091142113475697">21</xref>
</sup> These puzzling results may reflect simple reporting errors in the data. It is noteworthy that the four countries with <italic>negative</italic> tax gaps report relatively small gaps in percentage terms.</p>

<p>Without a convincing explanation for the negative import duty gaps observed in our sample, it is not clear how to proceed. It is tempting to simply discard the countries with negative tax gaps and base our estimate of the tax gap for import duties exclusively on the two countries in our sample with positive duty gaps. In our sample, China and Germany are the two countries with positive tax gaps, with VCRs equal to about 54.7 percent and 87.9 percent of potential import duties, respectively. However, this approach risks overstating the tax gap for import duties, assuming the negative tax gaps result from errors in the data, and there are similar errors but of the opposite sign in the case of those countries with positive tax gaps. We choose to err on the side of caution and avoid the expedient of simply discarding country data with negative tax gaps. Instead, we take two approaches to estimating the tax gap for import duties. First, we aggregate the negative and positive gaps for the six countries in our sample. Using this method we get an estimated tax gap for import duties equal to about Rs 8.4 billion (US$0.088 billion) for our sample of countries, with a VCR of 87.2 percent of potential import duties of Rs 65.7 billion (US$0.7 billion) for our sample of countries. If we weight the VCRs by country using trade weighted values, then we get a VCR for import duties of 82.6 percent of potential import duties of Rs 139.7 billion (US$1.5 billion), as reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1091142113475697">table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>To estimate the size of Pakistan’s underground economy and tax gap, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1091142113475697">Ahmed and Ginsburgh (1995</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1091142113475697">Aslam (1998</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1091142113475697">Iqbal, Qureshi, and Mahmood (1998</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1091142113475697">Kemal (2007</xref>); and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1091142113475697">Yasmin and Rauf (2003</xref>) use top-down approaches. Although they use similar approaches, they examine different periods and employ a variety of econometric specifications, resulting in a wide range of estimates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1091142113475697">Kemal (2007</xref>) estimates Pakistan’s tax gap to be in the range of Rs 302 to Rs 347 billion for FY 2004–05. This is comparable to our bottom-up estimate of Rs 397.4 billion for FY 2004–05.</p>
<p>This analysis provides a number of important insights into the performance of Pakistan’s tax system. For example, tax noncompliance makes a substantial difference in Pakistan’s tax structure. As previously noted, direct and indirect taxes account for about 30 percent and 70 percent, respectively, of actual federal tax collections. When potential tax revenues are used to measure Pakistan’s tax structure, the proportions are 45 percent and 55 percent, respectively. Assuming indirect taxes are more regressive than direct taxes, the tax system is less progressive in practice than by design.</p>
<p>Our analysis suggests that reforms in tax policy could increase the performance of the tax system. For example, the fact that small corporations are not required to withhold income tax on employees, leading to significant revenue leakage, is a tax policy issue. In addition, including services in the sales tax base would likely increase the efficiency, equity, and revenue yield of the sales tax by strengthening the withholding system of the VAT. Finally, Pakistan’s income tax withholding regime is masking serious weaknesses in the enforcement of the CIT. From examining corporate returns, it is clear that there are substantial problems with nonfilers and the returns are rife with form use and math errors, making CIT returns nearly useless for enforcement purposes. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s tax administration—the FBR—has suspended all tax audits in response to widespread complaints about corruption among tax officials.</p>

<p>It is important to distinguish between tax avoidance which refers to the use of the tax law to minimize tax liabilities, and noncompliance with the tax law that refers to the nonpayment of lawful tax liabilities. Tax avoidance is legal; noncompliance with the tax law or tax evasion is not. A country’s tax gap is the result of noncompliance with the tax law, not from tax avoidance.</p>

<p>We cover all of the federal taxes, with the exception of the workers welfare fund (WWF), workers profit participation fund (WPPF), and the capital value tax (CVT). Since these taxes represent only about 1.8 percent of net total federal tax receipts, we do not think that neglecting to estimate the tax gaps for these minor taxes is likely to result in serious errors. We also limit our analysis to Pakistan’s federal taxes; consequently, we do not estimate tax gaps for provincial taxes.</p>

<p>The survey also asks how much was earned in the previous year. However, the response rate on that variable is quite low so we do not use that variable in the simulation analysis.

<p>Although we put considerable effort into rebenchmarking the 1989–90 I-O model to hit targets in 2004–05 national income accounts, our efforts do not capture all the structural changes to the economy that have undoubtedly occurred over the intervening years. The model would also benefit from a careful effort to estimate the proportions of sales in a sector subject to the 15 percent sales tax rate and the proportion of sales in a sector that are above the registration threshold. Finally, with more time, it should be possible to use the I-O model to estimate potential sales tax from imports and refunds on exports. In any event, the methodology described here has considerable potential as a tool for identifying noncompliant sectors and allocating enforcement resources to the sectors that are likely to have the highest revenue yield.</p>

<p>The HIES expenditure data do not tally to total consumption or GDP as reported in the national income accounts. As explained in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1091142113475697">Wahid and Wallace (2009</xref>), a reweighting adjustment is made to the HIES expenditures, so that they are in line with the national income accounts.</p>

<p>A possible explanation for this puzzling finding is changes in exchange rates over time and across countries. However, international trade is generally conducted in US dollars, and the data in the U.N. Comtrade database are in US dollars. So, this explanation is not entirely convincing.</p>
