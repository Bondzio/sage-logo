<title>Every third child incorrectly restrained in cars</title>
<p>Car accidents are the main cause of serious injury and death among children in Norway. A new study from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health shows that 37% of all children under 16 years are incorrectly restrained in the car and 23% of children are so poorly restrained that a collision would have very serious consequences. The study results were presented at a seminar on traffic accidents in Oslo on 8 October 2012.</p>

<title>Mobile phones and wireless networks: no evidence of health risk found</title>
<p>There is no scientific evidence that low-level electromagnetic field exposure from mobile phones and other transmitting devices causes adverse health effects, according to a report presented by a Norwegian Expert Committee. In addition, the Committee provides advice to authorities about risk management and regulatory practice.</p>

<title>The National Institute for Health and Welfare in Finland (THL)</title>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) is a research and development institute under the Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.</p>
<p>The institute works to promote the well-being and health of the population, to prevent diseases and social problems, and to develop social and health services. It is the statutory statistical authority in health and welfare and maintains a strong knowledge base within its own field of operations. THL is also responsible for the application of this knowledge.</p>
<p>The institute has a wide range of tools to carry out its responsibilities: research, follow-up and evaluation, development, expert influence, official tasks and international cooperation. It serves the scientific community, actors in the field, and decision makers in central government and municipalities, as well as serving the broader society.</p>
<p>The institute started operating on 1 January 2009, after the merger of the National Public Health Institute (KTL) and the National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health (STAKES).</p>
<p>The institute’s functions are:</p>

<list-item><p>To prevent diseases and social problems</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To develop social and health services</p></list-item></list>
<p>The institute’s headquarters are located in Helsinki. It also has satellite offices in Jyväskylä, Kuopio, Oulu, Tampere, Turku and Vaasa. THL has a total staff of about 1,300 and is subject to the performance guidance of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.</p>

<title>New software to help detect genetic diseases in large families</title>
<p>A recent thesis introduces new software that enables analyses combining family-based and population-based data. This family-based gene mapping method was developed in the doctoral study of a THL researcher, Tero Hiekkalinna.</p>
<p>The new gene mapping software enables joint analyses of population-based and family-based samples, such as cases, controls, nuclear families, and large multigenerational families.</p>
<p>The study also compares the statistical properties of the new gene mapping software with other commonly used family-based association methods by using real-life migraine and schizophrenia pedigree structures from Finland.</p>

<title>Pekka Puska has been elected President of IANPHI</title>
<p>Professor Pekka Puska, Director General of THL, has been elected President of the International Association of National Public Health Institutes (IANPHI) for a 3-year term.</p>
<p>A key task of IANPHI is to promote information exchange and co-operation between national public health institutes. In recent years, the association has supported developing countries in developing or establishing their own public health institutes as well as in designing their own public health systems. For this work IANPHI has received a substantial grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>
<p>IANPHI’s 80 members represent national public health institutes or similar government health agencies from over 70 countries worldwide. The biggest member institutes, Centres for Disease Control (CDC) in the USA, Fiocruz in Brazil, and CDC in China, employ more than 10,000 people each. Puska’s predecessor was Professor Jeff Koplan, former US CDC director. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ianphi.org">www.ianphi.org</ext-link></p>
