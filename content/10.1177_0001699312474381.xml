<abstract>
<p>Both educational attainment and fields of study have been found to influence individuals’ socio-economic position, but their joint socio-economic impact has received considerably less research attention to date. Focusing on Finland, the article attempts to address this gap. Using large-scale and mainly register-based cross-sectional data, the logged annual earnings of young Finnish adults are estimated by means of median regression models for the years 1985, 1995 and 2005. Results show that whether or not educational level raises individuals’ socio-economic position crucially depends on the fields of study involved. Educational attainment increases earnings mainly within the same field of study, but not necessarily when comparing the impact of qualifications across different areas of specialization. Furthermore, trends over time in the economic value of educational qualifications are heterogeneous, with stability, decline and growth simultaneously affecting different fields of study within a given educational level. Gender differences in the returns to vocational education tentatively indicate that, at lower educational levels, female-dominated fields of study might be more beneficial for women’s earnings than stereotypically male fields, yet this result does not appear robust over alternative measures of socio-economic status. On the whole, it is suggested that theories of social closure and status competition may be more suited to account for the relationship between education and earnings stratification in Finland than arguments based on personal characteristics such as individuals' productivity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As one of sociology’s best-established research findings, the statement that education exerts a major influence on individuals’ life-chances in industrialized countries has today reached the rank of a truism. Despite the great divergence in their theoretical underpinnings and their views on education’s role in the social stratification process, human capital theorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0001699312474381">Becker, 1993</xref>), credentialists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0001699312474381">Collins, 1979</xref>), neo-Marxists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0001699312474381">Bowles and Gintis, 1976</xref>), and more recent studies in the sociology of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0001699312474381">Shavit and Müller, 1998</xref>) all tend to agree that higher levels of education correlate with higher socio-economic standing – their points of contention mainly lie with the mechanisms that produce this outcome. In recent years, however, indications are getting stronger that limiting the view to degree levels or years of schooling might oversimplify the role of education in social stratification processes. Institutional features of educational systems, among them the differentiation between vocational and academic secondary (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0001699312474381">Shavit and Müller, 2000</xref>), as well as polytechnic and university higher education (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0001699312474381">Prix, 2009</xref>), can significantly modify the socio-economic impact of educational attainment levels. Among university graduates, differential returns to fields of study (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0001699312474381">Kelly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0001699312474381">Rumberger and Thomas, 1993</xref>) are part of the reason why gender segregation in education can have serious socio-economic repercussions for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0001699312474381">Reimer and Steinmetz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0001699312474381">Roksa, 2005</xref>), despite a closing gender gap in educational investments. Overall, most studies showing greater concern for the institutional features of the school-to-work transition have had to focus their attention on a single educational subgroup only.</p>
<p>Yet, if these findings suggest that the same level of educational attainment can produce quite heterogeneous effects on individuals’ social position, can we continue to assume that increased levels of education are unconditionally beneficial in the social stratification process? Are the variations observed between fields of study large enough to relativize the role of educational attainment levels for socio-economic outcomes?</p>
<p>These are the questions the present article sets out to examine, focusing attention on the stratification outcomes of young adults in Finland between 1985 and 2005. Embedding this research problem into a comparison over time adds historical context to the results, which is particularly relevant given the educational and economic extremes Finland experienced during these two decades: while the country plunged from relatively low unemployment in 1985 into an exceptionally deep and severe recession during the 1990s and recovered in the early 2000s, the share of Finns enrolled in higher education has grown continuously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0001699312474381">Prix, 2012</xref>: 640). A comparison over time will thus help determine whether these changing historical conditions are likely to have shaped the role of education for social stratification in Finland.</p>
<p>The basic strategy applied in this article consists of contrasting the patterns and trends observed in two types of median regression models: one containing educational attainment levels as the only dimension of education used for estimating socio-economic status, while a second model differentiates secondary and tertiary levels of education by eight broad fields of study. By investigating the extent to which conclusions drawn from these two perspectives confirm or contradict each other, this comparison gauges the merit of adding a horizontal dimension of education (i.e. fields of study) to the analysis. Furthermore, gender differences and time trends in the patterns of field-specific educational returns are explored. Consequently, there are three research questions which structure this inquiry: Does the field-specific view confirm the finding that those with more education reap greater socio-economic rewards? Are trends in the overall returns to education consistent with developments in each field of study? Do field-specific differences in the socio-economic effect of education follow the same pattern among men and women?</p>

<title>Rewards for educational attainment: Equal for all fields?</title>
<p>
<italic> </italic>While the socio-economic relevance of educational fields is frequently noted, little research exists that directly compares educational levels and fields of study concerning their role in social stratification processes (for an exception, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0001699312474381">Van de Werfhorst, 2004</xref>). If the effect of educational attainment on social stratification operates mainly via the transmission of abstract, productivity-enhancing skills, as assumed by human capital theorists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0001699312474381">Becker, 1993</xref>), it is possible to imagine that fields of study exert a comparatively minor influence on individuals’ economic resources. Although previous research has found certain fields yielding greater economic rewards than others at the tertiary level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0001699312474381">Kelly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0001699312474381">Rumberger and Thomas, 1993</xref>), their effect on social stratification might still be most like other fields of the same level as opposed to qualifications ranked differently within the educational system. Despite some diversity, then, educational fields would still reproduce the overall impact on socio-economic status observed for their level of education (expectation 1a).</p>
<p>But if this abstract notion of enhanced productive capabilities is not the main mechanism connecting educational with socio-economic attainment, an alternative pattern might be expected to emerge in the analysis. Approaches that frame the discourse on the socio-economic role of education as a matter of group-level processes and political-economic structures rather than individual characteristics could provide some backing for this view. Net of workers’ educational attainment, it has been shown that wage levels vary by industry in Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0001699312474381">Vainiomäki and Laaksonen, 1995</xref>). Economic sociologists have argued that the organizational, market and technical differences between industries may play a role in producing such inter-industry differences, given that these factors directly influence the bargaining power of workers and therefore also wages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0001699312474381">Hodson and England, 1986</xref>). But in addition to unionization occupational groups apply social closure strategies such as licensing and credentialing to keep labour supply in check, thereby aiming to ‘shape the contours of the hierarchy of occupational rewards’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0001699312474381">Weeden, 2002</xref>: 57). Rather than enhancing or even signalling an individual worker’s productivity, educational qualifications in this view serve as a tool in the status competition between occupational groups within a particular economic segment. As a consequence, the shape of socio-economic hierarchies in different segments of the economy is likely to vary. Comparing the effect of educational attainment across industries and economic sectors might therefore produce instances where the earnings of lower-level educational attainment groups systematically exceed or equal those of highly educated workers in other occupational fields.</p>
<p>This latter scenario may be particularly relevant for the present analyses using Finnish data. It could be argued that the educational and occupational systems in Finland make up what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0001699312474381">Shavit and Müller (1998</xref>) call a ‘qualification space’. Drawing on the work of French sociologists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0001699312474381">Maurice et al. (1986</xref>), this term describes countries where occupationally relevant skills tend to be acquired through the nationally standardized education system as opposed to firm-specific, informal on-the-job training. Owing to these relatively close links between educational credentials and the labour market in Finland, it could be assumed that socio-economic differences between fields of study also reflect the economic heterogeneity of occupational groups associated with these educational fields. As a result, it is thinkable that the effect of educational attainment in Finland depends significantly on the chosen field specialization (expectation 1b).</p>

<sec id="section4-0001699312474381">
<title>Returns to education over time – divergent trends between educational fields?</title>
<p>Observing the shifting economic emphasis from the agricultural towards the industrial and eventually service sectors, sociologists and economists half a century ago expected nothing short of a social revolution to follow from this process of modernization. This vision derived from the idea that ‘industrialization requires an educational system functionally related to the skills and professions imperative to its technology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001699312474381">Kerr et al., 1973</xref>: 47), which in turn would lead to ‘an open society, inconsistent with the assignment of managers or workers to occupations or jobs by traditional caste, by racial groups, by sex, or by family status’ (ibid., p. 45). As a consequence, some stratification researchers expected modernization to increase the number of jobs with high skill requirements, resulting in a widening socio-economic gap between the highly and poorly educated across cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0001699312474381">Featherman and Hauser, 1978</xref>). While effects in line with this expectation have been observed in some countries (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0001699312474381">Boudarbat et al., 2010</xref>), ample evidence as well as theoretical arguments exist suggesting contrary mechanisms at work in contexts with highly expansive educational systems: when the supply of highly skilled workers outstrips their demand by employers, the level of socio-economic rewards for educational attainment tends to fall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0001699312474381">Brauns et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0001699312474381">Collins, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0001699312474381">Van der Ploeg, 1994</xref>). Subsequently, the process of credential inflation is assumed to send shockwaves also to groups with mid-level and lower qualifications, as they are increasingly displaced by employers favouring those with higher educational credentials even when job tasks remain unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0001699312474381">Thurow, 1975</xref>). In a climate where access to occupational positions requires ever higher-ranked educational credentials, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0001699312474381">Solga (2002</xref>) expects stigmatization to exacerbate the social and economic disadvantage of those at the bottom of the labour queue. Overall, available data for Finland are consistent with this credential inflation account, as returns to education decreased in Finland during the last decades of the previous century (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0001699312474381">Asplund and Leijola, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, is it likely that this credential inflation evenly affected all fields of study within different educational levels? Some researchers argue that educational expansion weakens the signal of high ability that university degrees used to transmit to employers, resulting in a shift of this signal function to programmes with more academically challenging entrance requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0001699312474381">Reimer et al., 2008</xref>). Other scholars highlight differences in occupational specificity between educational fields, claiming that specializations transmitting generic rather than occupation-specific skills will make graduates more replaceable in situations of fiercer job competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0001699312474381">Berger, 1988</xref>). Both accounts expect university graduates’ labour market outcomes to diversify over time, with ‘soft science’ disciplines such as the humanities increasingly disadvantaged on the labour market compared to degrees in technical fields. But different historical trajectories in the labour market value of educational fields might also reflect the impact of structural causes. Previous research showed that for those at the beginning of their labour market career, severe economic crises can lastingly affect their socio-economic positioning (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0001699312474381">Härkönen and Bihagen, 2011</xref>). The deep recession which Finland experienced in the early 1990s drastically raised unemployment in the manufacturing and construction industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0001699312474381">Statistics Finland, 1997</xref>: 76). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0001699312474381">Haapakorpi (1995</xref>), this slump impaired the labour market situation for new graduates particularly in technical fields, despite the high degree of occupational specificity or the stronger ability signals attributed to this qualification.</p>
<p>To summarize, many authors expect the effect of education to decline and the diversity in labour market outcomes between fields of study to increase over time, yet opinions concerning the mechanisms that drive these processes vary. In the Finnish context, the present inquiry expects to find a stronger decline in the humanities compared to other fields at all educational levels (expectation 2), with a possible slump in the value of an engineering qualification predicted for 1995 (expectation 3). In total, then, field-specific trajectories in the socio-economic effect of education are expected to display patterns that are more heterogeneous than the time trends identified in models focusing only on qualification levels (expectation 4).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0001699312474381">
<title>Gender differences in the field-specific impact of education</title>
<p>It is a well-established fact that men and women in most countries tend to be found in different educational and occupational fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0001699312474381">Charles, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001699312474381">Charles and Bradley, 2009</xref>). Attempts to explain this persisting gender segregation often emphasize the power of socialization and social norms in maintaining gender-appropriate behaviour, which lead individuals to prefer gender-typical fields of study and employment regardless of their economic returns (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0001699312474381">Jacobs, 1995</xref>). Yet, there might also be quite rational considerations involved when choosing gender-typical fields of study. Some qualitative studies have suggested that stereotypical ascriptions may work in men’s favour when they work in a female-dominated environment, while such assumptions can create obstacles for women in male-dominated fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0001699312474381">Greed, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0001699312474381">Simpson, 2004</xref>). Other research has highlighted that women’s persistently disproportionate share of childcare responsibilities lowers the earnings advantage commonly associated with male-dominated, private sector employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0001699312474381">Hansen, 1997</xref>). Either of these mechanisms may decrease the material trade-offs for women who take the personal risk of crossing into atypical fields. Empirically, such a situation should be reflected in lower differences between returns in female-typical and male-typical fields of study among women (expectation 5).</p>
<p>Given the wide scope of educational differentiations considered in this article, the analysis of their socio-economic effects will be forced to apply relatively broad brush strokes and cannot examine the generative processes sketched in this section in a fine-tuned manner. As a consequence, any explanatory accounts in this study must remain speculative.</p>

<title>The sample</title>
<p>The data in this study constitute a random sample drawn from the Finnish census (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0001699312474381">Statistics Finland, 1996</xref>), representing roughly 33 per cent of discrete age groups resident in Finland in 1970. An additional 40 per cent sample of several younger birth cohorts was added to the panel in 1980 and 1985. For the present study, the data are used in repeated cross-sectional rather than longitudinal fashion, with attention limited to men and women aged 28–30 or 33–35 in 1985, 1995 and 2005. The dataset only contained selected birth cohorts, which explains the gap of three years between these two age groups. The focus on relatively young adults in this study was motivated by the assumption that any effects of educational expansion will be most visible in the social stratification patterns of younger age groups. With the exception of self-reported employment status and occupation in 1985, all information in the sample was drawn from the Finnish population register and other administrative Finnish registers. 832 cases with missing values on education and/or annual earnings were excluded. In addition, individuals with zero earnings were omitted from the analysis, which reduced the year-specific subsamples by about 5–12 per cent for men and 8–18 per cent in the case of women. In total, the final sample comprises 440,829 cases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0001699312474381" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The analyses in this article were performed using median regression models, i.e. quantile regression models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0001699312474381">Hao and Naiman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0001699312474381">Koenker, 2005</xref>) estimated at the median of the conditional distribution. The interpretation of coefficients in median regression is similar to ordinary least square regression, only that coefficients refer to predictors’ effect on the median (rather than the mean) of the dependent variable, net of all other effects. Computation of coefficients was performed with R version 2.15.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0001699312474381">R Development Core Team, 2012</xref>) using the quantreg package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0001699312474381">Koenker, 2012</xref>). Quantile regression (QR) models are not affected by outliers, less sensitive to top coding and impose less stringent distributional assumptions compared to ordinary least squares regression, which makes QR particularly useful for analyses of income and its typically skewed distribution.</p>

<title>Dependent variable</title>
<p>In this article, the socio-economic outcome of interest is operationalized as the personal gross earnings in a given year, defined as income from employment or self-employment as recorded in the Finnish tax register. For greater comparability with conventional analyses of returns to education, the natural logarithm of annual earnings serves as the dependent variable in the models. This transformation allows focusing on the <italic>relative</italic> socio-economic effect of education, expressed as percentage differentials in the earnings of groups with varying educational qualifications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0001699312474381">
<title>Educational variables</title>
<p>Five levels of educational attainment are considered in this article. At the secondary level, a distinction is made between compulsory basic schooling (<italic>perus-,</italic> <italic>keski- or kansakoulu,</italic> lasting maximally 9 years), vocational qualifications (<italic>ammattikoulu</italic>, with programmes 2–3 years in length after compulsory schooling) and the high school examination <italic>(ylioppilastutkinto,</italic>taken 3 years after compulsory schooling<italic>)</italic>. At tertiary level, vocational colleges (<italic>opisto</italic>, with a programme length of 2–3 years after upper secondary schooling) provided advanced vocational training until the mid-1990s. Beginning in 1992, these institutions were reformed and gradually upgraded to polytechnics <italic>(ammattikorkeakoulu,</italic>with degree length of at least 3 years after upper secondary education), which established a new sector of Finnish higher education characterized by a more vocational emphasis compared to the universities. Due to this shared history, polytechnic and vocational college degrees are merged in all analyses to form the category of ‘intermediate-level’ education. The group of university graduates in the analysis contains individuals who have completed at least a 3-year bachelor degree at a university.</p>
<p>Fields of study are recorded in the dataset for those respondents who graduated from a vocational school, vocational college, polytechnic or university. In line with Eurostat’s classification of educational fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0001699312474381">Andersson and Olsson, 1999</xref>), the analysis distinguishes eight specializations: education, humanities and arts, social sciences including business and law, science and computing, engineering (including manufacturing and construction), agriculture and veterinary, health and social welfare, and services. The official nature of this classification makes the conception of educational fields in this article more transparent for the reader, as codebooks describing the type of programme included in each field are publicly available. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0001699312474381">Table 1</xref> gives trends in the distribution of men and women over these eight fields of study for each educational level. The core analyses of this article focus on the joint impact of the horizontal and vertical dimensions of education, measured by a new variable with 24 distinct field-level combinations in addition to categories for high school and basic schooling.</p>

<p>Although the inclusion of eight fields of study and five levels of education maps the main educational differentiations in Finland relatively comprehensively, it is obvious that some heterogeneity remains concealed <italic>within</italic> these categories. For instance, while the science field is dominated by computer science courses at secondary and post-secondary level, the scope of science sub-disciplines is considerably wider at the university level. Similarly, the results might also be affected by the fact that several different types of university degree (bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral qualifications) have been merged into one category. To keep any such distortions from affecting this article’s main conclusions, some additional analyses with finer educational distinctions have been performed. They have for the most part reproduced the qualitative results reported in this article, but the few cases which deviated in a more noteworthy fashion are commented on further below. Differences between types of degree within the intermediate-level category remain outside the scope of this article.</p>

<title>Control variables</title>
<p>Several categorical variables were entered as additional control variables in the analyses: current labour market activity (employed, unemployed, not in the labour force), age group (28–30 vs. 33–35 years old), region (rural, semi-urban, urban), married (yes or no), years since graduation (less than five, five to nine and ten years or more), and a dummy recording whether individuals experienced any unemployment spells during the year in question. As an indication of individuals’ social background, their parents’ relative position in the occupational status hierarchy (measured by International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0001699312474381">Ganzeboom and Treiman, 1996</xref>) was entered as a categorical variable.</p>

<title>Data limitations and robustness issues</title>
<p>A significant weakness of this dataset is its lack of consistent information on weekly working hours as well as on the number of months worked during the year. Variations in typical working hours in different occupational segments and industries could be thought to cause any field-specific diversity observed. However, repeating analyses using occupational status (measured by ISEI scores) as the dependent variable yielded a similar extent of field-specific heterogeneity, although the particular patterns in which it occurred varied to some extent. But although this inevitable omission thus appears to leave the basic conclusions drawn from the analyses unaffected, the size of coefficients is nevertheless expected to be biased, especially in the case of women. Although women in Finland have been characterized by a high rate of labour market participation (frequently more than 80 per cent among those aged 30–34) and low shares of part-time employment (around 10 per cent) during the past few decades, full-time wage labour is still a slightly more common scenario for men compared to women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0001699312474381">OECD.Stat, 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0001699312474381">b</xref>). In addition, the dataset did not allow for consistently controlling the number and age of individuals’ children, which is likely to affect women’s results more strongly than men’s. Therefore, the analyses refrain from directly comparing the size of coefficients between the genders.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the sample in these data includes only individuals who at some point during the year gained income from employment or self-employment. Restricting the data in this manner has been suspected to bias results, which led to the development of methods to correct for sample selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0001699312474381">Heckman, 1979</xref>). But some researchers have forcefully argued against any automatic inclusion of such corrector estimates without well-founded indications that selectivity issues indeed affect a given analysis (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0001699312474381">Bushway et al., 2007</xref>). Given that positive annual earnings constitute a considerably lower threshold than current employment status for individuals to be included into the sample, the extent of selectivity bias is assumed to be limited for the present study. To further examine possible effects arising from this restriction, analyses have been repeated using a broader income measure, which includes earnings as well as income from other, non-labour sources (such as social benefits). Coefficients estimated for this unrestricted sample approximately replicated the results presented in this article. For all these reasons, the findings reported in this article are left uncorrected for potential sample selection bias.</p>

<p>When looking at trends over time, patterns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699312474381">Table 3</xref> appear on the whole to be in line with expectations formulated by credential inflation accounts: the effect of a university degree has decreased between 1985 and 2005 for both men and women. This development is consistent with earlier studies on the wage returns to education using Finnish data (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0001699312474381">Asplund and Leijola, 2005</xref>). A similar decline over time affected the impact of intermediate-level degrees (vocational colleges together with polytechnics) among men in the sample, yet these trends may not be generalizable given the overlap in the confidence intervals containing these estimates. However, women with vocational college degrees saw an improvement of their earnings relative to the group with only basic schooling. While this result does not appear to be statistically significant in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699312474381">Table 3</xref>, analyses of alternative socio-economic measures reproduced this upward trend among women. Developments in the effect of high school qualifications differ between the genders, with its benefit over basic schooling relatively stable among men (about 10 per cent), but declining for women (from around 15 per cent to 12 per cent) between 1985 and 2005. When it comes to vocational education, the trends displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699312474381">Table 3</xref> are sensitive to the measure of socio-economic outcome used: although the positive earnings effect of vocational upper secondary education appears to strengthen over time in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699312474381">Table 3</xref>, alternative analyses showed a downwards trend in the impact of vocational schooling on occupational status for men and a stable negative coefficient for women (not shown).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0001699312474381">2</xref>
</sup></p>
<p>A noticeable drop in the returns to education can be observed for most types of degree among men and women in 1995. This pattern is likely to reflect the aftermath of the 1990s recession, given that the share of individuals having experienced recent unemployment in the sample soared from 8 per cent (1985) to 30 per cent (1995) for those with only basic schooling and tripled for most other educational groups. Among women, the more steady decline in the effect of a high school degree may to some extent also echo the educational expansion during the 1990s: while unemployment equally affected both genders in the sample, a larger share of female compared to male high school graduates was enrolled in further education after 1985, which possibly reduced the share of high-school educated women with full-time commitment to the labour market.</p>

<title>Comparing overall trends and patterns with the field-specific view</title>
<p>At this stage, the educational attainment variable in the models was replaced by dummies measuring all possible combinations between fields of study and levels of education. For ease of interpretation, the resulting coefficients are presented graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0001699312474381">Figure 1</xref>. Each row of panels represents the results of a given year separately for men and women. The coefficients are sorted by field of study, represented on the y-axis of each panel, while the symbols correspond to the four different educational levels distinguished in this study. All symbols within each panel are directly comparable to each other, since basic schooling serves as their common reference group. The scale at the bottom of each panel indicates the size of the coefficient represented by each symbol. The error bars around each estimate reflect confidence intervals at the 95 per cent level, although some of them are too short to be graphically discernible. The dashed vertical line in each panel separates effects which lower from those that raise median logged earnings compared to the reference group.</p>

<italic>Field-specific patterns in the effects of educational attainment</italic>
</p>
<p>To what extent can fields of study alter the socio-economic benefit of educational attainment? Low field-specific diversity in returns to a given educational level would sort the symbols for each level along a more or less vertical line within the panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0001699312474381">Figure 1</xref>, without overlaps between symbols representing distinct educational levels across or within fields of study. A pattern of this sort would indicate that education impacts on economic resources mainly through its attainment level and remains largely unaffected by field specializations. However, the configuration of symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0001699312474381">Figure 1</xref> indicates that education’s role in the Finnish social stratification process is more complex. Net of other effects, qualification levels are most powerful in distinguishing the socio-economic status of graduates within the <italic>same</italic> broad field of study. Yet, even within the same fields, higher-level educational credentials do not always confer greater economic resources: this is exemplified with most historical stability by men’s coefficients in the humanities and the sciences<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0001699312474381">3</xref>
</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0001699312474381">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Examining the impact of educational attainment levels across different fields of study further reveals a large number of cases where field-specific returns to a given qualification equal those of certain lower or higher-ranking educational credentials. Several cases illustrating this pattern are briefly commented on here. Vocational qualifications in the fields of agriculture transmit no benefit over basic schooling, which may be linked to low profitability in self-employed farming as well as farmers’ reliance on agricultural subsidies to supplement their income. The fact that returns to intermediate-level degrees in engineering appear to equal or even exceed the earnings effect of a university degree in the humanities (for men and women in most years) might partly be linked to wage differentials for employees in the public and private sectors. Science qualifications at intermediate level in 1985 had a significantly larger effect on annual earnings than several university degrees, which probably reflected the high demand for the newly emerged occupation of computer specialists at that time. This advantage was to some extent still visible in 2005, especially when compared to university fields with stronger affiliation to public sector occupations, such as the humanities and education. Among men, intermediate-level qualifications in health provide no economic benefit over lower-level credentials acquired in the field of services (all years). Given that men’s training in the services field usually meant specializing in either transport or security, it could be speculated that part of their earnings advantage is associated with the greater bargaining power of these occupations compared to that of care workers.</p>
<p>Overall then, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0001699312474381">Figure 1</xref> suggests that the view on field-specific qualifications far from neatly reproduces the aggregate effect of educational attainment described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699312474381">Table 3</xref>. While the exact mechanisms producing these patterns cannot be conclusively determined in the context of this study, the results depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0001699312474381">Figure 1</xref> are more congruent with expectations derived from the status competition view (expectation 1b) compared to the homogeneous outcome predicted by the productivity-based account (expectation 1a).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0001699312474381">
<title>Time trends of field-specific educational coefficients</title>
<p>For a better view on how coefficients developed over time, symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0001699312474381">Figure 2</xref> now distinguish different years, while each row of panels represents a given educational level. For men, it seems indeed to be the case that economic rewards for those specialized in the humanities have declined sharply at the university level between 1985 and 2005. Among women, trends in the returns to university degrees are affected by female graduates’ changing distribution over lower and higher-level university qualifications: when bachelor degrees are disregarded, it appears that the labour market value of humanities degrees has suffered much clearer losses, while the drop in the returns to a health degree turns out to be significantly less dramatic among university-educated women (not shown). Also at intermediate and vocational secondary levels, humanities qualifications seem to have lost some of their economic value over time. Despite these developments, significant declines in fields such as science (at intermediate level among men and women), agriculture, health and education<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0001699312474381">4</xref>
</sup> (among university-educated men) and services (among men at intermediate level) taint the conclusion of ‘soft science’ fields being most affected by lowering returns. As such, the results provide mixed support for expectation 2. The prediction concerning a slump in rewards caused by the aftermath of the recession among those with an engineering qualification (expectation 3) materializes especially at the intermediate level and among female engineers with university degrees. By contrast, men’s and women’s returns to an engineering qualification at the vocational level remained more or less stable between 1985 and 1995.</p>

<p>Are field-specific trends in returns to education consistent with the overall picture painted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699312474381">Table 3</xref>? Men’s and women’s decreasing rewards in most university fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0001699312474381">Figure 2</xref>) represent a good fit with the small decline observed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699312474381">Table 3</xref>. But a greater discrepancy in developments over time can be observed at lower educational levels. Among men, the near constancy of returns to intermediate-level training between 1985 and 2005 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699312474381">Table 3</xref>) appears to be driven mainly by the stable returns to engineering qualifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0001699312474381">Figure 2</xref>), which at the same time represent the most common field for men qualified at this level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0001699312474381">Table 1</xref>). Trends in other fields, by contrast, show a much more marked downwards tendency during that period than suggested in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699312474381">Table 3</xref>. Similarly, the impression of stable returns to women’s intermediate-level qualifications in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699312474381">Table 3</xref> appears to be produced mainly by a favourable development in the socio-economic value of the business and services fields, while the effects of many other areas of specialization largely decreased over time. But most contradictory trends of this sort are found at the vocational level. In the case of both men and women, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0001699312474381">Figure 2</xref> suggests that dominant fields (such as engineering in the case of men, services and business in the case of women, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0001699312474381">Table 1</xref>) drive the improvement in the effects of vocational education observed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699312474381">Table 3</xref>, whereas relative economic rewards in other vocational fields are stable or dropping. Overall, it can be concluded that the predicted heterogeneity of field-specific trends (expectation 4) is consistent with patterns detected at the vocational and intermediate level, whereas a more homogeneous decline affected the university sector.</p>

<title>Gender differences in the effects of male and female-typical fields of study</title>
<p>Can the diversity in field-specific returns to education potentially reinforce educational and occupational gender segregation in Finland? To tentatively explore this question, the focus now shifts towards those two broad fields which have been most persistently associated with a strongly lopsided gender ratio among students of all educational levels in Finland, i.e. male-dominated engineering and female-dominated health programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0001699312474381">Prix, 2012</xref>). Some interesting patterns emerge when comparing effects associated with these two fields among men and women in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0001699312474381">Figure 2</xref>. The rank order of fields in terms of their socio-economic value is relatively similar among university-educated men and women, with both health and engineering producing comparatively high returns for both genders.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0001699312474381">5</xref>
</sup> For men with intermediate-level qualifications, specializing in engineering provides a clear economic advantage over the non-traditional group of men qualified in a health field. This income benefit of engineering over health exists also among women, but is less pronounced, especially after 1985 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0001699312474381">Figure 2</xref>). The clearest contrast between men and women in this context arises at the vocational level. Men with vocational engineering qualifications are increasingly better off than their male colleagues in health fields. Yet, for women, the opposite relationship holds: in the past, women specializing in the stereotypical female field of health have had a clear advantage over their female peers who crossed the gender boundaries into the male-dominated field of engineering, although returns in both fields appear to have equalized for women in 2005.</p>
<p>In general, then, rational incentives for men and women to adhere to gender-typical field choices (expectation 5) seem to have been especially pronounced among graduates of vocational schools. Incidentally, the vocational sector is also characterized by the highest degree of field-specific gender segregation in the Finnish educational structure (Prix, 2011), yet an examination of the causal links between these two phenomena lies beyond the scope of this study. In general, since only two very broad fields of study were compared, the observed gender differences in the relative socio-economic advantage of male and female-dominated fields need to be treated as tentative and preliminary. This is especially important given that these results could not be replicated when estimating effects on occupational status.</p>

<title>Discussion and concluding remarks</title>
<p>Combining insights from social stratification research and the sociology of education, this article’s contribution lies with highlighting the multidimensional character of educational credentials for the distribution of economic resources. While fields of study are increasingly acknowledged to modify individuals' returns to higher education, less is known about the way that vertical (i.e. qualification levels) and horizontal (e.g. fields of study) dimensions interact in the social stratification process. Fields of study are most likely to assume this moderating role in countries like Finland, where the educational system is characterized by large sections of highly differentiated, occupationally specific and standardized educational programmes at secondary and tertiary level. Access to a very extensive, register-based dataset with detailed educational information provided a rare opportunity to explore this question empirically. The results of median regression models of annual earnings, focusing on young Finnish adults during the years 1985, 1995 and 2005, suggest that the field-specific perspective on the effect of education cannot be reduced to just a strain on the parsimony of more conventional models. On the contrary, the models presented in this article suggest that disregarding the horizontal dimension of education might even create a false sense of homogeneity when estimating the socio-economic effects of educational attainment. In the Finnish case, this omission might have quite substantial consequences for the kind of role attributed to education in the stratification process. As the analysis in this article has revealed, whether or not educational attainment raises individuals’ socio-economic position crucially depends on the fields of study involved. This questions the idea that increments of education necessarily raise median earnings. Omitting fields of study from the analysis leaves average returns to qualifications dominated by the field-specific effects in large fields. With the contradictory patterns that affect other areas of specialization thus out of sight, structural explanatory factors that affect the discrepancy in field-specific effects tend to be equally neglected. As a result, interpretations of education’s role in the social stratification process may unduly favour discourses framed in individual-level terms, emphasizing graduates’ productivity and ability, over such with a greater regard for political-economic structures and group level processes.</p>
<p>Similarly, this article has suggested that trends over time in the effect of education on socio-economic rewards might not necessarily reflect developments in the value of education as such, given that patterns of change clearly differed across fields of study. Disregarding this field-specific variability can have severely distorting consequences for interpreting trends in the socio-economic impact of educational qualifications: even if the value of education were to remain stable over time in all fields of study, it is thinkable that an analysis of average returns to education may detect some historical change. This might be the case if the weight of enrolment patterns in education shifted over time towards fields of study with differential socio-economic returns. Moreover, while the pattern of diversity has varied to some extent over time, the extent of this heterogeneity remained relatively stable between 1985 and 2005, suggesting the sources for field-specific differentials in socio-economic returns to lie elsewhere than in Finland's previous economic crises or recent episodes of educational expansion.</p>
<p>Field-specific differences in the economic returns to a given educational level are often acknowledged as the factor making the historically and cross-nationally persistent patterns of gender segregation most worrisome. Yet, the analysis in this article has suggested that material considerations potentially contribute to maintaining this phenomenon on the labour market and within the educational system, especially among those with lower-level educational credentials: among women, vocational training in the male-dominated field of engineering did not provide a greater economic benefit than a traditional female-type field like health, whereas the inverse scenario was observed among men. Nevertheless, this finding must be treated as strictly preliminary, given that only selected and very broad fields of study were examined. Additional analyses focusing on occupational status in place of annual earnings did not replicate these patterns.</p>
<p>A concluding word of caution to remind the reader of several limitations faced by this study. Certain complications arise from the fact that the dataset used did not contain any information on weekly working hours. Although both men and women exhibit a high degree of labour market commitment in Finland, there remains a gender difference in the share of those working full-time, which might affect the results especially among women. For this reason, no attempt was made to directly compare the size of coefficients between men and women. Another potentially troublesome aspect concerns missing information on the number of weeks spent working or outside paid employment during the year. Although the experience of unemployment spells during the year was included in the models, the lacking data on the exact number of months spent in employment could have affected the estimations. Some robustness checks were performed to assess the severity of these imperfections. Using a more comprehensive income measure (annual earnings from labour and non-labour sources) as the dependent variable approximately replicated the size of coefficients and their trends over time. In models estimating occupational status (measured as ISEI scores), the particular pattern of field-specific coefficients varied to some extent, yet the key finding of field-specific heterogeneity in the economic impact of educational attainment persisted. As a consequence, the main conclusions presented in this article appear to be sufficiently robust. However, although this study discussed a number of mechanisms which could play a potential role for producing the results reported in this article, it must be emphasized that their causal involvement could not be formally tested within the applied research design.</p>
<p>To conclude, further research is needed to evaluate field-specific gender differences in the economic effects of educational qualifications as well as to subject the rivalling causal mechanisms mentioned in this study to closer scrutiny. A life-course perspective might be useful for determining how persistent the field-specific differentials in educational returns are over individuals’ careers.</p>

<p>Expectations derived from the negative selection literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0001699312474381">Solga, 2002</xref>) could be interpreted as consistent with this divergence at least in the case of men: displacing the increasingly marginalized low-educated segment in the labour market with vocationally qualified candidates may raise the relative difference in income levels between the two groups despite also lowering the occupational status of skilled workers.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the surprising overlap between returns to intermediate and university degrees in science is due to the heterogeneity of the science field at university level, whereas lower levels are dominated by the subfield of computer science. When only computer science graduates are considered, a university degree has a larger effect on earnings than intermediate qualifications in the same field.</p>

<p>The sharp drop in the field of education at intermediate level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0001699312474381">Figure 2</xref>) is also due to changes in the Finnish education system. In 1985, some of the secondary school teachers in the sample had gained their qualification prior to the reform which turned teaching into a master-level university degree. Pre-school teacher training was upgraded to a Bachelor of Education in 1995, meaning that in 2005 the field of teacher training at intermediate level consisted mainly of teachers of musical instruments and dance. Teacher training at vocational level comprises mostly driving instructors.</p>

<p>Women’s returns to health qualifications are significantly higher when bachelor degrees are disregarded in the analysis. This is due to the comparatively high share of bachelor-level pharmacists <italic>(farmaseutit)</italic> among female graduates in this field, which slightly depresses the overall earnings effect.</p>
