<abstract>
<p>The concomitant infections of <italic>Canine distemper virus</italic> (CDV), <italic>Canine adenovirus A</italic> types 1 (CAdV-1) and 2 (CAdV-2), Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> are described in a 43-day-old mixed-breed puppy. Clinically, there were convulsions and blindness with spontaneous death; 14 siblings of this puppy, born to a 10-month-old dam, which was seropositive (titer: 1,024) for <italic>T. gondii</italic>, also died. Necropsy revealed unilateral corneal edema (blue eye), depletion of intestinal lymphoid tissue, non-collapsible lungs, congestion of meningeal vessels, and a pale area in the myocardium. Histopathology demonstrated necrotizing myocarditis associated with intralesional apicomplexan protozoa; necrotizing and chronic hepatitis associated with rare intranuclear inclusion bodies within hepatocytes; necrotizing bronchitis and bronchiolitis; interstitial pneumonia associated with eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies within epithelial cells; atrophy and fusion of intestinal villi with cryptal necrosis; and white matter demyelination of the cerebrum and cerebellum associated with intranuclear inclusion bodies within astrocytes. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified the partial fragments (bp) of the CDV N gene (290 bp), CPV-2c VP2 capsid protein gene (583 bp), and CAdV-1 (508 bp) and CAdV-2 (1,030 bp) E gene from urine and tissue samples. The PCR assays demonstrated that the apicomplexan protozoa observed within several organs contained DNA specific for <italic>T. gondii</italic>; genotyping revealed <italic>T. gondii</italic> type III. The findings support the characterization of concomitant infections of CDV, CAdV-1, CAdV-2, CPV-2, and <italic>T. gondii</italic> in this puppy. Further, seroreactivity to <italic>T. gondii</italic> of the dam in association with the systemic disease observed in the puppy described herein is suggestive of congenital toxoplasmosis.</p>

<p>A 43-day-old, male, mixed-breed dog was submitted for routine necropsy to the Laboratory of Veterinary Pathology, Universidade Norte do Paraná, southern Brazil. The puppy was part of a litter of 15 (7 males and 8 females); the puppies were born from a 10-month-old, unvaccinated, female Pit Bull mix and were kept in a country house within the city of Londrina, southern Brazil. The dam originally belonged to a colony of dogs, and reportedly demonstrated clinical manifestations of distemper at approximately 60 days of age. Additionally, during the last phase of pregnancy, the dam had sporadic contacts with 2 Lhasa Apso dogs that had ocular-nasal secretions. According to the referring veterinarian, 13 of the puppies died suddenly during a period of 30 days. The first puppy died 15 days after birth, demonstrating ocular discharge, with death of the other 14 puppies occurring in intervals of 3–4 days; 7 puppies had similar ocular lesions. The last of the 14 puppies had episodes of convulsion before spontaneous death. The puppy submitted for necropsy had reportedly demonstrated convulsive crises and manifestations of blindness; dexamethasone, penicillin, vitamin B1, and poly-vitamin complex were prescribed, and the puppy apparently recovered from the illness. However, convulsions, stumbling into objects, and discrete icterus of the ocular mucosa were observed 2 days later before the animal died spontaneously, after which a routine necropsy was done. At necropsy, the puppy was afebrile, without ocular or nasal secretions.</p>
<p>Selected tissue samples (brain, lung, liver, kidneys, palatine tonsils, heart, urinary bladder, intestine, spleen, and lymph nodes) were fixed by immersion in 10% buffered formalin solution and routinely processed for histopathological evaluation. Fresh fecal samples, collected during necropsy, were submitted for parasitological analyses by the zinc sulfate flotation technique.</p>
<p>Serum samples (collected in ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid tubes) from the dam were used for the detection of anti–<italic>T. gondii</italic> antibodies by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638712471344">11</xref></sup>; a reaction was considered positive when a titer measuring ≥16 was obtained. Selected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections of the liver and lung were processed for the detection of CAdV-1 and CAdV-2 nucleic acid, using in situ hybridization (ISH).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1040638712471344">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Urine and selected tissue samples (brain, liver, spleen, lung, and cervical lymph node) were processed for extraction of RNA and subsequent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay targeting a 287–base pair (bp) fragment of the N gene of CDV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1040638712471344">15</xref></sup> The partial nucleotide sequences of the CDV N gene obtained were initially compared with those deposited in GenBank by using BLAST (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST</ext-link>).

<p>Selected FFPE tissue blocks (liver and myocardium [with and without white foci] and lungs) were used to identify the presence of apicomplexan protozoa by extracting protozoan DNA using a commercial kit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1040638712471344">c</xref></sup> The extracted DNA was then used in a PCR assay that targets the 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene that is common between apicomplexan protozoa, by using specific primers (Tg18s58F: CTAAGTATAA GCTTTTATACGGC; Tg18s348R: TGCCACGGTAGTCCA ATAC) that amplify a 291-bp fragment of <italic>T. gondii</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1040638712471344">23</xref></sup> Genetic typing of the apicomplexan protozoa was then achieved by restriction enzymatic digestion to differentiate between <italic>T. gondii, Neospora caninum, Hammondia hammondi</italic>, and <italic>Sarcocystis neurona</italic> by conventional PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1040638712471344">23</xref></sup> Positive controls consisted of protozoan DNA from previous cases; ultrapure water<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1040638712471344">a</xref></sup> was used as negative control.

The lungs were non-collapsible, wet, and heavy, with discrete accumulation of edematous fluid at the distal extremity of the trachea. There was a focal (2 mm × 4 mm) white streak at the myocardium, close to the apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1040638712471344">Fig. 2B</xref>). Lymph nodes (cervical, axillary, prescapular, inguinal, and mesenteric) were moderately enlarged and edematous; the palatine tonsils were also enlarged. The serosal surface of the intestine was slightly granular, and Peyer patches were easily identified; the intestinal lumen was filled with a predominantly watery content, and there was marked depletion of Peyer patches. The liver was pale and friable, the lobular pattern evident with pale foci randomly distributed throughout the capsular surface. Additionally, there was moderate congestion of meningeal vessels.</p>

<p>Significant histopathological alterations were observed within most tissues collected during necropsy. Pulmonary alterations included interstitial pneumonia associated with intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies within bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1040638712471344">Fig. 3A</xref>). In some areas of interstitial pneumonia, there was destruction of the alveolar, bronchial, and bronchiolar epithelium and vasculitis associated with intralesional protozoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1040638712471344">Fig. 3B</xref>). There was necrohemorrhagic hepatitis associated with large intranuclear amphophilic inclusion bodies predominantly within Kupffer cells, and more sporadically in viable hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1040638712471344">Fig. 3C</xref>). Additionally, there were areas of random coagulative hepatocellular necrosis associated with intralesional apicomplexan protozoan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1040638712471344">Fig. 3D</xref>). The white foci observed grossly at the myocardium demonstrated severe necrotizing myocarditis with dystrophic mineralization associated with large quantities of intralesional protozoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1040638712471344">Fig. 3E</xref>); these were also observed in areas of myocardial degeneration and nonsuppurative myocarditis. There was discrete white matter demyelination and nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis of the cerebrum and cerebellum associated with few eosinophilic inclusion bodies within astrocytes. Within the intestine, there was atrophy and fusion of intestinal villi with cryptal necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1040638712471344">Fig. 3F</xref>), depletion of lymphoid tissue, regeneration of cryptal epithelial cells, and discrete hemorrhage. Further, there was nonsuppurative cortical interstitial nephritis with ballooning degeneration of epithelial cells of the renal pelvis, ballooning degeneration of the transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder, multifocal necrosis of the squamous epithelium of the palatine tonsils with depletion and necrosis of lymphoid tissue, and depletion and necrosis of lymphatic nodules of the spleen.</p>

<p>Gastrointestinal parasites were not observed in the samples evaluated by the zinc sulfate flotation technique. The IFAT based on the serum sample derived from the dam revealed a titer of 1,024 for anti–<italic>T. gondii</italic> antibodies.</p>
<p>The RT-PCR assay amplified the desired 290-bp fragment of the N gene of CDV derived from the urine, lung, brain, liver, spleen, and cervical lymph node samples of the puppy submitted for necropsy. The partial CDV N gene sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession no. JQ965820). Initial analysis using the BLAST program demonstrated that the sequences have 95–99% homology with other similar sequences deposited in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that strains from Brazil based on this gene are divided into 2 clusters, one having more members relative to the other. When the sequences derived from the present study were compared with other similar sequences obtained from GenBank, it was demonstrated that these sequences are more closely related to other wild-type strains of CDV circulating in Brazil, particularly to a strain from the state of Paraná and others from São Paulo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1040638712471344">Fig. 1</xref>). Further, these strains were grouped into the larger cluster of Brazilian wild-type strains of CDV. The PCR assays amplified the 508-bp and 1,030-bp fragments of the E gene of CAdV-1 and -2 from renal and hepatic tissue and from the urine sample, and the 583-bp fragment of CPV-2c VP2 gene from the cervical lymph node. However, CaHV-1 DNA was not amplified from any of the tissue samples analyzed, and positive CAdV-1 and -2 signaling was not observed by ISH.</p>
<p>The PCR assay amplified the 291-bp fragment of the 18S rDNA gene that is common to apicomplexan protozoa, while enzymatic digestion by PCR-RFLP confirmed that the samples derived from the myocardium (with and without mineralization and necrosis), liver (with and without pale foci), and lungs contained apicomplexan DNA specific for <italic>T. gondii</italic>. The PCR-RFLP multilocus genotyping was only achieved with the SAG3 marker, which revealed that the isolates of the current study are <italic>T. gondii</italic> genotype III.</p>
<p>The results of these investigations have confirmed the participation of CDV, CPV-2, CAdV-1 and -2, and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> in lesions by the combination of characteristic clinical signs and histopathological findings aided with molecular techniques in the manifestations of systemic CD, infectious tracheobronchitis, and toxoplasmosis with concomitant ICH and canine parvoviral enteritis in this puppy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638712471344">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638712471344">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1040638712471344">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1040638712471344">13</xref></sup> The possible participation of CaHV-1 in the lesions observed in the puppy was excluded due to the negative results of the PCR assay that was designed to amplify the partial fragments of the CaHV-1 glycoprotein B gene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1040638712471344">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>A diagnosis of systemic CD was obtained due to histopathological alterations within the lungs and brain associated with eosinophilic inclusion bodies within epithelial cells; such findings are diagnostic for CDV,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638712471344">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1040638712471344">14</xref></sup> and have been described in other cases of CD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1040638712471344">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1040638712471344">17</xref></sup> The amplification of viral RNA from the urine, brain, liver, spleen, and cervical lymph node extended the dissemination of this infection. Although inclusion bodies were not identifiable within the urinary bladder or the renal pelvis of the necropsied puppy, the ballooning degeneration observed in these organs is a frequent manifestation of CDV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638712471344">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The sequences derived from the current study were more closely related to other wild-type strains of CDV circulating in Brazil, particularly from the state where the puppy resided. However, these sequences were quite distant phylogenetically from those (GenBank accession no. EF197736) derived previously from a dog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1040638712471344">Fig. 1</xref>) from the same geographical location that was diagnosed with old dog encephalitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1040638712471344">15</xref></sup> Hence, the initial phylogenetic results suggest that there might be at least 2 somewhat distant but related wild-type strains of CDV circulating in southern Brazil. A 2012 study demonstrated by phylogenetic analyses of the H gene that the strains of CDV in Brazil might represent part of a larger clade of CDV strains circulating in South America.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1040638712471344">21</xref></sup> However, it is suggested that those strains in Brazil that were classified on the basis of nucleic acid sequence from the viral H gene should be correctly referred to as the southern Brazilian, or more specifically northern Paraná, wild-type strains of CDV. This is because these strains were obtained from 2 closely related geographical locations of continental Brazil and might represent 2 different wild-type strains of CDV circulating within these geographical regions of the country.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1040638712471344">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The apicomplexan protozoa observed within several tissues of the necropsied puppy by histopathology were confirmed as <italic>T. gondii</italic> by a combination of PCR and genetic typing; this molecular approach is diagnostic for <italic>T. gondii</italic> and is recommended for the differentiation of apicomplexan protozoa within tissue samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1040638712471344">23</xref></sup> The elevated titer (1,024) of anti–<italic>T. gondii</italic> antibodies seen in the dam could be indicative of acute toxoplasmosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638712471344">11</xref></sup> while the lesions (pulmonary, hepatic, and cardiac) observed in the puppy are consistent with systemic toxoplasmosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638712471344">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1040638712471344">11</xref></sup> Collective analyses of the results would suggest that the puppy was most likely infected congenitally; the dam was only 10 months of age at the time of parturition and might have been infected during pregnancy. Although congenital toxoplasmosis in dogs is rare,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638712471344">9</xref></sup> a 2009 study described suspected spontaneous transplacental transmission confirmed by PCR-RFLP in 6 puppies born to an 18-month-old, female cattle dog from Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1040638712471344">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The initial diagnosis of CPV-2 was based on characteristic pathological findings that are consistent with this disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638712471344">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1040638712471344">13</xref></sup>; the participation of CPV-2 in these lesions was confirmed by amplifying the desired 583-bp fragment of the VP2 gene by using primers that are specific for CPV-2c.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1040638712471344">18</xref></sup> The intestinal lesions (cryptal necrosis, atrophy and fusion of intestinal villi, and lymphoid depletion) observed in the necropsied puppy are highly suggestive of canine parvoviral enteritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638712471344">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1040638712471344">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Infectious canine hepatitis was presumptively diagnosed by the characteristic clinical manifestation of CAdV-1–induced corneal edema and necrotizing hepatitis associated with large intranuclear inclusion bodies predominantly within Kupffer cells and in few hepatocytes; such findings are diagnostic for ICH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638712471344">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1040638712471344">12</xref></sup> Confirmation of infection was obtained from the PCR assay that successfully amplified the 508-bp fragment of CAdV-1; similar findings have been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1040638712471344">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although characteristic CAdV-2 intranuclear inclusion bodies were not observed within the lung of the puppy, the necrotizing lesions seen within the pulmonary airways can be partially attributed to this pathogen; similar findings have been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638712471344">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1040638712471344">10</xref></sup> The amplification of viral DNA from the kidney and urine of this dog would suggest that CAdV-2 is excreted via the urinary system, and clinical urinal samples can be used to identify this agent by PCR. As far as the authors of the current study are aware, this method of viral excretion was never proposed for CAdV-2. However, urinary excretion occurs with CAdV-1, where viral identification within the kidney can be demonstrated long after the virus has been cleared from the liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1040638712471344">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although there are several reports of coinfections with the participation of CDV in dogs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1040638712471344">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1040638712471344">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1040638712471344">17</xref></sup> the uniqueness of the current report lies in the concomitant characterization of 5 important canine diseases in the same puppy. In the current case, the immunosuppressive effects of CDV resulting in the destruction of signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM)-producing cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1040638712471344">2</xref></sup> coupled with the underdeveloped immune system of the puppy, would have facilitated the simultaneous occurrence and maintenance of these infectious disease agents. Additionally, concomitant systemic CD and toxoplasmosis, as observed in the puppy, are common in immunologically immature neonates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1040638712471344">4</xref></sup>; while the age of the puppy makes the animal highly susceptible to all infections herein described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1040638712471344">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1040638712471344">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1040638712471344">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1040638712471344"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1040638712471344">14</xref></sup> Further, the effects of undernourishment, considering the large number of littermates (14), cannot be overlooked as a contributory factor to the development of these diseases. Moreover, the current study highlights the importance of infections induced by CDV and its related consequences to the urban canine populations of Brazil.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1040638712471344">16</xref></sup> Furthermore, because CDV coupled with age and undernourishment might have been the predisposing factors to the other infectious agents, the acute hepatitis due to CAdV-1 with the concomitant hepatic and pulmonary toxoplasmosis and the necrotizing protozoan myocarditis most likely would have resulted in multiple organ failure and consequently death. In conclusion, the present study is an excellent demonstration of the effects of multifactorial conditions (age of the dog, infectious agents, immunosuppression, and probably starvation or at least undernutrition) in the development of disease.</p>
