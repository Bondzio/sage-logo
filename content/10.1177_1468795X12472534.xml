<abstract>
<p>This article proceeds from the claim that the earliest examples of sociological method were linked by a critique of the theories of natural law proposed in the Enlightenment. It illustrates this point by surveying the rise of social theory in the aftermath of the French Revolution and by examining approaches to natural law in key texts in the history of sociology. However, the article claims that natural law remains a blind spot for sociological method, and the original sociological dismissal of natural law as a formal body of normative postulates has prevented the formation of sociology as a comprehensive system of social interpretation. Using a series of historical examples, the article then argues that natural law theory needs in itself to be viewed sociologically, and, throughout modern history, ius-natural thinking has served not only to establish formal norms for evaluating social and political practices, but also to form the positive preconditions for the evolution of contemporary society in its distinctive differentiated form. The article concludes by arguing that a sociological reconstruction of natural law points the way towards a sociological theory of theory, which has typically proved elusive for sociological methodologies.</p>

<title>Natural law and positive law</title>
<p>The distinction between natural law and positive law underpins, in variable fashion, the history of legal and political analysis in European society. This distinction was already present in medieval Europe. In particular, the political controversies of the later Middle Ages were shaped by a clear distinction between theory, close to scholastic orthodoxy, which analysed law and political power from a transcendent normative perspective and theory offering a more positive or contingent account of legal and political order.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468795X12472534">1</xref></sup> By the early modern era, this distinction had emerged as an organizing matrix for theoretical inquiry into the preconditions of law and legitimate authority. At this time, legal and political philosophies were widely classified either as placing their claims on the side of universal natural law, which involved an implicit commitment to a normative/metaphysical construction of legal or political order, or as proposing a defence of positive law, which meant accepting a more secular/pragmatic account of the foundations of legitimate legal and political rule.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468795X12472534">2</xref></sup> It was in the nineteenth century, however, that the difference between these patterns of reflections assumed most striking salience. The most famous expression of this distinction was perhaps that set out by John Austin. Austin defined positive law as volitionally ordained (that is, as ‘law set by political superiors to political inferiors’), and he located this in stark opposition to any purely normative or moral analysis of law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468795X12472534">1995 [1832]</xref>: 18). This account of positive law became the basis for Austin’s construction of jurisprudence as a conclusively objective science, for which considerations of natural law could assume no relevance. From this point on, a clear dichotomy was cemented between theories favouring positive law and theories promoting principles of natural law as the foundation of political jurisprudence. Positive law became synonymous with legal realism, and natural law became synonymous with legal inquiry, still attached to the residues of metaphysics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1468795X12472534">3</xref></sup> The distinction between natural law and positive law assumed greater intensity during the early twentieth century, and, across otherwise unbridgeable theoretical differences, it was reflected in the most influential theories of law and state. Most strikingly, for example, Hans Kelsen and Carl Schmitt, otherwise theoretical antipodes, were key exponents of the view that concern with natural law entails a metaphysical and rather irresponsibly antiquated approach to questions of law’s foundations,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1468795X12472534">4</xref></sup> and that reliable legal analysis must restrict itself to positive scrutiny of legal facts. Schmitt in fact asserted that natural law principles were derived from speciously harmonious or quasi-metaphysical views of society, which were chronically unable to appreciate the dimensions of conflict in all socio-political exchange; as a result, they inevitably instituted weak structures of political order.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1468795X12472534">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many modern critics of natural law (for example, Austin and Kelsen) were legal positivists, and their hostility to natural law reflected their intention to determine, without metaphysical abstraction, the objective limits of jurisprudence as a pure autonomous science. Indeed, Kelsen positioned his entire analysis of the law not only against natural law ideas, but against all patterns of analysis importing extra-legal (including sociological) evidence into the process of legal construction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1468795X12472534">6</xref></sup> However, the critical reaction against natural law acquired the greatest significance not in the rise of legal positivism, but in the methodological formation of sociology. Scepticism in face of natural legal standards of legitimacy and validity was fundamental to the first emergence of a specifically sociological orientation in legal inquiry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1468795X12472534">7</xref></sup> In fact, it is arguable that the very first origins of sociology as a distinct theoretical discipline <italic>tout court</italic> were interlaced with the critique of rational or normatively asocial constructs of natural law. The earliest period of proto-sociological inquiry in law and politics, very diversely evidenced, for instance, by Burke, Bentham, Savigny, and de Maistre, was characterized by a rejection of the ius-naturalism implied in the formal-normative ethical, juridical and (above all) constitutional principles of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment. This should not be taken to imply that early sociological method simply denounced the ethical residues of the Enlightenment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1468795X12472534">8</xref></sup> Indeed, the contrary was clearly the case. Across the spectrum of proto-sociological and early sociological reflection, a commitment was expressed to preserving the moral vision of modern society projected by natural law theory in the Enlightenment. For example, Comte expressed great hostility towards doctrines of universal right. Yet he also sought to account for general laws of social formation within an encompassing positive theory of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468795X12472534">1975 [1830]</xref>: 27, 701). Similarly, although in his early writings he was deeply critical of the registers of formal natural rights arising from the French Revolution (Marx, 1958–1968b: 364), Marx clearly accepted and followed the defining principle of Rousseau’s (in itself deeply sociological) doctrine of natural law (subsequently endorsed by Kant and Hegel). In particular, he claimed that for law to be legitimate it must be law enshrining an idea of freedom: that is, it must reflect a body of collective liberties, capable of being equally exercised by all members of society in all dimensions (material, social and political) of their lives (1958–1968b: 364). Much of the legal/political content of Marx’s early works, including <italic>On the Jewish Question, The Paris Manuscripts</italic> and even <italic>The Holy Family</italic>, is in fact interpretable as an attempt to give flesh to the idea of equal freedom central to Rousseau’s thinking, and so also to elaborate a sociologically embodied theory of post-Enlightenment natural law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1468795X12472534">9</xref></sup> Despite these expansive continuities between theories of the high Enlightenment and theories emerging in the wake of 1789 and forming the bedrock of early sociology, nonetheless it remains arguable that the process of theoretical formation in early sociology reflected a commitment to the interpretation of valid laws, which distinguished it in key respects from the more deductive methods of the Enlightenment.</p>
<p>Most notably, the corpus of early sociological inquiry endeavoured to interpret valid laws not as rationally deduced or invariably postulated institutes, but as embedded elements within the objective-historical life-horizon of different societies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1468795X12472534">10</xref></sup> The subsequent disciplinary consolidation of sociology, then, hinged on a rejection of abstract legal norms, on a construction of legal norms perceived as possessing legitimacy as the outgrowths of shared structures of social integration, and on a square opposition to formal ius-natural principles. This negation of abstract ius-naturalism was clear, after Comte and Marx, in the works of Tönnies, Durkheim and Weber.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1468795X12472534">11</xref></sup> Durkheim, for instance, perceived his entire sociological method as an attempt to transpose the patterns of normative postulation promoted by the Kantian Enlightenment into a positive-scientific analysis of society as a contingent aggregate of moral facts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1468795X12472534">12</xref></sup> The critique of natural law was, albeit less self-evidently, of great methodological importance for Weber. On one hand, he offered a sociological reconstruction of natural law by describing ius-natural thinking as a legal outlook specific to particular historical conjunctures (periods of rapid social transformation, in which stable accounts of legitimacy have diminished purchase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1468795X12472534">1921</xref>: 497). On the other hand, his theory of ideal types and scientific interpretation more generally can be viewed as methodological approach to social and historical analysis, which, <italic>contra</italic> the neo-Kantian deductivism represented by Heinrich Rickert and other members of the South West German School, was designed to eradicate all transcendental principles from sociological reconstruction, and to obtain defensible insights through the application of an exclusively inner-historical method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1468795X12472534">1921</xref>: 9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1468795X12472534">13</xref></sup> This sociological approach to legal phenomena ultimately obtained its most uncompromising expression in the works of Niklas Luhmann.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1468795X12472534">14</xref></sup> Epistemologically, Luhmann argued that sociology could only think in an eminently sociological manner if it renounced the basic idea that human life has a common nature, perhaps identifiable as <italic>rationality</italic>, which can be distilled into laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1468795X12472534">1967</xref>: 97). Normatively, he concluded that the belief that power and law are legitimized by laws obtained <italic>ab extra</italic>, or from moral residues extracted from nature, marks a spectacular failure to comprehend the systemic internality of the principles validating legal exchange. This assumption, for Luhmann, relies on the spurious metaphysical conviction that law is a privileged bearer of universal rationality, able to transmit values derived outside and independently of other social systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468795X12472534">1981b</xref>: 69), and it runs the potential risk of destabilizing or at least distorting the functions of the systems to which these principles are applied. Even sociologically oriented theorists, exemplified by Jürgen Habermas, who show a measure of sympathy for natural law ideals and are intent on promoting a theory of society which accepts the possibility of universal normative structures, insist that analysis of norm formation must separate normative orientations from natural processes and thus appreciate norms as reflections of specific societal preconditions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1468795X12472534">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Broadly, in sum, sociology first began to evolve as a discipline that was centred on a methodological critique of the natural law concepts of the Enlightenment. Then, throughout its history, sociology repeatedly re-articulated its disbelief in face of the claims of natural law. The critique of natural law is fundamentally linked to the ways in which sociological thinking first understood itself as <italic>categorically sociological</italic>. The sociological outlook in legal and political analysis has throughout its different historical articulations been decisively shaped by the sense that theories of natural law falsify the complexly emergent positive reality of society and have only the most fragile and specious claim to validity. For the sociological standpoint, natural law can only be posited by a rather crudely monadic individualism, it simplifies the normative structure of society by defining standards of legal validity as an aggregate of norms somehow external to society as a whole, and it has little evidential status as a device for explaining the complex and immanently contingent cohesion of objective social structures.</p>

<title>Natural law and the founding fiction of sociology</title>
<p>My proposal in this article, however, is that the sociological critique of natural law, although foundational for sociology as a discipline, has conventionally adopted an approach to law and legal norms that is, paradoxically, <italic>insufficiently sociological</italic>. In fact, this article argues that, in its critical response to natural law and the moral principles of the Enlightenment, sociological theory has accepted, and in fact rather perversely replicated, both the defining principles and the basic self-comprehension of more conventionally normative inquiry; indeed, it has accepted and internalized the theoretical self-conception which it itself reproachfully imputes to the Enlightenment. In particular, sociology has tended to observe ius-natural theories, from a perspective that is highly <italic>literalistic</italic> and insufficient in its reflection on societal causality, as conducting conceptual debate within a socially abstracted or rationally externalistic system of norms. In so doing, it has omitted to appreciate the ways in which theoretical norms of natural law act, in <italic>conclusively sociological</italic> fashion, as functionally variable and deeply internalistic elements of societal exchange and self-construction. Sociology’s formative and persistent acceptance of a dichotomy between natural law and positive law is, in consequence, of itself rather sociologically naïve, and it might be seen as representing an <italic>original blind spot</italic> in sociological method. Sociology first designed itself through a critique of natural law as a realm of norms located hypostatically against social facts, and it has been forced enduringly to reproduce this dichotomy to sustain itself. As a result of this, in fact, sociology’s founding self-definition has prevented sociological research, more widely, from obtaining an adequate conception of the position of theoretical norms in society. The fact that sociology constructed itself, formatively, as a critique of originally ius-naturalistic theoretical stances means that it persistently observes theoretical norms in unreflectively literal fashion, and it habitually accepts the principle that arguments and norms constructed through reliance on natural law exist as a static and socially withdrawn body of postulates. This has had the consequence that sociology constantly preserves, and draws impetus from, an internal non-sociological residue in its interpretation of theory and theoretical norms. Indeed it has meant – paradoxically – that the normative functions of theory and philosophical speculation are routinely exempted by sociology from the need for sociological reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1468795X12472534">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Against this background, this article aims to offer a theoretical construction of natural law, including its relation to positive law, which seeks to overcome the original antinomy between natural law and positive law, and which endeavours to think sociologically about natural law without replicating the original founding blindness of sociology towards the social function of conceptual norms. To this end, this article proposes to trace a short history of natural law, using a perspective designed to correct sociology’s original sociological deficit in confronting the normative constructs of theory. In this respect, this article does not stand alone. Attempts at historical-sociological appraisal of the status of natural law are already evident in the works of Weber, Stefan Breuer and Luhmann.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1468795X12472534">17</xref></sup> Indeed, Luhmann’s doctrine of the semantics/structure relation, in which theoretical concepts form temporal parameters to stabilize evolutionary social expectations, is remotely invoked as the methodological underpinning for this article.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1468795X12472534">18</xref></sup> Unlike such approaches, however, this article examines theories of natural law, and the assimilation of ius-natural ideas in concrete political institutions, as integral dimensions of a functional/evolutionary process underlying the historical construction of European society. In so doing, it seeks to elucidate, in historical-sociological reconstruction, how at different junctures natural legal principles have internalistically reflected and cemented changes in the functional structure of modern societies. Implicit in this approach is an attempt to re-imagine the relation between sociology and (what it constructs as) its original normative antipodes, and to use analysis of natural law to alter sociology’s founding attitude to the status of normative theoretical reflection. Central to this, in turn, is the claim that in its critique of natural legal normativity (widely born from its methodological reservations in face of the Enlightenment) sociological analysis of law and politics has, to date, failed to show adequate sensibility to the socio-historical contingency and societal reflexivity embedded in political concepts and conceptually articulated norms. As a result, it has struggled to produce <italic>a sociological theory of theory</italic> to understand the internal standing of conceptual, and especially normative, claims in society, and to articulate its own position, as sociology, in relation to theoretical norms.</p>
<p>To comprehend natural law principles, sociological theory must in fact step outside its own founding fictions and antinomies, and it must observe that the abstracted norms of theory, against which it has defined its methodological structure, are in fact, like all objects, mere intrinsic parts of that positive social and historical reality, which sociological inquiry more normally constructs as its own object. To appreciate the social status of natural law, in other words, sociology must finally <italic>become sociology</italic>: it must deploy a sociological method to capture <italic>all</italic> social phenomena, and it must compel itself to analyse those objects against which it originally positioned itself (and thus also, by extension, itself and its primary foundations) in a <italic>conclusively sociological</italic> perspective. From the vantage point of a <italic>fully sociological</italic> sociology, then, the article concludes that the dichotomy between natural law and positive law is (functionally, at least) without sociological reality.</p>
<sec id="section3-1468795X12472534">
<title>Medieval natural law</title>
<p>The first intellectual sources of modern natural law are observable in classical philosophy. However, the origins of modern natural law can be traced to the legal system of the papal church of high medieval Europe. In the earlier Middle Ages, the law of the church had been established in only inchoate manner. Indeed, the construction of a general legal structure in the church was a tortuous process, which was partly discontinuous with the eschatological principles of the very earliest Christian communities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1468795X12472534">19</xref></sup> Despite this, however, the earlier high medieval period was shaped by a pronounced <italic>increment of legality</italic> in the church. Culminating in the Gregorian reforms of the eleventh century, the early high medieval church progressively organized itself as a relatively autonomous institution, defined constitutionally by an internal corpus of legal norms. In this process, in particular, the church, centred on the papacy in Rome, began to explain and arrange itself as a cohesively sacral legal body, uniformly founded in God’s will or in the <italic>divine/natural law</italic> ordained by God. Reference to the transcendent supra-positive authority of this law meant that the church was able to expand control over a distinct Christian <italic>ecumene</italic>, to define all members of the <italic>ecumene</italic> as equally subject to, and included in, its laws, and to articulate consistent hierocratic principles to legitimize the use of legal power throughout this <italic>ecumene</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1468795X12472534">20</xref></sup> The divine legal norms invoked by the church thus gradually established a regular internal juridical hierarchy, which they constructed as a legal order able to overarch local and customary legal forms. Moreover, at a time when, in all spheres of society, the exercise of public power was restricted by the private force of local actors, natural law enabled the church to distinguish itself from, and elevate itself above, the worldly institutions of feudalism by claiming general authority and jurisdiction, transmissible through law, over clearly extensible and inclusive legal communities.</p>
<p>Of primary note in this process was the fact that the rise of natural law in the church contributed deeply, at different societal levels, to an accelerated positivization of law. Within the church itself, the infusion of divine/natural law stimulated a positivizing process in four different dimensions of ecclesiastical order. First, the prominence of divine/natural law meant that the high medieval church witnessed a remarkable growth in legal consistency. This was reflected in the increasingly refined codifications of the canon law, normally borrowing principles of Roman law. It culminated in the twelfth-century promulgation of a common code of canon law, Gratian’s <italic>Decretum</italic>, which conferred a high level of predictability and positive reproducibility on the procedures in which ecclesiastical authority was used across different European territories. Second, the existence of a supra-positive legal order in the church meant that a regular chain of legal command could be established throughout the ecclesiastical order, so that all decisions in the church could be authorized by clear legal principles, enunciated in the first instance by the pope (but also existing in legal independence of the pope). This facilitated the regular use of ecclesiastical power across different societies. It created a legal form for the application of power in <italic>iterable</italic> fashion, it allowed power to be used in extensible positive form, and it demarcated power in the church against power held outside it. In particular, this liberated the church from personalistic accommodation with secular actors, and it helped to establish a distinct and socially encompassing administrative structure within it. Third, the reference to supra- positive legal norms enabled the church to adopt a defined legal personality and even an apersonal system of offices, which also permitted it to apply power to those that it included in highly flexible, positive and easily reproducible form. The transpersonal personality of the church in fact became the primary precondition for the general use of ecclesiastical authority, and it meant that decisions could be made throughout the Christian world, the <italic>ecumene</italic>, with little regard for singular contexts, demands or persons. Fourth, the salience of natural law eventually formed the basis for a conciliar order, in which the church assumed a representative constitutional fabric that was distinct from and could be legally mobilized against all its members (including the pope – or in fact all three of the popes who existed during the height of the conciliar controversies).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1468795X12472534">21</xref></sup> In these formative respects, the principle that the church was sustained by a <italic>higher natural law</italic> played an indispensible role in enabling it to evolve as an institution equipped to distil law as an abstract medium of exchange, and in fact to utilize law across society, in extensible and reproducible fashion, as <italic>positive law</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1468795X12472534">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Outside the church, similarly, the integrated relation between natural law and positive law played a vital role in shaping the worldly institutions of different societies in high medieval Europe. At one level, to be sure, the rise of a divine/natural legal order in the church devalued the diffuse forms of secular or positive law. The implications of the Gregorian legal order for worldly actors became visible in the Gregorian reforms and investiture controversies of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, in which the assertion of a papal monarchy diminished the status of secular or positive legal actors. Despite this, however, the process of legal systematization in the church, underpinned by concepts of divine/natural law, possessed clearly dialectical dimensions. In varying fashion, this process generated deep reserves of positive legitimacy for temporal institutions. In fact, there are several ways in which the early systematization of law in the Gregorian church extended beyond the ecclesiastical realm and began directly to transform the legal structure of society more generally and to create more fully positive foundations for the law and legal institutions in society as a whole.</p>
<p>Most strikingly, the ius-naturalism of the Gregorian church defined the worldly regime, next to the church, as an institution that assumed inner authority from natural law. In this respect, legal theorists in the church conferred an indirect legitimacy and autonomy on nascent European states, and they began, tentatively, to delineate a basis of distinct and quasi-positive authority for states to conduct their legislative acts. Vitally, in fact, the formalization of papal authority was specifically intended to undermine the powers of the Holy Roman Emperor, so that the natural legal codification of church law often entailed a <italic>de iure</italic> recognition of the claims to statutory self-reliance of the rulers of individual polities within and outside the imperial domains.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1468795X12472534">23</xref></sup> This dimension of church law brought about an ultimate affirmation of the customary legislative powers of the semi-independent cities and nascent states within the Holy Roman Empire, whose rulers were seen as justified by natural law in solidifying their local jurisdictions and in assuming semi-autonomous political power over their territories. In some instances, most significantly, this power (attributed by canonists to urban regents and consuls) included the <italic>ius statuendi</italic>, which allowed cities and early states to place their laws on expressly <italic>positive</italic> foundations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1468795X12472534">24</xref></sup> In this respect, the universalist ideas of natural law appearing in the late medieval church contained a direct impetus towards legal positivization in the secular sphere, and they established a realm of positive statutory liberty for emergent political actors (gradually concerted as states).</p>
<p>Additionally, as the Gregorian reforms established a body of consistent legal principles to define ecclesiastical power, emergent states were able to emulate the positive forms and procedures underpinning the law of the church. Like the church, the nascent states of medieval Europe began to assimilate principles of Roman law to consolidate their authority, to the exclusion of both ecclesiastical and more private or local legal sources, as centres of positive and generalized jurisdictional power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1468795X12472534">25</xref></sup> This was initially evident in the fact that temporal rulers learned from the church to utilize the <italic>lex regia</italic> of Roman law to assert statutory supremacy in their own domains. However, the use of natural law arguments to pursue a legal formalization of the <italic>ecumene</italic> in the Gregorian era gave rise to the wider idea that institutions exercising political power possessed a juridical and administrative <italic>personality</italic> that was distinct from the aggregate of natural or private persons which these institutions incorporated. It is no coincidence, therefore, that the late medieval period also gave rise to principles of secular constitutionalism, such that the conciliar idea of the church as a congregation of believers united under divine/natural law began to migrate into the temporal terrain (and <italic>vice versa</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1468795X12472534">26</xref></sup> In the secular setting, the principle that law possessed an overarching origin, distinct from the will of any particular actor or institution entitled to enforce it, also acted to cement an element of positivity and replicability at the reflexive centre of the law. By contagion, this enabled worldly institutions to obtain flexible administrative structures close to those used in the church, and increasingly to apply law, positively, in relative indifference to local customs and embedded conventions.</p>
<p>It can be concluded, in consequence, that the renaissance of natural law in Europe at the beginning of the high Middle Ages performed a number of vital processes of juridico-political abstraction and positive legal generalization for European societies. In this period, natural law, although originating in a perception of law as divinely ordained, was gradually distilled as the medium in which societies constructed an autonomous legal domain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1468795X12472534">27</xref></sup> Natural law enabled European societies to explain their legal rulings in uniform fashion, to project and justify their legal rulings into a controllable societal future, and to stabilize their legal exchanges, positively and replicably, across increasingly complex differences of place and time. The rebirth of natural law made it possible for European societies to utilize law as a medium able to conserve an inner and consistent account of its validity, to use law to <italic>create new laws</italic>, and thus, positively, to undermine the local and consuetudinal legal fabric supporting the patrimonial conventions of feudal legality. In this respect, natural law greatly intensified the capacity of European societies for utilizing the law as a bearer of generalized (central) power and as a generalized (central) medium of social construction. Indeed, natural law assumed intense significance in medieval Europe precisely because at this time European societies experienced a dramatic extension of their territorial reach, an incremental decline in local authority, and, in consequence, an increased requirement for <italic>positive law</italic> as an instrument for the articulation and reproduction of political power. Above all, natural law acted as the foundation for the emergence of a positively differentiated legal/political arena, and it created premises for institutions able to utilize law and power at a high degree of autonomy and functional distinction.</p>

<p>If medieval natural law began to construct law as a positive resource for emergent states, this process was dramatically intensified during the Reformation. At this time, once again, the positivizing potentials in natural law visibly heightened the capacities of governmental institutions for the autonomous use and reproduction of law and power, and they contributed in structurally vital fashion to the consolidation of a positive differentiated political domain.</p>
<p>The earliest years of the Reformation expressed a febrile reaction against natural law. In his early writings, for example, Luther rejected all metaphysical principles of natural law. As a central aspect of his anti-theocratic doctrine of the Two Kingdoms, he denounced all claims that a divinely prescribed legal order could be discerned in the world by human minds or replicated (however remotely) in acts of human legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468795X12472534">Luther 1883–</xref>: 43). Despite this invective, however, the protagonists of the Reformation soon began, in a number of ways, to reduce the viscerality and to revoke the substance of the original Evangelical hostility to ius-naturalism. Within a few years, first, Melanchthon adjusted Lutheran views on law, and he devised a theory of natural law that defined the secular prince as the appointed custodian of natural law, possessing specific authority to translate divine law into positive edicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1468795X12472534">1529</xref>: 3). After the Religious Peace of Augsburg of 1555, subsequently, it became axiomatic for Evangelical jurists that a quasi-Episcopal ecclesiastical order should be established in Evangelical states, and that, in this order, Evangelical princes were to be accorded legal responsibility across the divide between worldly and temporal matters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1468795X12472534">28</xref></sup> These princes, aided by their court theologians and lawyers, habitually declared themselves the highest representatives of a territorial episcopate, with power to impose religious uniformity in their territories and to exercise judicial power in both worldly and sacral disputes. Under this neo-Episcopal system, princes endeavoured to explain their position and legislative authority (both religious and temporal) by pursuing a <italic>re-theocratization</italic> of their legal orders, and they claimed temporal legitimacy and autonomy by imagining their own (positive) laws as enactments of the natural laws ordained by God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1468795X12472534">29</xref></sup> The great shift to the modern definition of state sovereignty as founded in the positive will of a prince thus originated in a theoretical transformation of the natural law of the papacy, which occurred in the later Reformation. In Augustinian spirit, the early Reformation had denounced all natural law as a pernicious vestige of Pelagian theocracy. In contrast, the later Reformation transferred the custodianship of natural law (even under a neo-theocratic mask) from the church to the positive jurisdiction of the princely state, and it allowed the secular state at once to rebel against the natural law of the papacy and to perceive itself and its own laws as irrevocably authorized under natural law.</p>
<p>The Reformation, in consequence, was a period of European history in which natural law provided the crucial theoretical underpinning for the emergence of modern society as a society possessing relatively independent and increasingly <italic>positivized</italic> legal and political functions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468795X12472534">Kriele, 1993</xref>: 10). As in high medieval Europe, the proliferation of natural law in the Reformation allowed European societies to satisfy their increasing requirement for positive law as an instrument for the abstraction, articulation and circulation of political power. It is no surprise that in most European societies the Reformation coincided with a dramatic rise both in the density of statehood and in the volume of statutes (that is, of <italic>positive laws</italic>) that states were able to produce (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468795X12472534">Harriss, 1993</xref>).</p>

<title>Natural law between the Reformation and the early Enlightenment</title>
<p>The construction of natural law in the era between the Reformation and the early Enlightenment, often seen as the <italic>époque</italic> of <italic>classical natural law</italic>, gave rise to a number of highly adversarial ius-natural doctrines, each of which was employed to support divergent legal and political stances. Using a slightly schematic periodization, we can observe that natural law debate in the earlier part of this period (that is, in the late sixteenth and earlier seventeenth century) was focused primarily on the dispute over whether actors bearing political power were subject to natural legal constraints derived from <italic>fundamental laws</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1468795X12472534">30</xref></sup> or whether supreme powers of magistracy ought to be placed solely in the hands of a prince, who was entitled, under natural law, to legislate with relative (though only <italic>relative</italic>) autonomy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1468795X12472534">31</xref></sup> The defining point of conflict in the political discussions of this period, therefore, was the question of the binding force of <italic>legal convention</italic>. The spectrum of controversy was polarized between more absolutist theorists who argued that conventions needed to be acknowledged, under natural law, as constituting a quasi-constitutional countervailing force against the princely state,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1468795X12472534">32</xref></sup> and theorists who claimed that convention did not have claim to such effective constitutional power. In the more extreme endorsements of the basic-law principle, the support for the normative force of convention was extended to include the quasi-contractual notion that regents were bound by singular and abstracted laws imposed upon them by those over whom they exercised governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468795X12472534">Althusius, 1614 [1603]</xref>: 177; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468795X12472534">Celta, 1580</xref>: 105; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1468795X12472534">Pareus, 1616</xref>: 12), and that compliance of regents with such law was prescriptible as a <italic>natural</italic> obligation.</p>
<p>In the discursive settings of early European modernity, in short, natural law arguments were harnessed to diametrically opposed and acutely controversialized political strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1468795X12472534">33</xref></sup> Indeed, self-evidently, this was a period in which natural legal analysis divided acrimoniously into rivalries between those theories tending to support consensual or constitutional government and those tending to espouse more ‘absolute’ governmental regimes. Despite these salient variations, however, on both sides of this deep argumentational divide, the essential – or <italic>functionally subliminal</italic> – thrust of natural law theories was not quite as polarized as a surface-level analysis might suggest. The defining impetus shaping each of these theoretical doctrines was that they attempted to envision the state as a repository of autonomous public power, and they endeavoured to formulate, to an increasingly abstracted and perennial degree, an exact and formally <italic>sui generis</italic> origin and a precise legal form for the power that was accorded, in society, to states. In both respects, these theories acted to construct a notion of statehood that placed the legislative acts of public power on socially distinct, theoretically extracted, and <italic>easily positivized</italic> foundations, and they articulated principles of state legitimacy which public institutions could <italic>formally internalize</italic> to control and accompany their recurrent use of power. Therefore, for all their extreme antagonism over points of express principle, the different stances in early modern debates concerning natural law converged around a structural insight into the fact that bearers of public authority were in the process of severing their power from private/personal agreements with late feudal elites, and they were increasingly required by their societies to expand power in abstracted and internally positivized form over rapidly enlarged social spaces. As a result, states could not be expected to hold open a large societal periphery that enabled them privately or locally to consult individual social agents in each and every case in which they made use of their power. In fact, early modern states developed a need for simply internalizable accounts of their power and its origin, to which they could consistently and repeatedly refer in utilizing their power, and which they could conveniently presuppose as relatively stable and even replicable supports for all particular and statutory acts of state. The argument for and against <italic>basic laws</italic> in early European modernity was thus, at a most evident level, a point of almost catastrophic conceptual fracture, in which viciously antagonistic constructs of the constitution of public authority were enunciated. At a more submerged sociological level, however, this argument reflected an attempt within European society as a whole to respond to the rising formation of political power as a fully abstracted and differentiated phenomenon, and to adapt to the societal requirement for positive principles that could plausibly articulate the source, and underwrite the widening transmission, of state authority. Different accounts of natural law reflected divergent endeavours to concentrate political power as an internally authorized and so abstractly iterable resource. On both sides of the divide, the early modern controversy over natural law formed an intensified dispute over the distinctively positive form of law and power, and it incorporated rival, yet also overlapping solutions for articulating and consolidating this positive form. Above all, the deep controversy attached to natural law at this point was induced by the fact that European societies experienced a dramatically accelerated differentiation of their religious, political and economic functions, and they confronted, internally, a deeply intensified need for positive law to accompany the use of power and law as increasingly abstracted phenomena.</p>
<p>In the middle decades of the seventeenth century, the positivizing tendency in classical ius-naturalism approached an interim conclusion in the works of Thomas Hobbes. Hobbes succeeded in devising a theoretical construct – namely, the <italic>social contract</italic> – that enabled the emerging European political system to imagine its use of power as at once deeply founded in natural law, yet also, at the same time, as <italic>irreducibly positive</italic> and internally reproducible. That is to say, Hobbes defined the state as obtaining legitimacy as an expression of the <italic>natural will of the people</italic> (that is, of the people willing peace and self-preservation). But he also defined this will as an entity constitutionally and perennially distinct both from the particular factual wills of this same people and from the wills of those concrete persons who were authorized by the people, at any given moment, to enact the state’s power. It was the good fortune of Hobbes that he could appeal to both dimensions of earlier natural law debates between constitutionalists and absolutists (although personally he veered more towards to ‘absolutist’ camp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468795X12472534">1914 [1651]</xref>: 140). From this intermediate position, he invented an explanation of the state’s origin that could satisfy the demands for a positive definition of state power in both lineages. He offered a vision of the state, defined as an <italic>artificial personality</italic>, that was at once legally separate from any particular prince or magistrate but that also allowed princely rule to be exercised without objective impediment or higher normative constraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468795X12472534">1914 [1651]</xref>: 141). In so doing, Hobbes implanted an account of state power in the political system that contributed deeply to the increase in the quantity of positive and autonomous power that it had at its disposal. Indeed, this dual impetus in Hobbes’s theory was clearly intended not only to define the state as the centre of authority above its subjects, but also to augment the power of the state so that its laws could prevail over all juridical vestiges of local, late feudal and baronial authority.</p>
<p>Outside the more obviously positivist and voluntaristic line of early Enlightenment ius-naturalism, a similar, or at least analogous, theoretical impulse was also palpable. For example, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, the most defiantly metaphysical of all post-Reformation legal philosophers, employed a transcendental concept of natural law to assert that law is only valid (only <italic>natural</italic>) if it renders human law identical with the ‘laws of the best republic’, and if it guides human society towards the ‘idea’ of perfected unity with God’s own law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1468795X12472534">1885</xref>: 6). <italic>Contra</italic> all Hobbesian voluntarism, Leibniz claimed that only <italic>formal reason</italic> (that is, reason capable of assuming identity with God’s own rational essence) is able to deduce and enforce valid law, and law can under no circumstances be founded in acts of will or simple positive prerogative; such law would be ‘abhorrent to reason’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1468795X12472534">Leibniz, 1763</xref>: 279). Despite this, however, Leibniz’s metaphysical ius-naturalism was underscored by the belief that voluntarist theorists were actually guilty of pursuing an <italic>insufficiently positivizing</italic> approach to law. He accused the voluntarists of only unreliably explaining the positive grounds for the authority of human legislative acts. If the law is construed in voluntaristic categories, he observed, law retains a finally transcendent or radically <italic>dualistic</italic> contingency as its origin (that is, it presupposes a transcendent or voluntaristic source outside itself). In such circumstances, the origin of law remains, in the last analysis, extra-legal and <italic>unaccountably metaphysical</italic>; this means that it will resist effective and plausible positive analysis and application. Law capable of being consistently positivized, he concluded, is law whose origin resides in its accordance with the criteria of human reason, and which constantly reflects, refers to and internalizes this origin as its own founding premise. In other words, he suggested, only rational (natural) law can create positive law. In proposing this theory, Leibniz mirrored the intentions of the voluntarists in that he too aimed to create a conceptual template for explaining how law might internalize fully positive and abstracted principles to support itself, and how it might contribute to the abstraction of political power by maximizing the positive fluidity of the state’s decision-making functions. Indeed, Leibniz played an important role in codifying the law books of the Holy Roman Empire, and he clearly saw rational natural law as an indispensable substructure for the articulation of law as a consistently transmissible social facility (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468795X12472534">Leibniz, 1693</xref>).</p>
<p>In each of these examples, seminal natural law theories of early modern Europe re-enacted the deeper underlying sociological function of ius-naturalism. That is, they helped to consolidate the state as a newly evolved body of institutions, and they provided positive formulae for the functional distinction and positive self-construction of state power in European society. Even in their most intense polarization, all these analyses served to instil within the state an abstracted description of the origin of its legal foundations and its statutory functions, which the state could then preserve within itself <italic>as an element of its own positive self-reproduction</italic>, and which it could mobilize to sustain its inclusivity and to support and generalize its legislative acts across society. The conventional opposition, stylized even as an ‘intellectual civil war’, between quasi-positivistic (or voluntaristic) and quasi-metaphysical (or rational) philosophy in early European modernity is often inaccurately examined, or at least sociologically under-reflected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468795X12472534">Hunter, 2001</xref>: 364). Across this theoretical divide, the basic functional outcome of the different lines of classical ius-natural argument was congruent: it was to construct a perennial and fully differentiated personality for the state, to assess and to amplify the preconditions of the state’s positivity, and in fact functionally to assist the state in the course of its legal and political positivization.</p>

<title>Natural law and the Enlightenment</title>
<p>If the underlying debate in the period immediately prior to the Enlightenment was focused on controversy over the status of <italic>basic laws</italic>, this debate, under the influence of John Locke, was transcribed during the eighteenth-century Enlightenment into a more generalized and abstracted construction of <italic>basic rights</italic>. This change of paradigm transformed the earlier ius-natural claim that a polity obtains legitimacy from its compliance with particular and acceded constitutional laws. It replaced conventionalist principles of natural right with the more universal precondition that a polity obtains legitimacy if it acknowledges laws defined as formal derivates of human nature, and if it recognizes the freedoms of all members of society as equally protected under laws founded in uniform rights, attaching to persons <italic>qua</italic> persons. In the high Enlightenment, thus, the law of nature was stripped of all local and consuetudinal residues and translated into the construct of subjective rights, which came to act as the source and measure of state power. This was most clearly exemplified, theoretically, in the works of Kant, which proposed a theory of rights that defined rights as constitutive elements of human subjectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468795X12472534">1976</xref>: 69). This was exemplified, practically, in the catalogues of rights appended to the early state constitutions in America, and, most famously, in the Declaration of the Rights of Man drafted in 1789 and appended to the 1791 Constitution in France.</p>
<p>The later Enlightenment is often observed as bringing towards conclusion the wider dichotomy between transcendent normative and positive constructions of legal authority. It is typically seen as marking a re-emergence, in reinvigorated form, of the metaphysical attitude in political philosophy. This perception was widespread in the immediate aftermath of the Enlightenment. As discussed, the prevalence of formal rights in the theories of the later Enlightenment stimulated a deep positivistic and historicist backlash. The dominant tendencies of intellectual formation in the nineteenth century – that is, historicism, positivism and sociological method – all elaborated their theoretical apparatus in order, quite specifically, to analyse the formation of rights and higher norms not as deductive <italic>external measures</italic> of the legitimacy of power, but as positive institutes, formed through the internalistic evolution of distinct societal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1468795X12472534">Thornhill, 2010</xref>). Indeed, more recent theoretical stances continue to uphold the belief that the doctrines of rights in the later Enlightenment recast natural law as a metaphysical edifice, and gave conclusive form to the antinomy between positive and ius-natural patterns of legal deduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468795X12472534">Koselleck, 1959</xref>: 101).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1468795X12472534">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>The common perception, internalized most formatively by early sociology, that the Enlightenment comprised a body of intellectual currents advocating a normatively abstracted approach to political order remains, nonetheless, deeply disputable. In fact, it is questionable for a number of reasons. As I have discussed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1468795X12472534">Thornhill, 2012</xref>), first, most political theories of the Enlightenment were in themselves explicitly hostile to normative individualism and formal ius-naturalism. For the claims of this article, however, it is important to observe, second, that, like earlier natural law theories, the ius-natural outlooks of the Enlightenment, if examined in a more dialectically sociological perspective, were not formally opposed to the sphere of positive societal formation; in fact, they also enacted structurally embedded functions of societal positivization. This renders precarious the supposed dichotomy between the rights theories of the Enlightenment and the positivistic orientation of early sociological inquiry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1468795X12472534">35</xref></sup> Indeed, beneath their literal claims and implications, the rights theories of the later Enlightenment can be seen as articulating a distinctive functional response to the underlying trajectory of European social formation, and as playing a vital role in cementing the positive construction of modern European society. If earlier theories of natural law allowed the states of early European society positively to consolidate power and law as internally autonomous and positively generalizable social phenomena, the advent of natural rights as dominant elements in the modern socio-political order (configured in the Enlightenment as <italic>universal rights</italic> or <italic>subjective rights</italic>, internalized within the constitutional apparatus of the state) permitted states to extend this process and greatly to refine their positive and generally inclusive legal/political form.</p>
<p>The positivizing functions of rights and theories of rights in the Enlightenment can be seen in a number of ways.</p>
<p>First, the principle in Enlightenment ius-naturalism that the legitimacy of the state is secured through the state’s recognition and representation of all members of society as equal <italic>rights-holders</italic> performed a crucial positive/abstractive function for states as they approached the threshold of societal modernity. In particular, the fact that under the rights theories of the Enlightenment the European state began to construct its legitimacy as derived from persons assigned equal and uniform rights enabled the state radically to intensify its acts of legal <italic>inclusion</italic> through society, and so to apply its power at a dramatically heightened level of abstraction, simplicity and iterability. At one level, the state’s internalization of the reference to the rights-holder as the provenance of its legitimacy meant that it could imagine itself as incorporating a concrete yet fully abstracted public source, and it could refer to this internal source to explain, promote and operatively regenerate its power as a uniformly justified and inclusive. Additionally, the state’s internalization of this reference meant that, in defining its laws as constructed by and proportioned to equal rights-holders, it could finally assume legitimacy for itself as an institution whose origin was fully severed both from private persons, motives or milieux and from the actual or natural persons enforcing power. In casting an image of rights as the even and general source of all valid law, therefore, Enlightenment ius-naturalism provided a potent instrument for intensifying the inclusionary power of law and for eradicating bearers of legal power outside the state from centres of political administration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1468795X12472534">36</xref></sup> In each respect, the state’s account of itself as validated by rights exponentially increased the reserves of positive usable power that it contained and made available for society, and it contributed substantially to hardening its factual political authority.</p>
<p>In addition to this, it can be observed that, although they purported to draw legitimacy from the even and equal <italic>inclusion</italic> of national citizens, the natural rights ideals of the late eighteenth century possessed certain clearly dialectical features, which further intensified the abstracted positive power of emergent modern states. In particular, in defining state legitimacy as drawn from the state’s recognition of persons as holders of equal rights, natural law theories of the Enlightenment devised a mechanism which allowed the state at once to authorize its power through claims to inclusion of those subject to power, yet also to ensure that the terms of such inclusion were internally and autonomously controlled by the apparatus of the state itself. This also served to cement the position of the state in relation to its societal environments. On one hand, as discussed, by identifying the source of the state’s legitimacy as residing in its legal representation of persons <italic>qua</italic> equal rights-holders, rights theories made it possible for the state endlessly to propose itself as obtaining power from all society and as authorized, accordingly, to circulate power across all social spheres. Yet, on the other hand, the construction of the state as legitimated by rights, formally attached to persons, made it possible for the state to ensure that the actual origins of its inclusive force (natural persons possessing rights) were not required, or even <italic>able</italic>, to enter the political system in any factually meaningful manner. The concrete outcome of rights theories was that the state could purport, legitimately, to represent, and to apply power to, persons as rights-holders without factually integrating the persons beneath the rights in any palpable or obviously political fashion, and it could claim inclusivity for its laws without assuming any strict obligation to any factual demands. The (self-)legitimation of the state through its inclusion of rights- holders in fact implied that the origin of its legitimacy could always be held <italic>conceptually within</italic> but <italic>factually outside</italic> itself. Theories promoting an account of legitimacy based in rights instilled within the state a highly internalistic, and deeply paradoxical, construct of its legitimacy. On one hand, this construct allowed the state constantly to utilize and further to positivize its power: it meant that the state internalized an explanation of its power, which, from within itself, it could use to accompany its use of power in many varied and separate societal settings. Yet, on the other hand, it also meant that the state endlessly <italic>excluded</italic> the purported origin of legitimacy (the people as aggregate of real persons) from its concrete administrative apparatus, so that the constituent origin of the state’s power could not meaningfully act as a formative, or even factually integrated, element of the political system. The ius-natural constitutionalism evolving in the Enlightenment, in short, enabled the state to explain and authenticate its power as <italic>inclusively legitimated</italic> power. As discussed, this inclusionary self-reference made it possible for the state to produce a simplifying positive support for all its acts of legislation and statutory enforcement; indeed, the self-identity of legal subject and legal object in this reference became the primary foundation and constant support of the state’s positive power. However, as they stabilized this reference in a formal (and statically apolitical) text (that is, a written constitution, with a formal bill of rights), these theories of rights, in the same dialectical process, served to offset the concentrated politicization of any factual person or site of power within the state or in society more generally. Rights thus conferred abiding stability upon the state’s form by detaching it, in its purported inclusivity, from other spheres of society, and by hardening it against all external actors – including, at once, actors assuming private power outside the state, the factual persons named as originary bearers of power, and the particular members of the state’s constituent body.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1468795X12472534">37</xref></sup> In all these respects, the reference to rights greatly augmented the positive abstraction of state power.</p>
<p>To conclude, therefore, if early sociology first formed itself through a positivistic reaction against the natural rights theories of the Enlightenment and viewed natural rights as falsely externalistic doctrines, designed to impose simplistically normative principles on positive societal institutions, this view itself rested on a series of historically reductive, conceptually insensitive and equally simplistic preconditions. Natural rights, and their theoretical refractions, obtained prominence in the Enlightenment precisely <italic>because of</italic> the sociological internality of these constructs to the historical processes of political abstraction and legal positivization gaining accelerated momentum in this historical period. In fact, the doctrine of the legitimate state as enshrining natural rights and reflexively checking its power against rights emerged at this time as a culminating reaction to the increase in autonomy of different institutional systems in European society. This doctrine formed a positive template for constructing a highly autonomous model of statehood, capable of transmitting its power through society at an extremely high level of positive and iterable inclusion. The ius-natural theories of the Enlightenment, in other words, marked a culmination of a longer, socially embedded process in which natural law concepts had acted to abstract a distinct, positive and functionally specialized political realm in European society.</p>

<title>Modern natural rights: A conclusion and some notes</title>
<p>In many ways, the principles of natural right that characterized the later Enlightenment, translated into constitutional form in the USA, France and – subsequently – in most other European states, formed an epochal and foundational moment for the positive organization of modern societal order. That is to say, the rise to structural prominence of natural rights in the eighteenth century might be viewed as the moment in which the legal and political apparatus of modern society refined its theoretical resources to produce, finally, an internal self-construction that could sustain and underwrite law and power as legitimate and inclusive resources in a functionally varied society. Rights offered a positive form for law and power that was adequate to increasingly large, differentiated and pluralistic societies, in which the need for positive, internalistically replicable and subliminally acceptable accounts of legal and political validity was increasingly intense. In principle, therefore, it is arguable that the primary functional yield of the entire history of natural law theory was secured in the later Enlightenment. The theories of rights-based legitimacy in this period set the abiding, although subsequently often negated, legitimating design for the independent legal and political structure of a modern differentiated society as a whole.</p>
<p>In order to comprehend the relative constancy of natural law ideals and the natural legal fabric in the grammar of reasonably stable and consistently differentiated modern societies, however, it is necessary to renounce literalistic normative approaches (both normative and sociological) to natural laws and theories of natural law and natural rights. Instead, it is vital to observe natural laws and theories of natural laws and natural rights in terms of their internal functional resonances for European societies at different junctures in their formation. That is to say, it is important to analyse natural law principles as constructs that societies have objectively generated for themselves, and by means of which they have, in different ways at different times, formulated contingently extracted responses to their submerged formative dynamics. In particular, it is crucial to observe principles of natural law as reflexive formulae enabling societies to sustain a construction of their overall form as institutionally differentiated and to utilize the reserves of law and power in multiple positive abstraction and inclusivity. This functional approach to theoretical claims does not imply that we have to relinquish all normative ambitions in social analysis; nor does it imply that we need to perceive concepts in entirely relativistic light. On the contrary, we might conclude that, functionally, modern societies <italic>objectively rely on</italic> natural law and on the theoretical articulation of norms and rights; indeed, we have rather compelling grounds for defending the tradition of natural law reflection as a still vital formative resource in modern society. But this approach does indicate that it is important to appreciate natural laws, and the deductive or normative principles supporting these, as <italic>socially generated facts</italic>, whose most essential content resides in the degree to which they have made it possible for a society or a number of societies to produce plausible accounts of their political functions and positively to adapt these functions to the changing conditions of their inner environments.</p>
<p>More generally, we might conclude by reiterating that the general hostility to natural law principles in theoretical sociology and indeed the entire founding self-construction of sociology as <italic>averse to natural law</italic> is caused at once by an obscure sociological blindness towards the positive functions of natural law and by an obscure literalism in the sociological approach to the normative functions of theory. The founding antinomy between natural legal theory and positivist or sociological analysis of law is unfounded, and it needs to be abandoned; sociology positing itself as hostile to natural law misunderstands natural law, and it is too easily seduced by its own construction of the Enlightenment and the legal principles and abstracted normative attitudes that it imputes to the Enlightenment. In fact, from a comprehensively sociological standpoint, ius-naturalism might be observed, across longer historical <italic>époques</italic>, as a most crucial reflexive element in the history of societal positivization and positive legal/political construction. Natural law needs to be seen not as an external norm leading to a simplistic projection of society’s necessary legal order, but as an inner and variable element of inner-societal reflexivity that, at each stage in the course of modern society’s legal and political construction, has produced the most abiding and irrevocable templates for the positive formation of plausible and functionally adequate social meanings in modern society. Far from stabilizing an invariable normative structure against the mutating and organic functions of society, natural law has provided the recurrent register in which societal functions have articulated and reproduced their positive premises. To appreciate this intrinsically sociological function of natural law, however, sociology might be required to renounce its habitual self-comprehension, and it might be compelled to observe theoretical norms not as its own founding antipode, but as a positive object of interpretation. Indeed, it seems that a decision to persist in observing natural law principles as externally abstracted theoretical norms means effectively to move outside the terrain of sociology, and even to revert to the metaphysical literalism that sociology (in its first self-comprehension) endeavoured to supersede. A re-interpretation of natural law, through a <italic>sociological theory of theory</italic>, might be viewed as a vital stage in a process in which sociology <italic>might yet become</italic> sociology.</p>

<p>This is exemplified in the early German Enlightenment. Central to the philosophy of Christian Thomasius, for example, was the attempt to construct a body of public law on practical and positively constructed foundations. This endeavour involved an assault on metaphysical presumptions. It hinged on the claim that human reason cannot have knowledge of ‘God’s secrets’, and that reason is nothing more than a positive faculty intended to help the human being ‘using his natural forces’ to further the interests of ‘temporal life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1468795X12472534">Thomasius, 1711</xref>: 5–6).</p>

<p>Kelsen was determined to separate the law, as the realm of purely normative injunction, from the world of objective or social facts.

<p>Amongst the most significant statements of the conciliar doctrine was Jean Gerson’s claim that the church derived its authority solely from Christ, and it obtained representative power as an institution inspirited by the ‘corpus mysticum’ of all believers.

Note Robespierre’s advocacy of a compromise between government by the general will and government by delegated representatives, whose legislative deliberations were to be subject to public scrutiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1468795X12472534">1956–1958: 141–156</xref>). For an excellent account of debates around this, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468795X12472534">Cowans (2001)</xref>. On the USA, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1468795X12472534">Wills (1982</xref>: 213); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1468795X12472534">Wood (1969</xref>: 266). On the early function of the US constitution as promoting the ‘establishment and acceptance’ of limits on social politicization, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1468795X12472534">Sharp (1993</xref>: 13). On the similar role performed in France by the constitution of 1791, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468795X12472534">Douglass (1955</xref>: 69); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468795X12472534">Duclos (1932</xref>: 11). Hence the early use of the term ‘anti-Constitutionalists’ to describe Republicans in Federalist-era America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468795X12472534">Kruman, 1997</xref>: 58).</p>
