<sec id="sec1-0265691412451813r"><title>Tamara Petkevich, <italic>Memoir of a Gulag Actress</italic>, trans. Yasha Klots and Ross Ufberg, foreword Joshua Rubenstein, Northern Illinois University Press: DeKalb IL, 2010; xiv + 481 pp., 27 illus.; 9780875804286, £31.50 (hbk)</title>
<p>It is a great achievement that the translators have successfully produced an accurate and satisfying prose rendition of this Gulag memoir. To them, doctoral candidates at Yale and Columbia, warmest congratulations. This is a valuable addition to the primary source literature on the USSR in the twentieth century. Tamara Petkevich writes movingly about her life from childhood, through marriage, to arrest and internment in the Great Patriotic War, to eventual release. The book is thus about the fate of a member of the elite in a period when the Revolution devoured its own as well as its out-and-out enemies.</p>
<p>Petkevich’s parents were believing communists who fought on the Party’s side during its toughest battles, including the Civil War and collectivization. The family was rewarded with an opulent flat in Leningrad plus a servant. Petkevich seemed to have a guaranteed future as part of the elite, attending a competitive-entry language school and becoming a member of the Komsomol. She never appears as a communist herself. Her induction test into the communist youth league was notable for the fact that she knew the names of the People’s Commissars, not for any proficiency in Marxism. Indeed, Petkevich seems to lack any sense of politics. Following her father’s arrest and her own expulsion from the Komsomol, she was inexplicably invited to rejoin the ranks; an invitation she rejected. No surprise that she ended up on the list of suspects. A woman of obvious beauty, she had many suitors, but at a tender age and while still in college she left her family to join a man she barely knew who had been sent into internal exile. This man, like many others in the memoir, was unfaithful. And at the final hour she spurned the offer of help from a smitten interrogator to keep her from a camp sentence.</p>
<p>Her political parents clearly did not pass on a communist outlook or ability for political analysis to their daughter. On the contrary, a trusting belief in God is crucial to Petkevich’s sense of self and general human worth. Faith in a higher power sustains Petkevich through many a horror, alongside constant offers of help from earthly beings. There are mean and evil characters, but what is striking is how a sense of community, of a special circle of close friendships with extraordinary people triumphs. A humane fabric was not totally destroyed by Stalinism. Shelia Fitpatrick concluded her account of everyday Stalinism by describing Soviet citizens of that time as survivors. Petkevich is a survivor par excellence, although one who seems blessed with much good fortune. She, on her own admittance, was not in the worst of the camps. She retained links with the outside through contact with ‘free workers’. In the camps she was favoured with the better jobs, most especially joining the performing troupe, TEC. Her stage performances moved the audience to tears; a career she continued post-release. In the camps she had a son (stolen from her by the father) and also found, after so many inappropriate and false proposals, true love. At low points she could also be uplifted through an appreciation of nature; there was beauty even in brutality.</p>
<p>Of course the memoir is of interest for what it tells us and confirms about the camps: the work routine and the divisions between categories of prisoner, the thieves and the politicals, for instance. It is remarkable that Petkevich undertook so much travel as an actor while in the camps. She claims to have visited every camp in the Northern sphere, acquiring a knowledge of their range and scope that one would have thought the regime would have wanted to keep secret. Petkevich also carried and received messages. Inmates seem to have been aware of transfers and could continue to correspond. Discussions were held about literature that somehow managed to reach the camps – the latest novel from Ilya Ehrenburg, for example.</p>
<p>Above all though, this reads like a human soap opera, in which what counts is that which proved to be of lasting value. Despite the displacement, most especially the loss of family, real human friendships were forged and continued into the Khrushchev Spring and beyond. Petkevich pays due regard to the sufferings of friends as well as her own. How could families understand relatives who had been arrested? How could children who had been taken away and raised by others recognize their own parents? Ultimately this memoir will be read not only for what it tells us about the Soviet Union (but, to repeat: Petkevich is not a political scientist or sociologist), but as a fascinating human story of individuals who were unjustly persecuted, and, if they survived, were then released and, if not rehabilitated, could at least live out their pain with some dignity and, yes, even freedom.</p>
