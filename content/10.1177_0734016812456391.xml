<p>Robert M. Baird and Stuart E. Rosenbaum coedited the book <italic>The Death Penalty:</italic> <italic>Debating the Moral, Legal and Political Issues</italic>, published in 2011. Dr. Stuart E. Rosenbaum is a Professor of Philosophy at Baylor University where he has been recognized as an Outstanding University Faculty Member and earned the Circle of Achievement Award. Dr. Robert M. Baird is also a Professor and former Chair in the Philosophy Department at Baylor. He was also selected as the Cornelia Marschall Smith Professor of the Year and the Robert L. Reid Award for Outstanding Teaching in the Humanities and designated a University Master Teacher. They have jointly edited at least 20 books on a wide variety of ethical topics including euthanasia, pornography, abortion, punishment, disability, and now capital punishment. Both editors bring to the table a wide breadth of experience, having published dozens of scholarly articles and having achieved professional recognition in their field. The book is published by Prometheus Books, a leading independent publisher in Philosophy and Critical Thinking.</p>
<p>The book seeks to highlight the moral, ethical, and policy implications of the death penalty and particularly its administration in this country. In framing the debate, the book is divided into six broad topic areas. The first section of the book covers the history of capital punishment and some recent statistics about the use of the death penalty. The chapter on the history of the death penalty is from the Death Penalty Information Center and is a very brief overview of the usage in the United States and a cursory introduction to a few issues. This section left me desiring more information.</p>
<p>The next section plunges into the morality of the death penalty attempting to answer the question of why or why not we should have a death penalty. Both sides of the argument are presented with one piece arguing that anger, and by extension retribution, is an appropriate, moral, and justified response to criminal behavior. In contrast, two additional authors argue that the application of the death penalty is so problematic that it is inherently unfair and question whether or not Texas executed an innocent man. The later piece seems a bit out of place, as there is a section later on in the anthology devoted to DNA testing and innocence.</p>
<p>Section three is devoted to examining lethal injections as a method of execution. It starts by examining the history of the development of this method of execution and its rise in popularity. It follows by presenting the opening and closing statements, Justice Robert’s majority opinion, Ginsburg’s dissent and Steven’s, Scalia’s, Breyer’s, and Thomas’s concurring opinions from the <italic>Baze v. Rees</italic> (2008) decision challenging Kentucky’s lethal injection protocol as violating the 8th Amendment’s cruel and unusual punishment clause.</p>
<p>Following this presentation, a section examines the Supreme Court’s stand on the death penalty for the rape of a child. Justice Kennedy’s opinion in <italic>Kennedy v. Louisiana</italic> (2008) as well as Alito’s dissenting opinion is presented. This is followed by a number of short presentations arguing both for and against capital punishment for this crime. One of the more interesting perspectives in this batch of commentaries is piece entitled “Engaging Capital Emotions” by Douglas A. Berman and Stephanos Bibas. Although a very emotionally engaging topic, overall, it feels as if a disproportionate amount of the book is dedicated to this topic.</p>
<p>Section five examines the issue of DNA in capital punishment cases. This section presents Kirk Bloodsworth’s (the first individual whose death sentence was overturned as a result of DNA) story. While the stories of individuals exonerated by DNA are compelling, this is balanced by an explanation of the Court’s Harmless Error rule as well as the testimony of Barry C. Scheck explaining that DNA evidence is not the panacea that it is often presented to be and reminding us that DNA evidence alone cannot solve the complex, systemic issues that result in innocent persons being convicted and sentenced to death.</p>
<p>The final section of the book tackles the issue of racism and capital punishment. It starts with an essay by W. E. B. Du Bois that thoughtfully addresses the issue of the anger and frustration that results from racism. Race as a factor in death sentencing is examined for both the federal system and the state of Georgia. An interesting essay on the influence of perceived stereotypes as related to the appearance of the defendant is also presented. This section feels a bit disjointed simply due to the vastness of the topic and the narrow selection of articles to address the topic.</p>
<p>Overall, the book does a good job of balancing the various perspectives on the issues presented while providing an introduction to several of the key issues surrounding the administration of the death penalty. It does not add tremendously to the literature that already exists on the topic but several of the selections—the history of lethal injection, anger as a moral response, and the piece by W. E. B. Du Bois are particularly noteworthy. This book is probably best used as a supplement for an issues class—it should be an easy and interesting read for undergraduates. It is likely not that informative for research purposes and for those who are well immersed in the capital punishment literature. Where the book is lacking is in any sort of commentary from the editors to either introduce the sections or to tie the various selected works together. They do, however, provide an introduction to the volume that places the issues into a historical context and introduces the reader to the major issues to be discussed. I think the authors sum it up best by stating “A basic values issue remains insufficiently addressed by this collection of materials, and it should continue nagging at contemporary American psyches, especially after a careful reading of the materials included here” (p. 17). The issue they are discussing is that of decency. The book is their effort to push individuals to consider these issues.</p>
