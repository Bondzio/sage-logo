<abstract>
<p>The Institute for Social Studies and Research, founded in 1958, provided a framework for research and teaching modern social sciences, especially sociology, in Iran. The political climate of post-Second World War Iran, that delivered neither the full benefits of freedom nor the true powers of censorship, fostered both resilience and pragmatism among the founders and leading figures in the Institute. The outcome was a brand of applied sociology that strived to provide scientific guidance for the state’s modernization project while trying to maintain independence and critical distance. The resulting tensions are both unique to Iran and, at the same time, indicative of larger global trends.</p>

<title>Institution building as a lived experience</title>
<p>The academic discipline of sociology in Iran is a co-creation of the UNESCO and the University of Tehran in 1958. Rather than an organic outgrowth of an existing tradition of teaching and research, Iranian academic sociology was born out of a deliberate attempt at institution building aided by the UNESCO’s mission to promote the social sciences internationally. Internally, rapid socioeconomic transformation had provided an impetus for the scientific study of society and its changes. The outcome was the Institute of Social Studies and Research, which for 15 years functioned as the main institutional framework for teaching and research in the social sciences – specifically, sociology, anthropology and demography – before it was incorporated into its own offspring, the Faculty of Social Science, University of Tehran in 1972.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0268580913494913">2</xref></sup> This is not to imply that no sociological work was done before this date or that Iranian sociology has only been limited to academia. In fact, some of the most influential sociological work was carried out outside academia and by scholars such as Ali Shariati and Jalal Al-e Ahmad who sought, explicitly, to distance themselves from the Institute (see Conclusion section; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0268580913494913">Behnam, 1997</xref>: 197). But my focus on the academic aspect is to examine the role of institution building in the creation of a specific brand of sociology defined by the political context of Iran.</p>
<p>Iranian academic sociology, not dissimilar to that practised in many developed and developing countries, is defined by the overwhelming dominance of positivism and applied research, at least as far as funded research is concerned (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0268580913494913">Bayatrizi, 2010</xref>). But the socioeconomic and political climate of Iran at the time also fostered dispositions towards pragmatism and resilience in Iranian sociologists as they had to navigate a complex political and intellectual field characterized by contradictions and unpredictability. In the political field, the state was neither democratic nor ruled with an iron fist. The majority of professional sociologists were critical of the state – some were even militantly opposed to it – but they were also dependent on the state for funding and access. The Institute housed underground guerrillas and state agents side by side. Many sociologists who were critical of the state’s political autocracy were nonetheless explicitly or implicitly sympathetic to its modernization goals. There were contradictions within the intellectual and disciplinary field as well, since the dominant intellectual mood was defined by Marxism but the dominant sociological paradigms were Comptian and Durkheimian positivism, early on, and American style applied and quantitative research in the later years.</p>
<p>After five and a half decades of proliferation and blockade, freedom and censorship, critique and cooptation, sterility and innovation, Iranian academic sociology remains both as a routinized career and an avenue of resistance and critical thinking, a refuge for low scoring students but also the chosen path of politically motivated students who give up more prestigious degrees in law, engineering and medicine to pursue sociology, deeply aware of Iran’s social ills and hoping to find an explanation and a solution in sociology.</p>
<p>The objective of this article is to bring back to life and help the reader navigate this political and intellectual terrain using the oral and written narratives and recollections of those most closely involved in the foundation of sociology in Iran. The goal is to navigate two common pitfalls in the existing literature on Iranian sociology: on the one hand, the commonplace generalizations that criticize Iranian sociology for being co-opted, inept and even dead (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580913494913">Âzâdarmaki, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0268580913494913">Ghane’i-râd, 2007</xref>; Hossein Kachu’iyan, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0268580913494913">Shabani, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0268580913494913">Mahdi, 2010</xref>), and, on the other hand, canonizing narratives that focus too narrowly on the founding figures (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913494913">Naraghi and Ayati, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0268580913494913">Shabani, 2010a</xref>). In contrast, I have tried to write a history of sociology in Iran that accounts for the habitus, coping strategies and actual day-to-day working experience and perspective of those who worked in the political and intellectual environment of 1950s Iran. To this end, I have relied primarily, but critically, on the first-hand narratives provided by those most directly involved in the early years of the Institute’s foundation. Of the two figures considered to be the founders of academic sociology in Iran, Ehsan Naraghi is the prominent prolific writer and interviewer who provides a rich body of his recollections of the Institute’s past – although the narrative overlooks the collective nature of founding an institute. Gholam-Hoseyn Sadighi, in contrast, escaped the spotlight. His few publications do not shed much light on his role in creating the intellectual culture of the Institute. But a variety of second-hand sources fill the gap. I have also used the personal recollections of Ahmad Ashraf, an influential early graduate of the Institute, as well as those of two later directors of the Institute. Lastly, I have taken an extensive survey of the Institute’s research and publications, and read and drawn on its early reports.</p>
<p>The resulting portrait of this institute in context will hopefully illustrate the nature, hazards and surprising rewards of sociological work in a non-liberal political environment (both pre- and post- the 1979 Revolution) characterized by an unsystematic provisional stability that leaves the door always open for negotiation, subversion and critique. An outcome of this modality of power is the emergence of a moving target for the ‘margins of tolerated illegality’, to paraphrase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0268580913494913">Michel Foucault (1977</xref>: 82), which define many spheres of Iranian private and public life, including academic production in politically sensitive areas such as sociology. Conceptualizing a milieu such as this necessitates ‘reflexivity’ capable of capturing the dynamic interplay between scattered and inconsistent repressive social structures and the unexpected possibilities opened up when social actors navigate and negotiate those social structures with a blend of creativity, fearlessness, pragmatism, compromise and of course co-optation. Thus, to paraphrase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580913494913">Bourdieu (1990</xref>: 52–54), the objective sociopolitical structures have created the above set of dispositions or acquired schemes of thought and action that constitute the habitus of Iranian academic sociologists in its early years and still today.</p>

<title>Intellectual and political context</title>
<p>The University of Tehran’s original plan was to create an institute housed in the Faculty of Law, and focusing on master’s level courses in public administration. Naraghi, who had been studying in France, became aware of the plans and proposed an alternative: an institute for social research and teaching, housed in the Faculty of Letters and Humanities, where Sadighi and Yahya Mahdavi had already been teaching sociology courses, and where, in his opinion, the pre-existing focus on Iran, its culture and history created a more fertile environment for the indigenization of the social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0268580913494913">Shabani, 2010a</xref>: 45). In its charter, the goal of the Institute for Social Studies and Research is defined as ‘combining theoretical aspects of the social sciences with applied research and promoting scientific enquiry in social issues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0268580913494913">Faculty of Letters, 1958</xref>: 89, this and all other translations are the author’s).</p>
<p>At first the Institute only offered master’s level courses, which proved immensely popular, attracting 400 students in its first year alone (of which only about 60 graduated). The initial popularity of the Institute is attributed to its newness and employment potentials, as well as its appeal to a large group of politically oriented students who sought an avenue of expression and exploration in the repressive political environment that followed the 1953 coup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0268580913494913">Behnam, 1997</xref>: 178; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913494913">Naraghi and Ayati, 2000</xref>: 201). A look at the list of early researchers and students in the Institute reveals the names of many opposition figures and politically engaged intellectuals. Sadighi, a former deputy prime minister and political prisoner, was the most prominent figure and Naraghi was a former Marxist. Among the researchers, Abolhasan Banisadr and Hasan Habibi belonged to the nationalist-religious opposition. They later joined Ayatollah Khomeini in exile in Paris, and assumed prominent posts after the 1979 Revolution, the former becoming the first elected president of Iran and the latter a cabinet minister and vice president. Prominent left leaning author and critic, Jalal Al-e Ahmad, had a stint with the Institute to create a monograph series on remote cultures and folklore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580913494913">Al-e Ahmad, 1967</xref>: 51–52). Guerrilla organizers and leftist theorists Mostafa Sho’a’iyan and Amir Parviz Puyan were affiliated with the Institute before going into hiding in the 1970s, the former as a contract researcher and the latter as a master’s student (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0268580913494913">Tabarra’iyan, 2009</xref>: 82, fn 63). There is evidence that even the current supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, undertook a research project in 1967 at the request of an unidentified person within the Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580913494913">Khamenei, 1985</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0268580913494913">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Jean-Claude Chasteland, who came to the Institute in its early years to help set up a demography programme, recalls that one of his politically active researchers, Habibollah Peyman, was detained several times and that the SAVAK (National Intelligence and Security Organization) was concerned about activist researchers carrying out the Institute’s research projects in rural areas. He also recalls Sadighi being arrested every once in a while, and greeted back into the Institute each time with a solemn and silent tea ceremony (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913494913">Naraghi and Ayati, 2000</xref>: 353–354). Another French academic consultant, Georges Balandier, recalls that his students in the Institute were opposed to the Shah and interested in politically relevant topics that highlighted inequality and marginalization: the nomads, land reforms and ethnic and religious minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580913494913">Balandier, 1997</xref>: 92). Balandier himself is famous for his conceptually innovative anthropological work on colonized societies, which put power, conquest and domination (rather than witchcraft or local customs) at the centre of analysis.</p>
<p>It appears that the founders of the Institute also had a political understanding of its mission. Sadighi saw social science teachings as an essential part of broader education to familiarize students with their individual and social rights, leading to a policy of admitting students from diverse academic backgrounds in the initial years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0268580913494913">Behnam, 1997</xref>: 178). For his part, Naraghi also aimed to use social science research as a means of promoting the use of ‘objective’ and ‘scientific’ knowledge in political decision-making (see later).</p>
<p>Yet the Institute and particularly its founder Naraghi have remained under suspicion from both ends of the political spectrum: seen as a pawn of communism by the political establishment and a pawn of western imperialism by the left. On the one hand, elements within the political establishment did not trust the Institute because it debunked their grand promises of development and modernization (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0268580913494913">Takmil-Homayun, 2000</xref>: 383). The Shah reportedly accused Naraghi and the Institute of trying to stall his development plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0268580913494913">Kay, 2002</xref>: 320). He also apparently mistook sociology for socialism and opposed its promotion on that basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0268580913494913">Sheykhavandi, n.d</xref>.). On the other hand, leftist and Islamist critics insinuate that Naraghi was a SAVAK operative tasked with snuffing out the revolutionary flame in opposition figures, such as Al-e Ahmad and the charismatic Ali Shari’ati, by giving them routinized jobs and research projects at the Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0268580913494913">Salimi-Namin, 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0268580913494913">4</xref></sup> Mohammad Mokhtari, an activist both pre- and post- the 1979 Revolution, argues that the work of the Institute served the need to control society through knowledge and information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0268580913494913">Salimi-Namin, 2005</xref>). Lastly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580913494913">Abazari (2012)</xref> argues that Naraghi was given a free rein to promote sociology because it was an alternative to Marxism.</p>
<p>As we see, the Institute is often criticized for one thing by some and the exact opposite of it by others. This only makes sense if we take into account the political and intellectual context as well as the personal character and mission of its founders, especially Naraghi (more on the latter in the next section). The Institute opened only six years after the 1953 US-led coup against Mohammad Mosaddeq, prime minister and leader of the Oil Nationalization Movement, and leader of the prominent political party the National Front. Nationalist sentiments were deeply wounded at the time. At the same time, the pro-Soviet Tudeh Party commanded a major share of the political action and attention, and, more generally, Marxist thought and ideology dominated the intellectual terrain. Marxist publications, including the <italic>Donya</italic> magazine, were the most popular avenues of familiarity with anything resembling social and political thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0268580913494913">Behnam, 1997</xref>: 176; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0268580913494913">Sheykhavandi, n.d</xref>.: 1–5).</p>
<p>The 1950s was also a time of great socioeconomic change, which provided impetus, both nationally and internationally, for applied and positivistic sociology, in the service of policy-making and social development. Internationally, the UNESCO promoted the social sciences as part of its overall mandate of laying the cultural grounds for peaceful democratization. In the post-Second World War and Cold War climate, the American Marshall Plan and other similar US and European programmes provided funding for the spread of the social sciences, often in the applied form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0268580913494913">Thue, 2006</xref>). Internally, Iran was undergoing a period of rapid socioeconomic change, fuelled by oil revenues. Undertaking an ambitious modernization and industrialization plan, the government needed information, a lot of it, and very fast. With no prior tradition, accumulated expertise or institutional infrastructure to draw on, the Institute was forced to deliver everything to everyone and to do it quickly.</p>
<p>In this political environment, the Institute fulfilled a double function for both the regime and its critics: on the one hand, it provided a safe haven for critics where they were able to discuss inequality and social problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913494913">Naraghi and Ayati, 2000</xref>: 201), and, on the other hand, the regime itself, or elements within it, might have hoped that the Institute would channel the post-coup political fervour into harmless and routinized research and provide guidance for the modernization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580913494913">Abazari, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0268580913494913">Salimi-Namin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0268580913494913">Tabarra’iyan, 2009</xref>). This double function only makes sense if we do not see the state as a monolithic institution, nor expect coherence and clarity in the actions and intentions of social agents. Naraghi, for instance, justifies his relationship with the SAVAK by making a distinction between the ‘system’ and the ‘individuals’ occupying positions within the system. He had good personal relations with SAVAK director Hasan Pakravan (1960–1964), whom he describes as enlightened and genuinely interested in understanding the country objectively and systematically. The iron-fisted Nematollah Nasiri (1964–1979), on the other hand, was suspicious of Naraghi and pressured him until he quit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0268580913494913">Nabavi, 2002</xref>: 98).</p>
<p>Ahmad Ashraf, the current managing editor of the <italic>Encyclopedia Iranica</italic> at Columbia University, echoes this view arguing that the pre-Revolution regime was not a coherent bloc because it lacked a unifying ideology: ‘You have to realize that the Ministry of Science, and the Iranian regime more generally, was staffed at high levels by liberals and the leftists’ (personal communication, 2011). Among them is Ashraf himself, who was a student and later a researcher and teacher at the Institute. Ashraf’s closest circle include two of Iran’s most wanted men under the Shah: his younger brother Hamid Ashraf (d. 1976), the slain leader of the Organization of Iranian People’s Fada’i Guerrillas (Fada’i-e Khalq); and the aforementioned Mostafa Sho’a’iyan, guerrilla and theorist of anti-capitalist revolution, who took his own life to avoid arrest by state agents in 1975 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0268580913494913">Sho’a’iyan, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0268580913494913">Vahabzadeh, 2007</xref>). Ashraf himself was critical of the Shah’s monarchical regime and censored by it, but went on to hold official positions, including the directorship of social research in the Organization for Planning and Budget (OPB), which was tasked, among other things, with drafting concrete plans for the Shah’s grandiose development and modernization goals. He summarizes his political environment succinctly: ‘I was banned from holding official posts, from publishing, and from leaving the country. But I held official posts, published, and travelled in and out of the country.’ As the director of social research at the OPB, he ‘routinely contracted out research to the opposition activists and turned down regime insiders’ (personal communication, 2011). Yet, Ashraf admits, the work of the Institute was a constant compromise, a negotiation between state needs and researcher’s curiosity, citing nomadic studies (see later) as a case in point.</p>

<title>The founder and the figurehead</title>
<p>Ehsan Naraghi and Gholam-Hoseyn Sadighi have been widely credited as the founders of the Institute. Sadighi (d. 1992) is considered the ‘father’ of sociology in Iran, due to his pioneering role in teaching sociology prior to the formation of the Institute and perhaps also because of his status within the Institute as that of a revered father figure. Naraghi (d. 2013) was the founder and first director of the Institute. The two could not be any more different in personality. Naraghi was an energetic doer, a pragmatist, a visionary and a charismatic personality with a penchant for self-aggrandizement. He was a regime insider as well as its critic before the 1979 Revolution. His unruly curly hair and dishevelled appearance betrayed a restless soul on a mission. Naraghi came up with the Institute’s blue print, ran its day-to-day affairs, obtained contracts and funds, recruited researchers and utilized his contacts at various political levels all the way to the SAVAK and the Empress Farah, internally, and the UNESCO and the French government, internationally. Of himself he says: ‘I am a positive guy and I don’t like the unconditional negativity of intellectuals. I believe people can act for change under any circumstances’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0268580913494913">Nabavi, 2002</xref>: 106). Sadighi was the former deputy prime minister and interior minister during the Oil Nationalization Movement led by Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq, and a political prisoner in the ensuing US-led coup (1953). He refused to have any dealings with the post-coup regime, even to apply for a passport. He was a revered but enigmatic personality who never showed his full scholarly or political potential, clean-shaven and detail-oriented, obsessive about order and manners, principled, loyal, but free of vision or a sense of mission. Sadighi functioned as a figurehead, formally the chair of the Institute, giving it an aura of respect, trust and political weight in an intellectual environment that was highly critical of the monarchical regime. Of himself he said: ‘Politics hindered my pursuit of knowledge and knowledge hindered my pursuit of politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580913494913">Ashraf, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The liminal status of these two men, representing both the opposition and the establishment, is indicative of the larger political climate in which academic sociology was introduced in the 1950s and still operates today – the 1979 Revolutionary change notwithstanding. The work of these figures resonated within the political field and conversely the political field called for, fostered, enabled, shaped and imposed a particular brand of applied sociology, which these men produced and delivered willingly or begrudgingly while trying to speak the truth to power.</p>
<p>Sadighi began teaching sociology courses in the 1940s and coined ‘<italic>jame’eh shenâsi</italic>’ as the Farsi equivalent of ‘sociology’. He went on to oversee the teaching programme in the Institute and later in the Department of Sociology. He taught history of social thought as well as <italic>ejtemâ’iyat</italic> (societals) in Persian literature, a course focused on ‘social factors culled from Persian literature of the past millennium to bring out distinctive developmental patterns in Iranian history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580913494913">Amir Arjomand, 2011</xref>: 199). It capitalized on what Sadighi was highly knowledgeable about: Iranian history and literary, intellectual and cultural heritage. The depth of this knowledge is evident in his publications, which are few but rich in detail and are crafted with utmost scholarly care, critical scrutiny, clarity and a sense of humility, evident in his richly detailed introduction to a Farsi translation of Aristotle’s <italic>The Constitution of Athenians</italic>, which is peppered with footnotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0268580913494913">Sadighi, 1963</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0268580913494913">Milani, 1998</xref>) as well as his posthumously published dissertation on medieval Iranian religious movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0268580913494913">Sadighi, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>This attention to detail went hand in hand with Sadighi’s reported commitment to positivism and the separation of facts from values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0268580913494913">Ashraf, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580913494913">Ashuri, 1993</xref>: 251; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0268580913494913">Mahdavi, 1996</xref>: 12), which is most evident in his purely descriptive, astonishingly factual and superbly detailed account of the 1953 coup, in which he himself was a principal victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0268580913494913">Milani, 1998</xref>: 576; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0268580913494913">Sadighi, 1996</xref>). Sadighi promoted this positivism in teaching and used it as a criterion for selecting instructors as well. He was intolerant of those who brought their ideology to the classroom, which included the enigmatic and popular Marxist intellectual Hoseyn Aryanpur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0268580913494913">Nabavi, 2002</xref>: 137).</p>
<p>Sadighi did not consider himself qualified as a ‘sociology professor’, perhaps due to his lack of research and publishing records in contemporary social issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580913494913">Ashuri, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0268580913494913">Sadighi, 1964</xref>: 254). However, his adherence to the French school of sociological positivism complemented and gave a boost to Naraghi’s vision and mission of promoting applied, positivistic sociological research. One of his public statements in defence of applied and empirical sociological research was delivered as the chair of the session on youth in the Seminar on the Social Problems in the City of Tehran (1962): ‘The problem of the youth is the most important and, in some respects, the most harrowing problem facing the country’s researchers and administrators. … If we are to adopt a research-based approach to social issues, if we are to engage in scientific debate and research, and if we are to think that time is over for nonsense and simplifications in social issues, it is necessary to investigate the problem of youth in detail and to focus on the social factors causing it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0268580913494913">Sadighi, 1964</xref>: 325).</p>
<p>Sadighi is a pioneer but his work did not lead to the creation of a lasting tradition of teaching and research, beyond his support for positivism and applied research. His course in ‘societals’ had much promise but was never built upon by his students in any systematic way, perhaps due in part to the Institute’s overwhelming emphasis on applied and empirical research, which Sadighi himself fully supported. Nonetheless, he gave academic and political credibility to Naraghi’s plans, and his presence helped attract a generation of politically oriented students, such as Ahmad Ashraf, seeking an avenue of critique through academic research.</p>
<p>The second figure, Naraghi, was born in a family that straddled tradition and modernization. His paternal grandfather and great-grandfather were well-known clergymen and religious scholars. His mother was a pioneer in modern, European-style education for women. This family history created in Naraghi the life-long desire to find a balance between preserving Iran’s cultural character and adopting western achievements. His pragmatic father sent the young Ehsan abroad to distance him from the overly politicized atmosphere of Iranian universities in the 1940s and 1950s, which was dominated by the left (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913494913">Naraghi and Ayati, 2000</xref>: 10–13). Naraghi’s initial stay in Geneva cured him of his leftist allegiance to the Tudeh Party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913494913">Naraghi and Ayati, 2000</xref>: 17). It also turned him into an accidental sociologist as his originally chosen mentor in mathematical economics died unexpectedly. He took a compulsory sociology course with Jean Piaget and, having witnessed political turmoil in Iran, became attracted to Piaget’s pedagogical strategy of presenting the two opposing poles on any issue, only to offer them and defend the middle ground in conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913494913">Naraghi and Ayati, 2000</xref>: 14).</p>
<p>Two fateful moments took place in the early 1950s, when Naraghi came back to Iran to conduct field research for his PhD dissertation. He was invited to teach a few sessions on modern, postwar sociology in Sadighi’s social theory class, and was in turn recommended for a post in the General Statistics Office, which was part of Sadighi’s portfolio as interior minister. Second, his trip coincided with the turbulent aftermath of the Oil Nationalization Movement, in which Mosaddeq’s National Front, the Tudeh Party and the clerical establishment all participated and, ultimately, all failed, as the American-led coup of 1953 exposed and exploited the divisions among the national leaders. Sadighi was sent to prison and Naraghi lost his job in the Statistics Office.</p>
<p>According to his own narrative, disillusioned by party politics and frustrated by the lack of objective sociopolitical knowledge among the national leaders, Naraghi began thinking about creating a centre for applied research ‘to bring politics and scientific knowledge together and promote systematic thinking and enquiry in the political process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913494913">Naraghi and Ayati, 2000</xref>: 26). To learn the ropes, he abandoned his dissertation plans to study ‘currents of thought in nineteenth century Iran’ under Piaget and became an intern at the French <italic>Institut national d’études démographiques</italic> directed by Alfred Sauvy. While Piaget had little to offer on Third World issues, Sauvy had coined the ‘Third World’. Here, Naraghi ‘fell in love with statistics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913494913">Naraghi and Ayati, 2000</xref>: 39) and chose as his new dissertation topic ‘The study of population in countries with incomplete statistics: A methodological contribution’ (1956).</p>
<p>Thus emerged Naraghi as a staunch positivist. He returned to Iran and established the Institute on the model of Sauvy’s <italic>Institut</italic> as a place to promote the cool-headed study of social facts as an antidote to the ‘emotionalism’ that had entrapped national leaders during the Oil Nationalization Movement. He promoted statistics as the method <italic>par excellence</italic> for sociology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0268580913494913">Naraghi, 2007</xref>: 351) and departed from the traditional pedagogy of memorization in favour of learning through fieldwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913494913">Naraghi and Ayati, 2000</xref>: 131). Invoking attitudes prevalent in some European countries in the grips of state building and social reorganization in the nineteenth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0268580913494913">Patriarca, 1996</xref>: 24), Naraghi saw statistics not merely as an objective method of collecting factual data, but also as ‘an important and useful mental exercise for us Iranians so that we can avoid treating social issues based on empty slogans and personal opinion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913494913">Naraghi and Ayati, 2000</xref>: 134). Statistics was, in addition, a useful tool for a restrained and calculated fight against new imperialism: it was a western method but it was a significant weapon for fighting back against western domination.</p>
<p>To Naraghi, the main mission of the social sciences in Iran was to be in the service of development and to identify social problems arising from the rapid pace of development. In an essay on the aims and methods of the social sciences, he states that demography, anthropology and social research in general had to go beyond academic goals and ‘bring about change in people’s living conditions’ by ‘facilitat[ing] decision making for governmental organizations regarding the affairs of rural and nomadic peoples’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0268580913494913">Naraghi, 1969</xref>: 264–277; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0268580913494913">Naraghi, 1968</xref>: 6). His conclusion regarding the role of the social scientist in a developing country is quite telling of the direction and tone he set for social scientists in Iran: ‘rather than creating original works, … his task is to offer practical recommendations that facilitate social change. Therefore the social scientists should focus more on applied, rather than theoretical, social issues and seek the root causes of these issues in the social fabric of the society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0268580913494913">Naraghi, 1969</xref>: 291–292). He acknowledges that this view will draw protests from those who are worried about ‘scientific objectivity’, but asks ‘in the final analysis, is application of research, which will bring science out of its mere observer role, not a precondition for its objectivity?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0268580913494913">Naraghi, 1969</xref>: 292). A look at the library collection of the Institute shows hundreds of research reports that addressed the scarcity of first-hand material about Iran but rarely went beyond descriptive accounts. Five decades later, Iranian sociology is still in search of both theory and objectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0268580913494913">Bayatrizi, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Aside from his commitment to positivism and applied research, Naraghi was also an opportunist and had incredible networking skills. Being an engaging conversationalist, he built ties and used them. He had friends from the SAVAK, to the prime minister and the National Broadcasting Corporation. He was also an advisor to the Empress Farah. He used these ties to get grants, but he also shaped or presented social research to fit bureaucratic and technocratic expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913494913">Naraghi and Ayati, 2000</xref>: 139). Among the most useful contacts was Prime Minister Amir-Abbas Hoveyda, who was friends with Naraghi going back to Geneva, and who directed engineering firms with large development contracts to hire the Institute as a consultant (Gholam-Abbas Tavassoli, personal communication, 2011). This turned the Institute into a de facto consulting agency, rather than an academic institution committed to setting its own agenda and to the rigorous and independent pursuit of knowledge. This entrepreneurial spirit was internalized by some Institute researchers and future sociologists who founded their own private research firms (Gholam-Abbas Tavassoli, personal communication, 2011). To this day, sociologists actively seek private, paid contracts from government agencies to the extent that it overshadows independent academic research and publishing, becoming a lucrative business for a select number of ‘elite’ and well-connected researchers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0268580913494913">Bayatrizi, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet it was not Naraghi’s personality or preferences that account for the applied and contract-oriented nature of sociological research in this period. On the contrary, the lack of support for basic research along with the censorship of critical thinking created an environment in which applied and contractual research became the primary avenue of professional sociological research. Naraghi’s positivism, pragmatism and networking skills merely resonated with this political field. Arguably, the first victim of this situation was Naraghi’s own potential, vision and legacy. As a young scholar he had shown much promise. He was invited by Georges Gurvitch to publish an essay in <italic>Cahiers internationaux de sociologie</italic>, critically assessing the relevance of the Marxist notion of ‘class’ in Iran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0268580913494913">Naraghi, 1957</xref>), an article that caught the attention of Henri Lefebrve, who later stayed at the Institute for a short period. His innovative dissertation on Third World demography was published as a textbook with an introduction by the noted statistician Jean Stoetzel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0268580913494913">Naraghi, 1960</xref>). Upon returning to Iran, Naraghi wrote several books trying to defend Iranian cultural and historical identity under siege by western culture and technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0268580913494913">Naraghi, 1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0268580913494913">1977</xref>). But leafing through the reports of the Institute it is hard to see any traces of his theoretical insight or influence. Research was routinized in the form of descriptive and hastily done reports, surveys and policy evaluations, snuffing any potential for the creation of a strong indigenous tradition in sociology, a goal he continued to cherish.</p>
<p>By the early 1970s Naraghi had left for a UNESCO post in Paris and Sadighi had retired. But politics almost brought them back together again. Having ignored expert advice for many years, the Shah finally turned to Naraghi during the national uprising leading up to the 1979 Revolution. During one of their several meetings, which are chronicled in Naraghi’s <italic>From Palace to Prison</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0268580913494913">1993</xref>), Naraghi suggested Sadighi as the only credible candidate for the post of prime minister who could lead the country out of turmoil. This led to an unsuccessful meeting between the Shah and his former prisoner, during which Sadighi set preconditions which the Shah ultimately rejected. A few short months later, the Shah was deposed and Naraghi earned two years in detention after the Revolution on accusations of being a former regime insider.</p>

<title>Research, teaching and legacy</title>
<p>Naraghi often portrays himself as a one-man hero who created academic sociology in Iran. But the nature of the effort was collective from the very beginning. Among the founders are Firuz Towfiq, Shapur Rasekh and Jamshid Behnam, who focused on advancing substantive and empirical research in demography, family, and urban and rural sociology, telecommunications, etc., and helped shape the still evolving curriculum by bringing a new Anglo-American perspective to balance the theoretical dominance of the French traditions of Comte and Durkheim that had already been introduced by Sadighi and Mahdavi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0268580913494913">Izadi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580913494913">Rasekh, 2011</xref>: 22). Ahmad Ashraf founded the <italic>Nâmeh-ye Olum-e Ejtemâ’i</italic>, the first social science journal in Iran, which was published by the Institute and for which Naraghi often claims credit. He went on to publish influential and widely read critical books and essays, including <italic>Historical Impediments to the Growth of Capitalism in Iran</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0268580913494913">1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0268580913494913">1970</xref>) and the highly successful book <italic>The Sociology of Social Classes in America</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0268580913494913">1967</xref>). Jalal Al-e Ahmad’s brother, Shams, also argues that Jalal worked behind the scenes to create room and garner support for the young Naraghi’s ambitious and innovative plans in the old and conservative institution that was the University of Tehran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0268580913494913">Tabarra’iyan, 2009</xref>: 103).</p>
<p>By 1977, the Institute had 300 part- and full-time researchers and had published 263 books. It had research groups in the areas of demography, urban sociology, rural sociology, tribal sociology, social psychology and social stratification, some of which were helped set up by foreign researchers, most importantly, anthropologist Pierre Bessaignet, and sociologist Paul Vieille, who came to Iran funded by the UNESCO or the French government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0268580913494913">Izadi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913494913">Naraghi and Ayati, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>A society in rapid transition, due to rural land reforms, industrialization, modernization and unfettered urban migration, Iran was a laboratory of social change. It was also largely understudied. Attention was immediately directed to urban issues, the impact of rural reforms and the history and the fate of the nomads. As one of its first undertakings, the Institute, in collaboration with the UNESCO, conducted a seminar on ‘Social Change and Development in Iran’ (1959), followed by another major seminar three years later on the ‘Social Problems of Tehran’ (1962). The political economy of Tehran, which was driven by land speculation, as well as anomie and social disintegration were major concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0268580913494913">Naraghi, 1964</xref>: 11). The Institute carried out the first studies of its kind on the social and economic topography of Tehran and other industrializing cities, and promoted the idea of master plans for urban development in major cities. Urban sociology became its largest section under the guidance of Paul Vieille, with Iran’s future president, Abolhasan Banisadr, as one of his assistants. The Institute became the de facto source of applied research and data gathering on urban issues, often responding to urgent problems arising from new policy initiatives with no time for theory formation and synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913494913">Naraghi and Ayati, 2000</xref>: 156, 217–218).</p>
<p>Later on, with land reforms, rural sociology became the Institute’s bread and butter. In 1963, the board of the OPB passed a motion to delegate to the Institute the task of conducting research into the social and economic state of rural areas. The Institute carried out research evaluating land reform, rural cooperatives and agricultural financing. These studies sounded the alarm bells about the adverse outcomes of land reforms, such as the disintegration of decision-making structures in rural areas. But they failed to garner the attention of political authorities who rammed through with the reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0268580913494913">Izadi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913494913">Naraghi and Ayati, 2000</xref>: 190–193). Neither did they succeed in creating a strong tradition of rural sociology, beyond descriptive case studies and basic policy evaluation.</p>
<p>In contrast to rural reforms and urban planning, demography was perhaps the least contentious and most successful area of investigation in the Institute. It emerged in a time of profound change involving migration, population boom and a wholesale restructuring of labour and family. Demographic research primarily focused on analysing census data, improving census techniques and correcting misreporting. It led to the creation of a rather successful demography group, which presented itself as a source of objective and neutral data on ideologically hot debates. For instance, in the words of one of the early major figures in demography, census data supplemented with case studies were a much more fruitful avenue of research about the changing structures of family than ‘theoretical and general discussions comparing Iranian family with Islamic and western types, which has become popular in recent years’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0268580913494913">Behnam, 1977</xref>: 19).</p>
<p>Like demographers, early anthropologists also set out to collect and synthesize as much raw empirical data as quickly as possible on the fast-changing indigenous structures, especially the threatened way of life among the nomads. Here too, modernization plans led to funding for studying the past and the present. Access to remote areas was not easy to obtain and researchers had to seize upon any opportunity for field trips. In the early 1960s, two water projects in the north provided opportunities for anthropological studies of local nomads who were destined for forced settlement. These studies, focusing on the historical, social, kinship, economic and education aspects of nomadic life in the north of the country were carried out by Pierre Bessaignet, a former student of Marcel Mauss, then on a UNESCO-sponsored stay in Iran. In south-central areas, an uprising by the Boyer Ahmadi tribes in the early 1960s, which was eventually quashed, gave new impetus to settling the nomads and brining the ‘new civilization’ to them. It also led to a new project for the Institute, which sent a team of researchers in spite of concerns over the wisdom of settling and ‘modernizing’ the nomads (Ashraf, personal communication 2011). In any case, the anthropology section brought to light the plight of the nomadic people of Iran, who had not even been counted in the first census of 1956 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0268580913494913">Izadi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913494913">Naraghi and Ayati, 2000</xref>: 397–402).</p>

<sec id="section5-0268580913494913">
<title>Conclusion: Critique is dead, long live critique</title>
<p>In 1972, the Institute lost its autonomy and became part of the newly founded Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Tehran. It also lost its research space to classrooms and energy was increasingly diverted to teaching and administration of the new Faculty. During presentations on the oral history of the Institute held in spring 2011 at the current location of the Institute, Naraghi, Gholam-Abbas Tavassoli and Taghi Âzâdarmaki, each of whom acted as the Institute’s director at different points in its history, offered diverging views on its decline. While Naraghi and Tavassoli place the blame on the creation of the Faculty of Social Sciences, Âzâdarmaki believes that the Institute self-destructed because it failed to create a strong tradition in research and teaching, never going beyond purely descriptive, empirical and applied research. When the Institute was created, it was the only one of its kind. But soon research centres mushroomed in government organizations and the private sector. With nothing to distinguish it from its competitors in terms of quality or approach, the Institute became just another research centre competing for an increasingly shrinking share of the funding pie.</p>
<p>In addition, Naraghi’s vision of influencing policy through objective, empirical research faced immovable hurdles. The OPB, a main source of contracts for social research, was rendered ineffective as the political discipline it was trying to implement conflicted with the autocratic mentality of the Shah (Ashraf, personal communication, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913494913">Naraghi and Ayati, 2000</xref>: 140–141). The Institute itself was also ill-equipped for the task at hand. In 1965, Naraghi used his connections with Prime Minister Hoveyda to commission a large-scale study aimed to forecast the 20-year developmental outlook of Iran, modelled on the ‘1985 Horizon’ in France. They gained a grant of about 200,000,000 Rials, which was quite large at the time, but failed to deliver any results beyond an analysis of the current situation (Tavassoli, personal communication, 2011). Naraghi attributes his departure for a post at UNESCO (1969) to the failure of this project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0268580913494913">Naraghi, 1977</xref>: 179; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0268580913494913">Naraghi and Ayati, 2000</xref>: 183).</p>
<p>The Institute’s legacy is mixed. On the one hand, it provided a framework for research and teaching in the social sciences and a supportive environment for those interested in critical thinking about social issues. On the other hand, the Institute’s research projects themselves were not the primary avenue of independent critical expression. The Institute created a certain tradition in research that is distinct from strictly academic standards and traditions. Looking at the list of research projects and reports accomplished at the Institute and reading about the hopes and ambitions of its founders, it appears that the Institute functioned more as a consultancy firm (with an additional focus on teaching in the early years) than as an academic research institute. The political and economic circumstances within which the Institute operated imposed a pragmatic and entrepreneurial spirit among its founders and first generations that still dominates today among ‘research-oriented’ sociologists who clamour for private contracts with government agencies. This situation mirrors more recent developments in post-Soviet Central Asian sociology where social research has not developed organically but is founded, funded and supported from the outside (both the institutional ‘outside’ and the geographical and cultural ‘outside’) for expressly instrumental purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580913494913">Amsler, 2008</xref>). In effect, while the majority of sociologists remain critical on social and political issues, they struggle to preserve their critical voice in the absence of professional autonomy and security.</p>
<p>The ideological struggles of post-1979 Revolution solidified the image of sociology in Iran as an applied research enterprise. During the period known as the Cultural Revolution (1980–1984) sociology came under scrutiny due to apprehension about its role in promoting western outlooks on human nature and society. In an attempt to allay concerns and save sociology, former Institute researcher and its future director, Gholam-Abbas Tavassoli, convinced religious and revolutionary critics that sociology is for research into social issues (as, implicitly, opposed to social theorizing, which carried the baggage of western ideology) (Tavassoli, personal communication, 2011). Eventually, sociology was put back on the educational calendar but under the name ‘social research’. Even now, undergraduate sociology courses are taught in the social research programme.</p>
<p>Yet critical sociology has existed and stayed alive in Iran. In fact, many students who studied at the Institute went on to produce critical sociology outside of it. Ashraf argues that a fair assessment of the achievements of sociology in Iran and its relationship to power must take into account the fact that critical sociology in Iran was not generated within the academy, but rather in non-academic venues. For instance, in the 1960s, one of the most important venues for publishing critical sociology was the <italic>Jâhân-e Now</italic> magazine, where Ashraf and Dariush Ashuri published critiques of the Shah’s regime disguised as sociological studies of the state in general. Eventually, <italic>Jâhân-e Now</italic> was shut down and Ashraf and Ashuri banned from writing. After the 1979 Revolution, non-academic magazines, such as <italic>Kiân and Âdineh</italic>, continued to function as venues for critical sociological writing. These journals were often shut down too only to be replaced by others. The latest are <italic>Mehr Nâmeh</italic> and <italic>Andishe-ye Puya</italic>, both of which have an extensively sociological content, although the dominant angle of critique is no longer leftist but liberal. How these publications voice sociopolitical critique disguised as technical debates is itself worthy of a separate paper. Among independent sociologists in Iran, Ali Shari’ati has had the most impact, ideologically and theoretically. His hybrid of spiritual and Marxist theorizing regarding society, history and political struggle became an influential part of the ideological mosaic of the 1979 Revolution. It also attracted many people to sociology, including many of my own former professors at the University of Tehran in the 1990s. More recently a group of neo-Shariatists have reopened theoretical sociological discussions regarding religion and modernity in Tehran, which is one of the more promising lines of enquiry to emerge in Iranian sociology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0268580913494913">5</xref></sup></p>

Although the Institute’s mandate included the social sciences in general, I am primarily focusing on sociology here for two reasons: my own interest is the origins and development of sociology in Iran; and the main founders and major early figures of the Institute (including the aforementioned three figures) were sociologists.</p>

<p>In his account of the origins of his book on the history of Mashhad seminary, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580913494913">Khamenei (1985</xref>: 1) states that he undertook the project on the request of an unnamed individual acting on behalf of a senior researcher in the ‘Institute of Social Sciences at the University of Tehran’. Khamenei then states that he abandoned the project due to concerns over the political and religious leanings of that senior researcher. The institute in question is quite likely the Institute for Social Studies and Research and the senior researcher in question might have been Shapur Rasekh who was carrying out a project on religion in Iran at the time (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0268580913494913">Rasekh, 2011</xref>: 22). I would like to thank the current director of the Institute, Dr Zia Hashemi, for informing me about this source.</p>

<p>Ashraf argues that rumours about Naraghi’s cooperation with the SAVAK were intentionally spread by elements of the SAVAK in Europe on orders from the Shah in an attempt to discredit Naraghi (personal communication, 2011).</p>
