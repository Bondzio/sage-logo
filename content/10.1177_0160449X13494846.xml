<abstract>
<p>Since the 1990s African trade unions have discussed and in part embarked on mobilization in the informal economy. Reports, however, rarely relate present unionists’ attitudes towards informal workers, on the one hand, to the history of their labor movement on the other. In this study ethnographic interviews with high-ranking Tanzanian labor leaders and their development partners are evaluated against aims and obstacles unions in other African countries see for engagement in the informal economy and against the specific Tanzanian union history. This approach reveals how in the case of Tanzania structural and historical problems (the latter mainly survivals from <italic>Ujamaa</italic> socialism) reinforce each other. As a result, labor leaders experience difficulties in addressing economic developments such as the informalization of work and in returning to more inclusive concepts of unions prevalent in the pre-independence era.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2004 Tanzania’s federation of trade unions recommended that it “should organize all workers in the informal sector” and elevate their inclusion to the “the top of the agenda” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160449X13494846">Trade Union Congress of Tanzania [TUCTA] 2004</xref>, 78). The announcement formed the starting point for this study of how high-ranking Tanzanian labor leaders and their development partners have assessed the unions’ new task and put it into practice. Generally the topic made for easy conversations with unionists, but when it came to carrying out interviews, many respondents directed me to others, claiming they would know more about how informal workers had been approached. I ended up having more data about respondents’ attitudes towards the topic than about their concrete activities.</p>
<p>Based on ethnographic interviews, this article discusses the importance Tanzanian labor leaders and their development partners attach to the mobilization of informal workers and the challenges they foresee or experience in doing so. The empirical data are evaluated against the history of the Tanzanian labor movement as well as publications about other African countries. This approach makes it possible to analyze the interplay between constraints that might be seen as being (by tendency) structural to union-informal economy relations and specific to the Tanzanian situation. The article draws attention to two research gaps: first, scholars have rarely included a historical perspective in their investigations of African unions’ attitudes towards informal workers, and second, the last two decades have produced a number of reports about union activities in the informal economy, but little is known about Tanzania.</p>
<p>The next section evaluates African trade unions’ present-day aims in engaging with informal workers and the obstacles they encounter when cooperating with them. Section three sketches the history of the Tanzanian labor movement in relation to the informal economy and the achievements of various organizations in reducing precariousness. After having introduced the research methodology (section four), I present respondents’ accounts of outreach to the informal economy and the objectives and challenges they connect to this endeavor. The final discussion provides insights into how the Tanzanian labor movement deals with its political legacies in the liberalized era. I argue that the incomplete and highly contested transformation of unions from being part of the socialist one-party apparatus to free associations contributes to their reluctance in organizing the informal economy. On top of that, more inclusive concepts of “worker” and “union” prevalent in the pre-independence period have been consigned to oblivion and thus make it difficult to revisit abandoned ground.</p>

<title>African Trade Unions and the Challenge of Venturing into the Informal Economy</title>
<p>Since the 1970s scholars have increasingly discussed the less regulated part of the economy as the “informal sector” (in recent years de-emphasizing the sectors’ separateness by using the term “informal economy”). The heterogeneity of work, enterprises and employment relations in this category has produced conflicting definitions of informality. One broad definition conceives the following actors as informal: employers in small, unregistered enterprises; own account workers; unpaid family workers; members of informal producers’ cooperatives; informal employees; casual laborers and home workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160449X13494846">Chen 2008</xref>, 19-20). Three major theoretical approaches have addressed the question of how the informal and formal sectors relate to each other. The earliest school—the dualists—discerns two completely distinct sectors, the informal one being a result of slow economic growth, consequently resulting in a lack of formal employment opportunities. In a more positive vein, legalists view informal economic activities as a rational reaction to over-regulation by the government and as a seedbed for entrepreneurs. Finally, structuralists criticize the ongoing informalization as an economic restructuring process that enables powerful capitalists in the formal economy to maximize profits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0160449X13494846">Meagher 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160449X13494846">Chen, Jhabvala, and Lund 2001</xref>; for a critical evaluation in respect of Tanzania, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160449X13494846">Rizzo 2011</xref>). Scholars in the structuralist tradition have welcomed interventions and mobilization efforts in the informal economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160449X13494846">Gallin 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160449X13494846">Chen, Jhabvala, and Lund 2001</xref>). Apart from the government, civil society organizations have emerged as players in this field—sometimes competing, sometimes cooperating with each other. This article focuses on the question of what unions seek to attain by approaching workers outside their conventional recruitment pool. The following paragraphs discuss the aims and challenges of union engagement in the informal economy, concentrating on Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>The literature consulted for this article suggests five partly overlapping or mutually reinforcing reasons for African unions to engage in the informal economy. These are: 1. to survive in the face of dwindling membership, 2. to stem processes of informalization of work following neo-liberal globalization, 3. to defend informal workers’ labor rights in general, 4. to direct education at all workers (including entrepreneurs in the informal economy) and 5. to achieve gender representation. With regard to the first aim, the economic liberalization of the past decades has impacted upon the bargaining power of unions. This becomes most visible in decreasing membership numbers. For instance, in the 1990s the membership base of Ghana’s Trade Union Congress dwindled by 26%. This was a result of structural adjustment programs and forced the labor movement to find new followers outside the formal economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160449X13494846">Britwum, Ghartey, and Agbesinyale 2006</xref>, 7). Similar developments are reported from other African countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160449X13494846">Horn 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160449X13494846">Mwilima 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160449X13494846">Heidenreich 2007</xref>; on a contrary development in South Africa, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160449X13494846">Goldman 2003</xref>). But survival is not the only reason why unions want to stem informalization. They also do so in order to fulfill their role as watchdogs against economic developments that put workers at a disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160449X13494846">Horn 2002</xref>). For instance, the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions adopted a strategy paper in 2004 demanding that the government and formal private sector be more active in employment promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160449X13494846">Heidenreich 2007</xref>, 5-6). The effects of new waves of informalization are often facilitated by a general resistance against national labor laws and international labor standards in the informal economy. Unions in Ghana or Zimbabwe have therefore seen the need to defend informal workers’ labor rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160449X13494846">Britwum, Ghartey, and Agbesinyale 2006</xref>, 8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160449X13494846">Mwilima 2006</xref>, 64). This involves providing legal training to those employed under precarious conditions. However, unions’ educational traditions reach beyond this. Unions can “make significant contributions to raising skill levels and to building workers’ capacities as economic and political actors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160449X13494846">Croucher 2007</xref>, 211). Looking at Zambia again, the Congress of Trade Unions offers business management courses not only to former members but also to female micro-entrepreneurs who have never had any connection with the labor movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160449X13494846">Heidenreich 2007</xref>, 18-19). Finally, unions embark on recruitment in the informal economy to correct their gender imbalance. Often, women are under-represented as ordinary members as well as in leadership positions. In a gender policy ratified in 2000, the Congress of South African Trade Unions committed itself to making a “shift in mindset, organizing style and approach” in order to reach out to more informal women workers (COSATU 2000, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160449X13494846">Goldman 2003</xref>, 37).</p>
<p>Looking at these aims, one should not lose sight of the role other actors play in leading the labor movement into this field. Since the mid-1990s the International Labour Organization (ILO) has insisted that trade unions pay more attention to the informal economy and organize it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160449X13494846">Britwum, Ghartey, and Agbesinyale 2006</xref>, 7). Several ILO programs were drafted to assist unions in this endeavor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160449X13494846">Bangasser 2000</xref>, 24). Development agencies and political foundations (such as the German GTZ and Friedrich Ebert Foundation) have provided funding and consultancy for unions’ informal economy activities. It remains to be examined elsewhere to what extent unions themselves have developed the idea of organizing the “unorganized” and to what extent it was suggested or imposed on them from outside.</p>
<p>Leaving the question of ownership aside, the last two decades have shown increased union efforts to reach out to the informal economy. This has brought to light challenges in the cooperation between unions and informal actors that can be categorized as being of four kinds: 1. obstacles resulting from union structures and conditions, 2. obstacles inherent in the informal economy, 3. challenges emerging in the communication and cooperation of both parties, and finally 4. challenges produced by the legal, political and economic environment. In respect of the first category, not a few unions lack the necessary human and financial resources to launch recruitment in the informal economy. The irony is that “individual unions either have the resources derived from a stable core membership to organise in the informal sector, in which case they see no need, or see the need but lack resources” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160449X13494846">Croucher 2007</xref>, 212). Where efforts are made, new membership contributions are often neither immediate nor high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160449X13494846">Mwilima 2006</xref>, 61), making this activity a long-term investment that has to be defended against existing members’ needs. As a result, some unions stick to their traditional mission—unionization in the formal economy—especially when it is not yet sufficiently accomplished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160449X13494846">Horn 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160449X13494846">Heidenreich 2007</xref>, 27). This self-confinement is further enhanced by union constitutions that usually do not provide for the inclusion of informal workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160449X13494846">Horn 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160449X13494846">Britwum, Ghartey, and Agbesinyale 2006</xref>, 8). Finally, a potential obstacle is labor leaders’ lack of willingness (or lack of ability) to embark on the internal restructuring necessary to cater to a larger diversity of members. Since the informal economy is in its majority female, eliminating patriarchal structures would constitute part of this restructuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160449X13494846">Horn 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Turning to obstacles inherent in the informal economy, gender relations again constitute one challenge. Work in this sector is frequently embedded in social values and networks that are patriarchal and undemocratic. Employers and employees may come from the same tightly knit community (sometimes even family) with hierarchies that are not easily reconciled with equal rights approaches. A further obstacle to organizing is the absence, ambiguity or multiplicity of employment relations. What “form of labour relations and the basis for organization exists in an enterprise unit that combines family labour, permanent waged employees, non-waged employees (apprentices) and casual employees” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160449X13494846">Britwum, Ghartey, and Agbesinyale 2006</xref>, 108)? Where is the opposition between employer and employee if both are welded together through family or community networks? Organizing has to consider these questions and the diversity of activities pursued in mobile, multiple and often individualized workplaces. Additional obstacles are low awareness of the advantages of getting organized and the constant struggle for survival. For many informal actors this translates into not having, or not being willing to put aside, time for collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160449X13494846">Bonner and Spooner 2011</xref>, 90; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160449X13494846">Britwum, Ghartey, and Agbesinyale 2006</xref>, 115).</p>
<p>Challenges in the relationship between unions and informal economy actors (and their organizations) are often conceptual. From both perspectives the definition of “worker” may be vague, unions not knowing whom to target as new members and informal economy associations having different concepts of whom they represent (workers versus nascent entrepreneurs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160449X13494846">Webster 2006</xref>, 33-34). Moreover, many labor leaders have not yet developed a strong concept of their role outside the formal economy—a weakness that partly stems from an insufficient understanding of conditions in the informal economy and their relation to national and global processes. In spite of this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160449X13494846">Horn (2002)</xref> sees a tendency among unionists to want to speak on behalf of informal workers, treating them as inferior (since they often possess lower levels of formal education). On the part of the informal workers, a low knowledge of unions’ goals may result in ambivalence towards their organizing efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160449X13494846">Mwilima 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160449X13494846">Britwum, Ghartey, and Agbesinyale 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160449X13494846">Lindell (2008)</xref> describes mutual suspicions:
<disp-quote>
<p>Trade unionists often fear that if they allow informal workers to be part of their trade union, these will “take over” the leadership of the union. Leaders of organizations of informal workers sometimes wonder about the real motives behind the interest that some trade unions display in informal workers. … They refer to the danger of being “utilized” for the ends of trade unions without getting much in return. (p. 227)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Not in all cases are suspicions based on meager knowledge of each other. Sometimes they grow out of the opposite, namely previous experience of union membership, particularly in the case of retrenchees. Where unions have not defended their members well in the past, or take a weak position in the present, joining them does not appear attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160449X13494846">Goldman 2003</xref>, 39; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160449X13494846">Mwilima 2006</xref>, vii). Job competition and different income levels and needs further aggravate the relationship between formal and informal workers. Formal workers may see the informal economy as a pool of jobseekers and thus as a threat to their job security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160449X13494846">Skinner 2006</xref>, 11). Some regard organizing informal workers as a “drain on union resources” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160449X13494846">Bonner and Spooner 2011</xref>, 92), or even as a danger, since the new comrades’ needs may be overwhelming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160449X13494846">Britwum, Ghartey, and Agbesinyale 2006</xref>, 123).</p>
<p>The legal, political and economic environment creates unbalanced relationships, too. Unions have a legally recognized basis for negotiation, while informal workers and their associations are often treated as illegal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160449X13494846">Lindell 2008</xref>, 225-227). Some scholars have viewed legal recognition as a major advantage the labor movement should make use of to support informal workers’ rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0160449X13494846">Mitter 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160449X13494846">Lindell 2008</xref>). Challenges imposed by political and economic processes on the national and global scale probably need no further discussion. They are the chorus that runs through the topic: structural adjustment, informalization of work, and free market economy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160449X13494846">Gallin (2001</xref>, 535) reads them as “a strategy for eliminating the trade union movement” and as deliberately producing obstacles for organizing the informal economy.</p>
<p>Having evaluated the aims of different African unions with regard to mobilizing informal workers, and the challenges they encounter, it remains to consider how the strategies and attitudes developed by the unions relate to their specific history. For South Africa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160449X13494846">Goldman (2003</xref>, 36) refers to historical knowledge of organizing in the context of precarious employment but does not elaborate. Most studies have their starting point in the 1990s. This concentration on the liberalized era, I argue, shields us from insights into the long-term processes in which unions shape their directions and approaches. In the following sketch of the Tanzanian labor movement’s history, I therefore include a colonial period that saw the unionization of what we call informal workers today. Furthermore, post-independence attitudes towards informality need consideration, as they resulted in massive socialist efforts to organize from above. This sketch is preparatory to presenting and analyzing my data in sections five and six.</p>

<title>The Tanzanian Labor Movement and the Organization of Informal Workers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160449X13494846">1</xref></sup></title>
<p>The informal urban economy in Tanzania was at least partly a result of tax introduction in the colonial period. A growing number of villagers in need of cash to pay their taxes migrated to urban centers and produced surplus labor that the formal economy of colonial cities could not absorb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160449X13494846">Lugalla 1997</xref>, 427-29). Therefore, the urban population developed a variety of informal economy activities, some supplementing insufficient pay, some being sole income earning strategies. Workers—on both temporary and permanent contracts—began to organize in the late 1920s. At that time alliances between formal and informal workers were feasible and in part successful. This section starts with a brief depiction of two of these alliances. With the institutionalization of the labor movement (in the mid-1950s) and the shift to socialism (following independence in 1961), solidarity among formal and informal workers crumbled. For the subsequent liberalized era (starting in the mid-1980s), I present evidence of informal economy associations in order to give an idea of the field present unions intend to venture into.</p>
<p>In 1939 domestic workers—who according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160449X13494846">Chen, Jhabvala, and Lund (2001</xref>, 7) are classified as informal—founded the first African trade union in Tanganyika (as opposed to pre-existing unions of the African-Asian minority). Within a few years the African Cooks, Washermen, and House Servants Association not only managed to open 12 branches in up-country towns but also drafted rules demanding “considerable solidarity” from their members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160449X13494846">Iliffe 1979a</xref>, 397).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0160449X13494846">2</xref></sup> Although domestic workers constituted Dar es Salaam’s most numerous occupational group, they were the most difficult to mobilize since they worked in spatial separation. This (among other things) led to the union’s deregistration only ten years after its establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160449X13494846">Iliffe 1979b</xref>, 291). When Tanganyika’s first federation of trade unions, the Tanganyika Federation of Labour (TFL), came into being in 1955, domestic and hotel workers formed a new joint union. This alliance between unequal partners—scattered domestic workers with lower wages and concentrated hotel workers with higher wages—“gave a distinctive edge” to the association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160449X13494846">Bujra 2000</xref>, 159). A strike in 1956 revealed the degree to which formal and informal workers supported each other. The union demanded the reinstatement of retrenched employees of one hotel (the initial trigger of the action) and simultaneously higher wages for domestic labor. Although the strike was not immediately successful and many participants were victimized, other unions’ sympathy strikes, as well as TFL’s threat to launch a general strike, induced the government to introduce a legal minimum wage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160449X13494846">Bujra 2000</xref>, 160-61). In the years leading up to independence and thereafter, the Hotel and Domestic Workers Union retreated into passivity.</p>
<p>The second example of solidarity between formal and informal employees is documented in Iliffe’s “A History of the Dockworkers in Dar es Salaam” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160449X13494846">1970</xref>). In the 1930s port companies had three types of dock employees: permanent, registered casual and unregistered casual workers (the latter to be reckoned as informal). Employers had begun to register a number of casuals for preferential employment in order to raise labor skills. Nevertheless, workers were divided and permanently threatened by the unemployed in front of the harbor gates. Dockers’ solidarity built up slowly in the course of three strikes. In 1939 only the casuals (registered and unregistered) struck, demanding better pay and some of the permanent workers’ benefits. The complete failure of the strike “was clearly due principally to the refusal of the permanent workers to join them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160449X13494846">Iliffe 1970</xref>, 127). A second strike (1943) was caused by the effect of wartime inflation on incomes. For the first time all dockers acted as one group. The government employed wartime regulations to arrest strikers. Workers gained little but learned that “an effective strike required unity between permanent and casual workers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160449X13494846">Iliffe 1970</xref>, 131). The third docker strike (1947)—again a result of diminishing wages—turned into a nationwide general strike. Dockworkers kept up solidarity and achieved substantial pay increases for both permanent and casual employees. Moreover, a government award recommended the transformation of irregular casual into regular employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160449X13494846">Iliffe 1970</xref>, 133). However, the first dockworkers’ union that was formed immediately after the strike broke down again in the early 1950s. With its reformation under the Tanzania Federation of Labour, matters took another direction. The port was modernized, now requiring more skilled than unskilled labor. Companies reduced the pool of casuals through conversion of irregular into permanent employment and through retrenchments. The dockworkers’ union opposed decasualization, one of the main reasons being that a large number of casuals provided more dues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160449X13494846">Iliffe 1970</xref>, 141). Union income gained priority over the improvement of contract conditions. For a couple of years union popularity and membership fell.</p>
<p>In the early stages of the Tanzanian labor movement—as these examples show—certain groups of informal workers (such as casuals or domestic workers) were organized within unions and were most successful when able to join hands with members in permanent employment. Concepts of “worker” and “union” were more inclusive than in the following decades. However, there is no evidence that other informal actors, such as employers of small, unregistered businesses, or unpaid family workers, got attached to the labor movement. It is also unclear whether formal and informal workers in less closely related areas of work (than outlined above) could have joined together for collective action.</p>
<p>After independence in 1961, legal restrictions on rural-urban migration were lifted, and more of the growing urban population engaged in informal economy activities. This development ended only a few years later, when through the Arusha Declaration (1967) the state seized control over the economy. Nationalization turned the government into the biggest employer. All major economic activities—in towns as well as villages—were supposed to take place in cooperatives or state-owned companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160449X13494846">Lugalla 1997</xref>, 432). While Tanzania’s independent cooperative movement had been the largest in Africa in 1968, it lost its vitality and credibility after seizure by the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160449X13494846">Maghimbi 2010</xref>, 2-6). Informal actors disappeared from the official political agenda and from unions’ concept of membership. By 1964 the government had incorporated the labor movement into the one-party system. Upon employment all workers automatically became union members and had their dues deducted from their wages. Exceptions were (for instance) domestic workers, whose employment was difficult to keep track of. Employers as well as workers often shunned the registration process, the latter because they could not see how a co-opted union could assist them in their daily labor struggles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160449X13494846">Bujra 2000</xref>, 167). Bujra describes the relations between the union and domestic workers after the establishment of JUWATA, the sole trade union after 1978, as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>Domestic workers now faced exploitation as atomised workers in a context of extreme economic hardship and state repression of any voices of protest or oppositional groupings. In this context workers “forgot” their history of collective action. … Few thought of combining against employers and they did not see JUWATA as a friend of such action. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160449X13494846">Bujra 2000</xref>, 166)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Changes came in 1985. In the face of a severe economic crisis the Tanzanian government turned away from socialism. Declining real wages forced many workers to take up additional income-generating activities in the “new” informal economy. They were joined by those retrenched as a result of privatization and public employment reduction exercises. The government kept up its unfriendly attitude towards informality—combining deregulation in some areas with regulation in others. In the 1980s and 1990s it enacted several laws that were used to harass supposedly “idle” informal workers or even deport them to rural areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160449X13494846">Lugalla 1997</xref>, 444). In spite of this, the informal urban economy grew. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160449X13494846">Lugalla (1997)</xref> sees it as consisting of the chronic poor (who were poor even before the economic crisis), the new poor (who slipped below the poverty line after the crisis) and wealthy entrepreneurs (often employees in the formal economy) who use the informal sector’s lack of regulation to accumulate profit. “The informal sector is now an arena of competition, exploitation, and struggle between the desperate ‘chronic poor’ and the others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160449X13494846">Lugalla 1997</xref>, 442). But struggle is only one side of the coin. There is evidence of solidarity among informal workers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160449X13494846">Lwoga (1995)</xref> visited 14 locations in Dar es Salaam at which traders, craftsmen, artists and other informal actors cluster together and found that they had established 12 cooperatives for various work-related issues, such as the installation of water, electricity and toilets or the purchase of land and the erection of buildings. With support from the ILO, another five groups initiated their own health scheme in 1996, the often-cited UMASIDA project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160449X13494846">Kiwara 1999</xref>), which in recent years dissolved due to various organizational problems. The biggest and probably most successful group in the informal economy is VIBINDO, founded in 1995 as the umbrella organization of petty traders. Initially representing 19 organizations, its base has grown to over 300 organizations with more than 30,000 members pursuing various informal activities, not always trade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0160449X13494846">Policy Forum 2012</xref>). Besides capacity building and advocacy, VIBINDO offers a micro-insurance health scheme to its members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0160449X13494846">McIntyre et al. 2008</xref>, 24) and is currently establishing a bank (Tanzania Machinga Bank Limited) to provide start-up capital to petty traders. However, micro politics within associations may be fraught with tensions, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160449X13494846">Rizzo (2011)</xref> shows for a group of commuter bus workers in Dar es Salaam. By reorganizing their work, members created a welfare fund and additional income. But “from the outset there existed a structural imbalance between members’ needs for support and the association’s capacity to provide it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160449X13494846">Rizzo 2011</xref>, 1196). There is competition over resources and petty exploitation among members. Solidarity among the poor has its limits. After six years the organization broke up for reasons not easy to determine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160449X13494846">Rizzo 2011</xref>, 1199-1200). This study suggests there is a need to study the internal and external factors affecting the sustainability (or fall) of various types of informal actors’ associations. For Tanzania, one external threat prevails, namely government actions. Since 2006 petty traders have been evicted from the city centers and public spaces of all major Tanzanian towns—an ongoing operation that is in part violent.</p>
<p>What happened to trade unions in the liberalized era? With the introduction of multi-party democracy, the unions gained independence in 1991. Since then, they have been swinging between continued control by the government and efforts to establish themselves as autonomous civil society organizations. In 2000, after several organizational dissolutions and re-registrations, the present federation, TUCTA, was founded with 14 sectoral unions affiliated to it. Membership is now voluntary instead of forced, as under socialism, and has been subject to diverging developments in the labor market: in some areas, casualization has taken place, such as in the plantation sector, where in the period between 1994 and 2001, 50% of the permanent workers were turned into temporary employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160449X13494846">Chambua 2004</xref>, 13-14). Retrenchments in private and government institutions have left some unions with fewer members than before. Others, especially in the fields of education and health (where a mushrooming of private companies is taking place), have managed to attract a considerable number of new members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160449X13494846">Chambua 2004</xref>, 10-11).</p>
<p>In 2004 TUCTA recommended that informal workers be included in unions, “especially women who not only face poor working conditions but also comprise a big percentage of the labour force in this sector” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160449X13494846">TUCTA 2004</xref>, 78). Further or more specific aims are not given. How far have unions gone to make inclusion happen? The best-documented project, SYNDICoop, was initiated by the ILO, the International Cooperative Alliance, and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and funded by the Dutch government. Launched in 2002 with a timeframe of four years, it focused on informal workers in Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania and Kenya. In Tanzania, TUCTA and the Tanzania Federation of Cooperatives, the successor of the former socialist Cooperative Union, implemented the project. Its immediate aims were to strengthen union and cooperative capacity to organize in the informal economy, to improve informal actors’ working and living conditions and to reduce poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160449X13494846">ILO 2008</xref>, 24). SYNDICoop Tanzania trained ten union and cooperative organizers, conducted sensitization campaigns and contributed to the establishment of seven cooperatives in Dar es Salaam with a total of 649 members, more than half of them women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160449X13494846">ILO 2004</xref>, 61-64). From 2009 to 2010 the project was revived (under the label of COOP<sup>AFRICA</sup>). It aimed at the formation of 20 saving and credit cooperatives for 2000 informal economy workers in the Northwestern Lake Zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160449X13494846">ILO 2009</xref>). This project was an externally stimulated attempt to venture into the informal economy and should not be read as representing a general spirit of change among unionists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160449X13494846">Jason’s (2004)</xref> research among informal construction workers in Dar es Salaam reveals the respective union’s reluctance to welcome members with irregular incomes and changing employers. In an enquiry carried out among labor officials, McQuinn was told that “many union leaders look too much to the past and find it hard to keep up to date with emerging realities of importance to the movement, such as the growth of the informal sector” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160449X13494846">2009</xref>, 9). Persistence in attitudes formed in the past is also conceded by the final independent evaluation report of SYNDICoop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160449X13494846">ILO 2005</xref>, 6). In its examination of union–informal economy relations, this paper therefore includes effects of historical developments that are still evident today.</p>

<title>Research Methodology</title>
<p>Research for this article was conducted between December 2007 and February 2009. It consisted of interviews with nine union leaders on the national level and on the level of one region (the Lake Zone comprising Mwanza, Mara, Shinyanga and Kagera). Snowball sampling established access to respondents. All interviewees were in leading positions either in the federation TUCTA or in the sectoral unions Tanzania Union of Industrial and Commercial Workers (TUICO); Conservation, Hotels, Domestic and Allied Workers’ Union (CHODAWU) and Communication and Transport Workers’ Union of Tanzania (COTWU). My interest in union activities in the informal sector guided this selection. TUICO, CHODAWU and COTWU have a reputation for being especially engaged in this field. I interviewed, apart from labor officials, three experts from international development organizations. Through training, funding and staff they have supported the unions over the past few years. Their assessment of the labor movement—made from a detached but informed position—helped to clarify important aspects. The small number of respondents in this group is due to the fact that only a few international organizations continuously support the unions and maintain representatives in Tanzania. I asked all respondents (unionists and experts) to talk about the transformation of unions and efforts to organize the informal sector. Questions were open ended (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160449X13494846">Spradley 1979</xref> on ethnographic interviews). All interviews (except for two with experts) were conducted in Swahili. They capture the views of a selected group of labor officials in a period of transformation.</p>

<title>Presentation of Findings</title>
<p>This section presents data with respect to 1. unions’ activities in the informal economy, 2. aims of engaging with informal workers and 3. obstacles in doing so. The length of these three subsections is determined to a great extent by the willingness of the respondents to elaborate on each topic. In general, interviewees talked least about activities and dwelled most on the problems they encountered. This interview behavior might be a clue to how far unions have put TUCTA’s recommendation of 2004 into practice.</p>
<sec id="section6-0160449X13494846">
<title>Union Activities in the Informal Economy</title>
<p>Kariakoo Market in Dar es Salaam is an area that TUICO targets with its activities. The employees of the market authority have been TUICO members for some time, but especially micro-traders lack organization and “one voice,” a respondent explains. Therefore, TUICO assisted food vendors to establish 13 groups according to merchandise, each with a leader and a management of all groups above. This apex now represents members’ demands vis-à-vis local authorities and mediates in conflicts over tax payments and the use of market space. Moreover, TUICO trained the new members in bookkeeping and occupational health and safety. Similar training was given to female batik producers and hairdressers in other parts of the town. In Tanzania’s Lake Zone (Mwanza) TUICO advises a self-founded group of informal workers on labor rights and has enabled some of them to sign formal contracts with their employers. One development partner and a top unionist praise TUICO for its successful efforts to stop informalization in supermarkets of the South African Shoprite chain in Dar es Salaam. “A worker is employed today as Mary, and if she wants to continue her employment after three months, she has to change her name.” Shoprite avoids making contributions to the National Social Security Fund, narrates the expert. TUICO even goes into Export Processing Zones; “it has tried to transform itself,” the respondent continues. However, the limits of transformation become visible by looking at the organizational structure: TUICO’s conventional target groups are served through specific departments. Informal workers are (still) subsumed under the department of “Service and Consultancies.”</p>
<p>Apart from TUICO, CHODAWU and COTWU have a reputation for being active in the informal economy. CHODAWU broadcasts radio spots on labor rights that have convinced some informal workers to become members. In Dar es Salaam CHODAWU attempted to incorporate more domestic workers. Furthermore, it studied the working and living conditions of female operators of roadside cook shops and supported them in organizing saving and credit cooperatives. CHODAWU’s biggest concern in the informal economy has been the elimination of child labor. This project is funded by DANIDA, Denmark’s development agency, and the ILO and includes sensitization campaigns in schools and discussions with parents. Finally, COTWU approached taxi and lorry drivers as well as commuter bus workers. It offered legal training and HIV/AIDS counseling especially for lorry drivers (for instance, at the Tanzanian-Zambian border).</p>
<p>Most of the respondents’ accounts could not be supported by documents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0160449X13494846">3</xref></sup> Asked for numbers and written material, one TUICO leader told me: “We do not make this public. … We do not print brochures to work with them in the informal sector. Organizing the informal sector is through face-to-face interaction.” Besides choosing a face-to-face approach, unions are not good at documenting what they are doing, one development partner remarks. Therefore, the planning, range and effectiveness of the activities mentioned cannot be assessed. How do the external experts evaluate the unions’ efforts? “They concern themselves a little bit with the informal sector and take action on a small scale,” one of them says. Another development partner adds: “I would say, it’s a few steps, it is not very well organized, it’s you are doing a little here and here and then a little there. And I don’t think you can say there is an overall plan on how to include the informal sector.” The absence of an overall plan is criticized by labor leaders themselves. TUCTA recommended the recruitment of informal workers without appropriately clarifying how and why. The following subsection thus presents reasons individual respondents see for their engagement in the informal economy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0160449X13494846">
<title>Aims of Engaging with Informal Workers</title>
<p>In the evaluation of the respondents’ accounts, two types of aims emerged: first, aims that grow out of discussions within the unions and, second, aims that arise from exchanges with other organizations. With regard to the first type, many unionists mention falling membership numbers as their main motivation for recruiting beyond the conventional pool. “We had almost 92,000 members. But in the 1990s the wave of retrenchments hit us. Now we have 35,000 members. We felt, where are we going now?” one TUICO leader recounts. This process stirred up new ideas: “If we insist on reaching ordinary people only, I mean workers, there will be a time when we won’t have members any longer.” Respondents associate Tanzania’s privatization exercise (after 1990) with casualization, outsourcing and the introduction of new technology—resulting in a mass movement of workers to the informal economy. Retrenchees were therefore identified as the first group beyond the “normal” groups to be targeted by unions. Labor leaders began to negotiate the meaning of the word <italic>mfanyakazi</italic> (worker), a respondent says. The liberalization of the economy went hand in hand with the political liberalization of trade unions. The Trade Unions Act of 1998 detached unions from the <italic>Chama cha Mapinduzi</italic>, the former socialist single party. While the unions had previously enjoyed the security of a government-granted budget, they now depended on their own income (mainly fees). Moreover, privileged access to members was lost since the unions had to switch from involuntary to voluntary membership. After having elaborated on these changes, a TUCTA representative states that they have caused financial pressure within the organization and led to the realization that “we need to work hard to satisfy our members.” It is exactly these points that made unionists see that a department for the informal sector was needed, comments an expert.</p>
<p>Apart from organizational survival, labor leaders refer to two intrinsic motivations for including informal workers. One of them is the insight that strikes could be more effective if backed up by “common people.” Strikers can too easily be replaced from among the large number of job seekers. “Without getting … support from these people, … we can’t reach our goal, so they are our interest,” says one respondent. But not only are “common people” meant to strengthen labor power; they should also alleviate the formal workers’ tax burden. Income tax reduction has been one of the priorities of Tanzanian unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160449X13494846">Fischer 2011</xref>, 129-30). The skills development levy—a 6% payroll deduction partly used to finance public vocational training—adds to the conflict between government, employers and labor officials.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0160449X13494846">4</xref></sup> “Definitely, if you only charge the worker and leave the others, the government cannot collect enough taxes. … Only some take the responsibility for the country …, while the majority remains without any responsibilities,” one respondent argues. In his eyes, unions should aim at formalization of employment and thus inclusion of more citizens in tax payment.</p>
<p>Looking at the second type of aims, those that arise from exchanges with other organizations, the ILO’s influence cannot be overlooked. Following a decision in 2002, the labor organization has been determined to eradicate the informal sector—a position that has impacted on Tanzanian unions over the years, a development partner says. Although none of the union respondents mentioned the ILO-TUCTA collaboration in the SYNDICoop project, they acknowledge the guiding role the labor organization plays. One official sees the unions as obliged to follow ILO policies, one of them being to serve workers of all kinds. Another respondent is grateful for the ILO’s “pressure from outside” to make sure unions reach out to the informal economy. Both interviewees emphasize that ILO guidelines match the unions’ own initiatives in respect of reorientation. A development expert takes a more critical stance. The informal sector, he says, is a typical “ILO end of the year topic,” when money is left over and union participants receive attractive per diems at seminars—thus being blocked for other duties with higher priority. For him the ILO prematurely forces the topic on unions at a stage where the formal economy is not yet sufficiently organized.</p>
<p>Less controversial (and stimulating) was the question how unions can achieve the aim of organizing the precariously employed. Only a few labor leaders identified services unions could offer to potential members from the informal economy. The most detailed answer was given by a TUICO official who describes the union’s new role as that of supporting workers in different phases of their working life (employment, entrepreneurship or unemployment), offering loans and training depending on members’ changing needs. Other respondents see the unions as a mouthpiece informal actors could use to communicate with government authorities. Furthermore, the unions could more broadly support informal workers in establishing their own organizations so that they can participate in tenders or run saving and credit cooperatives. Finally, a top official emphasizes the importance of including the informal sector in social security coverage—“a very big challenge,” he winds up. The following subsection focuses on challenges respondents foresee and their experience in engaging with informal workers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0160449X13494846">
<title>Obstacles</title>
<p>This subsection follows the categories established for obstacles in section two. I present, firstly, obstacles respondents perceive as inherent in the informal economy, secondly, challenges seen as emerging in the communication between unions and informal actors, thirdly, obstacles resulting from union structures and conditions, and fourthly, challenges that are produced by the legal, political and economic environment. A major challenge inherent in the informal economy is workers’ poverty, which generates efforts to maximize working time and profit. If you explain to someone that he is self-employed but still belongs to the workers, he feels you are wasting his time, a TUICO leader notes. “He says if I sit down with you for two or three hours, I don’t know how much money I would have already earned.” Sometimes informal workers consult unions when their labor problems cannot be solved. This delay in realizing unions’ potential is described as stemming not only from low levels of education but also from a specific concept of the employment relation. Some informal workers consider employment as an act of care and not as a contractual relationship. As a result, they reckon employers to be right at all times and unions to be aiming at undermining charity, a COTWU official remarks. Another respondent draws attention to further obstacles when summarizing a study of female operators of roadside cook shops: “They are scattered … they have no licence for business … and they are women. They do not dare to stand up.” The atomization of workers, the illegality of some of their activities and the general gender imbalance in society are seen as hindering organization.</p>
<p>Turning to challenges in the communication between unions and informal actors, the labor movement’s role in the socialist era overshadows current relations. “In the past many were more than aware of the fact that unions were not defending. And this is true because many decisions were taken by the political party,” a TUICO representative says. He explains that this inactivity creates bitterness, especially in retrenchees who were forced to pay union dues for many years but then felt inadequately fought for in the retrenchment exercises following economic liberalization. Even if they find new formal employment, they do not want to hear anything about unions, another official adds. Informal workers who have never been attached to the labor movement constitute a different case. Their low knowledge of what unions are for corresponds to a vague understanding on the labor officials’ side of working conditions in the informal economy. One way to attract informal actors as members is to visit them, discern their problems and assist them in problem solving, one respondent proposes. An expert doubts that the latter can be done easily: “What they need—those people in the informal sector—they need to know something about business, they need to know how they can get loans, how they can administrate these kinds of things. And that is not what the unions are experts in.” This statement applies to some informal actors only (mainly small-scale entrepreneurs), though additional confusion in determining needs and opportunities is caused by an inadequate understanding of “informal.” One TUICO leader narrates that formal employees from two registered non-governmental organizations joined his union and were categorized as informal workers. A TUCTA representative declares a large hospital his union is targeting for recruitment as informal since it is owned by a religious institution and not the government. Notions of governmental and formal are opposed to non-governmental and informal, probably an ideological remnant from socialist times. Communication between labor officials and informal actors is thus fraught with disillusionment with the unions’ past role, ignorance or confusion about how labor and the informal economy could relate and a third (not yet mentioned) aspect: competition. When TUICO approached informal traders in their new complex in Dar es Salaam (Machinga Building), the unionists soon sensed that they were not wanted. They had entered the ground of VIBINDO, Tanzania’s largest umbrella organization of petty traders. A TUICO respondent explains: “I assume it was because of the fees. They are afraid that the union could take their members and contributions.” How well unions could fare in the light of such competition depends (among other things) on their capacity for organizational change. The following paragraph therefore discusses obstacles resulting from union structures and conditions.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental challenges mentioned by respondents is the lack of policies regulating labor’s venture into the informal economy. A CHODAWU leader declares: “There is no CHODAWU policy saying that we should go into the informal sector. There are no regulations for these activities in the constitutions of the trade unions. There is no common policy of the trade unions for this sector.” The absence of directives and concerted action is seen as causing two types of confusion in respect of responsibilities: First, within single unions it is not clear who should be in charge of informal economy activities. Should these activities be subsumed under existing departments (as done in TUICO at the time of the study)? Or should each union establish a department specifically dedicated to these activities? Second, it remains vague which union should be responsible for which area of the informal economy. After liberalization, unions received the right to recruit workers irrespective of their occupations. This enhances competition not only for formal but also for informal workers. Policies are needed so that “we do not steal from each other,” a respondent concludes. Some unionists claim that the lack of internal re-organization is aggravated by financial constraints. “We cannot afford to employ more staff. We need to invest more than we get in return,” an official states. To cover at least some of their expenses, unions need to set and collect informal workers’ membership dues. A TUICO leader considers this need as being unsatisfactorily fulfilled. His union charges informal economy members 2% of the sectoral minimum wage set by the government. But the government’s repeated increase of minimum wages does not automatically correspond with higher income for informal workers. The respondent therefore speaks of discussions about how fair contributions can be achieved. At the same time TUICO is confronted with requests from members who have formed informal workers’ cooperatives. One request was for a loan so that the group could upgrade their technical equipment. Being financially weak, the union turned to various banks asking if it could serve as guarantor for the cooperative’s loan. The union could not meet the banks’ conditions. “Unions are not there to give loans,” the respondent says. While some unionists ponder how to restructure their organizations to include more informal workers, others show general reservations towards this exercise. A leader of the federation clings to formal employees as the priority target group: “We have unionized one third of the work force. … Two thirds have not yet joined the unions. This is the problem.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0160449X13494846">5</xref></sup> An expert agrees and calls current informal sector activities “premature”: unions should first increase their membership in the formal economy (and thus their financial position). TUCTA’s recommendation of 2004 is in part contested from within the labor movement.</p>
<p>Turning to the fourth category, namely challenges deriving from the legal, economic and political environment, one has to distinguish between Tanzania’s new legal and political situation and economic changes related to global capitalism. Interestingly, the latter were usually not perceived as immediate challenges so much as those stemming from the unions’ past entanglement with the socialist party. Some respondents claim that officials are still so much caught up in old habits that they are unable to identify and address economic questions. On this matter an expert details:
<disp-quote>
<p>They have neglected the informal sector for a long time. It was the organizational habit of when someone gets employment, dues will automatically be paid to the respective union. Now, to follow people in the informal sector, to be able to talk to them, to know how to convince them to become members, few have started to acquire these skills now.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Apart from this, another union “tradition” has not yet completely lost its impact. In the socialist era, informal workers were regarded as not eligible to receive union support. Although obliged to do so by law, the unions did not care for workers at the bottom, a labor leader says. When workers such as shoeshine boys approached unions they were told to solve their labor problems with local party representatives (such as ten cell leaders). The focus was on parastatals only. Other respondents mention a third aspect that hinders unionists from venturing into the informal economy: TUCTA operates with too few and insufficiently educated employees. This has financial and historical reasons: “In the past unions did not select people who were very well educated.” Ideological adherence counted more than critical thinking. This has consequences to this day, an expert criticizes: new areas of union activity are not clearly defined, researched and addressed. Instead of being proactive, unions wait to be invited to important national decision-making processes. Another development partner says about “labour people”: “Of course, there is a fundamental change because you have a capitalist system now. … It is not a fundamental change in the way that the mentality of people has changed to the new system.” Whether to reach out to or (temporarily) ignore informal workers is one of many controversies in the labor movement’s transformation. Internal struggles between new and old generation leaders affect the unions’ ability to focus on urgent economic topics (such as informalization). Existing room to fight economic inequality is not appropriated. In the words of an expert: “We need to have the old generation out before we can get full compliance with the new situation.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>How do the aims and obstacles Tanzanian respondents see for their engagement in the informal sector compare to those summarized for other African unions? Similar to their colleagues elsewhere, Tanzanian labor leaders view survival in the face of dwindling membership as a core reason for recruitment in the informal economy. In this study, however, the organizational self-interest of employed representatives was supplemented by members’ self-interest in reducing the tax burden and the appeal to include informal workers to decrease the threat they pose to members’ job security. More altruistic reasons received less attention in the interviews. TUICO was praised for its attempts at stemming informalization (at Shoprite or in Export Processing Zones)—but obviously because they constitute exceptions. Although some of the sectoral unions’ activities aim at defending informal workers’ labor rights or providing education for all workers, they must be seen as sporadic efforts that lack formulation and strategy. The objective of achieving gender representation—part of the official TUCTA recommendation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160449X13494846">TUCTA 2004</xref>: 78)—was not referred to by respondents. Do some unionists welcome ILO’s initiative merely for inward-looking reasons?</p>
<p>A glance at the obstacles allows the picture to emerge more clearly. Many of the challenges discussed in publications about other African countries (such as informal actors’ atomization at work, the lack of union policies for the informal economy or the unaccomplished organization of formal workers) resemble those outlined by Tanzanian respondents. However, in this study obstacles resulting from the unions’ history play a more pronounced role, especially in two of the four categories: communication between unionists and informal actors and the relation to the social, political and economic environment. Starting with the former, communication between unionists and informal actors is fraught with experiences and conceptions acquired in the socialist past such as an inadequate definition of informal, unionists’ low recruitment skills and some officials’ doubts as to the eligibility of informal workers for inclusion. These survivals as well as the fact that unions still operate with few and inadequately trained employees explain some of the labor representatives’ inertia towards organizing in the informal economy. Looking at the second category, the question whether one should stick to attitudes and processes of long standing or transform them creates conflicts between new and old generation leaders and hinders a proactive attitude towards the environment. Although Tanzania’s political liberalization and its new labor law have removed certain obstacles (such as direct ideological control or restrictions on strikes), the unions do not exhaust their new room for maneuvering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160449X13494846">Fischer 2011</xref>). At present, broader labor-related issues do not constitute targets for the Tanzanian labor movement (at least not in a planned manner), since it is still too much absorbed by its own process of detachment from (or continuous attachment to) the government. Strategic discussions about venturing into the informal economy (and matters of global capitalism and development in general) may become more significant when the internal transformation has further advanced.</p>
<p>Data acquired for this study, in combination with existing historical material, allow a reinterpretation of the history of the Tanzanian labor movement in relation to informal workers. In the pre-independence period (up to 1961) when labor organizations came into being they initially operated with concepts that included casuals and other informal employees such as domestic workers. Temporarily joining into the anti-colonial struggle, unions addressed labor issues on a broader base. With the institutionalization of the labor movement in 1955, inner organizational interests gradually acquired more weight. Taking Iliffe’s case of the dockworkers, their union prioritized maximization of dues over improving members’ contract conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160449X13494846">1970</xref>, 141). The incorporation of unions into the one-party system in 1964 turned them into exclusive organizations of government and parastatal employees (with the exception of employees from a few private companies). Informality in society was either negated or meant to be eliminated through massive organizing efforts from above. This was in accord with <italic>Ujamaa</italic> ideology, which declared war on economic exploitation and inequality on an international scale but nationally sought to revive “traditional” African values of social security and equality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0160449X13494846">6</xref></sup> On pre-colonial and <italic>Ujamaa</italic> socialism, Nyerere wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>For when a society is so organised that it cares about its individuals, then, provided he is willing to work, no individual within that society should worry about what will happen to him tomorrow if he does not hoard wealth today. … Nobody starved, either of food or of human dignity, because he lacked personal wealth; he could depend on the wealth possessed by the community of which he was a member. That was socialism. That <italic>is</italic> socialism. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160449X13494846">1968</xref>, 3-4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ideological tenets of this kind turned a blind eye on the precariousness and exploitation of certain groups (such as domestic workers) under socialism, as well as before it. At the same time, the negation of informality enhanced the status consciousness of formal workers and their unions. Shoeshine boys were “below” union responsibility. This consciousness lived on, even when many formal workers lost their financially privileged position in the 1980s and had to engage in additional income-earning activities (often in the informal economy). The fact that formal employment became less profitable, or that one needed to have multiple jobs (some of them informal), did not automatically entail a loss of status or increase in solidarity with less privileged workers. In the late 1990s I observed how workers in a factory still praised formality as a symbol of ideological integrity and social security promised by the state—a symbol that was at the same time questioned by the privatization exercise many considered involuntary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160449X13494846">Fischer 2003</xref>). This entanglement of ideology, status consciousness, formality and labor representation draws attention to potential obstacles to current union engagement in the informal sector none of the respondents mentioned. Since (to my knowledge) no research has been carried out concerning this point, I venture to formulate the following questions: How far do informal workers (still) associate unions with the former single party’s negation of informality, the status consciousness formal workers and unionists derived from it and the massive top-down efforts of the government to eradicate informality? Could the impression of adverse relationships be further enhanced by the fact that some formal employees (in private and government sectors) enter the informal economy as entrepreneurs and use informality to maximize profits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160449X13494846">Lugalla 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160449X13494846">Rizzo 2011</xref>)? Studies among informal workers are needed to see if they perceive formal workers 1. as claiming to be part of a higher status group and 2. as using their position to their own economic advantage (e.g., through privileged access to loans and the lack of labor regulation in the informal economy). If these assumptions can be verified, then labor organizations initiated by informal workers themselves will be far more effective in the near future than any union activities in this field.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>“Organising in the informal economy takes place where the traditional labour movement intersects with the broader civil society. It is therefore intimately linked with the issue of engaging with civil society and of forming broad alliances to advance a common agenda” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160449X13494846">Gallin 2001</xref>, 545-47). In this endeavor African trade unions experience similar structural problems. However, their attitudes, engagement, creativity and ability for change differ due to their specific history. In Tanzania, the transformation of unions from a corporatist to a liberal model could provide the opportunity to open up to civil society and to revive more inclusive concepts of workers and unions. A turn to social movement unionism would necessitate taking up core themes of <italic>Ujamaa</italic> again, such as global inequality and exploitation, but linking them to existing inequalities on the national scale. At this point structural problems and historical problems tend to reinforce each other. Past union structures were characterized by strong hierarchies, low education and irrevocable directives—features that limit flexibility and change to this day. The transformation of unions has to progress further before Tanzanian labor representatives can successfully revisit the informal economy as abandoned ground.</p>
