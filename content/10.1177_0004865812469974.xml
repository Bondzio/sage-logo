<p>Literatures on the regulation of conduct have tended to focus on the role of policing and the enforcement of criminal law. This paper instead emphasizes the importance of planning in shaping conduct, using the example of how planning shapes sexual conduct to demonstrate that planning can, in different times and places, exercise police-type powers. We illustrate this by analysing the regulation of brothels in Sydney and Parramatta, NSW, Australia, providing a case study of spaces of sexuality that historically were constructed and regulated as criminal, but have since become lawful. This paper examines the ways in which these transitions in law have been differently expressed and accomplished through local planning enforcement. In making such arguments, the paper emphasizes not only the potential for planners to act like police, but also the capacity of planning to supplant policing as a key technique of governmentality.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0004865812469974" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Policing has long been the subject of sustained criminological scrutiny, with increasing attention given to policing’s role in producing gender, age, class and ethnic norms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0004865812469974">Reiner, 2000</xref>). In this sense, critical criminology considers policing as an enforcer of social order as much as a mechanism for eradicating crime. However, with a few honourable exceptions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0004865812469974">Millie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0004865812469974">Room, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0004865812469974">Valverde and Cirak, 2003</xref>), there has been little criminological analysis of planning regulators, which on the surface is explicable given that planning is primarily concerned with the civil sphere, whilst criminology focuses on the criminal sphere. Yet given that critical and cultural criminology has broadened the traditional interests of criminology, extending notions of offending, offences and offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004865812469974">Anthony and Cunneen, 2008</xref>: 3), in this paper we argue for a focus on planning as a means of enforcing social and behavioural norms through the control of land use.</p>
<p>In this paper, we alight on planning as a technique of governance, albeit one that regulates people via the regulation of land use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004865812469974">Foucault, 1991</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0004865812469974">Philo, 1992</xref> on spatial governmentality). From its 19th-century origins, the ultimate aim of town and country planning was to order and regulate the use of land to secure the physical, economic and social efficiency, health and well-being of the population. Planning itself was an expression of the modern fantasy that society could control the worst aspects of industrialization and urbanization by identifying potential nuisances and segregating them from other land uses via the exercise of judgements about what properly belongs where (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865812469974">Blomley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0004865812469974">Sibley, 1995</xref>). This is an exercise of spatial governmentality which is ultimately about the production of particular bodies and identities, with planning underpinned by ideas of environmental determinism (or at the very least, possibilism), which suggests that the management of space has the capacity to affect behaviour. Planning after all was introduced at the bequest of reformers concerned with the moral and physical health of the populace, and based on an understanding that the imposition of spatial order was about much more than aesthetic improvement and civic beautification: it was also about a biopolitics through which the problems of the governed were diagnosed and ‘solved’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0004865812469974">Rose, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Planning is thus an appropriate subject of criminological analysis because of the complex intersection of planning and policing: in many senses, the powers of planners over land use represent an <italic>extension</italic> of police power, being justified in terms of the health, safety and well-being of citizens. For some planning theorists, this represents the ‘dark side’ of planning, given it inevitably involves an entanglement of reforming rationalities with practices of social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0004865812469974">Yiftachel,1998</xref>). Hence, and following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0004865812469974">Gill’s (2002)</xref> argument that policing should be viewed as part of a spectrum of enforcement, we insist that the policing and planning nexus is not solely a unidirectional expansion of policing and social control into the civil sphere: given this entanglement, the relationship of planning and policing is more complex than this, with planning retaining the capacity to change and challenge social norms at a local level through the exercise of situated discretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0004865812469974">Valverde, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In this paper we explore the intersections of planning and policing via the example of the regulation of sexuality. There are two central rationales for this. The first is that there is a tendency in much of the literature on the governance and regulation of sexuality to focus on the role of policing and the deployment of the criminal law as it pertains to sexual conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865812469974">Colter et al., 1996</xref>). In this paper we emphasize that planning can contribute to policing, take on a policing role, and augment policing powers as they pertain to sexual conduct. Second, by analysing the regulation of brothels in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, we provide a case study of spaces of sexual conduct that historically were constructed and regulated as criminal, but have since become lawful. Noting the different ways that these spaces have been regulated in two different municipalities (the City of Sydney and Parramatta), our paper argues that planners have the ability to shape the ‘conduct of conduct’ in markedly different ways, with the realms of planning and policing overlapping in significant ways to produce different regulatory landscapes at the urban level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0004865812469974"><title>Sexuality as object of regulation</title>
<p>This paper contributes to the understanding of both policing and planning as techniques of governance via an analysis of their ability to shape sexual conduct. Planning and policing are both viewed here as strategies for shaping the ‘conduct of conduct’, and hence implicated in the exercise of biopower that ultimately shapes the anatomo-politics of sex itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004865812469974">Foucault, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0004865812469974">1992</xref>). Here, both planning and policing must be viewed as working alongside other ‘regimes of practice’ – legal, medical, juridical, religious – which make sexuality visible and coherent, making clear ‘which… [sexualities] are virtuous and useful and… which will be penalised through governance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0004865812469974">Kerkin, 2004</xref>: 185). Since the 1970s, critical sexologists have argued that these practices have privileged a very small portion of human sexuality that is seen as sanctified, natural, safe, normal, healthy, mature, profitable, legal or politically correct, noting that in most cultures this is taken to be synonymous with heterosexual, coupled, monogamous relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865812469974">Foucault, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0004865812469974">Rubin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0004865812469974">Warner, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>As noted above, in contrast to policing, little has been said about planning’s role in shaping sexual conduct. However, if planning is conceived as a technique of governing conduct through a management of space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0004865812469974">Valverde, 2011</xref>), one can easily conceive of planning as creating and maintaining particular sexual norms within a given space or territory (see especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865812469974">Brown, 2009</xref>). These techniques are inevitably multi-scalar, linking the national apparatus of the state to local mappings and interventions via a politics which is not determined by the nation-state but allows for dispersed power. Hence, at the level of the urban, it is evident that planning and policing can operate in paradoxical ways that are empowering as much as repressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0004865812469974">Frisch, 2002</xref>). Indeed, the ways planning deploys governance over sexuality varies from attempts to eliminate particular sexualities from urban communities via forms of incarceration and/or exclusion (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0004865812469974">Hubbard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0004865812469974">Legg, 2008</xref>), through to assorted attempts to manage sexualities and sexual institutions through countless, often competing, local strategies of persuasion, inducement, management, incitement, motivation and encouragement which link the sexual conduct of individuals to the ‘rational’ use of land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865812469974">Brown, 2009</xref>). The ability of planning authorities to deploy these strategies depends on a complex assemblage of diverse mechanisms – zoning, development control, building regulation and so on – which allow the decisions and actions of individuals, groups, organizations and populations to be understood and regulated in relation to these tactics.</p>
<p>Over recent years scholarship has hence begun to explore how mechanisms such as zoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004865812469974">Anacker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0004865812469974">Frisch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0004865812469974">Hubbard, 2001</xref>), licensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0004865812469974">Hubbard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0004865812469974">Valverde and Cirak, 2003</xref>), preservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004865812469974">Forsyth, 2001</xref>) and public health regulation (Brown, 2008) are used to govern sexuality through the organization of city space. Here, an important focus has been the way that these procedures can combine to determine the placement of sex industry premises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865812469974">Crofts, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0004865812469974">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0004865812469974">Cusack and Prior, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0004865812469974">Hubbard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0004865812469974">Hubbard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0004865812469974">Papayanis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0004865812469974">Prior, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0004865812469974">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0004865812469974">Ryder, 2004</xref>). Such studies might at first glance have little in common with studies of the ways that policing seeks to control sexuality through the surveillance and punishment of those pursuing illegal practices: whilst police are concerned with people, planning is, in contrast, concerned with place or land-use. However, it is apparent that this distinction veils some key mutualities. For example, if planning defines a particular land use as illegal, this will have major implications for the way the people in it are subject to surveillance, as well as shaping the rights of police to enter those premises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0004865812469974">Prior, 2009</xref>). Conversely, if a practice is illegal in the eyes of the law, this tends to undermine its claim to occupy space legally, or have space allotted for it within the spatial imaginaries deployed by planners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0004865812469974">Prior and Crofts, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>For the purposes of this paper we are thus concerned with the intersections of, and differences between, planning and policing. Both planning and policing concern the ‘conduct of conduct’. Both attempt to impose order on the chaos of life, to classify and organize behaviour (or things), to organize the environment and eliminate danger through the exercise of particular techniques of governance. Yet there are obviously key differences. Policing, for instance, is concerned with unauthorized acts or omissions that violate the law and are therefore subject to criminal prosecution and criminal sanction. The police constitute a legitimized state apparatus that has the power to enforce the laws of the land by coercive methods if necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0004865812469974">Reiner, 1992b</xref>). Disorder accordingly has particular resonance for criminal law given it is a system of order, with crimes constituting breaches of that system. Crime and disorder are so closely intertwined that the terms are frequently conflated. Indeed, the lexicon of crime and disorder – violations, breaches, transgressions, offences – suggests that policing concerns the imposition of sanctions on those who breach that order. Thus it can be argued that the primary focus of the traditional policing role has been upon disorderly or criminal subjects, particularly individuals. From this perspective, the <italic>raison d’être</italic> of the police is the reduction of disorder or crime.</p>
<p>It can thus be suggested that whilst the role of police can be much wider, a conventional perception of the police role centres on crime fighting – that is, policing as <italic>reactive</italic> to perceived disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0004865812469974">McCulloch, 2008</xref>). In contrast, planning as it has traditionally been conceived is forward-looking, and reformist, seeking to manage land in accordance with a vision of the ideal city. The key assumption of planning is that it is possible and desirable to impose order in advance by suggesting where specific land uses and activities should occur. Thus, while policing can be regarded as primarily reactive and responsive to disorder, planning can be seen as proactive – communicating, organizing and regulating a <italic>vision</italic> of order by predicting possible disorders to come (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0004865812469974">Valverde, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>However, these broad summaries of the differences between policing and planning can – and have – been criticized. Modern police organizations perform many different functions that include enforcement roles in civil society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0004865812469974">Tomkins, 2004–2005</xref>). Police increasingly participate in civil society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0004865812469974">Waddington, 1999</xref>). Police are not solely reactive, but have become increasingly proactive, seeking to avoid disorder rather than simply react to its occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0004865812469974">Reiner, 2000</xref>), engaging in particular types of risk management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0004865812469974">Stenson and Sullivan, 2001</xref>). Far from reacting only to disorder, policing can be regarded as order maintenance, that is, controlling the streets, reproducing social order, controlling street economies, recreations and people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865812469974">Dixon, 1997</xref>). By the same token, we must also acknowledge that planning is not only forward looking, but takes a role in reactively regulating environments that do not conform to prescribed building codes or zoning requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865812469974">Blomley, 2010</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0004865812469974">Valverde (2011)</xref> has historicized and problematized contemporary conceptions of planning as primarily prospective, noting the relevance of nuisance as a <italic>reactive</italic> organizing logic underlying planning. Accordingly a reactive element is integral to planning. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0004865812469974">Foucault (1992)</xref> has written of the broad 18th- and early 19th-century conceptions of ‘police’ as a broad form of urban governance rather than one narrowly concerned with ‘crime’. Indeed, 18th- and 19th-century reformers such as Jeremy Bentham and Edwin Chadwick certainly envisaged ‘police’ as involved in a broad field of urban regulation – much of which overlapped with planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0004865812469974">Finnane, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0004865812469974">Pasquino, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0004865812469974">Wilson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Policing and planning are then both instrumental in the expression and maintenance of a prevailing order. As such, the enforcement of bourgeois morality and decency has been achieved through the police, via the management of the ‘dangerous’ and ‘disreputable’ poor who threatened the quality of life and economic advancement of the ‘respectable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0004865812469974">Finnane, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0004865812469974">Scraton, 1985</xref>). The same arguments can be made in the expression and organization of order by and through planning, albeit through a regulation of people through the management of land use. Yet policing is also inherently spatial, with the police seeking to regulate behaviour through forms of territorial control in which the city is reduced to a space of knowable places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0004865812469974">Herbert, 1997</xref>). Both planning and policing are hence implicated in the making of ‘moral geographies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0004865812469974">Philo, 1992</xref>) through the exercise of discretionary powers that determine what is permissible where – noting that this can only be established situationally.</p>
<p>Yet perhaps the most startling commonality between police and planning is the nature of the discretionary powers which they are able to deploy. For example, Chapter 8 of the Local Government Act 1993 (NSW) specifies the enforcement powers of local councils in 12 sections, including powers of entry (s. 191), inspections and investigations (s. 192), use of force (s. 194) and emergency entrance (s. 195). The intersection of policing powers and local government powers is highlighted by section 201 of the Australian Local Government Act 1993, which specifies that an application for a search warrant has to satisfy the Law Enforcement and Police Powers Act 2002. This highlights that land use control has been empowered by the legal concept of police power, with the institutional authority of planners to control people and their environments drawing part of its inspiration from the police power of the state.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0004865812469974"><title>The planning and policing of brothels</title>
<p>The legislation regulating paid sex in NSW has shifted away from the criminal sphere toward the planning sphere. While this transition is, as yet, incomplete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004865812469974">Crofts, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004865812469974">Crofts and Prior, 2011</xref>), the contemporary regulation of brothels provides a case study of subjects (that is sex-workers, clients, owners and brothels) that have transitioned from being criminal to potentially lawful at the symbolic level of legislative reform. Yet what is significant here is that the legal status of prostitution per se has not shifted – rather it is the legality of selling sex in different spaces. Since the Disorderly Houses Amendment Act 1995, sex industry premises have been permitted to operate as legitimate businesses. They are regulated by local councils under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0004865812469974">Crofts, 2006</xref>), with councils not permitted to ban sex industry premises from their local area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004865812469974">Department of Planning, 1996</xref>). This means that planners can exercise discretion within the law to determine the appropriateness of brothels in different locales, enforcing a veritable moral geography which determines where sex may be sold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0004865812469974">Hubbard, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of the legislative transition from the deployment of criminal law to environmental and land use law, it would be expected that the modes of enforcement would similarly shift from policing to planning. However, the relationship between planning and policing remains complex and cannot be easily characterized as having undergone this shift. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0004865812469974">Gill (2002)</xref> has persuasively argued that the range of possible enforcement responses by police and regulators will be influenced in part by where the business exists on an illegal/legal spectrum. We argue that whether or not a local council expresses a perception of a land-use as inherently legal or illegal is a key shaper of whether planning or policing enforcement regimes are applied. Here we are drawing upon the notion of a policing enforcement approach as primarily reactive, whilst a planning enforcement approach is primarily proactive: both approaches are available within the repertoire of powers accorded to local governments.</p>
<p>We consider case studies of the regulation of brothels in two local councils in New South Wales to demonstrate the central and discretionary role of planning in constituting roles for police, and to stress the overlap between these different ‘regimes of practice’. The first, Parramatta City Council, was selected because it is an example of an approach that regards brothels as inherently disorderly despite legislative reforms, thus encouraging the deployment of planning powers which are akin to police-type powers (being reactive and punitive). The second council, Sydney City, is examined because it is widely regarded as a best practice model in the regulation of sex services premises, proactively determining the appropriate location for sex premises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865812469974">Brothels Taskforce, 2001</xref>). We hence argue that Sydney City relies primarily on planning and a proactive imposition of order in its regulation of brothels.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0004865812469974"><title>Excluding brothels from Parramatta</title>
<p>Parramatta City Council is a largely suburban area to the west of Sydney. Despite the state-wide legalization of brothels, there is still a lingering perception of brothels in Parramatta as disorderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004865812469974">Crofts, 2007a</xref>) with the council stating in 2011 that brothels would be banned from the entire local government area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0004865812469974">Lim, 2011</xref>). Prior to this, the conception of brothels as disorderly was expressed in highly restrictive planning policies that made it very difficult to receive planning consent, further confirming the perception of disorder. For example, Parramatta restricted brothels to industrial and commercial zones, and imposed distance restrictions of 200 metres from ‘sensitive uses’, defined broadly to include ‘licensed premises being a hotel, public bar, nightclub or the like’ (Parramatta DCP 2009, 5.1, s.3). This meant that there were very few buildings in the Parramatta LGA that would be able to operate as brothels with council authorization. This restriction of brothels to industrial areas created security problems at night, when industrial zones tend to be particularly isolated, poorly serviced and with little or no public transport. In restricting brothels to these ‘dangerous’ zones, the Council then had a basis to claim they are unsafe and they should be refused (<italic>Huang v Parramatta City Council</italic>).</p>
<p>Parramatta has thus developed restrictive policies that are strictly applied, with most brothel applications for development (deemed) refused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0004865812469974"><italic>Boers v Parramatta City Council</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0004865812469974"><italic>Davis v Parramatta City Council</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0004865812469974"><italic>Huang v Parramatta City Council</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0004865812469974"><italic>Wei v Parramatta City Council</italic>, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0004865812469974">2010</xref>). This means that in order to achieve council authorization the brothel proprietor must invest time and money in an appeal to the Land and Environment Court (LEC). If a proprietor appeals, then the LEC tends to apply planning controls consistent with the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act. The focus of the court is on potential amenity impacts of a business, and morality is irrelevant. The LEC tends to require hard and fast evidence of detriment, and in the absence of this, will not apply overly restrictive policies. For example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0004865812469974"><italic>Davis v Parramatta City Council</italic> (2005)</xref> the LEC noted that the council had imposed parking requirements on a proposed brothel development, whilst a nearby restaurant had not needed to provide parking. It was accepted by the Court that like the restaurant customers, clients could use the nearby public transport, and also that brothel clients tend to park away from brothels. Accordingly, the LEC overturned the parking requirements and approved the brothel. However, the LEC has tended to accept zone restrictions to industrial areas, and in turn accepted council concerns about the safety of these locations for brothels. In these cases, the LEC has imposed strict security requirements, such as CCTV and security guards, that are very expensive for the operators to meet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0004865812469974"><italic>Huang v Parramatta City Council</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>These types of decisions by the LEC highlight that local councils do not have complete discretion within the law to determine how brothels are regulated. Nevertheless, in Parramatta it is very difficult, expensive and time consuming to receive development consent for a brothel. Moreover, the period of consent is only for two years, after which time the operator must apply again for authorization (Parramatta Development Control Plan, 2009, 4). This reduces the number of applicants and increases the likelihood of these types of premises operating without consent – confirming council assumptions of illegality. This regard of brothels as disorderly by Parramatta City Council in turn shapes their enforcement practices, rendering a policing response appropriate and necessary. Not only does Parramatta City Council actively pursue unauthorized or ‘illegal’ brothels, but once authorization for a brothel has been granted, the premises continue to be policed through the agents and powers of planning as though it is inherently disorderly. Parramatta City Council has adopted an enforcement approach to brothels in which local council powers at times equal or even exceed those of the police, at the same time that they augment police powers beyond the restrictions of the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>One of the difficulties in writing this paper has been establishing evidence of planners using police-like powers. This lack of evidence in itself contributes to our argument. Indeed, while there is a body of criminological literature criticizing the limited reporting of the exercise of police powers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0004865812469974">Dixon, 1999</xref>), police have increasingly been called to account and required to provide information about the treatment of suspects. In contrast, no such effort to require the reporting of the exercise of local government powers has been made in NSW. The lack of records, systems and protections imposed on planning demonstrates the need for critical analysis given the potential for planning powers to be exercised in arbitrary and discretionary ways that produce prejudicial outcomes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0004865812469974">Hubbard et al., 2009</xref>). In order to establish this policing approach to the regulation of brothels, we draw upon a range of sources including the Annual Reports of Parramatta City Council, anecdotal information from the Sex Workers Outreach Project (SWOP), and evidence presented to the LEC in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0004865812469974"><italic>Huang</italic> (2009)</xref> by the Strategic Crime and Corruption Officer of Parramatta City Council. <italic>Huang</italic> (2009) was an appeal by to the Land and Environment Court against a council refusal of development consent for a proposed brothel.</p>
<p>The Parramatta City Council Annual Reports<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0004865812469974">1</xref></sup> state the number of (recorded) brothel raids and closures. In 2007/2008, the council undertook ‘more than 50 inspections of brothels and massage parlours (both unauthorised and approved)’ (2007/2008: 101). In 2008/2009, 105 inspections took place (2008/2009: 99). In the 2008 quarterly review the council stated its aim to inspect all brothels on a six-monthly basis. There were 30 identified in the area, and 29 had been inspected, resulting in three closures (page 44 of 74). Anecdotally, there are indications that the inspections were more frequent: in court the Strategic Crime Officer claimed that ‘raids’ were fortnightly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0004865812469974"><italic>Huang v Parramatta City Council</italic>, 2009</xref>). Similarly, SWOP received anecdotal information that in 2009 two brothels were raided twice a month, whilst one brothel stated there had been three raids in two months.</p>
<p>These council inspections were facilitated by the Brothels Legislation Amendment Act 2007. This legislation expanded the powers of councils and the LEC to close ‘disorderly and unlawful brothels’. Under this legislation, councils and the LEC can order water, electricity and/or gas to be cut off to premises that have failed to comply with a closure order. Parramatta City Council states that it was the first council to receive a utilities order from the local court under this legislation, and notes that the more than 50 inspections of sex services premises resulted in four utilities orders being issued by Parramatta City Council (2007/2008: 101). The notion of brothels as inherently disorderly is confirmed by the Brothels Legislation Amendment Act 1995, which explicitly excludes development applications from the limited circumstances in which the LEC may grant adjournments to brothel owners, expressing the doubt that brothels would ever wish, or be able, to operate lawfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865812469974">Crofts, 2007b</xref>).</p>
<p>These legislative reforms not only demonstrate the perception of brothels as inherently unlawful, but also highlight a tendency to conflate ‘disorderly’ and ‘unlawful’ as one and the same. The legislation is based on the premise that even if brothels receive authorization by councils, that legitimacy is always contingent and suspect. In turn, the Council has demonstrated a tendency to subsume brothels into the category of ‘illegal’ or ‘unlawful’, whether authorized or not. For example, the Mayor promises inspections of ‘unlicensed and unsafe’ brothels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0004865812469974">Issa, 2008</xref>). As a consequence of this lexicon of criminality, a policing-type enforcement approach appears both appropriate and necessary, with the council adopting police-like strategies and powers. The difference is that whilst police powers are subject to restrictions, similar local council powers are relatively unrestricted. The power of local councils is demonstrated by the frequent ‘inspections’ or ‘raids’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0004865812469974">Strategic Crime Officer, 2009</xref>) on authorized premises: police would simply not be permitted to undertake these types of highly intrusive and disruptive raids under the Law Enforcement Powers and Responsibilities Act (2002). Under this Act, police would need to establish reasonable suspicion of an imminent crime and/or obtain a warrant. In contrast, the Local Government Act 1993 gives much broader powers to agents acting for the council (which can include the police).</p>
<p>The exact means by which the council gains entry to these sex premises is unclear, but section 193 of the Local Government Act 1993 allows entry without notice if the owner consents. The complexity of the notion of consent has been explored in criminological literature generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0004865812469974">Naffine, 1997</xref>) and with regard to policing specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865812469974">Dixon, 1990</xref>). Criminologists have argued that police may be able to achieve their objectives by not using legal powers, but by securing the ‘consent’ of the suspect. If consent is obtained, the legal relationship between the actors is not that between a state official and private citizen, but rather between two private citizens. This notion of policing by consent has long been promoted to supplement or replace what are regarded as inadequate or unclear powers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865812469974">Dixon, 1990</xref>: 346), albeit the complexity of policing by consent has been widely acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004865812469974">Brogden, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0004865812469974">Murphy and Cherney, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0004865812469974">Murphy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0004865812469974">Pickering et al., 2008</xref>). Where a police officer receives consent, the statutory requirements for the exercise of power do not apply and there is no need to establish a reasonable suspicion. Moreover, record keeping is also not required where consent has been given – resulting in greater difficulty in assessing accountability. In addition, where consent has been given, the suspect does not have the rights and protections that are corollaries of the exercise of legal power.</p>
<p>Consent is hence a problematic term, as indicated by a wealth of criminological literature. There are two significant components of consent. The first is <italic>knowledge</italic> – that is, information and understanding – about what is requested. The second is <italic>power</italic> – an ability to make choices based on knowledge to use the available information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865812469974">Dixon, 1990</xref>). Consent is usually limited not by external factors, but by the subject’s social and psychological position, lack of knowledge, and lack of power. Whilst the police may not positively misrepresent powers to achieve consent, they may receive consent based on an assumption that they are legally authorized. The same can apply to consent by brothel operators to inspections in Parramatta. Criminological literature would suggest operators would be unlikely to refuse council entry for a variety of reasons including lack of knowledge about their rights, fear of upsetting the council upon whom they depend for continued authorization, and relative disempowerment. There is hence recognition that consent is not solely based on ignorance, but the appreciation of the contextual irrelevance of rights and legal provision. Analysis of policing indicates that rights are seen by officers as the property of some people, but not others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865812469974">Dixon, 1990</xref>). The overt construction by Parramatta City Council of brothels as disorderly, empowered by the Brothels Legislation Amendment Act 2007, and lack of sympathy in the community and media, renders brothel operators relatively powerless, and hence contributes to a perception of lack of rights by the local council <italic>and</italic> the brothel operators.</p>
<p>In the event council inspectors cannot obtain consent, section 193(3)(b) of the Local Government Act 1993 allows entry without consent ‘because of the existence or reasonable likelihood of a serious risk to health or safety’. These grounds are similar to those of the police, where entry is justified if there is a reasonable likelihood of a breach of law (ss 9 and 10 Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002). The difference is in the type of law that is being breached: police are given powers of entry if there is a relatively serious breach of the criminal law or a person is in imminent danger. In comparison, the council can enter if there are breaches of civil provisions, including fire safety and occupational health and safety. Claims by the Strategic Crime Officer of breaches by that particular brothel, or brothels generally, and the tendency to conflate all breaches in terms of severity, would support an argument of ‘reasonable likelihood’ of serious risk to health or safety. Moreover, critical criminological literature argues that the ‘very process of trying to obtain consent allows officers to test their suspicions about a person: as the hoary truism insists, only the guilty have reason to refuse it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865812469974">Dixon, 1990</xref>: 352). If consent is refused, then police could use this to arrest a suspect on reasonable suspicion of criminality: put simply, they appear guilty if they refuse.</p>
<p>These inspections confirm the perception of the inherent disorderliness of brothels, as breaches can only be found if these raids are carried out. No attempt is made to distinguish between brothels as victims or perpetrators of crime – the main argument is that brothels are criminogenic (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0004865812469974">Hubbard, 2004</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0004865812469974">Strategic Crime Officer (2009)</xref> asserted that ‘brothels have significant impact upon crime and a tendency to generate criminality’. According to him, ‘typical crimes experienced within and around brothels’ include armed robbery, assault, illegal drug use/supply, extortion and protection rackets, drive-by shootings and illegal immigrants used as sex workers, sex trafficking. This evidence focuses on brothels as inherently criminal, and does not differentiate between whether brothels are likely to be perpetrators or victims of crime. For example, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0004865812469974">Strategic Crime Officer (2009)</xref> asserted that brothels are likely to be victims of armed robbery, and in the next paragraph that clients or criminals attracted to the area are likely to assault nearby workers.</p>
<p>The council also conflates civil and criminal breaches and escalates these to the criminal. This is demonstrated in evidence to the court in which the Strategic Crime Officer made no distinction between types of breaches in terms of seriousness of crime. For example, he asserted that 80 per cent of clients were known to the police. When questioned further, he asserted that offences they might have committed ranged from train fare evasion to assaults or robberies. He stated that as a former police officer he was concerned with all breaches of the law. This is a form of ‘zero tolerance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004865812469974">Dixon, 1998</xref>), which has been described in policing terms as routinely ‘stopping the disorderly, the unruly and disturbing behaviour of people in public places whether lawful or not’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0004865812469974">Bayley and Shearing, 1996</xref>). The Mayor of Parramatta has asserted that the council is adopting a zero tolerance policy to ‘those operating unlicensed and unsafe brothels’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0004865812469974">Issa, 2008</xref>). Given this approach, any breaches, whether civil or criminal, no matter how trivial, will not be tolerated. The tendency to conflate different types of breaches is reinforced and reflected by the multi-agency approach. The Lord Mayor of Parramatta has ‘welcomed a joint-agency operation’ to close brothels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0004865812469974">Issa, 2008</xref>). This Joint Agency Group comprises of police, federal and state, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship and Centrelink – a combination of departments amalgamating criminal, immigration, social security and planning concerns. This in turn justifies the targeted policing of brothels. Criminality is hence confirmed by the high frequency of inspections identifying breaches (no matter how trivial) of various conditions, regulations, and civil and criminal laws.</p>
<p>The conflation of different areas and categories of law to construct an amalgam of law-breaking was demonstrated in the outcome of an inspection on the <italic>Huang</italic> brothel. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0004865812469974">Strategic Crime Officer (2009)</xref> stated that the raid found a sex worker who ‘was identified as having just turned 18 years of age and being on a no-work entry visa into Australia’. This would be a breach of immigration law. The mention of the age of the worker implies (misleadingly) a suggested breach of criminal laws regarding the age of consent. In addition, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0004865812469974">Strategic Crime Officer (2009)</xref> asserted that a ‘detailed inspection of the premises located fire safety breaches and a lack of a Fire Safety Certificate’ – a breach of civil fire safety laws – asserting that ‘A penalty infringement notice was issued to the manager of that brothel for the offence of permit sex worker to reside on premises, contrary to Consent’ (para. 27) – a breach of local government planning regulations. These breaches are amalgamated to depict brothels as criminogenic, with the lack of explanation as to the number, type and severity of breaches leaving the problems associated with brothels to the imagination. In this case, this justifies the high frequency of inspections, which in turn generates evidence of further breaches, albeit that many could be considered trivial.</p>
<p>Significantly then, we see here that planning powers have the capacity to augment and enhance police powers. Police presence is justified under section 201 of the Local Government Act given that an authorized officer may accompany and issue a warrant to enter and search premises ‘if the authorised person has reasonable grounds for believing that the provisions of this Act… have been or are being contravened in or on any premises’. This would justify the initial police and council raid on authorized brothels. Minor breaches of the Act found by the raid would then justify continued raids. Ostensibly this involves the same powers granted to police under the Law Enforcement Powers and Responsibility Act 2002. However, the big difference is that police are granted these powers on the basis of breaches of the Local Government Act. As such, breaches of relatively minor regulations of civil law can be relied upon to justify and require police presence.</p>
<p>The conduct of the inspections themselves can be characterized as a ‘punitive display’ entailing zero tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0004865812469974">Garland, 1996</xref>). While section 191 of the Local Government Act states that entry ‘may only be made at any reasonable hour’ this is also supplemented by ‘or at any hour during which business is in progress’. This permits and justifies late night raids on brothels. The effect of these late night inspections can be highly intimidatory. These disruptive inspections are within the repertoire of enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0004865812469974">Gill, 2002</xref>) and provide an example of where the process is itself the punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0004865812469974">Feeley, 1979</xref>). Similarly, the number of people on the inspections representing various agency interests can intimidate. The multi-agency interests means the inspectors have a wide remit in terms of what they are inspecting and the evidence they need to collect, increasing the intrusiveness of the inspection and the length of time it takes. Not only does this result in loss of business to the brothel, but clients and workers on the street may feel humiliated and decide not to return.</p>
<p>Such practices raise questions in terms of costs. The attention currently directed towards the enforcement and exclusion of brothels in Parramatta represents an intensive use of resources, with relatively low returns. The inspections are time-consuming for police. Records include meaningless figures that make little effort to assess the outcomes, intended or unintended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0004865812469974">Gill, 2002</xref>). Unintended consequences include the production of negative relations between the council and police, with brothel owners reluctant to turn to the police or council if ‘real’ crime issues arise, as this just confirms preconceptions and they cannot be sure that the police or council will assist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004865812469974">Hinds, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0004865812469974">Murphy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0004865812469974">Murphy and Cherney, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0004865812469974">Pickering et al., 2008</xref>). There are also dangers that this punitive approach can create an environment that facilitates corruption. One of the original reasons for legislative reforms in 1995 was the association of an illegal industry with police corruption – encouraging bribery by police and brothels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865812469974">Crofts, 2003</xref>). This potential for corruption has extended to councils including Parramatta Council, for example, the Independent Commission Against Corruption found corrupt practices by Parramatta Council workers of accepting bribes in exchange for not investigating businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004865812469974">ICAC, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0004865812469974"><title>Making space for brothels in Sydney City</title>
<p>In Parramatta, it is clear that planners’ implicit ideas about sex work as outside the conventions of heteronormative sexuality leads them to make certain assumptions about the disorderliness and even criminogenic status of spaces of sex work. This is something that might be related to Parramatta’s status as one of Sydney’s suburbs, a space that is imaginatively distanced from the landscapes of inner Sydney which have traditionally been noted for the presence of sex industries (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0004865812469974">Prior, 2008a</xref>). In contrast, and given its reputation as sexually permissive, Sydney City has adopted a very different approach to the regulation of sex services premises. The basic difference is that whilst Parramatta asserts the inherent disorderliness of brothels, deeming them as inevitably ‘out of place’, Sydney City regards and regulates sex services premises as a legitimate land use that may well be appropriate – at least in some neighbourhoods. This is tied into a variety of factors, including the more established nature of sex premises in the inner city and the globally-mediated reputation of Sydney for sexual liberalism and LGBT lifestyles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004865812469974">Gorman-Murray and Waitt, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The difference in perception of, and approach to, sex services premises is apparent in the planning principles adopted in Sydney City and Parramatta City Council. We have argued that Parramatta City Council regulates sex premises through a unitary category of ‘brothel’ and highly restrictive policies that make it difficult for these businesses to receive council authorization. In contrast, Sydney City has adopted detailed planning regulations that assist and enable the authorization of sex services premises. Of particular importance in Sydney is the distinction made <italic>between</italic> types of sex services premises based on size, nature and potential amenity impacts. Specific regulations have been developed for different types of brothels, including Home Occupations Sex Services Premises (HOSSPs) where workers operate from their own home. Central to Sydney City’s approach is the treatment of sex industry premises in the same way as other legitimate business on the basis of their environmental impacts, and providing assistance in reducing those impacts, rather than assuming that all brothels are disorderly, which is judged contingently via the exercise of planner’s discretion about the appropriateness of a brothel in a given location.</p>
<p>An example of this is the way in which the Sydney City has approached HOSSPs. Rather than including HOSSPs within the unitary category of ‘brothel’ (as Parramatta City Council does), Sydney City regulates these businesses similarly to other home occupations. This differentiation between types of sex services premises is important, because it is estimated that HOSSPs make up at least 40 percent of the sex industry in NSW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865812469974">Brothels Taskforce, 2001</xref>). It is very difficult, if not impossible, for HOSSPs to receive authorization in councils like Parramatta City which rely on a unitary category of ‘brothel’ because of zoning and notification requirements. In contrast, in Sydney City, HOSSPs are permitted to operate without development consent within much of the residential zones of the city, whilst larger sex services premises are required to submit a development application, satisfying notification requirements and appropriate zoning. This approach to HOSSPs appears appropriate given their minimal negative amenity impact, with studies suggesting that most people are unaware that they have been living next to a HOSSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004865812469974">Cox, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Accordingly, Sydney City regards and regulates HOSSPs under a planning regime, focusing primarily on amenity impacts. Action is not taken unless and until complaints are made about negative amenity impacts. An analysis of these complaints revealed that during the period January 2008 and August 2009, Sydney City only received two substantiated complaints for complying HOSSPs. This underlines that within a planning perspective that treats sex premises as a legal land use, planning controls can exercise significant control over the location of sex premises primarily on grounds of minimizing negative environmental, as opposed to moral, impacts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0004865812469974">Hubbard et al., 2009</xref>). Assumptions of illegality are hence dropped, with the goal being to ensure the best possible use of urban land within the context of competing property and development rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865812469974">Blomley, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As a consequence of the council’s approach, the role for police is that which would be adopted for any other legal citizen or business. Legitimacy and authorization come associated with a longstanding legal framework of responsibilities including the need to conform with environmental health and taxation regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004865812469974">Crofts and Prior, 2011</xref>). But along with obligations come rights, meaning that sex services premises and their workers and clients are able to turn to the law for protection. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0004865812469974"><italic>Huang v Parramatta</italic> (2009)</xref> the Senior Constable of Police Statement of Evidence asserted that an existing authorized brothel near the proposed brothel had been the subject of motorcycle gang threats accompanied by promises of ‘protection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0004865812469974">Senior Constable of Police, 2009</xref>). The officer relied upon this as evidence of the inherent unlawfulness of brothels. In contrast, we regard this as demonstrating an advantage of legal status, albeit in its infant form. Rather than succumbing to motorcycle gang threats, the brothel owner was able to, and did, report the threats to the police and seek protection from existing legal institutions.</p>
<p>The effect of legalization also improves the safety of individual sex workers. Research has consistently shown that sex workers in NSW experience high levels of violence and are more at risk of harm than other citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865812469974">Harcourt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0004865812469974">Prior 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0004865812469974">2008b</xref>). This research indicates that sex workers experience physical assault, fraud or scamming, theft, rape and attempted rape, being forced to have unprotected sex, verbal abuse, sexual assault, harassment threats, kidnapping, drugging and stalking. This research also indicates that these experiences result in varying degrees of physical and emotional trauma and physical health problems which until recently have often remained unaddressed because sex work was illegal and remains stigmatized.</p>
<p>Granting brothels legal status ensures that legitimate avenues are available for protection and redress. Moreover, it facilitates research into how best to protect sex workers, including the good design of brothels and the introduction of ‘safe house brothels’. Safe house brothels are privately owned commercial premises that provide short-term room rentals to clients to enable the provision of sexual services by a sex worker. These safe houses provide workers with cheap, easily accessible, legal, clean and safe environment to service their clients, albeit away from areas where their presence might be regarded as inappropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0004865812469974">Prior et al., 2012</xref>). They were introduced into Sydney City local government area as a means of providing street-based sex workers with safe provision sites, as out of all forms of sex work, research has shown that street-based sex workers are vulnerable to the most extreme forms of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0004865812469974">Prior, 2008b</xref>). This means that those who engage in street-based sex work have less need to risk their own safety by getting into a client’s car or conducting services in other isolated private venues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865812469974">Harcourt et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>This suggests that taking an approach that regards sex work as an inevitable part of urban life, and planning for it by adopting certain principles of reducing undesirable ‘secondary effects’, results in the creation of spaces which can accommodate this legal activity. Yet the adoption of an approach led by the concern of planning with ensuring the optimum use of urban space does not mean policing is insignificant in the regulation of sex work. For example, planners relied upon police to assist with the collection of evidence of breaches of operating conditions by an erotic massage parlour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0004865812469974"><italic>Sydney City Council v DeCue</italic>, 2006</xref>). This case involved neighbourhood complaints to police <italic>and</italic> council about public urination, propositioning schoolgirls and illegal parking. The council successfully applied to the LEC to close down this authorized sex services premises for breach of operating conditions. The case demonstrated the capacity for the council to regulate this sort of business through planning, but also the way in which policing can serve planning, rather than vice versa.</p>

<p>This paper has argued that, like the police before them, planners now play a key role in constructing sexual orders, albeit these operate through the deployment of specific techniques of spatial governmentality rather than through a direct surveillance and disciplining of bodies. Inevitably, this exercise of planning power can reinforce existing norms, and benefit specific groups – not least the propertied classes who may feel that the presence of commercial sex premises lowers property prices in the vicinity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0004865812469974">Hubbard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0004865812469974">Papayanis, 2000</xref>). Although planning is not explicitly designed to protect landed interests or reinforce ideas that commercial sex is an inappropriate land use in wealthier, whiter or ‘family’ areas, we have argued this is a potential outcome if planning processes begin from the perspective that commercial sex is inherently criminal, disorderly or immoral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004865812469974">Crofts, 2007a</xref>). The regulation of brothels in Parramatta by the local council embodies this presumption of disorder, representing an instance of over-regulation – where a particular group, behaviour or space is targeted for intervention and surveillance in a way that is disproportionate to the risk it poses to society (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0004865812469974">Millie, 2008</xref>). In the case of brothel owners and workers, we have argued that this form of regulation amounts to punishment given the loss of work and income because of these raids when the premises are closed for several hours. In contrast, Sydney City has adopted a planning approach to brothels which is more compatible with planning’s traditional proactive role in dictating the most appropriate use of land, yet which still imposes a moral order by dictating where sex can legally be sold.</p>
<p>The idea that planning has the capacity to change and challenge sexual and social norms at a local level through the exercise of situated discretion (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0004865812469974">Valverde, 2011</xref>) has thus been demonstrated here given the contrast between Parramatta and Sydney City. Important questions accordingly need to be asked about the fairness of planning interventions in Parramatta as they are directed towards sex workers and premises owners. There is a large body of criminological literature about abuse of powers via differential policing practices informed by assumptions about which particular gender, age, class and ethnic groups are prone to offend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004865812469974">Bowling, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865812469974">Bowling and Phillips, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0004865812469974">Reiner, 2000</xref>). Part of policing’s historical mandate has been the control of street economies, recreations and people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0004865812469974">Herbert, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0004865812469974">Reiner, 2000</xref>), and this has meant using wide discretionary powers against categories of the population which police culture has distinguished from ‘respectable people’. Such discrimination has been less frequently discussed in planning (though see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0004865812469974">Yiftachel, 1998</xref>) because it is assumed to be about the management of land use not people. Yet despite the legalization of sex work in NSW, sex workers, their clients and employers apparently remain perceived as criminal by (some) planners. Worryingly, whilst the Local Government Act provides planners with extensive powers of enforcement, it does not require extensive reporting. So, planners may have some of the powers of police, but are not necessarily accountable in the same ways.</p>
<p>We accordingly conclude by arguing that planning needs to be critically analysed as a technique of governmentality that sits alongside policing in the construction of social and moral orders, and, moreover, that criminological research needs to recognize that planning law can be as significant as criminal law in the regulation of conduct. In making such claims, we are arguing that criminological research needs to consider planning as a key technique of social ordering that is as much tied into questions of morality as policing is. However, adopting a critical Foucauldian perspective on planning as a technique of governmentality requires that attention is devoted to its specific apparatus given its emphasis on spaces rather than subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0004865812469974">Valverde, 2011</xref>): considering planning as a form of governmentality requires that we consider both the spatiality of planning law and planners’ discretion within that law, understanding planning as a ‘situated mentality’ that is contingently and unevenly applied.</p>
