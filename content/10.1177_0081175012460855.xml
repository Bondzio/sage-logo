<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0081175012460855">Franzosi, De Fazio, and Vicari (this volume, 2012</xref>:1–42) propose a strategy for using details contained in narrative accounts of social events to give life to the actors in those events and to reveal agency on the part of those actors. They use the history of lynching in the state of Georgia to demonstrate an application of the proposed methodological tool, Quantitative Narrative Analysis (QNA). Early in this paper Franzosi and colleagues describe their primary objective as methodological rather than substantive. But in evaluating the contribution of this paper it is necessary to consider both methodological and substantive issues.</p>
<p>As Franzosi and colleagues correctly observe, the quantitative study of southern lynching has relied heavily on aggregate data (spatial or temporal) to describe the strength of relationships between the intensity of lynching (usually counts of incidents or victims) and a variety of social, economic, political, and demographic variables. As a result of these studies, we know that lynchings were more numerous where the African American population was relatively large, the agricultural economy was based predominantly on cotton, the white population was economically stressed, the Democratic Party was stronger, and multiple religious organizations competed for congregants. Savvy social scientists strive to avoid committing an ecological fallacy by drawing inferences about individual-level motivations and behaviors from such aggregate evidence. Still, the temptation to do so is great because the loss of the actors involved in the lynchings seems a high price to pay for relying on the available, but aggregated, data.</p>
<p>Franzosi’s interest in the use of narrative for social scientific inquiry is long-standing, and he and his colleagues have provided useful introductions to the QNA methodology elsewhere (see the citations in their work). The current paper offers an intriguing, and potentially very valuable, opportunity to complement the aggregate analysis of southern lynching with the intensive examination of the cast of characters involved in specific lynching incidents and their sequential behaviors, while also considering a large number of events. The raw material for this type of inquiry is the “semantic triplet” which, to oversimplify, describes who did what to whom.</p>
<p>The great potential for the use of QNA in the study of southern lynching is illustrated in Tables 1 and 2 of the paper, which describe, respectively, the different types of actors participating in lynching incidents and the variety of actions they performed. Figures 1 and 2 exploit further the QNA database to portray the strength of the underlying networks that comprised the lynching event. It is these two tables and two figures that provide the best insights into the most valuable contributions of QNA to the study of lynching. That is, they demonstrate what is truly unique about the approach—profiling the actors, their actions, and the interactions among actors.</p>
<p>Although quite simple and elegant in their presentation, Figures 1 and 2 represent an enormous amount of work that was necessary to (1) locate newspaper articles about lynchings in Georgia, (2) enter the appropriate information from the articles in the required format, and (3) extract the network evidence. I cringe when I contemplate the additional work that will be required to construct equivalent relational databases for the other southern states with significant lynching histories. But, it will be important to make that additional effort in order for the full potential of the application of QNA to the study of southern lynching to be realized.</p>
<p>I was hoping that Franzosi and colleagues would elaborate further on the potential use of QNA for extracting network structures among the actors engaged in Georgia lynchings (e.g., as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2). However, much of the subsequent quantitative evidence presented in the article does not, in my opinion, exploit the true value of the relational database or QNA. Rather, it could have been produced by existing databases or slightly enhanced versions of those databases.</p>
<p>The trends in lynching for Georgia and ten southern states presented in Figure 3 could have been produced easily with existing lynching inventories, as could the map in Figure 4 showing the spatial distribution of lynchings in Georgia. Likewise, the accusations lodged against lynched victims discussed in the article and presented in Figure 6 do not require QNA techniques. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0081175012460855">Brundage (1993</xref>, ch. 2) devotes a chapter in his book <italic>Lynching in the New South</italic> to the topic for Georgia and Virginia; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0081175012460855">Tolnay and Beck (1995)</xref> do likewise in their book <italic>A Festival of Violence</italic>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I do not believe that QNA (or newspaper articles for that matter) are well-suited to constructing profiles of the lynch victims, as hinted by Franzosi and colleagues when they report the victims’ average age as 27 years (median of 20 years) and their modal occupation as “farm hands or cotton pickers.” The problem is that so few newspaper stories contained useful descriptions of the victims that it is difficult to know what to make of the statistical evidence gleaned from those that did. Rather, the approach used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0081175012460855">Bailey and colleagues (2011)</xref> that matches lynch victims to their census records is more appropriate for this purpose.</p>
<p>In sum, Franzosi and colleagues describe an intriguing, and potentially very valuable, method for applying QNA to narrative accounts of social events to highlight the actors and to reveal their actions and interactions. Yet, it is important to distinguish the tasks for which QNA is most useful from the tasks that are best left to other methods and other data. I believe that they express it quite well when they write, “The real power of QNA is its <italic>relational</italic> properties” [emphasis added]. And that could prove to be very significant power, indeed.</p>

<p><bold>Stewart E. Tolnay</bold> is the S. Frank Miyamoto Professor of Sociology at the University of Washington. He is author of <italic>The Bottom Rung: African American Family Life on Southern Farms</italic> (1999, University of Illinois Press), and coauthor, with E. M. Beck, of <italic>A Festival of Violence: An Analysis of Southern Lynchings, 1882-1930</italic> (1995, University of Illinois Press). His recent research and publications have focused on the Great Migration of African Americans away from the South. Along with Amy Kate Bailey and E. M. Beck, he recently completed a new database that links nearly one thousand southern lynch victims with their records in the census before their deaths.</p>
