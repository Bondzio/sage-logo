<speaker>MR. THOMAS PRESTON (Columbus, Ohio):</speaker>
<p>Due to the facial trauma in a C2 fracture, were there any concerns with your cannulation technique? How did your team stabilize that area afterwards?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. JOSHUA WALKER (San Antonio, Texas):</speaker>
<p>The patient was admitted wearing a cervical collar. Those things are a pain in the neck, literally, for everyone involved. Once we determined that we were going to use neck cannulation, the physicians used sandbags, taped the patient’s head down, and did the best they could. They knew, based on the computed tomography (CT) scan, that the fracture was most likely not injuring the spinal cord. The C2 vertebral body actually has a larger lumen, which is not completely filled by the spinal cord, so you can actually have a minimal amount of swelling without any impedance upon the spinal cord.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. KEVIN LILLY (Cotuit, Massachusetts):</speaker>
<p>I have a cardiopulmonary support (CPS) system, as well, and we use it for all sorts of applications. Can you remind me again, what does the Better Bladder™ do for you on the venous side?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. WALKER:</speaker>
<p>The Better Bladder™ gives you a good way to dampen venous line fluctuations, as has been demonstrated in a number of studies. If you were to clamp the venous line or have an acute occlusion, you can have massive spikes in venous line pressure. That pliable membrane in the Better Bladder™ allows for it to buffer against those severe changes in pressure. Some also argue that, because it is mounted vertically, you have better flow dynamics and less potential for thrombus formation because of the way that the blood flows through the actual bladder. I do not have any science to base that statement on, but I believe that to be true as well.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. LILLY:</speaker>
<p>Certainly, with a trauma patient, there can be a lot of fluctuations in blood volume. If you are just using a centrifugal pump connected directly to the patient, you will get a lot of fluctuations. Does the Better Bladder™ come heparin-coated?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>MR. WALKER:</speaker>
<p>I believe it does now, but I am not certain.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>CO-MODERATOR WILLIAM HARRIS (Luling, Louisiana):</speaker>
<p>Mr. Yehuda Tamari has been working with several companies to have a coating applied to that particular device.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>CO-MODERATOR HARRIS:</speaker>
<p>The other thing that has been shown in some of the literature is that the Better Bladder™ or a compliance chamber may actually be able to collect some of the air that might be cavitated by severe chattering, which has been measured to instantly decrease to the range −600 to −700 mmHg.</p>
