<sec id="section1-1039856212458007">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>To explore the clinical reasoning processes underpinning diagnostic and management decision-making in treating patients presenting with psychological distress in general practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1039856212458007">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>Practising GPs were invited to attend small-group workshops in which two case histories were presented. Discussion was GP-facilitated and recorded for thematic analysis. GPs provided demographic data, completed personality and attitudinal questionnaires, and answered a series of multiple-choice questions embedded in the cases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1039856212458007">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>GPs recognize the possibility of psychiatric disorders early in the clinical reasoning process, but are cautious about applying definitive diagnoses. GPs perceive that patients may be resistant to a psychiatric diagnosis and instead emphasize the need to build rapport and explore and exclude physical comorbidities. GPs see patients with a broad spectrum of distress, illness and impairment, in whom the initial presentation of psychological symptoms is often poorly differentiated and somatically focused, requiring elucidation over time. GPs therefore adopt a longitudinal strategy for diagnosis rather than investing heavily in cross-sectional assessment.</p>

<sec id="section4-1039856212458007">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>GPs appear cognizant of possible psychiatric disorders and management strategies, but employ diagnostic strategies and decision-making processes that, in addition to experience and expertise, likely reflect key differences between the primary care and specialist practice settings.</p>

<p>The GP remains the most commonly consulted health practitioner by individuals with psychological distress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212458007">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212458007">2</xref></sup> Some evidence suggests, however, that many disorders meeting recognized diagnostic criteria are being missed, with the GP ‘report card’ often saying ‘could do better’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212458007">3</xref></sup> Barriers to diagnosing psychiatric disorders in general practice have been reported as including lack of knowledge, skills, and interest, and negative attitudes to mental health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212458007">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212458007"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856212458007"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212458007">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Research suggests that GPs employ different decision-making processes to specialists in determining diagnosis and implementing treatment.

<p>GPs are cautious about early diagnosis, preferring a watchful waiting approach, which they believe is appropriate due to the in-depth knowledge they have of their patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212458007">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212458007"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856212458007"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212458007"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856212458007"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856212458007">15</xref></sup> The validity and usefulness of the major psychiatric classificatory systems in primary care is seen as poor by GPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212458007">7</xref></sup> who place more emphasis on the personal context in which the patient is presenting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212458007">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Considering the importance of recognition and treatment of common mental disorders in primary care, this study aimed to evaluate GPs’ decision-making processes through two case presentations and to explore the perceived usefulness of diagnostic and classificatory systems in common use.</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856212458007" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Metropolitan GPs were recruited to participate in one of the five offered workshops. Based on two cases developed to reflect common presentations in general practice, differential diagnoses were presented using DSM-IV, ICD-10 and ICPC-2 classificatory systems. In one case a young mother presented with symptoms of anxiety that would not meet DSM-IV or ICD-10 criteria for any disorder, but could have been classified under a number of ICPC-2 codes; in the second case a young woman presented with initial symptoms of depression, later returning with symptoms of hypomania that would have met criteria for bipolar disorder. Throughout the cases, scripted questions were posed that explored decision-making processes. Answers were collected and stored using an electronic ‘KEEPAD’ system. A GP-facilitated discussion around these questions was recorded.</p>
<p>Prior to the workshops, participants were asked to complete a series of questionnaires that collected demographic and clinical practice data (age, gender, full-time/part-time work, years in general practice) and were asked if they had an interest in mental health or had completed any post-graduate training in mental health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1039856212458007" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Thirty-eight GPs participated in the workshops. They had considerable experience in general practice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1039856212458007">Table 1</xref>). Almost two-thirds of the group were aged between 50 and 69 years, approximately two-thirds were female and two-thirds were in full-time practice. Approximately three-quarters indicated an interest in mental health, although only 48 per cent reported receiving any post-graduate training. Those who did had attended a range of training activities in mental health (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1039856212458007">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Analysis of the recorded workshop discussions was undertaken by listening to each recording and identifying themes. An open process was used initially. When topics emerged consistently across workshops, they were organized into categories (e.g. ‘engagement’, ‘social context’, ‘treatment’), then grouped into dominant themes and subthemes (e.g. main theme ‘diagnostic process’ and subtheme ‘importance of family history’). Quotes were selected by virtue of their representativeness of content. Two main themes emerged, with six subthemes.</p>
<sec id="section7-1039856212458007">
<title>Diagnostic process</title>
<sec id="section8-1039856212458007">
<title>Engagement with the patient and detection of serious physical illness are key priorities – a focus on physical illness enhances engagement</title>
<p>GPs see it as an important priority to exclude serious and treatable physical conditions, using a “… <italic>exclusionary approach, make a diagnosis by ruling things out … not in</italic> …” policy. Time constraints also require that this issue be the main focus of the first assessment. A focus on physical complaints reassures patients that they are being taken seriously, thus promoting engagement and the likelihood that patients will return for review: “<italic>You’d have to convince her at the first consultation to come back … before you send her away …</italic>”.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1039856212458007">
<title>GPs prefer a watchful waiting approach to diagnosis</title>
<p>GPs are aware that psychological distress may be the presenting feature of a wide range of possible conditions, both physical and mental, and that many cases of psychological distress will be time-limited and settle spontaneously or, alternatively, better differentiate from normal over time. This observation underlies the ‘wait and see’ approach widely endorsed by GP participants in the workshops: “… <italic>that it is a matter of degree … and I want more information before I write down a diagnosis</italic> …”.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1039856212458007">
<title>Personal context and family history are essential to understanding the patient and making a diagnosis</title>
<p>A robust theme to emerge was that GPs emphasize the necessity for a holistic approach to understanding the patient, including work, relationships and family contexts, in the process of making a diagnosis. GPs “… <italic>look for red flags or trigger events in the history</italic> …” and “… <italic>social support matters, if she has family support … this is important … tension issues with the husband … escaping to work … does she get any emotional support or is she bereft in that area; does she belong to a club, or church or whatever …</italic>” A positive family history of mental illness was seen as very important, and in the case of the patient with bipolar disorder probably more so than the symptoms and recent history with which the patient presented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1039856212458007">
<title>General practice is different to specialist practice in psychiatry</title>
<p>“<italic>It’s not about being right [or wrong] … it’s a different context.</italic>” GPs point out that by the time a patient sees a psychiatrist a number of incidents have already happened. Firstly, the ongoing process of engagement, review and discussion has gradually shaped the patient’s view of their problem, from a purely or mainly physical one to the possibility that their symptoms have a large psychological component. Many patients take time to make this adjustment, whereas when they initially present, GPs feel that: “<italic>…She’s not ready for a diagnosis …</italic>”.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1039856212458007">
<title>Diagnostic and classificatory systems</title>
<sec id="section13-1039856212458007">
<title>Diagnosis as a label and an imposition</title>
<p>Since diagnosis is only one of many factors guiding treatment, there is a tendency for it to be seen more as a label, and one associated with stigma in the community, which almost certainly contributes to reluctance to make a specific diagnosis. This is further impacted by concerns about possible adverse future consequences for Medicare access or insurance: “<italic>…this business about recording a diagnosis is confronting sometimes … because it has significant implications … if you put it in their notes it’s there forever … once that is filed through to Medicare …</italic>” and “<italic>… I find it really confronting having to write a diagnosis in the absence of a real danger …</italic>” and “… <italic>it’s just a label and not relevant</italic>”. Another aspect of stigma is that patients themselves may be reluctant to entertain the possibility of a psychiatric cause for their symptoms, and GPs are cautious that introducing such an idea too early may damage rapport.</p>
<p>Our workshops yielded a suggestion that a GP’s usual practice with respect to recording diagnoses may show some relationship to whether they are in full-time or part-time practice, with part-time GPs indicating that recording a clear indication of diagnostic thinking was important in ensuring treatment continuity, given that the patient may see a different doctor at their next visit. However, those in full-time practice were of the view that “<italic>… it is all in the continuation notes, I don’t need to force a diagnosis …</italic>”.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1039856212458007">
<title>Diagnostic classifications and rating scales have limited usefulness</title>
<p>The frequent overlap observed between common psychiatric disorders as they present in general practice creates an impression that distinctions between them are arbitrary, artificial and unhelpful. The high prevalence of mixed anxiety and depression, not well catered to within DSM-IV, is a case in point. Although ICPC-2 allows for a diagnosis of ‘anxiety with depression’, many GPs remained reluctant to assign a specific diagnosis. Despite their apparently questionable utility in general practice, GPs often feel imposed upon to make specific diagnoses, because they are told this is optimal practice, or for administrative reasons, for example “<italic>… for the Mental Health Care Plan …and from an insurance point of view …</italic>”.</p>
<p>As expected based on the literature review, GPs did not regard DSM-IV and ICD-10 as useful. It was also found that many were unfamiliar with ICPC-2, or did not find it to have utility, preferring to record a problem list rather than a diagnosis, despite availability of a classificatory system designed to reflect GP presentations.</p>

<sec id="section15-1039856212458007" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) data from 2007 indicate that the average age of GPs in NSW is 50.9 years, two-thirds are male and average hours worked are 44.4 hours for males and 32.9 hours for females.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856212458007">17</xref></sup> Females were over-represented in our sample but the data were otherwise comparable in age and hours worked. The self-selected nature of the sample accords with the finding that most participants acknowledged an interest in mental health and approximately half had completed some type of relevant post-graduate training. It can be argued that this renders our findings even more compelling given that they are the views of an interested, knowledgeable and highly experienced group.</p>
<p>The diagnostic process in general practice is influenced by the setting. The broader range of severity, the admixture of bio-psycho-social factors and the ‘raw’ undifferentiated nature of presentations in general practice are crucial differences from specialist practice across all branches of medicine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856212458007">18</xref></sup> The interactive process of assessment over time helps refine the differential diagnosis, with both the GP and patient gradually reaching a shared view about the nature of the symptoms. As one of our GP facilitators observed, even the language the patient uses begins to reflect the iterative process. Thus, by the time a patient presents to a specialist, their symptom pattern is likely to be more defined and to be expressed in language reflective of this evolution.</p>
<p>Our findings provide support for suggestions in the literature that a focus on excluding physical disorder strengthens the alliance and paves the way for introducing psychological considerations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856212458007">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856212458007">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212458007">11</xref></sup> as well as being seen as an imperative for patient safety.</p>
<p>A key finding was the preference of GPs to defer diagnosis pending further assessment. It is probable that the most significant influences in this regard are the perceived stigma of a psychiatric diagnosis, the perception of significant patient resistance to accepting a psychological cause for their symptoms, with fears that introducing such a diagnostic possibility ‘too early’ may impair the therapeutic alliance, and the awareness of GPs that many patients present with psychological distress that may be transient and part of a normal response to stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856212458007">7</xref></sup> An additional possibility regarding the preference for a longer time frame of assessment in general practice could relate to the complex nature of psychiatric disorders, typically requiring more time to assess fully. It may be that the longer time frame GPs prefer has some parallel to psychiatrists spending perhaps 50 minutes (the equivalent of 3–5 consultations in general practice) with patients before deciding on a diagnosis.</p>
<p>It is likely that GPs and psychiatrists differ with respect to conceptualization of diagnoses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212458007">10</xref></sup> The psychiatrist considers whether minimum criteria are sufficiently met to confer a given diagnosis, whereas it appears that GPs may make more intuitive diagnoses based on their sense of the patient and his or her individual problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856212458007">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856212458007"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856212458007"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856212458007"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856212458007"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856212458007">15</xref></sup> GPs may also weight risk factors differently. In particular, the emphasis on family history was a robust finding.</p>
<p>Avoidance of making a specific diagnosis may be misconstrued as GPs’ failure to recognize common psychiatric conditions. However, GPs are more likely to base their management on the problems identified, rather than to relate it to a specific diagnosis: ‘<italic>Not necessary to label it but necessary to manage it</italic>’ and ‘<italic>… does it matter what you call it? [What is important is] rather the way that you treat it…</italic>’ Not making a diagnosis does not equate to not recognizing the problem and not managing it properly. This accords with Summerton’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856212458007">18</xref></sup> observations regarding a preference by GPs for a problem-based rather than diagnosis-specific approach.</p>
<p>A key question is whether the reluctance to make specific diagnoses in general practice is associated with outcome. There does appear to be an elevated risk of meeting criteria for some psychiatric disorders in the longer term following subthreshold presentation (insufficient symptoms to meet diagnostic criteria),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856212458007">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856212458007">20</xref></sup> yet there is debate about whether active treatment of sub-threshold conditions is necessary since a substantial proportion of patients show a ‘natural recovery’. There is some evidence that long-term outcome is not enhanced by increased rates of detection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212458007">16</xref></sup> Our findings that GPs do not consider screening instruments useful are consistent with the results of a systematic review that found no effect on management or outcome for their use in unselected patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856212458007">16</xref></sup> The relationship of outcome to diagnostic specificity requires further study.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The present study was based on relatively small numbers. However, it was felt that data saturation was reached. The participants were primed as to the underlying psychological nature of the cases under discussion and this may have biased the results. However, participants were still cautious about applying psychiatric labels and emphasized the need to exclude physical causes, suggesting that their observations have validity for the wider group of GPs.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We find support for Hickie’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856212458007">21</xref></sup> view that “<italic>Primary care psychiatry is not specialist psychiatry in general practice.</italic>” Key findings from our study are:</p>
<list id="list1-1039856212458007" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>GPs identify psychological factors in the presentation but choose to focus initially on excluding physical disorder for patient safety (excluding serious or urgent medical conditions) as well as to enhance the therapeutic alliance.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>GPs may place particular emphasis on longitudinal factors such as personality, family history and social context in preference to a cross-sectional assessment.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>GPs are reluctant to make specific diagnoses despite the availability of classification systems appropriate to general practice, due to concerns about stigma, doubts that symptoms can be meaningfully categorized and a preference for a problem-focused approach to management.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Although the making of a specific diagnosis may be important in specialist psychiatric practice, the view consistently expressed by GPs that this may be less helpful in general practice needs further consideration. Future research should also examine whether diagnostic specificity is associated with outcome. This research has the potential to shape educational approaches and clinical support offered to GPs in assessing and treating mental illness.</p>
