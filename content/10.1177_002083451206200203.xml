<p>62.1682 AGRANOFF, Robert — <bold><italic>Federalist</italic> No. 44: what is the role of intergovernmental relations in [US] federalism?</bold> <italic>Public Administration Review</italic> 71, Suppl. 1, Dec. 2011: 68–77.</p>
<p><italic>Federalist</italic> No. 44 examines the connective mechanisms underlying a federal system of government. Traditionally called “intergovernmental relations,” these systems were intended to facilitate the pursuit of effective implementation of national policies. This essay suggests that the national government's officers should not be impressed by collaboration unless it produces better performance or lower costs. Collaboration is a means to an end, not an absolute requirement. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1653]</p>
<p>62.1683 ALBA, Richard — <bold>Schools and the diversity transition in the wealthy societies of the West.</bold> <italic>American Behavioral Scientist</italic> 55(12), Dec. 2011: 1616–1634.</p>
<p>The rich countries of the West are facing a diversity transition that will unfold in the next several decades. The transition means that these societies will depend increasingly on individuals who have grown up in immigrant homes to maintain economic, social, and cultural vitality. This situation turns a spotlight on educational systems, which are crucial to preparing the children from low-status immigrant families to participate in the institutions of the mainstream. The educational gaps between native-and immigrant-origin children in France, Germany, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and the US raise concerns about the performance of systems with very different characteristics. Yet all is not hopeless: Some modest policies seem to bring amelioration, and each system can learn from others. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1757]</p>
<p>62.1684 ALLERS, Maarten A.; ISHEMOI, Lewis J. — <bold>Do formulas reduce political influence on intergovernmental grants? Evidence from Tanzania.</bold> <italic>Journal of Development Studies</italic> 47(12), Dec. 2011: 1781–1797.</p>
<p>Sub-national governments usually depend on the central government for a large share of their revenues. Therefore, a fair allocation of intergovernmental grants is essential for financing vital local services like education and healthcare. In Tanzania, and many other countries, regions that are better represented in the national parliament receive significantly more funds than others. Recently, Tanzania replaced the previously existing discretionary method of grant allocation by allocation formulas. We study whether this has reduced the effect of malapportionment on grant allocation. Surprisingly, we find that formula allocation does not significantly change this effect. This has important policy implications. [R]</p>
<p>62.1685 ANGELETTI, Thomas — <bold>Faire la réalité ou s'y faire? La modération et les déplacements de la politique économique au tournant des années 1970 (Producing reality or making do with it? The moderation and the displacements of [French] economic policy at the turn of the 1970s).</bold> <italic>Politix</italic> 95, 2011: 47–72.</p>
<p>How is a given economic reality made, strengthened, and spread? This article examines the problem through the situation of the [French] General Planning Commissariat in the late 1960s, which held a key place in the politico-administrative space. Given the importance accorded to the market and the external constraints, it was then increasingly questioned. A new macroeconomic model, “FIFI,” developed by a group of economists at INSEE <italic>(Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques)</italic>, introduced some displacements regarding the making of economic policies and their purposes. The model was designed to forecast a picture of the French economiy in 1975 if no decisions were made, in order to identify problems which could arise from trends and to determine possible solutions. The FIFI model tended to displace the type of imputations on which the participants of the Plan relied, especially the labor unions. Hence, these economic metrologies produced not only a reality, made of numbers and relatively independent; they also destabilized the political forms explicitly based on values.

<p>62.1686 ARNOLD, Peri E. — <bold><italic>Federalist</italic> No. 70: can the public service survive in the contest between Hamilton's aspirations and Madison's reality?</bold> <italic>Public Administration Review</italic> 71, Suppl. 1, Dec. 2011: 105–111.</p>
<p><italic>Federalist</italic> No. 70 is widely viewed as a sweeping description and defense of the need for energy in the executive. This essay begins this detailed examination of <italic>Federalist</italic> No. 70 by comparing Alexander Hamilton's ideals with James Madison's more cautionary exposition on separated powers. According to the author, Hamilton's notion of a public service driven by honor eventually was undermined by partisanship and congressional prerogatives expressed in the rise of a “businesslike” path away from corruption and waste. The essay concludes with a brief description of a “counterfactual” revision to <italic>Federalist</italic> No. 70 containing a conception of good public service with a capacity to resist the incursions of expanding democratization and political parties.

<p>62.1687 ATUABENE, Bernadette — <bold>South Africa's land reform crisis.</bold> <italic>Foreign Affairs</italic> 90(4), July-Aug. 2011: 121–129.</p>
<p>When apartheid ended, the new regime in South Africa promised to redistribute land that whites had stolen from blacks. Yet nearly two decades later, it has largely failed to do so — and the patience of the dispossessed is running out. [R]</p>
<p>62.1688 ATUAHENE, Bernadette — <bold>Paying for the past: redressing the legacy of land dispossession in South Africa.</bold> <italic>Law and Society Review</italic> 45(4), Dec. 2011: 955–989.</p>
<p>The constitution of South Africa mandates equitable redress for individuals and communities evicted from their properties during colonialism and apartheid. The Commission on Restitution of Land Rights' institution-wide assumption is that the financial awards given as equitable redress had no long-term economic impact on recipients because the money is gone and they are still in poverty, whereas if people had received land, the economic impact would have been lasting. Consequently, in recent years, the commission has adopted a policy of using its soft power to force claimants to choose land-restitution instead of financial awards. However, the interviews I conducted with financial award recipients show that in 30 percent of the cases, the award did produce a long-term economic benefit because respondents invested in their homes.

<p>62.1689 BAEKKESKOV, Erik — <bold>Issue framing and sector character as critical parameters for government contracting-out in the UK.</bold> <italic>Public Administration</italic> 89(4), Dec. 2011: 1489–1508.</p>
<p>This article shows that variations in how two UK governments justified contracting-out (issue-framing), combined with shifting sector-derived incentives for union activism (sector character), can help explain the extent of contracting-out. Janitorial service, an activity of the UK government that should have been “low-hanging fruit” for its prolific reformers, proved difficult to contract-out for M. Thatcher's New Right Conservatives, but easier to contract-out for T. Blair's New Labour. The New Right government framed contracting-out narrowly, as merely an improvement in operational efficiency, and its reform faced unions that stood to lose a great deal from movement of janitorial jobs to private firms. In contrast, the New Labour government framed contracting-out broadly, as a means to efficient social justice, and faced unions with low stakes in government janitors.

<p>62.1690 BAHTIĆ-KUNRATH, Birgit — <bold>Of veto players and entity-voting: institutional gridlock in the Bosnian reform process.</bold> <italic>Nationalities Papers</italic> 39(6), Nov. 2011: 899–923.</p>
<p>Entity-voting in the Bosnian Parliamentary Assembly is a veto mechanism in Bosnia's consociational institutional setting and an important reason for the country's orientation towards the political status quo. An empirical analysis of the number and nature of adopted and rejected draft laws during the legislative period 2006–2010, embedded in G. Tsebelis's veto-player approach, leads to the conclusion that the veto-players in the parliament — either delegates from <italic>Republika Srpska</italic> or delegates from the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina — have pushed the consociational system of checks and balances to its extremes. Entity-voting enables the veto-players to “hijack” the parliament for their exclusionary ethnic interests and discourages cooperation and compromise between the veto-players. Significant legislation, defined as relevant for the European Partnership, faces severe obstacles to getting passed. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>62.1692 BEAULIER, Scott A.; HALL, Joshua C.; LYNCH, Allen K. — <bold>The impact of political factors on [US] military base closures.</bold> <italic>Journal of Economic Policy Reform</italic> 14(4), Dec. 2011: 333–342.</p>
<p>This paper investigates the political economy of military-base closure in the US. The Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Act was passed in 1988 in an attempt to insulate base-closure and realignment from political influence. The political pressure to influence the process remains strong, however, given the negative effects base-closures can often have on a local economy. Using data from the 2005 BRAC round, we examine whether the current process insulates base-closure and realignment from traditional political influences. We find no evidence of political influence on base closings. [R]</p>

<p>The territories of the South and East Mediterranean countries are underdeveloped and underpromoted. Regional planning can hardly find a good balance between economic efficiency and the spatial equity demanded by the Arab Spring. Territorial governance is influenced by a strong tradition of state control and centralization, but is improving. This could foster the overall modernization of these countries' governance. [R]</p>

<p>State-building in the postcolonial Horn of Africa (HoA) suffers from institutional incoherence, which emanates from the duality of institutional arrangements expressed in the coexistence, albeit in an unequal basis, of modern and traditional institutions. While modern institutions are transplanted by the colonial state or imported by the postcolonial state, traditional institutions are transferred from pre-colonial societal structures. The problem with the state-building project in the HoA is the absence of functional harmony between the competing constitutive institutional elements. The pre-colonial indigenous institutions and the colonially transplanted foreign institutions are two component parts that have to find ways and means of coexistence. The article concludes that the fusion of these two institutional systems enables the creation of a harmonious and functional state in the HoA. [R]</p>

<p>In 1974, Sweden adopted a new constitution. In contrast to the previous one (1809), based on ideas of separation-of-powers and which defined the monarch as a powerful political actor, the new constitution placed the parliament <italic>(Riksdag)</italic> at the center of political decision-making and removed the king from political power. At the time, this removed a huge discrepancy between the letter of the constitution and the “living constitution” which placed emphasis on parliamentary sovereignty of the Westminster type. But 35 years later, ideas of separation-of-powers and the necessity of control of suspicious politicians have grown stronger. A constitutional revision in 2010 introduces measures that are akin to what has recently been labeled the Madisonian turn in Western politics.

<p><italic>Federalist</italic> Nos. 41–43 provide a unified justification for the powers granted to the national government by posing a series of questions about the four classes of responsibilities, such as declaring war. This essay examines the role of polarization in limiting the coordination of powers needed for effective administration and uses ideology estimates for four states to illustrate the difficulties embedded in shared power between national and state governments.

<p>62.1697 BERTOSSI, Christophe — <bold>National models of integration in Europe: a comparative and critical analysis.</bold> <italic>American Behavioral Scientist</italic> 55(12), Dec. 2011: 1561–1580.</p>
<p>The concept of models of immigrant integration (e.g., French assimilation, Dutch and British multiculturalism) has had a vibrant career in comparative research on Western Europe, accounting for and explaining many national differences. This concept, however, is problematic because it suffers from normative and theoretical misconceptions. Through a comparison of France, Britain, and the Netherlands, this article discusses key problems affecting the use of national integration models in the literature and proposes ways to overcome them. It argues that models should not be considered as homogeneous and stable cultural entities — and even less as independent variables — but as complex structures of reference on the basis of which a multiplicity of conceptions of identity, equality, and inclusion are developed by a wide range of social agents in each national context.

<p>The author analyzes the effects of welfare reform initiatives undertaken by the J.F. Kennedy and L.B. Johnson administrations. She argues that liberalizing reforms of the 1960s created opportunities for conservative Democratic lawmakers to seize the policy agenda, laying the groundwork for a turn toward workfare that would culminate in the 1990s.

<p>62.1699 BESHA, Patrick — <bold>Civil-military integration in China: a techno-nationalist approach to development.</bold> <italic>American Journal of Chinese Studies</italic> 18(2), Oct. 2011: 97–112.</p>
<p>At the nexus of technology, national security and economic development in China is the policy of Civil-Military Integration (CMI), a technonationalist call to transform the country into a modern super-power. This paper finds that a major shift is occurring within the military, business, and government to develop this policy. It tracks a number of metrics: the increasing centrality of the policy in China's strategic plans, its increasing prominence in academic discourse on national security, the steady demise of a key science and technology ministry, the rise of the PLA's role in CMI and technology policy, and the prominent signaling to top leadership of its importance. These events are viewed in parallel with the broader science and technology policies of China. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The author discusses the causes and implications of the diplomatic drain since the early 1990s — inside the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Drawing on an original survey of students at academic programs in elite Russian universities designed to train diplomats, she challenges the idea that inadequate material benefits limit interest in Russian diplomatic careers. Instead, she demonstrates that concerns over the relative power and prestige of the diplomatic corps guide prospective diplomats in their career choices. [R]</p>
<p>62.1701 BIEBER, Florian — <bold>Building impossible states? State-building strategies and EU membership in the Western Balkans.</bold> <italic>Europe-Asia Studies</italic> 63(10), Dec. 2011: 1783–1802.</p>
<p>The author explores the tensions in state-building and preparing the countries of the Western Balkans for future membership in the EU. In Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro and Bosnia, the EU either inherited or designed state-building projects. The minimalist states which sprang from these efforts were initially designed to contain and manage conflict, not to join the EU. This stands in contrast, however, to the prospect of EU integration, offered by the EU to the countries of the region. In fact, EU integration as a transformative process is not only the single most important shared political project across the region and the ethnic divides, it is also widely seen as the best mechanism to prevent the resumption of conflict and address the legacies of the most recent wars.

<p>62.1702 BILMES, Linda J. — <bold><italic>Federalist</italic> Nos. 67–77: how would Publius envision the civil service today?</bold> <italic>Public Administration Review</italic> 71, Suppl. 1, Dec. 2011: 98–104.</p>
<p><italic>Federalist</italic> Nos. 67–77 offer a strong defense of the “energetic executive” embedded in the new constitution, which is perhaps best captured in Alexander Hamilton's famous conclusion that “the true test of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to produce a good administration”. This essay places this basic definition into historical context by reviewing the erosion of the national government's emphasis on public duty as a prerequisite for effectiveness. Reading widely across the <italic>Federalist Papers</italic>, the author argues that the founders would be taken aback by the national government's sheer scale and complexity and would strongly restate their basic principles of a government well executed.

<p><italic>Federalist</italic> No. 51 is another of the most recognizable and important of the <italic>Federalist Papers</italic>, famously arguing that one first must enable government to control the governed, and then oblige it to control itself. The authors suggest that part of this obligation involves effective collaboration within a system of separate powers. They then ask how this “collaboration imperative” can be exercised in today's contentious political environment. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1653]</p>

<p>Do Solicitors General (SGs) influence how justices vote? Years of scholarship suggests that the answer is “yes” but has largely failed to examine what influence means and just how much influence the SG wields. The authors examine SG influence during the Court's agenda-setting stage. They find (1) that justices follow SG recommendations even when they are completely opposed to them and (2) that law exerts a strong independent influence. Justices are significantly less likely to follow SG recommendations that contravene important legal factors. [R]</p>

<p>This article analyzes EU member state political responses to ECJ challenges. Faced with high consensus requirements at the European level, member states often have to respond unilaterally and explore how to pursue autonomous regulatory goals in “EU-compatible” ways. Member states' domestic responses to one prominent series of ECJ judgments (Laval, Rüffert, Commission vs. Luxembourg) are traced from a Europe-anization perspective. The case studies show that, by forging a consensus which includes potential litigants and by building on existing legal precedent, member state governments can preserve significant parts of their original legislation while making it ECJ-proof.

<p>This article studies how Sweden's political parties handled the process of constitutional review from 2004–2008. In particular, the analysis examines how parties choose between their office-seeking, policy-seeking and vote-seeking goals and the desire to maintain intra party agreement. Three expectations are identified: (1) parties' different strategic situations lead them to advocate different long-term goals; (2) different party levels will take different stands in order to increase their influence vis-à-vis other levels; (3) party leaderships will try to increase their freedom to negotiate with others by avoiding extensive intra party debates or decisions. The study is based on 30 interviews with representatives closely involved in the constitutional reform process. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1695]</p>

<p>Neoliberal policies generated the conditions for the Great Recession, an economic downturn that hit the housing and construction industries particularly hard, disproportionately impacting the foreign-born and the undocumented populations in the US. The recession also created new openings for states and localities to criminalize and make visible the unauthorized where they live, work, and move about in their everyday lives. This increasing criminalization of the undocumented in both labor markets and civil society creates new risks and vulnerabilities to deportation, making it more difficult and dangerous for the unauthorized to continue to live in and work in the shadows of the global cities, rural farms, and slaughterhouses of the US.

<p>The law that instituted gender equality in politics was voted into effect on 6 June 2000. For the past 10 years, France has held several different levels of elections. So, we can now draw certain lessons from this law that has instituted gender quotas in all elections and has shaken up the political landscape of France. This article answers three questions: where did this law come from? How has this law succeeded in getting around the opposition to communitarianism? What are the consequences of this law on the elected assemblies? In conclusion, what is the future of this concept of gender equality in other spheres of French society? [R]</p>

<p>For years, scholars of elections have argued about whether campaign finance limitations adversely affect electoral competition. We examine how the institutional campaign finance restrictions differentially affect the performance of incumbents and challengers. Using elections for the state high court bench between 1990 and 2004, we demonstrate that candidate spending in [US] judicial elections has diminishing marginal returns, but that the returns to challenger spending diminish more slowly than incumbent spending. Since this is the case, campaign finance restrictions that limit candidate spending disproportionately harm challengers, increasing the incumbency advantage and decreasing electoral competition. More specifically, states with more stringent contribution limits have lower levels of candidate spending, and these restrictions thus put challengers at a competitive disadvantage. [R]</p>

<p>Are the EU's attempts to transfer its policies and institutions to accession and neighborhood countries sustainable and effective? To what degree do other regions of the world emulate the EU's institutional features; what are the mechanisms of, and scope conditions for, their diffusion? This introduction specifies EU-related institutional change as the dependent variable. Second, it discusses how Europeanization research and diffusion studies relate to each other and can be fruitfully combined to identify processes and mechanisms by which ideas and institutions of the EU spread. Third, we introduce scope conditions likely to affect domestic (or regional) change in response to the promotion or emulation of EU ideas and institutions.

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>Important changes are currently taking place within the French civil service, and civil servants now have to adapt to the performance requirements. To encourage profile diversity, the competitive entrance examinations for applicants to the French civil service have been redesigned. Furthermore, the development of new procedures for assessing civil servants has led to question the old methods used until recently. Thus, new measures for rating civil servants have now been implemented, with a focus on organizing advancement and promotion. This reform has also had an impact on the career management of civil servants, with the development of a performance-based compensation system. Finally, civil servant mobility within the civil service, considered to be one of the levers of the government reform process, is now also being encouraged. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Most studies of the relationship between deputy ministers (DMs) and ministers have focused on majority governments. This paper analyzes the impact of minority government on that relationship in four areas (personnel in key positions, the role of central agencies, agendas and daily relationships) on the basis of an analysis of the history of DM appointments and departures under minority governments in Canada and interviews with current DMs. It is found that, under minority governments, relationships of trust are more difficult to develop, there is a stronger tendency to develop public policy on an urgent basis and with a view to short-term issues, greater importance is attached to public opinion, and control is more centralized.

<p>We construct novel measures to assess (1) the extent to which European Union member states are using common standards in recognizing asylum seekers and (2) the extent to which the responsibilities for asylum applications, acceptances and refugee populations are equally shared among the member states, taking into account population size, gross domestic product (GDP) and GDP expressed in purchasing power parity (GDP-PPP). We track the progression of these measures since the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam (1999). These measures display divergent trends and we try to provide an interpretation of the dynamics that are constitutive of these trends. [R]</p>

<p>The global financial crisis reinvigorated ongoing debates over whether China has its own distinct and separate “model” of political economy and/or development. There is much that connects this Chinese model with previous systems of national political economies; partly in terms of specific policy preferences, but also in terms of shared basic conceptions of the distribution of power in the global order. Like these previous systems, China has come to stand as an example of an alternative to following dominant (neo-)liberal models of development. In this respect, what the China model is not and what China does not stand for might be more important than what it actually is and what it does stand for. However, the idea of a coherent and unique Chinese model has considerable purchase. [R, abr.]</p>

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>The article rests on a critical legal approach and an empirical, comprehensive sociological analysis, which prefigures the later emergence of the legal consciousness studies. Drawing on in-depth interviews, the author points out the meaning of the law for individuals who perceived they had experienced discrimination, but most of whom did not, file a complaint. She offers a very pessimistic vision of the model of the legal protection, which in her view is unable to protect the victims of discrimination, caught in an interweaving of gender, class, and race power relations. Weighing the psychological and material costs of filing complaints, as well as their low chances of achieving a successful resolution of their claim, these individuals are guided by an “ethics of survival,” rather than accepting the stigmatizing status of “victims” of discrimination.

<p>Building on previous studies of women's formal, descriptive, and substantive representation in Rwanda, this article examines women's symbolic representation, defined as the broader social and cultural impact of the greater representation of women in the Rwandan political system. It explores the cultural meanings of gender quotas by analyzing popular perceptions of women, of women's roles in politics and society more broadly, and of changing cultural practices vis-à-vis gender. Data were gathered over 24 months of ethnographic research conducted between 1997 and 2009 and by ongoing documentary research. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Critical scholars and investigative journalists have developed a significant body of evidence demonstrating how US democracy-assistance programs undermine left and center-left governments in Latin America. This article draws upon original research to examine how democracy-promotion has sought to stabilize neoliberal polyarchy in Peru, a longtime regional ally of the US. It contributes to a neo-Gramscian theorization of democracy programs by examining how “soft” tactics have contributed to the state's efforts at creating an inclusive neoliberal social order, a project which has ultimately failed. Particular attention is paid to the way in which US programs were configured and carried out to respond to the rise of the “anti-systemic” Peruvian nationalist party of O. Humala, who won the recent presidential elections in June 2011. [R]</p>

<p>The authors explore whether the federal courts act as counter-majoritarian institutions by investigating the influence of public mood on decision-making in the US Courts of Appeals from 1961 to 2002. The results indicate that public opinion affects courts of appeals decision-making indirectly through judicial replacements and institutional constrains from Congress, but the authors fail to uncover evidence that courts of appeals judges respond directly to changes in public opinion. They conclude that, absent membership turnover in the circuit or in Congress, the courts of appeals are not responsive to the will of the public. [R]</p>

<p>Many works acknowledge partisan differences in distributive benefits. Few works, however, have empirically examined the role party-building activities play in these distributions. Through Exchange Theory, we hypothesize that legislators are rewarded with distributive benefits for promoting the legislative and electoral goals of the party. Using data on party unity, member-to-member contributions, and distributive benefits, we observe these exchange relationships occurring between members and their parties in the [US] House of Representatives, as well as directly between representatives and members of the Appropriations Committee. The analyses point to the importance of political parties in distributive politics. [R]</p>

<p>Governance in higher education has undergone certain substantial shifts in recent decades. In order to analyze this process from an empirical point of view, a specific understanding of governance, based on the role of the public power in question (state, government or another such power, depending on the context) has been assumed. Changes in systemic governance (and consequently also at the institutional level) are a product in particular of governments' responses to changes in their respective environments. This theoretical assumption is employed to analyze those changes witnessed in higher education over the last 20 years, focusing on four specific national cases (England, Germany, Italy and The Netherlands). The empirical evidence shows that government continues to govern, and has not lost any of its policy-making power, but has simply changed the way it steers higher education.

<p>Public agencies have discretion on the time domain, and politicians deploy numerous policy instruments to constrain it. Yet little is known about how administrative procedures that affect timing also affect the quality of agency decisions. We examine whether administrative deadlines shape decision timing and the observed quality of decisions. Using a unique and rich dataset of FDA drug approvals that allows us to examine decision timing and quality, we find that this administrative tool induces a piling of decisions before deadlines, and that these “just-before-deadline” approvals are linked with higher rates of postmarket safety problems (market withdrawals, severe safety warnings, safety alerts). Examination of data from FDA advisory committees suggests that the deadlines may impede quality by impairing late-stage deliberation and agency risk communication. Our results both support and challenge reigning theories about administrative procedures, suggesting they embody expected control-expertise trade-offs, but may also create unanticipated constituency losses.

<p>We investigate various theories of legislative coalition-formation in a bicameral context. More specifically, we employ a quasi-experimental design to examine the size of coalitions in both the House and Senate across the late 19th and early 20th c. This offers us considerable analytical leverage in investigating how changes in key institutional decision rules (the adoption of the Reed's Rules in the House and the passage of cloture in the Senate) affect the likelihood of passing major policy reform. Our findings indicate that when the size of the majority party is adequately controlled for, changes in institutional structures do not have a significant effect on cross-chamber coalition-formation.

<p>The influence of state architecture on gender policy and politics is an emergent strand of feminist research. This paper undertakes a detailed case study of one specific gender policy area — domestic violence policy — in old federation Australia. Drawing on the experiences of the past decade, it confirms earlier research findings that demonstrate that under certain conditions, federal structures can influence the development of gender policy in positive ways, such as providing opportunities for “venue shopping” and policy innovation. The paper engages, too, with recent research on Australian federalism and challenges the consensus about the centralized nature of the Australian federal system by demonstrating that in the area of gender policy, states and territories are more than just the implementation arms of the Commonwealth government.

<p>I present a case study of an authoritarian regime in Burma [Myanmar] that used special courts not to insulate the judiciary but to defeat it. Through comparison to other Asian cases, I suggest that the Burmese regime's composition and character better explain its strategy than does extant judicial authority or formal ideology. The regime consisted of war-fighters for whom the courts were enemy territory. But absent popular support, the regime's leaders could not embark immediately on a radical project for legal change that might compromise their hold on power. Consequently, they used special courts and other strategies to defeat judicial independence incrementally, until they could displace the professional judiciary and bring the courts fully under executive control.

<p>Chancellor A. Merkel's independence from her own Christian Democratic Union (CDU) during the second Grand Coalition (2005–2009) can be seen as consistent with broader trends toward presidentialism and personalized politics. Both would suggest that any publicly popular chief executive who seems likely to win it vital voter support can expect broad latitude from a party's dominant coalition while in office. Yet there was also an important organizational dimension to Merkel's chancellorship. Parties like her CDU — with a divided dominant coalition and ever more unstable relations among its factions — would be poorly positioned to constrain a leader to begin with. Thus, as chancellor, Merkel rarely had to fear unified dissent in her own ranks when shaping policy compromises with the Social Democrats (SPD). [R]</p>

In the end, by comparing “then” and “now,” we see a pattern of negative repercussions when the energy card is employed.

<p>Based on extensive new empirical fieldwork (via a case study of the reform of the territorial state in 2007–010), this article interrogates the meaning of the prefectoral institution in France. The central puzzle this article addresses is the survival of a pre-democratic institution — the Prefect — in a democratic, decentralizing and Europeanized Republic. Changing conditions have required institutional resilience and adaptation in a period of state restructuring and rescaling. The case study of the prefectures as old institutions is framed using language and tools of new institutionalism across three dimensions: the timing and sequence of decision-making, the logic of appropriateness, and interaction. Beyond the narrow case of the prefectures in France, the article makes the case for combining modes of institutionalist analysis in order to penetrate generalities about the black box of institutions.

<p>The aim of the article is to find out what a discursive approach can reveal about the role of previous policy success and failure in the making of subsequent decisions. Questions focused on are: how are the categories of success and failure constructed? How are they used in political areas? Do they actually provide decision makers with opportunities for learning lessons about policy effectiveness, or can they be used instead as a negotiable resource in political bargaining? The article deals with these questions through an analysis of two case studies — France and the UK — concerning national area-based policies aimed at coping with the economic and social challenges affecting cities. Two dimensions on which discourses and ideas affect the construction of policies in political arenas — “axiomatic” and “pragmatic” — are identified, in which discourses about policy success and failure affect such a process in different ways.

<p>In parliamentary systems, why do party groups of the government camp initiate their own bills instead of going through the cabinet? This article suggests that such governing party group bills occur for three reasons: (1) cabinets hand out bills to the parties on the floor; (2) party groups or MPs want to signal to constituencies; or (3) parties on the floor are dissatisfied with cabinet policy making. Arguing that the absolute and relative importance of these explanations varies with institutional context, country-specific hypotheses with regard to the number of governing party group bills in Germany are tested. As expected, mechanisms (1) and (3) are especially important in explaining the occurrence of governing party group legislation in Germany. [R]</p>

<p>Most cases involving EU law are decided in national courtrooms without a preliminary reference. The influence of the Court on these cases is often overstated by focusing on headline principles, such as mutual recognition and state liability. However, application of these principles in specific cases is often mediated by open norms such as proportionality, which allow much national court discretion. Whether national judges apply these open norms in a pro-integration way determines how far the broader principles directly impact on the national legal system, and on national regulators: these latter will condition their behavior according to their expectations of the national judiciary, since these are the judges to which they are directly subject. The Court's role here is important, but limited. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2361]</p>

(2) Beyond the study of the construction of public problems, it shows that this controversy made visible the modes of problematization that lay beneath that a policy answer, in which the state had merel to promote the right conditions for the creation and development of markets. Thus the corresponding governmentality of both energy and climate raises two core questions related to the emergence of a figure of the citizen subsumed under the consumer, and to the resulting uncertainty regarding the collectives that are targeted by public policies.

<p>Using data from a five-year online survey, the paper examines the effects of relative satisfaction with health services on individuals' voice-and-choice activity in the English public health care system. Voice is considered in three parts: individual voice (complaints), collective voice voting and participation (collective action). Exercising choice is seen in terms of complete exit (not using health care), internal exit (choosing another public service-provider) and private exit (using private health care). The interaction of satisfaction and forms of voice and choice are analyzed over time. Both voice and choice are correlated with dissatisfaction, with those who are unhappy with the NHS more likely to voice privately and to plan to take up private health care. Those unable to choose private provision are likely to use private voice. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1295]</p>

Most academic accounts place undue emphasis on elite-level interaction in the policy-making process instead of focusing on the ways in which such interaction is decisively shaped by tensions within the labor movement. Specifically, trade-union leaders confront the government as members of the labor bureaucracy — a contradictory social stratum which seeks to reconcile the antagonistic interests of its working-class base with the demands of capital and the state. Insofar as it performed a social control function during socio-political crises threatening to derail pension reform, the labor bureaucracy acted in ways that are not easily explained by standard theoretical models.

Further, the public should respond to changes in direct and indirect spending in distinct ways consistent with the divergent resource and interpretive effects of the two types of spending. We find that while public opinion is not responsive to the total amount of federal social spending, it is attentive to changes in direct and indirect spending, considered as separate concepts.

<p>There are <italic>longue durée</italic> patterns that differentiate the behavior of constitutional courts in multi-nation and mono-nation federations. While constitutional courts in multi-nation federations let politics take primacy over jurisprudence, constitutional courts in mono-nation federations play an important role in bringing about constitutional change. Instead of relying on institutional/constitutional factors to explain this variation, the article proposes a sociological explanation based on differences in democratic legitimacy between mono-nation federations based on a single demos and multi-nation ones where the federation represents a union between multiple <italic>demoi</italic>. The argument is applied to the paired comparison of the Canadian Supreme Court and the German Federal Constitutional Court. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1319]</p>

<p>We examine the speed and extent to which members of the US House of Representatives adopt emerging Web-based communication technologies. Given the growing centrality of communication for governance and the Web's growing role in effective public outreach, a rational actor approach would suggest that members of Congress should aggressively exploit online communication technology. And this should especially be true for freshman members. We test these expectations using two waves of data coded from the official Web sites of the US House of Representatives, for the years 2006 and 2007. We observe that incumbents show considerable path-dependence in their Web site technology adoptions, while the sites of the freshmen who won election in 2006 are largely independent of the Web designs of their corresponding predecessors.

<p>This article analyzes the regulation of voting rights for non-citizens in the European multilevel constitutional system. The pluralist arrangement that exists in Europe due to the overlap of the legal orders of the member states, of the EU and of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is increasingly described by scholars as a “multilevel constitutional architecture”. A widespread assumption among constitutional lawyers is that the European system is a <italic>sui generis</italic> arrangement. Nevertheless, the European multilevel architecture can be meaningfully compared with other federal systems; and it can also be better understood. [R]</p>

<p>In the Italian case, the changes in the relationship between political institutions have not been accompanied either by coherent reform of the electoral system or of the constitution. In addition, the collapse of the old political parties and their replacement by personality-centered parties has also accentuated the weakness of the political bases of successive governments. Since the end of the Cold War, Italian politics has functioned in line with a bipolar logic, but the internal cohesion of the governing coalitions has repeatedly been called into question. So, too, has the leadership of the head of the government. The consequence is that Italian democracy has changed, becoming more competitive, although this change continues to be politically uncertain and institutionally unbalanced. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The author's study of the EU's Environmental Impact Assessment for the construction of key roads in BiH shows that the weakness of EU conditionality at the state level need not be replicated at the local level. Even if the process through which road-building projects need to be discussed with local communities and environmental organizations does not constitute a “hard” condition of the EU, and non-compliance would have been possible, the authorities did engage in consultative processes and the author detects a learning process over time. As a result, the effectiveness of conditionality hinges not only on the degree to which these are enforced by external actors, but on the degree to which they change processes in a manner that does not fundamentally threaten existing institutions or elites.

<p>This article discusses the prospects for constitutional reforms in Italy after the 2009 and 2010 “mid-term” elections in order to provide informed speculation of the foreseeable outcomes. It analyzes the interplay between the preferences of parties and the change of power relations among and within them in the context of the extant institutional veto-points. The article concludes that: (1) a consensual “grand reform” negotiated between government and opposition is the least likely outcome; (2) a partisan reform carried out by the governmental forces is also unlikely because of deep divisions within the governmental majority; (3) the most likely outcome is no, or very limited, reform. From a normative (liberal-democratic) perspective, given the populist constitutional preferences of S. Berlusconi, it also concludes that “no reform” is not the worst outcome. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Variation in the behavior and preferences of subnational governments is one of the areas that remain poorly understood by students of comparative decentralization and federalism. Yet, evidence suggests that this variation plays an important role in shaping intergovernmental relations. Ecuador provides an especially interesting case for systematically exploring variation in the behavior of municipalities. Rather than establishing a uniform division of competences between levels of government, the 1998 constitution called on subnational governments to apply for policy responsibilities. Using an original data-set, our analysis demonstrates that, in addition to national-level incentives, municipal-level political variables — such as the government's support base and linkages to civil society — have a strong and significant impact on the behavior of local governments.

<p>The idea that governance has replaced government, and that networks have replaced hierarchy as the dominant mode of governance, have become mainstream views in the public policy literature. We consider a key initiative of the K. Rudd government in Australia, the 2020 Summit, which, at first sight, seems like an example of network governance in action. Having considered the operation and outcomes of the Summit, however, we argue that it more accurately illustrates how governments, perhaps particularly in Westminster systems, attempt to preserve hierarchy, through a process of metagovernance.

It studies the Swedish Association for Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR) and its relationship with the Committee on Constitutional Reform (2004–2008). A common assumption in the literature is that the policy process on constitutional matters is dominated by parties in government and parliament, and that interest groups do not participate. The empirical investigation presented here, consisting of a large number of interviews and analysis of official documents, shows that SALAR not only participated in the work of the Committee on Constitutional reform, but also exercised some influence on the committee's final report.

<p>Soft law, or non-legislative modes of policy-making, is becoming increasingly common today. The Nordic countries have a long tradition soft law, not least in central-local relations, where non-binding agreements are frequently used to coordinate policies. A key question springing from soft-law theory is that of compliance. Why do independent actors comply if they are not formally obliged to do so, and what happens if they do not comply? This article addresses the question of how compliance can be achieved during policy-conflict between actors at different governing levels by investigating a case of health care reform in Sweden. An important finding in the study is that compliance was reached “in the shadow of hierarchy”. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Serious comparative research on postwar immigration politics and policy began only 30 years ago and did not really take off until the 1990s. The level of interest of scholars has naturally followed the salience of immigration issues in the politics of liberal democracies. A flood of new research is now appearing, making a review of where research has come so far timely. Immigration research in political science has confronted a number of challenges, several of which are examined here: (1) the merits and limits of comparative case studies, (2) the wedding of economic theory with political analysis, (3) the analysis of the consequences of ethnic diversity on support for redistributive social policies, and (d) the possible contradictions of a popularly supported liberal immigration policy.

<p>Comparative studies spearheaded by several international organizations in recent years offer a different perspective of legislative oversight. They emphasize a new concept, oversight potential, and suggest that strengthening this potential would help promote good governance, fight corruption and improve democracy. This study examines the concept of oversight potential in a pure parliamentary system — the Israeli Knesset. It shows that low potential impairs actual oversight in a parliamentary system that uses mainly police-patrol techniques as defined by the 1987 work of M. McCubbins and T. Schwartz. It suggests that increasing oversight potential will help improve the oversight outputs of the legislature. Finally, it develops a bottom-up legislative approach for measuring oversight potential, and by doing so it enriches this neglected field of research. [R]</p>

<p>In 2010, the High Court delivered several judgments with potentially significant implications for the protection of human rights in Australia. It invoked the doctrine of the implied constitutional freedom of communication in Aid/Watch; found that offshore processing of asylum-seekers must comply with procedural fairness and natural justice; invalidated elements of the SA government's control-order scheme as it encroached on the independence of the judiciary; and invalidated amendments to electoral laws that shortened the period for enrolment. We evaluate the implications of these decisions in the wider context of the protection of human rights in Australia. We argue that while these decisions have made an important contribution to restating the boundaries of rights protection, there are significant limitations in relying on judicial review as a mechanism of rights protection within the Australian constitutional framework.

<p>One of the most linguistically and culturally diversified countries in the world, Nepal is in the midst of linguistic and cultural chaos. One explanation for the sad situation is that the ruling elites, [in] power since the 18th c., have conducted an invisible politics of privileging languages and deliberately ignoring issues related to minority and ethnic languages to promote the languages of their choice. This invisible politics of “unplanning” of languages has helped the elites to achieve “planned” linguistic edge over the speakers of other languages. In the changed political climate, the Nepalese people have embarked upon a debate about what language policy the country should have and what roles and statuses should be accorded to the local/regional, national and international languages.

<p>The article assesses the social consequences of the democratic transition that began in Pakistan in 1988 and ended in 1999 by analysing public spending for health and education and changes in human development indicators. Available information indicates that the return to democracy did not lead to greater spending in these two sectors. It is argued that the key internal factors that hampered government commitment to social welfare were the pre-eminence among elected representatives of social groups unwilling to invest in the human capital of the majority and the dominance of the armed forces in the country's power politics.

<p>Assertions have been made about the immortality of public-sector organizations and the need for higher rates of termination of public-sector organizations. Better research demonstrated that the mortality of public-sector organizations has occurred at the highest rates observed in the private sector. How does Canadian survival of public-sector organizations compare to that in other sectors and other countries? This article compares the survival and mortality rates of Canadian public-sector organizations to those of the private sector and the non-profit sector. It also compares Canadian public-sector organizations to those in Ireland and the US, finding that Canadian federal organizations have not been immortal and that their mortality rates are among the highest detected. The pattern of Canadian public-sector organization terminations is punctuated equilibrium. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Inter-party voting coalitions in three minority cabinets were analyzed: the 38th (2004–2005), 39th (2006–2008) and 40th (2008–2011) Federal Canadian Parliaments. The paper develops a simple theory to explain the formation of voting coalitions. The theory predicts that electoral incentives and policy issues drive minority government support. The main contention is that voting coalitions are more likely to form along ideological lines, as proposed by R. Axelrod <italic>[The Conflict of Interest</italic>, Chicago, 1970]. However, the analysis also demonstrates that voting coalitions form along a second dimension in the Canadian Parliament, mainly on issues related to federalism and the province of Quebec. Some evidence is also provided to show that expected electoral gains could explain why certain parties choose to support the government more, despite ideological incentives.

<p>When can presidents direct bureaucrats to allocate government expenditures for electoral purposes? To address this question, I exploit a scandal concerning the [US] General Services Administration (GSA), an agency that contracts with private vendors to provide supplies and real estate to other agencies. Shortly after Republican losses in 2006, a White House deputy gave a presentation to GSA political appointees identifying potentially vulnerable congressional districts. I find that vendors in prioritized Republican districts experienced unusually large new contract actions from the GSA's Public Buildings Service following the presentation relative to unmentioned districts, a discrepancy that disappeared once the <italic>Washington Post</italic> broke the story. Contracts supervised by the agency's Federal Acquisition Service, by contrast, were largely unresponsive to the briefing and media scrutiny. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Even when reduced, limited, or subdued, civil society still remains a significant aspect of a state's foundation, notwithstanding its police and totalitarian nature. No political system or regime, despite its aspirations, is capable of eradicating citizens' private life, which in all its various forms makes up what is commonly referred to as “civil society”. It is impossible to eliminate civil society without eliminating the state as well. Since the abolition of serfdom in 1861, Russian citizens' rights and freedoms have been limited more than once. Seven examples of recent alterations in Russian electoral legislation indicate a diversion from constitutional norms and international standards, which makes it impossible to speak of a genuine dialogue between authority and society today.</p>

Specifically, greater preference heterogeneity weakens the impact of the average constituency views on roll-call behavior while strengthening the impact of party.

<p>Recent national and local elections in Indonesia have exposed serious short-comings in electoral governance. Millions of eligible voters continue to be omitted from voter's lists and irregularities persist in critical stages of the election such as candidate-verification and vote-counting. Such problems have undermined public confidence in the results, leading to frequent disputes and increasing levels of election-related violence. While domestic critics charge that the incompetence of election officials is the main reason for electoral shortcomings, this article argues that a more serious problem can be found in the way powers and responsibilities are divided among election-management bodies. Further institutional reforms will be needed in order to preserve public confidence in Indonesia's democratic institutions and efforts to consolidate democracy over the next decade. [R]</p>

<p>This article employs two identification strategies to estimate how much individual Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) incumbents in the Lower House of the Diet influenced the distribution of government transfers during the period 1977 to 1992. The first exploits the changes in representation following the midterm deaths of Japanese representatives. The second uses the discontinuity in LDP representation when LDP candidates win or lose elections by very narrow margins. Overall, the influence of individual representatives on central-to-locality transfers is relatively small. However, the LDP incumbents who win office by small electoral margins do appear to affect per capita central government transfers to the municipalities where the incumbent had substantial electoral support.

<p>Ireland is one of the few countries in Europe not to offer some form of suffrage to its citizens who live abroad permanently.

This paper considers the normative case for and against external voting, the current comparative context of its increasing provision among European countries and the range of ways in which voting rights abroad combine with the extensibility of citizenship by descent abroad.

<p>In recent years, China and India have extensively liberalized their economies. They have departed from the East Asian developmental states, which have restricted FDI to protect domestic industry, and the liberal FDI strategy of Latin America during a similar stage of development as they have eschewed dependent development. Instead, they have taken a “liberalization two-step,” which follows liberalization with re-regulation that varies across industrial sectors. Country and sectoral case studies demonstrate the perceived strategic value of a sector, sectoral characteristics, and the organization of state institutions shape the ways in which re-regulation varies. The Chinese state shifts from universal controls on the aggregate level to selective controls at the sectoral level. In India, the government liberalizes FDI according to state goals but re-regulates as a function of sectoral interests. [R, abr.]</p>

Using an original data-set on financial disbursements, election results, and social, economic, and demographic data from the level of the administrative districts and the election constituencies in Ethiopia, it is found that the appeasement hypothesis best explains federal disbursements. Further, it is suggested that these disbursement patterns directly affected the outcome of the subsequent 2010 parliamentary election. [R]</p>

<p>Constitutional changes in Kyrgyzstan include the country's most recent Constitution, adopted by referendum on 27 June 2010. Changes mainly concern the division of powers between the two nationally elected bodies: parliament and president. In the course of the development of Kyrgyzstan's political situation, a number of alterations in the legal regulation of these interrelated authorities have taken place. Suggestions are made about possible arrangements that would allow for reaching optimal balance in supreme power organization within the existing form of government. Such ideas aim to promote democratic and lawful development.</p>

<p>The President of the Republic has since the adoption of the 1958 Constitution been the keystone of the institutions. The presidential election by direct universal suffrage, approved in October 1962 by referendum, has made him the central element of politics. Since then, the presidential election has determined the stakes of power, whether personal or collective. It sets the rhythm of democratic life, determines its strategies, influences the programs and priorities of the various camps. [R, abr., transl.]</p>

<p>This article presents a new framework for measuring civilian control of the armed forces in post-transition Latin America. Specifically, it builds on approaches that focus on military privileges and military protest, particularly in the face of government challenges to those privileges. Adding mission performance as a third dimension both helps us measure civilian control more accurately and provides causal leverage, as the three dimensions can interact. The paper demonstrates the utility of the framework through a close-up analysis of a critical case: civil-military relations in Peru since the 1990s. [R]</p>

<p><italic>Federalist</italic> No. 67 generally is read as a vigorous defense of the chief executive and contains intense language to alleviate fears of a dictatorial president. However, it also can be read as a much deeper explication of the blend of republican and energetic government.

<p><italic>Federalist</italic> No. 71 contains a strong defense of duration in office as a source of “cool and sedate reflection” by the executive. According to Alexander Hamilton's argument, duration in office is essential for the vigilant autonomy needed to faithfully execute the laws. The author examines this argument within the context of government regulation, using the recent financial crisis and consumer safety as examples of the limits of stability and autonomy for creating vigilant autonomy. When occasions present themselves, in which the interests of the people are at variance with their inclinations, it is the duty of the persons whom they have appointed to be the guardians of those interests, to withstand the temporary delusion, in order to give them time and opportunity for more cool and sedate reflection.

<p>[US] government efforts to manage the financial crisis and to promote economic recovery have been extensive. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been distributed — and much of it now repaid — from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The Federal Reserve holds more than $2 trillion in mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loans to financial institutions, and other assets and liabilities to maintain liquidity in the financial markets. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act injected more than $600 billion into the economy through tax breaks, loans, contracts, grants, and entitlements. Congress also passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010. Yet economic recovery remains flat. The author examines the reform effort to date, key points of its primary focus, and the politics of implementing the reform as a factor in eventual economic recovery. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This study analyzes factors associated with the perceived effectiveness of committee oversight in the Ukrainian <italic>Rada</italic>. Based on two waves of original survey data, it [examines] whether Ukrainian MPs view the committee oversight process primarily as an extension of partisan politics, a forum for constituency representation and resource-distribution, or a politically independent process of information-acquisition and regulation. The findings suggest that partisan political considerations do not play a significant role in shaping MP attitudes towards committee oversight. Rather, deputy evaluations of the oversight process are influenced mainly by distributional and informational factors, suggesting that committee oversight is one area in which legislative institutionalisation appears to be taking root in post-communist Ukraine.

<p>This article argues that US counterinsurgency doctrine forms a program of both liberal rule and liberal war whose ultimate purpose is the pacification of recalcitrant populations and their eventual (re)integration into the networks of liberal governance. Designed to promote “safe” forms of life while eradicating “dangerous” ones, the doctrine constitutes a response to both the biopolitical problematization of human (in)security and the geostrategic problematization of US national security. Ultimately, counterinsurgency's production and implementation of a biopolitical differentiation between “safe” and “dangerous” human lives is likely not only to reinforce existing societal divisions within targeted populations but also to create new global, regional and local divisions and to generate resistance to what many people will always view as imperial domination.

<p>This study explicates the nature of North Korea's party-military relations by investigating high-level officials who are involved in Kim Jong-Il's field-inspection visit to the military. We have built a hypothesis that Kim Jong-Il is more likely to employ party cadre to seize control over the military, based upon his grown-up and early career backgrounds tied with party cadres. A survival-analysis model is adapted to test the hypotheses. The results prove that party cadres are more likely to accompany Kim Jong-Il's field-inspection to combat units while top military leaders are more visible in his inspection to military art performance.

<p>Since the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution decade (1966–1976), post-Mao China has witnessed a sustained period of unprecedented legal reform. Criminal prosecutions and citizen lawsuits against the government, because they pit individual litigants against the authoritarian Chinese state, are two politically significant areas of law. We examine and critically assess the socio-legal scholarship on criminal and administrative legal reform as it has developed over the past few decades, with special attention to shifts in the conventional wisdom regarding legal reform and political liberalism in China and elsewhere. Additionally, we offer both theoretical and empirical suggestions for enhancing the explanatory power of socio-legal research in China. [R]</p>

<p>We analyze the impact on employment, wage inequality, public expenditure, and incomes of poor households of three different policy options currently being discussed in Germany: a statutory minimum wage, a combination of minimum wages and wage subsidies, and pure wage subsidies to low-paid workers. In doing so, we distinguish between perfectly competitive and monopsonistic labor markets. We find that a minimum wage of EUR 7.50 would cost between 410,000 and 840,000 low-paid jobs, increasing the fiscal burden, while only moderately raising the income of poor households. With pure wage subsidies, the government can always ensure more favorable employment effects. Combining a minimum wage with a wage subsidy turns out to be extremely costly and inferior to wage subsidies in all respects. [R, abr.]</p>

<p><italic>Federalist</italic> No. 10 contains an optimistic view of the national government's ability to fulfill its obligations in the midst of what was, at the time, a small but challenged nation. This essay suggests that the founders did not anticipate the pernicious effects of rent-seeking, corruption, and repression of minorities, and they failed to anticipate the calamities associated with slavery. The essay asks about the role of government as a party machine, a business, a policy process, and a contractor and examines a variety of contemporary theories for explaining government performance.

<p>Corporate governance reform has been a <italic>cri de coeur</italic> for two decades now. Starting with the advocacy of the liberal market model, proponents of reform have changed, sometimes radically so, their beliefs. Three recent books that examine this history arrive at distinctive interpretations why countries did not converge on the liberal market model. For P. Culpepper [<italic>Quiet Politics and Business Power: Corporate Control in Europe and Japan</italic>, Cambridge, 2011], this means the back rooms, where lobbyists and legislators hammer out future regulations. For J. Cioffi [<italic>Public Law and Private Power: The Comparative Political Economy of Corporate Governance Reform in the Age of Finance Capitalism</italic>, New York, 2010], the rooms are less sinister, but populated by experts who are skilled but hardly naïve technicians. M. Goyer <italic>[Contingent Capital: Short-term Investors and the Evolution of Corporate Governance in France and Germany</italic>, Oxford, 2011] prefers a more oxygenated realm of analysis whereby actors are constrained less by the making of law and regulations than by institutions. The merits of these distinctive contributions are compared through an analysis of the takeover of the German firm Mannesmann by the UK-based Vodafone. [R]</p>

<p>This article argues that from the very start of the transition process in Macedonia, a fusion of concerns about security and democratization locked local nationalist elites and international organizations into a political dynamic that prioritized security over democratization. This dynamic resulted in little progress in the implementation of human and minority rights until 2009, despite heavy EU involvement in Macedonia after the internal warfare of 2001. The effects of this informally institutionalized relationship have been overlooked by scholarship on EU enlargement towards Eastern Europe, which has made generalizations based on assumptions relevant to the democratization of countries in Eastern Europe, but not the Western Balkans.

<p>This article examines the relationship between nation-building and social policy in post-independence sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It argues that post-independence nationalist leaders used health, housing, and education programs to foster a sense of national unity that would transcend the existing ethnic divisions created by the arbitrary drawing of state boundaries during colonization. Yet, in SSA, the neo-liberal turn of the 1980s favored the decline of state-level integration and solidarity, which helped trigger territorial mobilization and fragmentation. As a consequence, the politics of welfare retrenchment in SSA does more than simply reduce benefits and increase inequalities; it also potentially weakens national unity. [R]</p>

<p>This article examines the centrality of inter-departmental coordination (horizontal coordination) in resolving complex cross-sectoral policy issues. It is also concerned with the link between horizontal coordination and improved governmental performance and national planning. In South Africa, attempts at such horizontal coordination and planning have not been very successful. The failure in 1996 of the reconstruction and Development Program (RDP) Office is a case point. More recent developments in the presidency have seen the establishment of a national Planning Commission which is tasked with the responsibility of establishing long-term planning, inter-departmental coordination and policy integration. In addition, a new department has been established within the Presidency — the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) — which has a mandate to ensure the greater realization of government's service-delivery objectives.

<p>With its strong [infusion of] ideology, Hungary's new constitution presents an exceptional case among European constitutions. However, criticism that the current government is abandoning the rule of law is not true.

Nonetheless, it provides some starting points for an illiberal majority to curtail the rule of law. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.2731]</p>

<p>This paper analyzes how the financial crises were managed by the governments of the US and South Korea. The US government's stalwart support and intervention in its market, as reflected in the $787 billion stimulus legislation, is in direct contrast to what obtained during the post-financial crisis in South Korea. Under the structural adjustment program of the IMF and the guideline of neo-liberalism, the Kim Dae Jung government took drastic steps to market reform which overhauled a fragile financial system in order to resuscitate the economy. Using a comparative political economic analysis of post-crisis reforms of these states, we reevaluate the promise and result of neo-liberalism, and explore the relationship between states and markets.

<p>Militaries throughout the world operate their own courts to prosecute military crimes, that are not part of civilian legal codes. Latin American militaries traditionally have extended this hermetic justice system to cover all crimes committed by their personnel, allowing the institution to sit in judgment of its own actions and escape punishment for human rights violations. This parallel legal system erodes the principle of equality before the law, threatens civilian control of the military, and nurtures a culture of impunity. This article develops a theoretical model to explain the state of military court jurisdiction over military personnel for human rights violations in democracies. It then empirically tests this model on seventeen cases in Latin America. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The paper adopts a historical institutionalist approach to Europeanization and argues that policy-change is facilitated by three factors. (1) It is driven by “soft” mechanisms of Europeanization such as policy-transfer. The EU provides the framework for reform and functions as a platform of best practices. Policy-transfer mechanisms are implemented in order for member states to pick and choose institutions. (2) Domestic mediating factors such as policy preferences are as important as EU obligations. The introduction of the Ombudsman to Greece, Cyprus and Malta demonstrates that soft mechanisms can be effective, as long as the political leadership prioritizes the reform. (3) Policy-change depends on time. Member states adjust their policies and institutions over time. The most common outcome of this adjustment is inertia or incremental change rather than convergence.

The paper relies on this information to demonstrate to what degree the job stability of magistrates can be explained in terms of the institutional conditions that regulate the judicial system. Our analysis emphasizes that the survival of magistrates is determined by the stability of the constitutional framework, rather than any specific legal content. [R]</p>

<p>For approximately two decades, the federal regulation for third-party election spending was the focus of repeated constitutional debate. However, with the 2004 Supreme Court decision in <italic>Harper v. Canada</italic>, a relative level of policy stability has been established.

Using an original data-set compiled from third-party election advertising reports from the 2004, 2006 and 2008 federal elections, this article offers the first empirical analysis of this important election policy. During this three-election cycle, third parties quite simply did not spend significant amounts. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>After a controversial ban on Islamic headscarves in schools in 2004, the French government now goes further in banning the wearing of the full-body <italic>burka</italic> by adult women in public spaces generally. The ban raises important questions regarding constitutional politics, liberal political theory, identity-formation and the legitimate social expectations of majority cultures.

<p>One of the challenges of decentralized systems is ensuring intergovernmental cooperation. This paper [examines] the conditions that bring about cooperation between central and sub-national governments. Drawing on extensive data based on the Spanish case, empirical findings show that factors that have a bearing on cooperation are associated with non-tangible assets of intergovernmental relations (such as informal contacts among representatives) or more general and long-term political dynamics. Public practitioners have little room to modify these conditions, which highlight the limitations of administrative reforms to promote intergovernmental relations. [R]</p>

<p>The 1993 National Voter Registration Act authorizes nonprofit social service organizations to conduct nonpartisan voter registration drives, with the aim of making the process more accessible for low-income citizens and segments of the population historically underrepresented in the political process. Although more than 15 years have elapsed since this important reform was enacted, very little is known about the extent to which nonprofits have embraced this practice, and what factors explain their decision to do so. Drawing upon institutional theory, this article examines the propensity of nonprofit social service organizations to carry out nonpartisan voter registration and voter mobilization campaigns in a national election year. A series of hypotheses are tested using data from a random sample of several hundred nonprofit service organizations in the US surveyed prior to the 2008 election. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>China's water-abstraction policies are significant for illustrating the application of market-based instruments in a transitional and developing country and for shedding light on improving China's water-management system. This article presents a new approach to analyzing applications of market-based instruments for water resources in China. Expanding the analysis beyond a rational choice approach, it demonstrates the institutional dimension of policy implementation at the local level in China. Four peculiar features of China's water institutions influence local governments in dealing with water-abstraction differently from how regulators might expect. This explains local governmental failures and the implementation of water-abstraction policies in several ways, including the setting of charges at low levels, a lack of necessary monitoring and sanctions, few incentives to collect charges diligently, and failure to provide accessible information for the public.

<p>Scholarship on Chinese governance has examined a range of factors that help to explain the resilience of authoritarianism. One understudied aspect of regime resilience and institutionalization has been the growing importance of supervision by a range of party-state entities. Examining court-media relations in China demonstrates that “competitive supervision” is an increasingly important tool for increasing state responsiveness and improving accountability. Court-media relations suggest that China is seeking to develop novel forms of horizontal accountability. Placing such relations in a broader institutional context also helps to explain why common paradigms used to analyze them may be inapplicable in China. [R]</p>

The case shows an ongoing conflict between a conception of the reform that remains devoted to the political nature of public decisions and one that links public decisions to economic and budgetary constraints.

<p>This article examines the meanings of politics in everyday legal practice using the case of Chinese criminal defense lawyers. Based on 194 in-depth interviews with criminal defense lawyers and other informants in 22 cities across China, we argue that lawyers' everyday politics have two faces: lawyers potentially can challenge state power, protect citizen rights, and pursue proceduralism in their daily work; on the other hand, they often have to rely on political connections with state agencies to protect themselves and to solve problems in their legal practice. The double meanings of politics — political liberalism and political embeddedness — explain the complex motivations and coping tactics that are frequently found in Chinese lawyers' everyday work.

<p>This article focuses on Public Service Bargains (PSBs) in the OECD world in an age of austerity and makes four main claims. (1) Both logic and recent history suggest that states can respond to financial crises in more than one way. (2) The pressures on existing PSBs are not all the same in this group of states, given observable differences in their financial vulnerability. (3) We analyze countries' differential exposure to two other major challenges, namely, that of population aging and environmental risk. (4) Those areas of vulnerability can counteract one another in some cases but be mutually reinforcing in others; “triply vulnerable” states in a composite analysis are those likely to face the strongest pressure to change their existing PSBs. While homogenizing pressures cannot be ignored, PSB diversity is likely to continue. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1545]</p>

<p>Ministerial staff relationships form part of the networks within the core executive. This article uses data from a comprehensive empirical study of Australian ministerial staff to explore advisers' horizontal relationships with each other. It finds that the interactions between Australian ministerial advisers are a key part of their role, are highly valued by ministers and public servants, and are an important element of the cabinet system. The informal links and networks between partisan advisers are underpinned by commonly understood norms of behavior and a clear power structure. This partisan arena of the core executive has become important to ministers and the collective functioning of government. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1295]</p>

<p>This paper ponders the question of whether MPs' previous experiences and personal attributes may have any impact on the way they behave once elected. In agreement with a recent stream of literature, the authors hypothesize that MPs with strong territorial roots might behave as agents of the local community, promoting its interests and demands in their parliamentary activity. The assertion that individual biographies influence legislative activity in parliamentary democracies runs counter to the commonly held view that in this kind of institutional setting, legislative assemblies are dominated by parties, leaving little room for individually oriented behavior and little incentive to do anything that is not coordinated by party organizations.

<p>Citizens engagement in the co-production of public services is becoming increasingly important to stimulate a participatory democracy.

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>Because China is at the center of a repositioning of the international scene, at both the financial and the political levels, it is a cause of discussion about state investment abroad. What is particularly fascinating is that China has developed a number of sovereign funds (SFs) and that they behave in substantially different ways. How can this divergence be explained? This article presents an exploratory model that allows the development of new hypotheses about the causes of diversity in the profiles of the Chinese SFs on the international scene. The explanatory variable is the mixture of political coalitions in the Chinese leadership, which have had an impact on the creation, mandates and investment strategies of the Chinese SFs.

<p>This article examines how the emergence of coalition governance within the UK poses fresh challenges not just to the politicians and officials who must govern through a new pattern of relationships, but also to scholars who must develop new tools of political analysis in terms of concepts, theories and methods. It is in this context that article examines the changing nature of governance in the UK and particularly how political and administrative actors are responding to the challenges of “coalitionization” within what has traditionally been conceptualized as a power-hoarding majoritarian democracy.

<p>The Government of Canada has been engaged in a massive redistribution of wealth and income from some provinces — usually British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario — to the other provinces and territories. This redistribution has been accomplished through a number of federal government programs presented to the public as having nation-wide applicability and not necessarily designed to meet the needs of any particular province or territory. These federal programs are part of a coherent redistributive whole, but each demonstrates how redistribution has been accomplished. The extent of this redistribution is discussed, as are the reasons for this redistributive focus and the impact of such large-scale federal transfers on provincial budgets. Finally, I assess why the degree of redistribution appears to have been reduced in recent years. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In mid-2011, it certainly looks as if England does not love coalitions, or at any rate the coalition that is governing it. The phrase was coined by Benjamin Disraeli in 1852. This article begins with the context in which Disraeli spoke, then gradually broadens its scope from England to the UK to the set of advanced democracies. Modern political economy has a great deal to say on the subject of coalitions. In conclusion we return to the prospects for future coalitions and minority governments in the UK. [R]</p>

<p>The office of UK Minister for Sport was created in 1964 at a junior level in government and has had 14 post-holders up to 2011. [Although] sport has become increasingly politicized, decisions to bid for major events such as the 2012 Olympics are made at Cabinet level, from which the Minister for Sport is excluded. What do Sports Ministers actually do? This article looks at relevant aspects of government sports policy, the influence that Ministers for Sport may have had on it and the limitations of that influence. It then examines the activities of the Ministers in Parliament, including the proportion of their time actually spent on sport. Finally, it assesses the holders of the office themselves and, in particular, their prospects for promotion in government. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Little attention has been paid to the factual contribution of the state's security forces to the physical security of African citizens. In many African crisis countries the realization of better security forces appears to be an elusive goal, either because violent conflicts are not definitively settled and therefore do not allow for decent reform or because a lack of capacity as a result of material constraints is not easy to remedy. Above all, the political will of governments to reform their security forces, including their composition and structure, is often limited. This contribution compares the security provision by official forces in Liberia and the Central African Republic, two extreme cases of strong and weak international involvement. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article analyzes from an anthropological perspective the 2010 Belgrade Pride Parade, the first state-supported Parade in Serbia, as a part of the building of a democratic and European Serbian nation. In their discursive framing of the Parade and making claims on the state to take it under its auspices, the organizing NGOs bound the event to the EU integration process of Serbia. This policy link helped them forge a political alliance with the state, but was also instrumentalized by the government to avoid an ideological conflict with the opponents of the Parade. Owing to the perception of the alliance as “elitist” and to the militarized and depoliticized nature of the state's involvement, the event materially actualized and reified rather than transcended the enduring conflict of liberal and collectivist citizenship visions in Serbia.

<p>The terrorist attacks of 7 August 1998 raised serious questions about transnational and domestic terrorism in Kenya and the Horn of Africa. What motivated terrorists to target Kenya? Why Kenya? Could these attacks have been stopped? How did Kenya and the international community respond to the attacks? Not only did the attacks target Western (US and Israel) interests but also Kenyan interests. This article critically examines the counter-terrorism (CT) measures that have been taken in Kenya in response to the attacks and threats made on the country. It describes the measures, explains the rationale and motivations behind them and assesses their effectiveness. While these measures address the perceived main causes of terrorism in Kenya, the assumptions upon which they are based are often flawed. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Crises are unexpected events that trigger and enable change in the policy regime. To analyze how the policy paradigm changes, this paper analyzes three different crises: Argentina in 2000–2003, Spain in 2008–2011, and Mexico in 1994–1996. The question is: how does crisis trigger change in the policy regime? To answer, I show that crises destroy the government's coalition, enable the formation of new coalitions that face the crisis that are also substituted after the crisis for a new coalition to institutionalize the new policy paradigm.

<p>In the 1960s, social scientists speculated about the consequence of legal, cultural, and racial pluralism in Africa after independence. Now, 50 years later, we know that, though transformed, cultural pluralism remains a shaping force. In Tanzania, from the 1960s on, there was an effort to build equality and national loyalty through socialism. In South Africa, after 1994, there were two major kinds of legislation that rejected the racially divisive past and attempted to repair its damage. One established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission; the other was a cluster of laws that designed a scheme of land reform. Both have been studied by anthropologists. I review the Tanzanian and the two South African instances. The incompleteness and unevenness of what has been achieved can be compared with the grand legislative intentions that preceded the law-making. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article begins with T.H. Marshall's essay on citizenship and its significance in confirming equal social standing, seen here as a precursor to work on rights and recognition. C. Taylor and A. Honneth are taken as exemplars of a dialogical perspective, whereby recognition through rights can provide a source of identity-formation, though Honneth's approach is broader in scope, being less confined to the issue of cultural rights. This work is argued to be complementary to the status-based approach to rights found in D. Lockwood's work on civic stratification, and the insights derived from both authors provide the basis for interrogation of a legal case history on UK withdrawal of welfare from in-country asylum-claimants. Analysis of this history draws attention to the role of judgment in forging a link between rights and recognition. [R]</p>

<p>The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111–148), or ACA, requires that US citizens either purchase health insurance or pay a fine. To offset the financial burden for lower-income households, it also provides subsidies to ensure that health insurance premiums are affordable. However, relatively little work has been done on how such affordability standards should be set. The existing literature on affordability is not grounded in social norms and has methodological and theoretical flaws. To address these issues, we developed a series of hypothetical vignettes in which individual and household sociodemographic characteristics were varied. We then convened a panel of eighteen experts with extensive experience in affordability standards to evaluate the extent to which each vignette character could afford to pay for one of two health insurance plans.

<p>Based on ethnographic fieldwork carried out between 2003 and 2005, this article examines how legality is constructed in present-day Adamaoua Province, Cameroon. Focusing on an instance of a process locally referred to as <italic>la concertation</italic>, I analyze how state officials and cattle-traders gather to discuss the practical fate of law. As a heightened moment of suspended enforcement, <italic>la concertation</italic> is productive for both officials, who work out the limits of their respective spheres of authority and imagine a trade based on business norms and practices that severely limit the scope of regulatory action, and traders, who manage to stave off the increased scrutiny that income tax law presupposes, while asserting their concern for the integrity and consistency of the law.

<p>The notion that the prime minister of Canada wields autocratic power is common in popular and academic discourse. D. Savoie's work on the subject implies that this is an inevitable result of centripetal forces in Canadian politics, combined with a process of centralization that began with P. Trudeau in the late 1960s. P. Aucoin's analysis of the role of prime ministerial management styles, however, suggests that there may be more scope for individual agency than a narrow reading of Savoie implies. An investigation of the decision-making process in the Trudeau government that led to the invocation of the War Measures Act in October 1970 lends credence to the view that, despite centralizing pressures, the exercise of prime ministerial power is significantly shaped by personal style.

<p>In Francophone Sub-Saharan Africa, in the post-colonial era, the army has played a major role in the exercise of political power. The wave of democratization of the 1990s called into question this conception. Many thought that this would put an end to military activism. However, during the last two decades, the armed forces have indulged in numerous intrusions in the political game. This may be considered a serious threat to democracy. However, despite some hostility towards democratic principles, the army sometimes acts in order to protect democratic regimes or fight corruption. The redefinition of the army's prerogatives and mission is a complex task which can be carried out only through dialogue and cooperation between civil and military institutions.</p>

<p>Hiroshima and Nagasaki are renowned internationally for experiencing the first twin devastating nuclear attacks in history. Unfortunately, Japan has witnessed several other serious nuclear-related disasters in recent years. The much-publicized Fukushima disaster in 2011 is one of them. How could such a serious accident occur in a modern, highly sensitive, nuclear-conscious country? The answer is complex, involving not only political and administrative issues but also technical and human dimensions. In retrospect, both government officials and private industry were far too lax with the operation and development of nuclear policies and facilities. The Fukushima debacle was the result of a lack of rigorous management and control of nuclear issues by both public authorities and private industry. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The EU takes a growing interest in governing the energy sector in its member states. Competing with national institutions, policies and organizational structures, it is however not clear whether the EU exerts a strong influence compared to other factors, and if there is such an influence, the mechanisms are not well understood. This paper examines strategic reorientation towards electricity investment in the Swedish energy sector, a “frontrunner case” of Europeanization, and discusses how this change can be attributed to EU policy-change, national policy-change and organizational field developments respectively. It finds that EU energy policy influence has been notable, and that governance mechanisms that shape beliefs and expectations are strongly at play.

The authors propose a view from the inside, describing the system and its deployment, as set up by Nigeria's Independent Electoral Commission (NIEC). In addition to describing this ambitious biometric project — the first of its kind in West Africa — they present a narrative and a fine-grained analysis of the interactions between federal government officials and men and women voters at the registration site. The authors sketch the areas of agreement and dissent surrounding the electoral process; in its shadow we see the stakeholders and elements of uneven success.

<p>The Committee on Constitutional Reform was appointed by the government to conduct a review of the Swedish Constitution.

However, it initiated a parallel reform aimed at the reorganization of the Swedish National Audit Office. The issue was investigated and decided upon, and the consequences of the reform were evaluated. This way of organizing constitutional change is atypical of Swedish constitutional policy. Moreover, the changes have had greater constitutional implications for Parliamentary Control than the work of the Committee on Constitutional reform. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.1695]</p>

<p>This article investigates the influence of partisanship, religion, and district need on legislative behavior pertaining to food policy. Historically, policy-making is this area has been decidedly bipartisan, because it provided opportunities for logrolling among legislators. As the parties became more ideologically polarized and as budget pressures mounted, some suggested the food coalition would break down. To test this argument, this article analyzes legislative behavior on food and agriculture measures in the US House of Representatives in 106th Congress. The findings indicate that while party, ideology, religion, and district need all affect legislative behavior, there is still a bipartisan majority coalition of legislators that supports food assistance.

<p>The changing nature of state-business relations in China can be analyzed in light of recent privatization experiences. Drawing on an analytical framework based on statist literature, the pervasive governance problems occurring during the privatization of local government-owned firms can be explained by two contributing factors. These are the state's declining capacity to regulate the market and its reduced autonomy from emerging elites. Consequently, local states were transformed from those in which there was “embedded autonomy” to those with a “clientelistic” form. Thus, the conventional wisdom that local states have played a positive role in China's economic development is subject to question. A more nuanced understanding of cronyism helps explain the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and capitalists. [R]</p>

Justices A. Scalia and S. Breyer write the clearest opinions, while Justice R.B. Ginsburg consistently writes the most complex opinions. (2) Ideology does not predict clarity in majority or concurring opinions. (3) All justices write clearer dissents than majority opinions, while minimum winning coalitions produce the clearest majority opinions. (4) Justices across the board write clearer opinions in criminal procedure cases than in any other issue area. (5) Opinions that formally alter Court precedent render less clear law, potentially leading to a cycle of legal ambiguity. [R]</p>

<p>The authors analyze gender differences in members' speech participation on the floor of the US House of Representatives.

The authors hypothesize that women's under-representation, coupled with the related challenges that female legislators face in a predominantly male institution, motivates congresswomen of both parties to speak at greater rates than congressmen. Analyzing over ten thousand floor speeches during the 103rd and 109th Congresses, the authors find strong support for their hypothesis, demonstrating that congresswomen's participation in legislative debate increases their visibility and enhances women's substantive representation.

<p>For the past 15 years the international community has assumed that by strengthening legislative capacity, legislatures are better equipped to oversee government activity and spending, to keep governments accountable, to secure good governance, prevent corruption, and create the conditions for sustainable economic development. The paper tests this set of assumptions by focusing on one of the oversight tools that the international community regards as particularly important, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).

<p>This study estimates the impact of education on voter-turnout. The identification relies on a reform, which increased the length of compulsory schooling in Norway from seven to nine years. The impact is measured both at the individual, and the municipality level. Both sets of analysis suggest that additional education has no effect on voter-turnout.

<p><italic>Federalist</italic> No. 72 is an oft-neglected defense of the president's re-eligibility for election. However, the paper goes well beyond this issue to basic models of human nature and motivation. This essay confronts this broad issue as a guide to “a public service ethic”. Like other authors in this special issue, this author reads broadly through the <italic>Federalist Papers</italic> in search of a deeper definition of public service motivation as a balance between the potency of passion and the limits of reason. Controlling passion was no doubt important to the founders, but it may have drowned out the greater good envisioned in public service commitments to acting on behalf of the people.

<p>The Faith-Based and Community Initiative (FBCI) was one of the most high-profile domestic policy initiatives of the G.W. Bush administration and a unique exercise in administrative policy-making. This analysis of federal-level implementation examines the actions taken to operationalize the FBCI and to realize its goals of enabling faith-based and community organizations (FBCOs) to provide social services with federal funding. Despite being labeled as social welfare policy, the FBCI was more a special-purpose procurement policy. As an administrative policy initiative, the FBCI succeeded in those areas subject to the greatest level of executive branch influence: administrative rule-changes and federal agency spending. These actions made for a legacy of success in establishing a reformed federal procurement environment for FBCOs. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>B. Obama campaigned for and was elected president amid an economic and financial crisis many called the worst since the 1930s. Many progressive voters hoped that the crisis of capitalism would lead to a sharp break with neoliberal public policies on the domestic front, perhaps in the form of a “New New Deal”. What have been the results as we move towards the presidential campaign of 2012? This article explores the distinct nature of Obama's political economy and how it has shaped his approach to the economic stimulus, banking and financial regulation, and health care reform. Obama's centrist approach, his quest for “business confidence,” and the clout of powerful private economic interests (“capital”) have resulted in as much continuity with, rather than departure from, neoliberalism.

<p>The economic crisis of 2007 caused a worsening of the public budget in almost all developed economies.

Default, consolidation by inflation and budget-consolidation could be considered for crisis-management. Furthermore, the European Stabilization mechanism was set up permanently to provide relief payments in case of a fiscal crisis of a Eurozone member. There is much to be said for it, but markedly negative incentives are against it. Prospectively, the way the reformed Stability and Growth Pact will be executed will be crucial. If the tightening of the pact will be inadequately implemented, the equilibrium within the Eurozone will be shifting permanently to an unopposed free-riding. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article argues that housing reforms imposed by the military regime, and largely preserved by the center-left <italic>Concertación</italic> since the 1990 transition to democracy, represent substantial impediments to collective action and the development of social capital among Chile's urban poor. In particular, housing policy exacerbates social stratification, reinforces workers' vulnerability to market forces and undermines social trust. These dynamics and the institutional structures which perpetuate them constrain social cohesion and collective action among the urban poor. The broader implication is that social reforms structured in a manner similar to Chile's housing program vitiate the cohesion of disadvantaged communities, thus making it difficult for them to work together to improve their welfare and to hold public officials accountable.

<p>I argue that presidents use unilateral powers for particularistic aims to gain electoral support. Specifically, I examine [US] presidential disaster declarations, which allow presidents to unilaterally authorize potentially billions of dollars to specific constituencies. In an analysis extending from 1981 to 2004, I find that a state's electoral competitiveness influences whether [it] receives a disaster declaration from the president. A highly competitive state can expect to receive twice as many presidential disaster declarations as an uncompetitive state. This relationship has existed since the passage of the 1988 Stafford Act, which expanded the disaster declaration powers of the president. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The US military's “don't ask, don't tell” (DADT) policy has been controversial since its adoption in 1993. The policy has been criticized as discriminatory for tolerating or fostering homophobic attitudes and behavior, and as detrimental to military effectiveness. This article examines the results of recent votes in the US Congress to repeal DADT to identify factors that may predict members' votes on morality issues, such as DADT. Our results demonstrate that the members' political ideology and the political party preference of the members' home district or state are strong predictors of how the members voted on repeal of DADT. For members of the House of Representatives, freshmen members were more likely than their colleagues to vote in ways that coincided with the political preferences of their home district. [R]</p>

<p>Every new president raises many questions in the public mind. Because B. Obama was a relative newcomer to the [US] national political scene, he raised more questions than most and still does two years into his presidency. I trace the intertwined developmental arcs of the president's late-blooming ambition and his ambivalent relationships with both of his parents and his own core identity. Obama's efforts to reconcile the conflicting experiences and feelings he had as he navigated these psychological currents have a great deal to do with how he has approached his presidency. Obama is a president of enormous intelligence and considerable political skill, but his presidency has faltered in part because of the mismatch between his redemptive and transformational ambitions and the public's willingness and readiness to support them.

To answer this question, the text investigates the political events associated with standing order reforms. Two results are emphasized. On the one hand, and contrary to common views, the study shows that the reforms were not casual or episodic, but resulted from different sets of political pressure, internal or external to the parliamentary ambit. This fact, on the other hand, draws attention to the need to go deeper into the question of the institutional evolution of the liberal parliament, chiefly with regard to relations among institutional actors.

<p>How do alterations in electoral rules shape competition? This article analyzes district-level competition in six legislative elections in South Korea (1988–2008) to identify whether Duvergerian pressures are restricting the number of competitors. South Korea provides a unique opportunity to analyze variation in mixed election rules, where seats are allocated in both single-member districts (SMDs) and a nationwide list by proportional representation (PR), as the country has used three different electoral formulas over the time period. Through quantitative analysis, evidence of a gradual reduction in the number of candidates is evident, despite a history of regional voting, thus resembling Duvergerian expectations. [R]</p>

<p>This article examines the extent to which race and ethnicity affect mobility to leadership positions within [the US] Congress. The authors utilize survival analysis to examine the rate at which legislators attained committee leadership positions between the 101st and 108th Congresses. The results show that black legislators attain leadership positions faster than white legislators. This may be because of the tendency for black members of Congress (MCs) to sit on less prestigious committees than white MCs, which creates greater opportunity for institutional promotion. Ethnicity, on the other hand, does not matter to mobility, as Latinos acquire leadership positions at the same rate as non-Latino legislators. [R]</p>

<p>This article analyzes the protracted process by which democratized Uruguay has come to terms with its legacy of human rights violations. Central to this process has been the nature of Uruguayan transitional policies and their more recent partial unraveling. Due to the negotiated transition to electoral democracy, civilian political elites approached the transitional dilemma of balancing normative expectations and political contingency by promulgating legal immunity, for years avoiding initiatives to pursue trials or launch an official truth commission, unlike neighboring Argentina. A constellation of national and transnational factors (including recurrent initiatives by social and political forces) eventually opened up new institutional ground for belated truth-telling and accountability for some historical wrongs — and yet, attempts to challenge the blanket legal impunity failed twice through popular consultation and in a recent parliamentary vote.

<p>During the last eleven years, Syria has undergone very important economical and social changes that have modified the very nature of the regime. This investigation seeks to explore the Syrian charities in order to seize, through them, the transformations of authoritarianism in Syria under the presidence of Bashar al-Asad. The main hypothesis is that shrinking state resources together with the regional and international political conjuncture have led the Baathist regime to promote certain segments of the Syrian civil society, among which charitable projects are the most important. These new policies regarding the associational sector have taken place in the context of a state readjustment where the redefinition of public policy is both based on the partial privatization of social welfare and in logic of partial state “off-loading”. Both factors reflect a clear rethinking of the previous social pact. [R]</p>

This could mean that the [German] political system should no longer be viewed as parliamentary, but rather as subject to “hybridization”. [On the contrary], close empirical examination points out that attempts by German presidents to upgrade their executive powers have been fruitless. Systematical analysis of all [bills] refused by the President reveals that the federal presidents concerned handled that instrument with considerable care. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>We argue that the concept of affordable health insurance is rooted in a social obligation to protect fair equality of opportunity. Specifically, health insurance helps keep people functioning normally and it protects their financial security. Together these benefits enable household members to exercise reasonable choices about their plans of life. To achieve truly affordable coverage, society must be able to contain the overall cost of health care, and health insurance must be progressively financed, meaning that those who are best able to pay for coverage should pay the largest share. While the recently passed [US] Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) falls short on both of these counts, we argue that it makes important contributions toward household affordability through the use of subsidies and regulations.

<p>Most theories about electoral system choice are based on the experiences of Western European countries, many of which shifted from majority/plurality rule to proportional representation (PR) at the turn of the 21th c. This article aims to explain the choice of the South Korean legislative electoral [single member district plurality] system in 1988 as an example of electoral institution choices in new democracies, which may be different from those in the Western European countries. It suggests three potentially generalizable findings. First, in new democracies, labor parties can only induce old parties to shift to a proportional representation system if they have mobilized the working class prior to democratization. Secondly, parties in the developing world at times face unusual systems that are neither majoritarian nor fully PR. Under such unusual systems, party size would not be a reliable predictor for the party's preference over electoral institutions. Finally, when parties choose a legislative electoral institution in a presidential system, they tend to prefer an institution that helps them in the subsequent presidential election even though the institution might harm them in the upcoming legislative election.

<p>Many post-colonial states use ethnically-based redistribution (EBR) programs to address economic inequalities between dominant minority communities and professedly autochthonous majority communities. Nevertheless, despite considerable efforts, such programs have generally failed in terms of advancing the economic status of majorities. I suggest that EBRs in post-colonial states are not solely intended to ameliorate economic gaps, but rather are also a policy tool used by governing elites to advance a narrative of state ownership, and by extension a decidedly non-liberal notion of democratic citizenship. I explore this claim through an analysis of Malaysia and Fiji, two post-colonial states characterized by persistent asymmetric claims by ethnic majorities who claim legitimacy by virtue of indigenousness.

<p>American liberals and conservatives agree that the Constitution's ambiguous allocation of foreign policy powers to the legislative, executive, and judicial branches is a problem that must be fixed. Conservatives rely on constitutional reinterpretation that might establish a bright line between executive power in foreign policy and war (which they embrace) and national authority to regulate domestic and economic affairs (which they do not). Liberals worry that constitutional ambiguity opens the door for the abuse of executive power, [prefer] formal delegation of power constrained by strict statutory limits on the exercise of that power. Liberal and conservative efforts have failed, each producing results quite the opposite of what was sought. After setting these debates in their legal, historical, and political context, this review concludes with a re-examination of the potential virtues of constitutional ambiguity. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Native Americans are unique among domestic actors in that their relations with the U.S. government involve treaty making, with almost 600 such documents signed between the Revolutionary War and the turn of the twentieth century. We investigate the effect of constitutional changes to the treaty-making process in 1871, by which Congress stripped the president of his ability to negotiate directly with tribes. We construct a comprehensive new data set by digitizing all of the treaties for systematic textual analysis. Employing scaling techniques validated with word-use information, we show that a single dimension characterizes the treaties as more or less “harsh” in land and resource cession terms. We find that specific institutional changes to treaty-making mechanisms had little effect on agreement outcomes. Rather, it is the relative bargaining power of the US economically and militarily that contributes to worsening terms for Indians over the 19th c. [R]</p>

<p>This article addresses one of the first French racial anti-discrimination policy initiatives, <italic>parrainage à l'emploi</italic> (employment mentoring), institutionalized in 1998 at a time when the intellectual climate was hostile to the public categorization of “race” and ethnicity. The author undertakes the ethnography of this mentoring program and demonstrates why it was not adequately equipped to fight discrimination. Bringing together the sociology of public action and the sociology of public problems, he explores what was lacking in that initiative and uses the case study to interrogate the criteria through which scholars usually assess the emergence and the proposed solutions of a public problem.

<p>Why do policies fail? There are many answers to this question, and many ways of answering it. We use the tools of policy-framing and systems-failure, each involving a different policy milieu and time-span. We show that, in both these cases, unintended consequences arose because governments lost control of the implementation process while remaining politically accountable for the outcomes. We develop the concept of transmitted risk to show how this occurred. We argue that governments expose themselves to this kind of risk when they make policy decisions involving a combination of excessive incentives and poorly controlled third parties. [R]</p>

<p>The development of a corpus of fundamental rights at the EU level has accentuated the constitutional pluralism that existed within many national legal systems. Illustrating the dynamic, the adjudication of the age-discrimination provisions of the 2000 Framework Directive on Employment Equality in Germany produced two major outcomes: (1) interactions between the ECJ and the German labor courts served to upgrade rights protections afforded to workers, relative to national constitutional standards; (2) the structural position of the German Federal Constitutional Court, as a privileged locus of rights protection, was weakened, while the authority of the labor courts was enhanced. Looking ahead, we are entering a new era of rights-based legal integration that will further serve to Europeanize national law, while undermining the (supposed) unity and coherence of national legal orders.

<p>A variety of factors has caused immigration rates in France to increase since the 1990s, with the majority of immigrants currently being of Muslim origin. Immigration-related issues include the problematic integration of Muslim immigrants into Western secular society, the rising discontent within the native French population, an increasing threat of terrorism, and the growing popularity of extreme right and radical parties. The national identity debate, which lasted from November 2009 to February 2010, reflects the growing necessity to define France's national identity, yet is also viewed by some as an attempt to manipulate public opinion on the eve of the 2012 presidential election.</p>

<p>Policy-diffusion studies often invoke explanations that draw on the directional pressures for emulation, whether top-down, horizontal, or bottom-up. This article develops a theoretical framework that accounts for the multidirectional features of diffusion, including sub-national, cross-national, and international mechanisms, through the illustrative case of Brazil's federal adoption of <italic>Bolsa Escola</italic> (School Grant Program), a conditional cash-transfer program that preceded the internationally acclaimed poverty-alleviation program called <italic>Bolsa Família</italic> (Family Grant Program). Using process-tracing, I argue that bottom-up pressures, including professional norms and intergovernmental competition, were key for policy-emulation. Cross-national competition had little effect on decision-making. Finally, top-down processes, including norms and financing, reinforced adoption decisions and ensured these programs would endure.

<p>As with democratic institutions elsewhere, public attitudes towards the Legislative Yuan reflect feelings of disconnectedness and disenchantment. Due to its informal and interactive form, blogging has been described by some western scholars as a tool for reconnecting representatives and their constituents. This article provides an empirical survey of the use of blogging by Taiwanese legislators. Drawing on a large sample of blogs over time, it compares uptake, uses and interactivity during campaign season and “peace time” for at-large and constituency based legislators. There are several promising findings and evidence that blogging is an important element in Taiwan's evolving political communications environment. [R]</p>

<p>International law defines refugees and their rights and the legal obligations of states that receive them. However, the actual formulation and implementation of asylum law are based on the politically and historically contingent constructions of the status of “refugee” that are determined largely by nation states. This article analyses the legal-political construction of “refugee” in the post-communist Czech Republic during and after its accession to the EU. It examines the role of the state and the nongovernmental sector and explains the gradual shift that took place towards treating asylum as a matter of migration management rather than a fundamental human right.

<p>In most French-speaking African states, the distribution of competences between the executive and the legislative branches on budgetary issues follow the provisions established by the 1958 French Constitution. These assign a predominant role to governments at the expense of parliaments. The analysis of statutory provisions and constitutional practices highlight that during political or institutional crises, when confronted with budgetary urgency, political players tend to adopt original procedures rather than classic solutions, often seen as inappropriate. The President can use emergency powers and overstep the parliament's budgetary validation role. The generalization of this practice may become a threat to democracy. Therefore, it may be necessary to find new forms of budgetary action, especially regarding the function of the legislative power in the decision-making process.</p>

<p>Is the state of a performance-measurement system the most important element for promoting the utilization of performance indicators (Pls) in the public sector? Or are there other more influential factors, such as organizational culture, or even individual perceptions on the merit of performance measurement for their agency? Through a survey on a small group of managers specializing in performance-measurement in 21 Australian state government agencies, this research examines the relative influence of the following factors on the use of Pls for internal decision-making: the agency's performance-measurement system, stakeholder support for the agency's performance-measurement, organizational culture, the external environment, and individual perceptions on the impact of performance-measurement in the agency.

<p>Scholars rely heavily on formal rules to classify legislatures, but parchment institutions may tell only part of the story about how the chamber works. Behind-the-scenes behavior may counter-balance or temper the power distribution created by formal rules. To begin examining if formal rules are an accurate predictor of actual behavior, we analyze standing committees in Costa Rica's Legislative Assembly. We find that despite the formal institutions that favor a majoritarian bonus, the opposition party is a full participant in the legislative process in committee sessions. Opposition deputies participate equally or more so than majority party deputies, and deputies of all parties work together to investigate bills and kill legislation evaluated to be flawed, which indicates that formal rules are only one component to understanding legislative behavior.

<p>In order to pursue the contradictory goals of effective economic development and equal spatial distribution, the Japanese Developmental State (JDS) under the Liberal Democratic Party tried to strike a balance between concentrated growth in Tokyo and redistribution to the rest of Japan. However, in recent years government leaders have been de-emphasizing the balance and introducing state devolution and market-based policy choices. Meanwhile, mixing such neoliberalism-style measures with government activism, state leaders have endorsed redevelopment in Tokyo. These political developments exhibit marked resemblance to the neoliberal glocalization observed in Western Europe. Nevertheless, Japan's neoliberalization displays fundamental differences from that of Western experiences. This study investigates how Japan's recent neoliberalization has come to take shape.

<p>This article analyzes the process of party constitutionalization in post-war Europe. It explores the temporal patterns of party constitutionalization and reveals their connection with moments of fundamental institutional restructuring. It discusses the different modes of party constitutionalization, and addresses what these convey about the underlying conceptions of party democracy. It argues that the constitutional codification of political parties has consolidated the empirical reality of modern party government as well as its normative foundations of modern party government, thereby transforming political parties from socio-political organizations into integral units of the democratic state. Finally, it suggests that the constitutionalization of the democratic importance of political parties might reflect an attempt to legitimize their existence in the face of their weakening as agents of democratic representation.

<p>What rulers think is betrayed by their attitude towards freedom of the press. V. Orbán and his government leave no doubt as to their position. They have terminated the constitutional guarantees of freedom of the press. A new media authority not only regulates the media market, but is to supervise and sanction the media with regard to content. In a move unprecedented for a democracy, the media law threatens freedom of the press. Nine hundred journalists were dismissed from public broadcasters. That was a political purge. Under the <italic>Fidesz</italic> government something unexpected has happened. A state monopoly of opinion has been restored, something that seemed to have been overcome in 1989.

<p>N. Kirchner, the [former] Argentinian president, developed a unique and new way of relating with the press, totally different from the method that previous democratic governments used. Through an analysis of Kirchner' speeches, this article illustrates [how] the president sought to weaken the media, removing them from their position as “fourth power” and “objective mediators” between the government and the citizens. Those transformations are due to the conditions in which he developed a specific type of leadership. Those changes, also, had consequences in the political representation and in the current characteristics of the democratic system in Argentina. [R]</p>

<p>The Swedish Committee on Constitutional reform (2004–2008) was charged with conducting a comprehensive review of the Instrument of Government, the fundamental law regulating the governing of Sweden. A gender researcher was engaged to analyze the Instrument of Government and propose necessary changes. The main result was the adoption of gender-neutral language. I show that gender was basically a non-issue for the Committee. There are two main explanations for this: (1) gender is the basis of a hierarchical power structure in society. Issues of gender tend to be seen as deviant and not as priorities. Thus, gender is not easily formulated as a constitutional rule. (2) The Swedish tradition of constitutional minimalism makes it difficult to incorporate new issues into the constitution, because to do so violates institutionalized norms and traditions.

<p>Much analysis of ethnolinguistic minorities is case-specific and concerned with the particular state or national context within which such minorities operate. This paper adopts a broad conceptual stance by focusing on how policies aimed at improving the position of ethnolinguistic minorities in Europe have been subject to broad and profound multilevel influences. These range from policies and practices which have their origin within the minority communities themselves, to the state, the European level and beyond. This paper identifies significant paradigm shifts and highlight structural tensions which derive from neo-liberal and social democratic perspectives coming into conflict as a result of closer European integration and globalization. It identifies six salient research themes which may inform more robust policy initiatives capable of building on best practice minority policy in several EU contexts. [R]</p>

<p>Although US President Obama received extensive media coverage during the 2008 presidential campaign and later during the first two years of his presidency, many people still perceive him as elusive, or even contradictory. Using biographical facts and objective at-a-distance measures, this article presents a personality profile of Obama, organized around a fourfold conception of personality. Personality can be understood as the residue of past and present social contexts and is publicly visible as traits or consistencies of style. Internal beliefs, values, and other cognitions, as well as implicit motives, can only be indirectly observed and so are measured through content analysis. The resulting profile is used to explain some outcomes, as well as paradoxes and puzzles of Obama's performance as president. It also suggests predictions about the future course of his presidency.

<p>In 1959, the four largest political parties in Switzerland's Federal Assembly established a broad coalition government with a specific allocation of the seven cabinet seats among them, [which] continued unaltered for 44 years —the “Magic Formula”. The underlying political paradigm appears to be essentially egalitarian, with a Rawlsian concern for minorities. We thus ask whether the Magic Formula can be implemented by the nucleolus of a weighted voting game for the Swiss government. We provide results over real-valued and integer-valued imputation sets, and for all regular election periods from 1959 to date. It turns out that the Magic Formula is contained in eight out of eleven nucleoli over integer domains between 1959 and 1999, and that it comes very close to the nucleolus in two of the three remaining cases.

<p>The institutional development [of] the provision of social and public services since its early beginnings in the 19th c. is analyzed. At the beginning, certain social services and public utilities were provided by municipalities and municipally owned enterprises, forming local welfare states. The national welfare state was the most developed in the 1960s. Since the 1980s, these services are under the impact of neo-liberal policy, the New Public Management concepts, and the EU market-liberalization policy. EU law has developed its own legal definition of public services and labeled them as services of general economic interest. The development in five countries is analyzed: UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Norway. Cross-country institutional commonalities and variance, as well as the factors that have impinged upon such country-specific trajectories are identified. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Civic-republican theories of democracy assume high levels of social capital within the community and within public bureaucracies will be associated with better government performance. This article tests these assumptions by analyzing the impact of community and organizational social capital on the achievements of English local governments. The interdependence between social capital and performance is modeled using a range of primary and secondary data. The statistical results suggest that both community and organizational social capital are positively related to government performance. However, further analysis revealed that the combined effects of these two forms of social capital are not beneficial for performance. [R]</p>

<p>Provincial governments have become an important part of decentralization in most African countries because they not only form the link between the central and local government units but also have resources at their disposal to build patronage at the sub-national level. Given that provincial governments can make or unmake decentralization, this paper examines provincial or regional governance in Ghana using the following indicators: (1) the political economy of the creation of regions; (2) constitutional authority; (3) electoral process; (4) range of expenditure and management responsibilities devolved; (5) authority and competence of staff; and (6) regional governance and party politics. Despite the secondary role of regional governments in Ghana, they are still very powerful compared to local government units because they serve as a source of patronage and complementary support for the party in power.

<p>How does the demand for lobbying reflected by government policy activity influence the use of lobbying strategies and tactics? The authors examine this question by assessing how the complexity of the policy space affects the political action committee (PAC) system. They hypothesize that the complexity of the policy space indirectly affects the size and activity of the PAC system through its direct effect on interest organization density. The authors test this hypothesis within the health sector using a unique data set that connects individual interest organizations registered to lobby US state legislatures with active PACs in the state. It appears that social, economic, and political measures of policy space complexity influence the size of the lobbying community, which in turn influences the size and activity of the PAC community.

<p>This article suggests that a common feature among democratic innovations is the lack of an agenda-setting function.

Second, it argues that democratic innovations focused on setting the policy agendas of public authorities can serve to democratize the policy process by providing citizens with a tool to place issues on the public agenda. The article analyzes a series of actual and potential institutional designs that divert from the dominant “directdemocratic” nature of agenda-setting innovations. It finishes with a discussion of the UK Sustainable Communities Act (2007), a process designed to allow communities to propose policy to government through their councils. [R]</p>

<p>This study, based on a statewide survey of local officials in Florida [US], examines the degree to which vertical and horizontal roadblocks to interlocal cooperation persist well after the 9/11 [2001] and Hurricane Katrina mega-disasters. Respondents evaluate the degree to which vertical constraints (state and federal mandates) and horizontal constraints (political tensions and competition for funding; incompatible communication equipment and inconsistent information-sharing; and local cost-sharing complexities and training and personnel qualification differences) still deter collaboration. Incompatible communication equipment is the most cited barrier, followed by the rules and legal complexities inherent in state and federal mandates and interlocal cost-sharing agreements.

<p>This research presents the historical analysis of the rules and norms that regulate the functioning of the Argentine provincial Supreme Courts (such as the tenure system, size of the courts, justice's constitutional rights, and the appointment and removal system). The objective of this research is to analyze to what extent the institutional design can condition the relationship of the judicial branch with the other branches of government. For this purpose a dataset was created that gathers all the provincial constitutions and rules in force between 1983 and 2009. The main finding is that the changes in the intuitional settings have often increased the degree of vulnerability of the Cortes vis-à-vis the other branches of government. [R]</p>

<p>Analyzing dynamic social phenomena is a major challenge for research. This article conducts a feasibility test of a social scientific tool we developed based on W. N. Dunn [<italic>Public Policy Analysis</italic>, New Jersey, 2004]. We apply this tool to a corpus of historical documents on tobacco policy in the city of Bern generated between 1659 and 1723. A longitudinal analysis across time periods of argument structure and form shows shifts in the perceived problems, causes, and policy measures considered with respect to tobacco, as well as their legitimation. The implication is that our method is a viable approach for studying historical policy arguments. [R]</p>

<p>62.1919 DOLLERY, Brian; KORTT, Michael; GRANT, Bligh — <bold>A normative model for local government de-amalgamation in Australia.</bold> <italic>Australian Journal of Political Science</italic> 46(4), Dec. 2011: 601–615.</p>
<p>Ongoing local community dissatisfaction in some newly amalgamated local government areas resulting from the 2007 Queensland forced amalgamation program has raised the prospect of de-merger in that state. One catalyst has been the Opposition's commitment to de-amalgamation should it acquire government. Apart from some descriptive discussion of actual de-amalgamation episodes, almost no prescriptive analysis exists on the optimal form any de-merger process may take. Using two documented cases of de-amalgamation in metropolitan and regional settings, this exploratory paper addresses this gap in the literature on local government by presenting a “stylized” approach to de-amalgamation designed for Australian local government conditions built around five generic principles.

<p>This article argues that the advent of sub-national entities on the international arena has changed our thinking about the international environment and diplomacy. However, most literature on paradiplomacy focuses on a number of paradigmatic cases, thereby overlooking the diplomatic practices of lesser-known sub-national actors. This article contributes to the paradiplomacy literature by analyzing the diplomacy of the French region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. By focusing on the international agency of the region and by framing sub-national diplomacy as a means of managing relations between the Self and the Other, this article gains more insight into the essence of paradiplomacy.

<p>This article examines the 2003 Ontario Liberal transition through intergovernmental and political lenses. Using indicators to assess the role and impact of partisanship, the Ontario case suggests that partisan complexions matter in how the transition process is planned and executed. The provincial team will seek advice on the matter from their federal cousins, for example, and will recruit experienced political staffers from Parliament Hill to be part of the new sub-national government. Shared partisanship may also predict whether harmonious relations with Ottawa will prevail during the first several months in power. In provinces where political party organizations formally overlap or are informally intertwined across the federal divide, partisanship can play a role in determining how a new government prepares and implements its transition process.

<p>How do American Indian tribal governments relate to nearby local governments? Do insights gleaned from these cases illuminate the constraints and opportunities that marginalized groups face within any system of federalism? What circumstances of marginalized governments help or hinder their effectiveness? Although some Native American tribes have transformed their fortunes with highly profitable casinos, most continue to face stark disadvantages. Some tribal governments, despite limited opportunities prevail locally by cultivating policy and political expertise. This analysis demonstrates that such expertise can be developed, even when resources are scarce. [R]</p>

<p>There is a large literature on both why local governments and public organizations choose internal or external production of services and what explains the performance of internal and external production. A range of different theories used to answer these questions show mixed results. We investigate four theories: transaction-cost economics, neoclassical economics, the resource-based view of strategy and institutional theory. Do the same variables explain the choice and the satisfaction? Based on a survey of four different service areas in Danish municipalities, it is shown that different theoretical variables explain the choice and satisfaction with the sourcing mode. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article examines challenges related to the political steering of New Public Management-inspired planning practices in Norway and asks if local politicians have sufficient and adequate instruments to hand, and if they are willing and have the knowledge to use them. The discussion is based upon a broad survey of the 145 largest municipalities and qualitative interviews in the three largest cities. It is found that local politicians do not lack steering instruments, as the different managerial practices represent a spectrum of suitable tools for giving direction to urban development. However, the data indicate that local politicians do not utilize the full steering potential of the instruments due to lack of knowledge and will. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Smart growth is a planning and land-use policy objective that generally focuses on where development should occur and how best to protect natural resources. What explains the adoption of smart growth policy by local government? This study focuses on a cooperative intergovernmental program that seeks to enhance local government abilities to work toward achieving state goals on sustainability. Extant research suggests that local interest group preferences shape policy decisions. However, much of the evidence on the influence of local interest groups on smart growth policy is presented within the coercive intergovernmental context. This article argues that resource dependency influences local decisions in pursuing a smart growth agenda when state incentives are provided. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Historically, few Maori have been elected to local government. In the last 10 years the Crown has created two opportunities for local government to increase the number of Maori elected: the Local Electoral Act 2001 allows a local government to change its electoral system from the first-past-the-post (FPP) to the single transferable voting (STV) system; and the Local Electoral Amendment Act 2002 allows a local government to create local Maori wards and Maori constituencies (replicating the model of Maori representation in the House of Representatives). Very few local governments have implemented either option. Following the 2010 local government elections, Maori are still chronically under-represented among elected councilors. This article argues that the Crown is failing in its duty of active protection of Maori in laws relating to Maori representation in local government. [R, abr.]</p>

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>In the debate on metropolitan governance, a commonly expressed hypothesis is that the reconstruction of statehood can take metropolitan governance along a variety of paths. This is especially true for Germany, where we can identify a great diversity of organizational forms of cooperation at the level of metropolitan agglomerations. This article addresses the question of how diversity within a country with more or less uniform institutional structures can be explained on the basis of a comparison of three German regions. We examine whether and how such differences can be explained as a combination of structural and other variables. Our starting hypothesis is that case-specific structural variables matter – e.g., the economic structure of the regions, or the dominance or polarization within the regional party system.

<p>In recent years, the academic literature on crisis communication has increased. The literature is however driven forward by studies in the private sector. In a public sector context, attention has mostly been given to the political scandal or what could be labeled emergency communication primarily focused on natural or man-made disasters. The municipalities in Denmark are however in a strong need for knowledge regarding crisis communication. Some have already been the center of a crisis, while others are preparing themselves. Everybody knows that crisis will come, but nobody knows when. This paper draws on a crisis in a municipality that has already had the “global” media attention in Denmark, the so-called <italic>Brønderslevsag</italic>.

<p>In 2011, a new electoral system in Hamburg gave voters multiple votes and the chance to split and gather them on parties and candidates as well. The citizen initiative <italic>Mehr Demokratie</italic> pinned high expectations on the new electoral system with respect to a “better” political representation and participation. The results were disappointing: only the descriptive representation of women, younger representatives and such with foreign descent improved. Yet these positive results of the new electoral law were far outweighed by its counterproductive effects: the working capacity of parliament and its parties was hampered. The election campaigns were further personalized and depoliticized. The new voting rules proved to be inappropriate for signifying coalition preferences. Voters were unable to cope with the far too complicated ballot structure and voting rules. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Social capital has been shown to positively influence government performance. C. Boix and D.N.

Such monitoring will be more explicit to the extent that instrumental voting motivations outweigh expressive considerations. We identify social capital as a source that facilitates instrumental voting and thus political accountability. We present an empirical test of the Boix and Posner hypothesis and find a positive link between perceived quality of government and election results of the incumbent parties. Crucially, we find this link to be stronger in municipalities high in social capital. [R]</p>

<p>This article identifies and describes the utilization of performance-measurement in Florida [USA] local governments. Two research questions are considered: which factors influence Florida city governments to use performance-measurement? And how do the factors associated with cities that are city-wide users differ from cities that are selective users? The paper develops a framework constructed from literatures in performance-measurement and management-innovation to develop hypotheses that are tested with 2005 Florida local government data. This study finds strong support for the role of community attributes, form of government and internal capacity as contributors to the use of performance-measurement. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>We study how well states translate public opinion into policy. Using national surveys and advances in subnational opinion estimation, we estimate state-level support for 39 policies across eight issue areas, including abortion, law enforcement, health care, and education. We show that policy is highly responsive to policy-specific opinion, even controlling for other influences. But we also uncover a striking “democratic deficit”: policy is congruent with majority will only half the time. The analysis considers the influence of institutions, salience, partisan control of government, and interest groups on the magnitude and ideological direction of this democratic deficit. We find the largest influences to be legislative professionalization, term limits, and issue salience. Partisanship and interest groups affect the ideological balance of incongruence more than the aggregate degree thereof. Finally, policy is overresponsive to ideology and party — leading policy to be polarized relative to state electorates. [R]</p>

<p>This article analyzes the relationship between US state governance and policies designed to enhance educational expectations. It examines three policy areas: state participation in voluntary National Assessment of Educational Progress testing, state testing requirements for new teachers, and state high school graduation requirements in math and science. In general, it identifies associations between state institutional and political characteristics and the state policies under study. In particular, state policies that impose higher demands on local school districts are more likely to be present in states with more centralized control of their K-12 systems. Furthermore, state partisanship appears to suggest that Republicans favor policies that push power to lower levels of the US intergovernmental system. [R]</p>

<p>Despite considerable public and scholarly interest in public-private partnerships (PPPs) as a tool of government in Germany, there is no quantitative empirical study exploring the motivations behind policymakers' decisions to (not) use this type of privatization policy. This article investigates the extent and determinants of the PPP activities of the 16 German states' governments over the period 2002–09. For that purpose, a PPP Activity Index is constructed which not only includes official PPP project figures but also state governments' programmatic, institutional, and advisory activities regarding PPP. Using this index, we statistically analyze whether fiscal stress, government partisanship, and other factors can help to explain the considerable differences between Länder governments' PPP activities.

<p>This article reviews developments in Scottish local government post-devolution. It outlines some expectations, assumptions and realities about local government in Scotland. Three assumptions are examined and rejected: 1999 was “Year Zero” for Scottish local government; central-local relations are characterized by a cohesive center versus a cohesive locality; central-local relations in Scotland are nothing more than a fuzzy microcosm of central-local relations in England. The article argues that Scotland increasingly offers a different “story” of central-local government relations with pre-existing differences accentuating in the context of minority government, different processes of governance and attitudes to the welfare state.

<p>This paper independently evaluates the impact of the Comprehensive Performance Assessment regime on one particular public service: the provision of council tax and housing benefits distributed by local authorities throughout the course of the regime. This service was assessed in every iteration of the CPA methodologies and it included one of the few key performance indicators (KPIs) where the definition of the performance-indicator — the means of collection and the public reporting of its results — remained the same throughout the CPA period between 2002 and 2008. There were considerable and consistent improvements in benefits administration nationally within England and across all of its regions. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article examines the rhetorical strategies of [US] black mayors J. Ford and R. McLin and their efforts to represent black interests in majority-white cities and compares the strategies to those of President B. Obama. Using polling data, speech content-analysis, and census data, the article identifies that all three black politicians were able to rhetorically advance policies and programs designed to represent black interests with majority-white constituencies. The results indicate that when black interest policy actions are framed utilizing a targeted universalistic rhetorical strategy, mayors Ford and McLin and President Obama each advanced black interests as they detailed how their proposed initiatives benefited all citizens. At the local and federal levels, the finding indicates how the advance of black interests can be achieved while maintaining significant white electoral and governing support. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article studies the impact of citizen participation on local government performance in Bulgaria. Both survey and interview data are used to suggest that, all else being equal, municipal efficacy grows with the increasing involvement of social and economic actors in the policy-making process. This improved government efficacy is most likely a result of the professionalization and organizational strength of the third sector. Although the politicization of the local state has undermined its capacity, municipalities have been able not only to reconstitute some of their authority but also to improve the output and the quality of their policy-making by employing the expertise and support of major local civic organizations.

Using data from the Judge-Level State Supreme Court Database, the authors analyze the votes of individual [US] judges from 1995 to 1998 to determine whether their behavior is constrained by legislation. The results indicate that more detailed language (resulting in statutes with higher word-counts) significantly limits the discretion afforded to liberal judges while simultaneously facilitating the ideological voting of their conservative colleagues.

<p>Welfare policy in the American states has been shaped profoundly by race, ethnicity, and representation. Does gender matter as well? Focusing on state welfare reform in the mid-1990s, we test hypotheses derived from two alternative approaches to incorporating gender into the study of representation and welfare policymaking. An additive approach, which assumes gender and race/ethnicity are distinct and independent, suggests that female state legislators —regardless of race/ethnicity —will mitigate the more restrictive and punitive aspects of welfare reform, much like their African American and Latino counterparts do. In contrast, an intersectional approach, which highlights the overlapping and interdependent nature of gender and race/ethnicity, suggests that legislative women of color will have the strongest countervailing effect on state welfare reform — stronger than that of other women or men of color. Our empirical analyses suggest an intersectional approach yields a more accurate understanding of gender, race/ethnicity, and welfare politics in the states. [R]</p>

<p>The article analyzes the interaction between elected deputies and an established legislative culture. Legislative research has largely ignored the socialization processes among new legislators and their effects. These processes are studies for the diets of Baden-Württemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia, based on a qualitative panel design. The interviews reveal both the new deputies' clear personal goals and their unclear expectations about parliamentary procedure. The gap between individual ideas and institutional norms is filled by adaptation to established rituals and rules of the game. As an expression of the legislative culture, these norms and rules are transmitted by the traditional socialization agents within the parties. [R]</p>

<p>Scholars have shown that diversity depresses public-goods provision. In US cities, racial and ethnic divisions could seriously undermine investment. However, diverse cities spend significant amounts on public goods. We ask how these communities overcome their potential collective-action problem. Using a new data-set on more than 3,000 municipal bond elections, we show that strategic politicians encourage cooperation. Diversity leads officials to be more selective about requesting approval for investment and more attentive to coalition-building. Diverse communities see fewer bond elections, but that the bonds proposed are larger and pass at higher rates. Diverse cities tend to offer voters bonds with more spending categories and are more likely to hold referenda during general elections. As a result, diverse cities do just as well as homogenous cities in issuing voter-authorized debt. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article contributes to the academic debate on the emergence and configuration of an epistemic community and its encouragement of participatory democracy in local government. With a case-study of the councils of cities in the province of Barcelona (Spain) with up to 5,000 inhabitants, where notable advances have been made in this field, we describe the epistemic community and the activities it has undertaken to promote citizen participation. The results illustrate the role of the epistemic community in the establishment of participation units and its capacity to generate participatory processes in different spheres of local government with different levels of pre-existing institutional arrangements. However, questions arise concerning its capacity to maintain and extend its influence in spheres of advanced technical specificity and robust institutional arrangements, where negotiation is required to promote citizen participation.

<p>The troubles of Alice Springs have been widely discussed in the Australian media since <italic>The Weekend Australian</italic> published N.

One topic that has not been mentioned is Alice's highly unrepresentative town council, built on a little-known electoral system used in Northern Territory local government called “exhaustive preferential”. This paper explains and critiques this electoral system and suggests that it is causing significant problems for both Alice Springs Town Council and other local governments in the Territory.

<p>The article deals with members of immigrant background in German city councils and city-state assemblies. Twenty-four semi-structures interviews have been conducted providing information on the immigrant parliamentarians' personal background and experiences in the respective parties and parliamentary groups. The results especially point to differences by political affiliation. Members of the political left have more often decided by themselves to join party politics while those of the center-right have been more frequently recruited by parties. Across political camps, respondents say that ethnic background plays an important role for nomination. While for politicians of the political left, religion is considered to matter rather in personal than in political life, those of the center-right more often say it also matters politically.

<p>More attention must be given to the performance of interlocal agreements (ILAs) as they continue to grow in popularity as a mode of service provision in US cities. This study scrutinizes the democratic performance of ILAs, drawing theoretical insights from the literature on network governance. Because ILAs shift service responsibility from individual cities to multijurisdictional arrangements, these tools may lead to complaints about the responsiveness of the service to the public in the individual units served by the multijurisdictional arrangement. Thus, democratic anchorage is central to assessments of ILA performance. This study evaluates democratic anchorage by identifying concerns with ILAs in interviews with a sample of local elected officials in Michigan [US]. [R, abr.]</p>
