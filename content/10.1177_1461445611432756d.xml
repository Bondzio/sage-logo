<p><italic>Workplace Discourse</italic> is concerned with spoken and written discourse in a variety of occupational settings, focusing on the analysis of interactions between co-workers in order to demonstrate how language is used to pursue transactional and relational goals. A recurring theme of the book is the significance of relational aspects of workplace discourse, given its transactional or task-oriented nature. The means of investigating workplace discourse also receive considerable attention, with a central concern being to promote the combined quantitative and qualitative methodologies of corpus linguistics and genre analysis.</p>
<p>In the opening chapter, the author establishes that goal orientation is the most important distinguishing feature of workplace discourse, in order to introduce genre analysis as part of this integrated analytical approach. The chapter aims to situate the approaches to analysing workplace discourse drawn on in the book within the wider body of research encompassing institutional, professional and business discourse. A strength of this introduction is to differentiate and compare concepts that underpin such approaches; for example, the respective notions of <italic>discourse communities</italic> and <italic>communities of practice</italic> are neatly elaborated and then linked explicitly to the chapters dealing with genre and relational talk. The bigger theoretical picture – covering sociological, sociolinguistic, social constructionist and socio-critical approaches – is concisely and clearly articulated, which will be invaluable for newer researchers from various disciplines.</p>
<p>The three remaining chapters in the first part of the book contribute different perspectives to the description of workplace discourse. Chapter 2 contextualizes the study of workplace genres in some detail, introducing evidence and examples from corpora such as Koester’s own 34,000-word Corpus of American and British Office Talk (ABOT), in which she identifies three macro-genres of spoken workplace discourse: unidirectional, collaborative and non-transactional. The chapter examines four recurring workplace genres (decision-making, meetings, service encounters and email), before changing focus to the interaction <italic>between</italic> genres. The intertextuality or ‘intertextual links’ between intra-organizational genres, such as between phone calls and email, or meetings and records of meetings, are presented as a defining characteristic of workplace discourse.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 focuses more specifically on what can be learnt from the corpus analysis of frequencies and patterning in workplace language. It draws on a range of smaller corpora such as ABOT, the Hong Kong Corpus of Spoken English business subcorpus (HKSE-bus) and larger corpora such as the million-word Cambridge and Nottingham Business English Corpus (CANBEC). Points of interest raised by this chapter are numerous. To take one example, an unexpected finding from Koester’s frequency analysis of interpersonal markers was that modals, vague language, hedges and idioms all occurred ‘<italic>less</italic> frequently in the non-transactional genres, than in genres where participants were focused on workplace tasks’ (p. 63). Her interpretation that the politeness functions of such markers are more relevant in transactional talk again underscores the importance of interpersonal aspects of interactions in the workplace.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 explores procedural and directive discourse, which exemplify the transactional talk found in unidirectional and collaborative genres. In analysing the key activity of ‘getting people to carry out tasks’, directives compared in the different genre sets of procedural discourse and decision-making showed a radically different profile according to the interactive context. The focus on directives gives way to the topic of training and apprenticeship, where Koester notes that the frequent use of solidarity strategies by trainers reinforces the importance of relational talk in transactional genres.</p>
<p>The three chapters in the second part of the book address issues and applications identified as timely and relevant to the current discussion of workplace discourse. Chapter 5 takes up the notion of community of practice to explore relational talk and humour, drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445611432756">Holmes and Marra (2002)</xref> and other Victoria University of Wellington Language in the Workplace Project (LWP) studies to establish a benchmark for the discussion – a connection somewhat under-explored in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445611432756">Koester (2006)</xref>. Although the LWP database covers a wider range of settings than the exclusively white-collar ABOT corpus, Koester’s finding that solidarity was the most frequent function of humour was revealed to be consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445611432756">Holmes and Marra (2002)</xref>, where the overall frequency of supportive humour exceeded that of contestive humour. Relational talk in general was shown to be integral, rather than peripheral, to workplace discourse.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 juxtaposes two contexts of intercultural communication, the use of English as a lingua franca (ELF) in international business and the ‘inter-ethnic’ interaction between dominant and minority cultures. The latter discussion centres on gatekeeping encounters such as job interviews, which have little in common with ELF interactions in that these typically occur between equals. The author suggests a relevant site for future research might concern a hybrid context of highly skilled, temporary migrant workers.</p>
<p>The final chapter briefly addresses research-based consultancy before discussing the pedagogical implications of insights gained from preceding chapters. The focus is on English for Specific Purposes and other classroom applications that primarily foster ways in which ‘interpersonal skills, which have largely been neglected in teaching materials, can systematically be included in a syllabus of English for occupational, professional and business purposes’ (p. 160). The book concludes with an appendix of five useful sample activities (the first of which is marred by an incorrect answer key) for use with learners.</p>
<p><italic>Workplace Discourse</italic> balances a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of a rapidly developing field with an object lesson in how complementary methodologies can be integrated. An additional strength is that its conclusions are supported by a wide range of data, including examples from specialized corpora, making it a valuable resource for students, teachers and analysts of language and communication, including more experienced researchers. The full potential of corpus linguistics as demonstrated here may even encourage those on more familiar ground with traditional analytical models of institutional talk to move out of their comfort zone.</p>
