<p>In this comment we take up two points made by Douglas Hollan in his article “Emerging Issues in the Cross-Cultural Study of Empathy,” and discuss their possible philosophical implications. Hollan‘s concept of complex empathy may give rise to the idea that we can learn about other people’s beliefs via empathy, which is something we do not believe is possible. Furthermore, Hollan’s description of possible negative effects of empathy, such as manipulations of a person on the basis of knowledge about their emotions, might pose a problem for proponents of care ethics, who generally start from the assumption that empathy fosters altruistic behavior.</p>

<p>In his article “Emerging Issues in the Cross-Cultural Study of Empathy,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754073911421389">Douglas Hollan (2012)</xref> distinguishes between basic and complex empathy and argues convincingly that further cross-cultural research is necessary in order to fully understand the latter. We want to comment on two points Hollan makes. First, we want to explore the meaning of complex empathy. Second, we want to put Hollan’s account of possible negative impacts of empathy in the context of some current research in moral philosophy.</p>
<p>Hollan distinguishes between basic and complex empathy. We have an example of basic empathy “when we recognize immediately that a person about to pick up a fork is likely to eat” (2012, p. 71), whereas an example for complex empathy is “what it takes to know that the person picking up the fork is doing so not out of hunger, but only to avoid upsetting or shaming an obliging host” (2012, p. 71). Basic empathy, then, is an immediate recognition of someone else’s intentions, whereas complex empathy is the ability to know the underlying motives of these intentions. It is interesting to notice that emotions do not play an essential role here. Plausibly, knowledge about someone else’s emotions is come by in the same way as knowledge about someone else’s intentions, and here we can also distinguish between the mere knowledge that someone has an emotion and the knowledge about why he has this emotion.</p>
<p>What seems problematic to us, however, is the notion of complex empathy as a tuning into not only the other person’s intentions and emotions, but into the particular beliefs that person has. Complex empathy in Hollan’s example requires that we know that the person intends to eat, and that he does so because he believes that not doing so would in some way hurt the host. Whilst it seems plausible to say that gaining knowledge about someone’s intentions and gaining knowledge about someone’s emotions work similarly, to say that gaining knowledge about someone’s beliefs is again similar is more difficult. The problem is that empathizing seems to involve having a mental state that is very similar to the other person’s, and that is mediated by the other person’s. To empathize with someone who is afraid, it is not enough to be aware of their fear; but I must somehow feel fear because of their fear (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754073911421389">Deonna, 2007</xref>). Similarly, to empathize with someone’s intentions, or so mirror neuron and simulation theories suggest, we simulate the intention because of their intention. Both emotions and intentions have manifestations in a person’s behavior, the perception of which can cause us to be in a similar state. But is the same true of beliefs? Can we come to have a belief similar to someone else’s belief because of their belief? At least it seems much more difficult to maintain this, as beliefs do not seem to have the same typical and fine-grained immediate bodily expressions that emotions and some intentions have and that could cause our having a similar belief. Hence, we would recommend a more carefully defined notion of complex empathy and exclude ways of knowing someone else’s beliefs from the empathy itself. Background knowledge about a person might enable us to interpret this person’s intentions and emotions much better than we could if this background knowledge were absent, by allowing us often to assume correctly what beliefs this person has, but this ability to assume correctly need not be part of the process of empathy itself.</p>
<p>The second point on which we would like to comment is Hollan’s descriptions of people who fear empathy because of the way in which the empathizer could misuse his knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754073911421389">2012</xref>, pp. 72, 73f.). A person who has gained knowledge about another person’s emotions and intentions is, for example, in a position to humiliate this person, as the Inuit of Northern Canada fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754073911421389">2012</xref>, p. 72). This notion of empathy as a potentially harmful tool stands in contrast, as Hollan points out, to the assumption that empathy is linked with altruism. This is potentially problematic for supporters of the growing discourse of care ethics. Care ethics is an ethical theory that tries to base morality on empathizing and consequently sympathizing with other people’s needs. Michael Slote, for example, assumes that “empathy is a crucial source and sustainer of altruistic concern or caring about (the wellbeing of) others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073911421389">2007</xref>, p. 15). Whilst Slote and others are aware and embrace that empathy varies in degrees, we are not sure they have considered the potential damage empathy can do, to which Hollan points. If empathy can result in both helping and harming others, then it might be best to assume that empathy is neither intrinsically motivating to help nor intrinsically motivating to harm. If this is true, then other motives must account for the good or bad we do with the knowledge acquired via empathy. This in turn, however, would mean that care ethicists will have more explaining to do than they have hitherto done. Whilst it may still be true that empathy is a “crucial source and sustainer of altruistic concern”, we would want to know more about how it is that empathy is more often such a source than a source of mischief. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754073911421389">Heidi Maibom (2009)</xref> claims that our understanding of moral norms has much less to do with either empathy or sympathy than is often supposed. She argues that people’s understanding of why a certain action is wrong is often independent of empathy and sympathy, and that emotions other than empathy and sympathy play significant roles in our motivation to moral behavior. The deeper understanding of how empathy is used in different cultures that Hollan calls for could shed light on these debates in care ethics.</p>
