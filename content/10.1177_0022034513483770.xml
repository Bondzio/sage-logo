<abstract>
<p>The exact mechanism underlying chronic masseter muscle pain, a conspicuous symptom in temporomandibular disorder, remains unclear. We investigated whether expression of P2X<sub>3</sub> receptor (P2X<sub>3</sub>R) is involved in mechanical hyperalgesia after contraction of masseter muscle (CMM). As compared with sham rats, the head-withdrawal threshold (HWT) to mechanical pressure stimulation of masseter muscle (MM) (but not after similar stimulation of facial skin) was significantly lower, and IL-1β level was significantly higher, in CMM rats on day 7 after CMM. The mean percentage of FG-labeled P2X<sub>3</sub>R-positive neurons was significantly increased in TG following successive IL-1β injections into the MM for 7 days. Successive administration of an IL-1β receptor-antagonist into the MM attenuated the increase of P2X<sub>3</sub>-IR cells in the TG. ATP release from MM after 300-g pressure stimulation of MM was also significantly enhanced after CMM. Administration into MM of the selective P2X<sub>3</sub>,<sub>2/3</sub> receptor antagonist A-317491 attenuated the decrement of HWT in CMM rats. A significant increase in HWT was also observed at 30 min after A-317491 (60 µg) injection in IL-1β-injected rats. These findings suggest that P2X<sub>3</sub>R expression associated with enhanced IL-1β expression and ATP release in MM has a possible important role in MM mechanical hyperalgesia after excessive muscular contraction.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pain of the masticatory muscles, such as masticatory myalgia or myofascial pain, is one of the most common symptoms in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034513483770">Okeson and de Kanter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034513483770">Glaros, 2008</xref>). In particular, muscle tenderness to palpation is an important clinical sign found in nearly 90% of patients with TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034513483770">Truelove <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>). It is likely that muscle nociceptors are sensitized in TMDs patients associated with muscle hyperactivity caused by frequent muscle contraction.</p>
<p>The P2X<sub>3</sub> receptor (P2X<sub>3</sub>R) is a member of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-gated ionotropic purinergic receptor subfamily and is present in sensory ganglion neurons innervated by small-diameter primary afferent fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034513483770">Burnstock, 2000</xref>). The number of P2X<sub>3</sub>R-positive muscle afferent neurons was higher after injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) into the MM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034513483770">Ambalavanar <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) and after continuous excessive muscle contraction (CMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034513483770">Shinoda <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Some previous studies have suggested that pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 are involved in the increase in P2X<sub>3</sub>R and in chronic muscle pain after muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034513483770">Dessem <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). These cytokines are thought to be involved in the sensitization of primary afferent nociceptors in muscle. Among the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β modulates pain sensitivity and usually produces hyperalgesia after peripheral or central exogenous administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034513483770">Falchi <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034513483770">Sachs <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034513483770">Watkin <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Moreover, craniofacial muscle pain positively correlated with concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6 in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034513483770">Niu and Ro, 2011</xref>). These findings suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines are involved in chronic muscle pain <italic>via</italic> purinergic receptor pathways. However, the relation between pro-inflammatory cytokines and the purinergic receptors associated with chronic MM pain is not fully understood.</p>
<p>We investigated the possible involvement of IL-1β and P2X<sub>3</sub>R interaction in mechanical hyperalgesia in MM after CMM by examining P2X<sub>3</sub>R expression in trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons and IL-1β in MM after CMM. In addition, we examined the functional significance of P2X<sub>3</sub>R and IL-1β by administering P2X<sub>3</sub>R and IL-1β antagonists into the MM.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) were used in the present study (Japan SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan). The rats were housed in group cages, maintained in a temperature-controlled environment under a semidiurnal light–dark cycle (light from 7:00–19:00), and given food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. This study was approved by the Animal Experimentation Committee at Nihon University, and the procedures were performed according to the guidelines of the International Association for the Study of Pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034513483770">Zimmermann, 1983</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-0022034513483770">
<title>CMM and Head-withdrawal Threshold Measurement</title>
<p>Two needle electrodes (10 mm apart) were applied transcutaneously on the masseteric fascia under 2% isoflurane (Mylan, Canonsburg, PA, USA) anesthesia, and electrical stimulation of the MM was performed (10 Hz with 10 V and 100-s pulse-width) for 30 min/day for 21 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034513483770">Shinoda <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). In addition, von Frey filaments (Touch Test Sensory Evaluator, North Coast Medical, Morgan Hill, CA, USA) were used to apply mechanical stimuli to the skin over the MM, after which the head-withdrawal threshold (HWT) was measured. HWT was defined as the minimum pressure intensity required for evoking head withdrawal in response to more than 3 of 5 stimuli. Assessment of mechanical sensitivity of deep tissue was also performed (n = 5 in CMM group; n = 5 in sham group) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034513483770">Shinoda <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). In brief, linearly increasing pressure (20 g/s) was applied to the MM surface through a cone-shaped plastic tip (tip diameter, 5 mm) attached to a scale. HWT was defined as the amount of pressure (grams) required to elicit pain-related behaviors (head flinching). To visualize the pathological changes in MM after electrical stimulation, we stained MM sections by hematoxylin and eosin.</p>

<title>Administration of P2X<sub>3/2/3</sub> R Antagonist</title>
<p>To assess the involvement of P2X<sub>3</sub>R in mechanical hyperalgesia in MM, we intramuscularly administered the selective P2X<sub>3/2/3</sub> receptor antagonist 5-([(3-phenoxybenzyl)[(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthalenyl][amino]carbonyl)-1,2,4-benzene-tricarboxylic acid (A-317491; 6.0 and 60 µg). A-317491 was dissolved in saline (0.1 mg/µL), and a 50-µL quantity of A-317491 was injected into the left MM by means of a 30-gauge needle under light inhalation anesthesia with 2% isoflurane (Mylan, Canonsburg, PA, USA) on day 7 after CMM. The HWTs of MMs were determined before and 30, 60, and 120 min after drug administration (n = 5 in each). The experimenter was not informed of the drugs used until HWT measurement and the data analyses had been completed. We also studied the effect of intramuscular (i.m.) administration of A-317491 (60 µg) on HWT in rats with recombinant rat IL-1β (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) injection into the MM for 7 days.</p>

<sec id="section5-0022034513483770">
<title>Cytokine Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay</title>
<p>Seven days after CMM, the MM was dissected and collected under pentobarbital anesthesia (50 mg/kg, i.p.). The tissues were weighed and placed separately in 300.25 µL of medium containing 300 µL of CelLytic-MT Mammalian Tissue Lysis/Extraction Reagent (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 0.25 µL of protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Tissue homogenization was performed with Polytron PT 1200E (Kinematica AG, Lucerne, Switzerland), and tissue samples were centrifuged (12,500 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min) to obtain extract proteins. The medium was collected, and the amount of IL-1β was assayed with a 2-site enzyme-linked immunoassay (n = 5 in CMM group; n = 5 in sham group) (ELISA, R&amp;D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022034513483770">
<title>ATP Assay</title>
<p>Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.), and the MM was dissected, placed in a small chamber (volume, 1.8 mL), and superfused at 3 mL/min with sterilized modified Krebs-Henseleit solution to quantify ATP released in the CMM (ipsi) group or sham group on day 7. Mechanical stimulation (10 <italic>g</italic>, 200 <italic>g</italic>, or 300 <italic>g</italic>) was applied with a cone-shaped plastic tip (tip diameter, 5 mm; 20 g/s) placed at the middle of the MM. Each pressure setting was maintained for 10 s and applied 3 times at 4-minute intervals. The intraluminal perfusate (100 mL) was assayed for ATP with a luciferin-luciferase reagent (n = 5 in CMM group; n = 5 in sham group) (100 mL; ATP Bioluminescent Assay Kit, Sigma). Bioluminescence was measured with a luminometer (TD-20/20; Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). ATP concentration was calculated from the ipsilateral/contralateral ATP concentration ratio (%).</p>
<p>To assess the correlation between the expression of P2X<sub>3</sub>R in TG neurons and IL-1β in MM after CMM, we successively injected an IL-1β antagonist (IL1ra; 100 nmol in 50 µL/day from day 0 to day 7) into the MM. On day 7, HWTs in response to mechanical stimulation of the MM were measured, and P2X<sub>3</sub>R expression was assessed in TG neurons (n = 5 in sham group; n = 5 in CMM + saline group; n = 5 in CMM + IL1ra group).</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry of Neurons Innervating Masseter Muscle in TG</title>
<p>A 3% solution of FG in saline (10 µL) was injected by means of a 100-µL Hamilton syringe with a 30-gauge needle into the left masseter muscle before electrical stimulation of the MM. On day 7, anesthetized rats were transcardially perfused with saline, followed by a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Ipsilateral TGs were dissected out after perfusion, immersed in the same fixative for 4 hrs at 4°C, and then stored in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 30% sucrose for 12 hrs for cryoprotection. TGs were cut on the horizontal plane, along the long axis of the ganglion, at a thickness of 10 µm. For analysis, every 10th section—4 sections <italic>per</italic> TG—was chosen for each rat.</p>
<p>TG sections were incubated with rabbit anti-P2X<sub>3</sub>R polyclonal antiserum (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) after dilution at a concentration of 1:1,000 in 0.01 M PBS containing 4% normal donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich). After being rinsed with 0.01 M PBS, sections were incubated in Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:100 in 0.01 M PBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 2 hrs at room temperature. To assess P2X<sub>3</sub>R expression in TG neurons innervating the MM, we identified and analyzed Alexa Fluor 488-labeled neurons using a BZ-9000 system (Keyence, Osaka, Japan; n = 5 in sham group; n = 5 in CMM + saline group; n = 5 in CMM + IL1ra group). The total number of P2X<sub>3</sub>R-immunoreactive (IR) cells in the 4 TG sections was calculated. Recombinant rat IL-1β was successively injected into the MM for 7 days, and P2X<sub>3</sub>R expression was assessed in TG neurons. Immunohistochemical staining without primary antibody was tested if the anti-P2X<sub>3</sub>R polyclonal antiserum was specific for P2X<sub>3</sub>R. Expression of P2X<sub>3</sub>Rs in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) was also assessed for a positive control.</p>

The ratio did not significantly differ between the CMM (200 g, 33.7 ± 14.6%; 10 g, 18.6 ± 16.2%) and sham rats (200 g, 4.64 ± 2.1%; 10 g, 3.0 ± 1.2%) (<italic>p</italic> = .069 and <italic>p</italic> = .37, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034513483770">Fig. 3A</xref>). The effects of administering the selective P2X<sub>3/2/3</sub> receptor antagonist A-317491 (6 or 60 µg) into the MM were studied in CMM rats or IL-1β-injected rats on day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034513483770">Fig. 3B</xref>). The decrease in HWT was significantly and dose-dependently attenuated at 30 min after A-317491 (60 µg: 232.0 ± 12.4 g) administration as compared with that in the saline-injected rats (173.8 ± 13.2 g) (<italic>p</italic> = .024). We observed a significant increase in HWT 30 min after A-317491 (60 µg) in IL-1β-injected rats compared with that in the saline-injected rats (A-317491, 230.2 ± 17.8 g; saline, 230.2 ± 17.8 g, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034513483770">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>P2X<sub>3</sub>Rs are known to present in primary afferent neurons of MM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034513483770">Ambalavanar <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), and the number of TG neurons expressing P2X<sub>3</sub>R increases after repetitive muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034513483770">Shinoda <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Recent studies have shown that administration of the selective P2X<sub>1</sub>,<sub>3</sub>,<sub>2/3</sub>R agonist α,β-me ATP into the MM decreases the pressure-pain threshold and that the effect of intramuscular injection of α,β-me ATP was blocked by co-administration of the P2X<sub>1,2,3,5,1/5,2/3</sub>R antagonist pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-20,40- disulfonic acid (PPADS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034513483770">Shinoda <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, mechanical hyperalgesia in the MM after daily electrical stimulation of the MM was blocked by administration of the selective P2X<sub>3,2/3</sub> receptor antagonist A-317491. It has been reported that ATP directly activates peripheral primary afferent fibers, thereby increasing their firing frequency <italic>via</italic> activation of the P2X<sub>3</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034513483770">Reinohl <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). We observed that ATP released after 300-g on the MM was significantly higher in CMM rats than in control rats. However, we could not observe any changes in the ATP release following 10-g or 200-g stimulus to the MM (200 g: <italic>p</italic> = .069). These results suggest that more ATP is released after noxious pressure on the MM and that MM-nociceptive afferents expressing P2X<sub>3</sub>R were activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034513483770">Reinohl <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034513483770">Hoheisel <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), thereby resulting in MM hyperalgesia. The levels of endogenous cytokines in the MM are elevated in several painful muscular diseases such as the inflammatory myopathies and fibromyalgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034513483770">Feng <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). IL-1β concentration increases in human skeletal muscle after prolonged eccentric exercise and has also been shown to be increased after the application of a potent hyperalgesic agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034513483770">Fielding <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>). It was also shown to be elevated in the trapezius muscle of humans with an active myofascial trigger point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034513483770">Shah <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). In an animal model of muscle hyperalgesia, carrageenan injected into the MM caused an immediate increase in IL-1β concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034513483770">Ono <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). In the present study, on day 7 after excessive muscle contraction, IL-1β concentration was significantly higher in CMM rats than in sham rats. In sum, these findings suggest that IL-1β released in the MM after CMM may be involved in chronic MM pain.</p>
<p>The mean percentage of FG-labeled P2X<sub>3</sub>R-positive neurons was significantly increased in TG following successive IL-1β injections into the MM for 7days. Moreover, successive IL1ra injections attenuated the decrement of HWT in CMM rats and significantly limited the CMM-related increase in the mean percentage of FG-labeled P2X<sub>3</sub>R-positive neurons in TG. Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β directly or indirectly modulate expression of P2X<sub>3</sub>R in primary afferent neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034513483770">Dessem <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Previous studies reported that P2X<sub>3</sub> expression in TG neurons was increased by calcitonin gene-related peptide associated with enhanced expression of IL-1β gene and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034513483770">Dessem <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034513483770">Shi <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). We found that P2X<sub>3</sub>R expression in TG neurons was associated with marked IL-1β expression, and that enhanced ATP release in the MM was involved in mechanical hyperalgesia in the MM after CMM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034513483770">Fig. 4</xref>). However, we could not show direct interaction between ATP and IL-1β releases associated with MM hyperalgesia. Further studies to measure ATP and IL-1β concentration during electrical stimulation of the MM may be necessary to address this question.</p>
