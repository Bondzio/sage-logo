<abstract>
<p>Organizational communities of practice (OCoPs) are used increasingly to capitalize on valuable distributed knowledge and to fully engage the innovation potential of employees. OCoPs have become increasingly global in their reach, relying of necessity on virtual forms of interaction to engage the participation and expertise of a global workforce. An unanswered question is whether the performance of such global OCoPs may be predicted to benefit or suffer owing to their nationality diversity. Using data from over 200 members of 30 global OCoPs in a Fortune 100 US-based multinational mining and minerals processing firm, we found that nationality diversity was curvilinearly (U-shaped) related to community performance. We also found that the curvilinear relationship was moderated by psychological safety and the extent of rich communication media use. Specifically, the arc relating nationality diversity and performance became more positive at the higher end, and less negative at the lower end, to the extent that communities reported higher psychological safety and richer communication media use.</p>

<p>As technology-mediated communication improves, companies increasingly use new types of collaborative entities that are both global and virtual. While global virtual team collaboration is widespread, communities of practice (CoPs) are also being used by more organizations as an additional way to make productive use of globally dispersed knowledge and expertise (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0018726712464076">McDermott and Archibald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0018726712464076">Majchrzak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726712464076">Malhotra et al., 2001</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0018726712464076">Weinstein, 2007</xref>, for examples at Conoco-Phillips, Shell, Boeing-Rocketdyne, and IBM, respectively). CoPs are defined as ‘groups of people who share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic, and who deepen their knowledge and expertise in this area by interacting on an ongoing basis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726712464076">Wenger et al., 2002</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>The original concept of a CoP was based on volunteer participation, informality, and naturally evolving, community-determined missions. <italic>Organizational</italic> communities of practice (OCoPs), however, have evolved as more formalized, purposeful, and bounded forms of CoPs and typically operate alongside more traditional team structures such as virtual and project teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0018726712464076">McDermott and Archibald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726712464076">Swan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0018726712464076">Thompson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726712464076">Wenger et al., 2002</xref>). Their embeddedness within organizations means that OCoPs have elements of both traditional CoPs and organizational teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726712464076">Kirkman et al., 2011</xref>) but are, nevertheless, distinctive. For example, with respect to their composition, OCoPs are likely to be larger (and potentially more diverse) than typical organizational (e.g. work, project) teams, but with more formal constraints around who can join (and leave) than a typical CoP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0018726712464076">McDermott and Archibald, 2010</xref>). This hybrid character becomes problematic when organizations seek guidance on how to design and manage OCoPs. While OCoPs have received less attention than CoPs and teams, research is emerging on what makes these collaborative entities optimally effective. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726712464076">Kimble et al. (2001)</xref> found that relational attributes such as trust, confidence, and OCoP identity were critical for performance, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726712464076">Kirkman et al. (2011)</xref> found that OCoPs are typically more effective when they have high levels of empowerment, interdependent members, and active, involved leaders.</p>
<p>Despite growing interest in what makes OCoPs effective, to our knowledge, there has been no research on how OCoP composition influences effectiveness. Importantly, for our study, OCoPs are increasingly global in composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726712464076">Kimble et al., 2001</xref>) and virtual in structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726712464076">Kimble and Hildreth, 2005</xref>). However, examining how the globally diverse make up of these increasingly virtual entities influences OCoP performance has not been examined. This omission is problematic because OCoPs are expected to generate breakthrough innovations worldwide based on the input of a diverse set of members from different countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726712464076">Cox, 2005</xref>). We thus examine how one common element of globally distributed OCoPs, their diverse national makeup (i.e. nationality diversity), drives the performance of these collaborative entities. Performance in this context refers to the extent to which OCoPs realize goals and objectives that emanate from their unique missions.</p>
<p>Nationality diversity is defined as the extent to which members vary on country of origin and is the variety type of diversity in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726712464076">Harrison and Klein’s (2007)</xref> typology, describing qualitative differences on a categorical attribute. Nationality is a superordinate determinant of individuals’ identities, meaning that it is likely to be more salient and influential than other demographics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726712464076">Dahlin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726712464076">Hambrick et al., 1998</xref>), particularly because it determines communication patterns, interaction styles, and the content and structure of individuals’ trait hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712464076">Earley and Mosakowski, 2000</xref>). Nationality is even more salient in global virtual collaboration because synchronous, real-time communication has to be arranged by the time zones of contributing member countries, imposing additional coordination demands based on national origin or location<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0018726712464076">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712464076">Cramton and Hinds, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712464076">Gibson and Gibbs, 2006</xref>). Despite the salience of nationality and the rapid increase in the use of OCoPs to link globally distributed employees, research examining the influence of nationality diversity on their effectiveness is scant. This is problematic because as companies continue to use nationally diverse OCoPs, the effects of nationality diversity need to be more fully understood in order for the OCoPs to perform optimally. Consequently, our goals here were to: (a) examine the nature of the relationship between nationality diversity and OCoP performance; and (b) identify contingency factors that may help to explain when nationality diversity has maximum benefit for OCoPs operating in global contexts.</p>
<p>We make three contributions to the literature on the performance of global collaborative entities. First, we propose that the relationship between nationality diversity and OCoP performance will be U-shaped. Consistent with laboratory-based research on face-to-face teams that found a U-shaped relationship between nationality diversity and team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712464076">Earley and Mosakowski, 2000</xref>), we also propose a U-shaped relationship in our field setting based on a theoretical understanding of how social categorization and information/decision-making theories function simultaneously in collectives with varying levels of nationality diversity. Importantly, support for our prediction would mean that theories underlying nationality diversity effects would also be consistent in a global OCoP context.</p>
<p>Second, we examine the potential moderating effects of psychological safety, or the degree to which a collective is perceived as being safe for interpersonal risk-taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726712464076">Edmondson, 1999</xref>), on the proposed curvilinear nationality diversity−OCoP performance relationship. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712464076">Gibson and Gibbs (2006)</xref> found that increasing levels of psychological safety moderated a linear, negative relationship between nationality diversity and innovation in global virtual teams, we treat psychological safety as a moderator of curvilinear, rather than linear, effects in the relationship between nationality diversity and collective performance. Thus, in the context of this particular collective form (i.e. the global OCoP), we are suggesting that psychological safety may act as both an inhibitor of negative diversity−performance effects and an enhancer of positive effects.</p>
<p>Finally, we examine the moderating effects of the extent of rich communication media use on the nationality diversity−OCoP performance relationship. Because global OCoP members are so heavily reliant on electronic communication to carry out tasks, a better understanding of how nationality diversity interacts with the richness of the communication media is warranted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726712464076">Hertel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726712464076">Kirkman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726712464076">Martins et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, while the use of OCoPs for knowledge sharing and innovation application has been growing, we know relatively little about how they function as designated collectives in organizations or what determines their effectiveness. The small body of empirical research investigating the functioning and effectiveness of OCoPs consists mainly of qualitative case studies focusing on less formal, loosely coupled arrangements (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726712464076">Gherardi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712464076">Gongla and Rizzuto, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726712464076">Kimble and Hildreth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0018726712464076">Wenger, 1998</xref>). In addition, in the organization we studied here, approximately 30 per cent of OCoPs that were initially launched had ceased operation (i.e. members were no longer interacting with each other) within one year. Interviews with managers suggested that many others were struggling to engage their members from around the globe in synergistic and productive activity. This was despite a high level of encouragement from management, who credited the more successful OCoPs with the development of innovations and new, shared best practices worth millions of dollars in both cost savings and increased global production. We therefore attempt to explore the conditions under which the ‘global’ aspect of global, virtual OCoPs can be optimally realized.</p>

<title>Literature review and hypotheses</title>
<p>Before discussing specific relationships involving OCoP effectiveness, it is important to highlight the differences between OCoPs and both more traditional CoPs and virtual teams. Regarding CoPs, they were initially discussed as voluntary communities of midwives, tailors, meat cutters, and other professions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712464076">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>) and have been formally adopted by business organizations looking to enhance knowledge management and innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726712464076">Cox, 2005</xref>, refers to this process as the ‘commodification’ of CoPs: 534). Whereas the original idea of a CoP was based on volunteer participation and purely organic development, OCoPs are not traditional communities in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712464076">Lave and Wenger’s (1991)</xref> sense. Rather, OCoPs are established around some substantive domain and may have more specific, identifiable goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726712464076">Cox, 2005</xref>). There may be a core group of members assigned and associated deliverables and timetables for them to achieve. As an example of the difference, led by a group of university computer technicians, Cisco Systems used a community of practice composed of customer networks to generate innovative product ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726712464076">Lundkvist, 2004</xref>). Conversely, led by its assistant treasurer, Shell Chemicals used a global, virtual OCoP to develop a companywide, cash-focused approach to financial management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0018726712464076">Majchrzak et al., 2004</xref>). Note that the emphasis changes, from idea generation in a traditional CoP to the sharing and application of ideas in an OCoP to help achieve specific organizational outcomes.</p>
<p>In addition to the differences between OCoPs and more traditional CoPs, virtual OCoPs are also distinct from more traditional and formally structured virtual teams. For example, compared with virtual teams, virtual OCoPs are more loosely coupled, semi-structured, and are in parallel arrangements. Indeed, Raven (2003) argued that communities and teams can be differentiated on seven factors, such that traditional CoPs are typically characterized by: (i) task missions that are emergent rather than mandated by the organization; (ii) membership that is voluntary rather than appointed; (iii) leadership that is emergent and dynamic rather than defined explicitly; (iv) task interdependence that is lower rather than higher; (v) structure that is emergent rather than designed; (vi) accountability flowing from internal, social sanctions rather than external, formal sanctions; and (vii) resources coming from members rather than from the organization. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0018726712464076">McDermott and Archibald (2010)</xref> argued that OCoPs are different from teams in the following ways: (i) longer, rather than shorter, time horizons that are needed to develop a body of knowledge or a discipline over the long term; (ii) facilitative, rather than directive, leadership; (iii) permeable, rather than stable, membership boundaries; and (iv) knowledge sharing and codification of information rather than a strict, problem-solving focus.</p>
<p>Using this previous research as a guide, the organizational form of CoPs is, in some ways, similar to both traditional CoPs and teams and falls somewhere in between loosely organized CoPs and the more formalized virtual teams. For example, like teams, the organization will likely have more control over OCoP missions, assigns at least some members and perhaps even leaders, requires a higher level of interdependent work, provides more formalized community structures, and provides at least some resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726712464076">Wenger et al., 2002</xref>). However, unlike teams and more like traditional CoPs, working in a community is not a person’s full-time job and there are no formal sanctions or consequences for low community performance or failure. The freedom to operate autonomously and self-regulate participation likely enables underlying individual-level differences and social-psychological processes to flourish. This means that virtual OCoPs are ‘weak situations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0018726712464076">Mischel, 1977</xref>) in that virtual OCoP members do not have the same bureaucratic restraints of more traditional virtual teams and are generally free to engage and operate as they see fit. Given that there are both similarities and differences between virtual OCoPs and virtual teams, we integrate both literature streams to inform our theoretical development of nationality diversity effects.</p>
<sec id="section2-0018726712464076">
<title>Nationality diversity and global OCoP performance</title>
<p>OCoPs are frequently used to coordinate worldwide on best practices and innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726712464076">Kimble and Hildreth, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726712464076">Kimble et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0018726712464076">Wenger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726712464076">Wenger et al., 2002</xref>). As such, they are often designed to include a mix of member nationalities in order to leverage expertise and know-how relating to the countries in which the community’s decisions will be implemented. Given that the OCoP literature has yet to address nationality diversity effects, we turned to virtual teams literature reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726712464076">Hertel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726712464076">Kirkman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726712464076">Martins et al., 2004</xref>) for guidance, finding only two studies examining nationality diversity effects in global virtual collaboration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712464076">Gibson and Gibbs (2006)</xref> found that nationality diversity was negatively related to global virtual team innovation, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726712464076">Polzer et al. (2006)</xref> found that it was unrelated to global virtual team conflict and trust. In face-to-face collaboration, studies have found: positive effects on firm-level internationalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726712464076">Caliguiri et al., 2004</xref>), subsidiary performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726712464076">Gong, 2006</xref>), and decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0018726712464076">Watson et al., 1993</xref>); negative effects on job satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0018726712464076">Verkuyten et al., 1993</xref>); mixed effects on international expansion decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0018726712464076">Punnett and Clemens, 1999</xref>); or curvilinear effects on team processes and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712464076">Earley and Mosakowski, 2000</xref>) and information use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726712464076">Dahlin et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, findings for nationality diversity are mixed in both face-to-face and virtual collaboration research.</p>
<p>In building a theoretical rationale for a relationship between nationality diversity and global OCoP performance, we must address three important questions regarding nationality, including: (a) why would nationality be salient in global OCoPs; (b) why would it matter for global OCoP performance; and (c) why would diversity on nationality be curvilinearily (i.e. U-shaped) related to global OCoP performance? Regarding the salience of nationality, we have already noted that it is a superordinate determinant of individuals’ identities and will also likely be heightened because interactions involving synchronous media will require a high level of coordination owing to different time zones and locations. Moreover, in multinational settings, one of the main purposes for assembling a global OCoP is to access and integrate different knowledge stores from various countries worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726712464076">Kimble et al., 2001</xref>). Tapping country-specific knowledge also likely elevates nationality beyond other demographics (we also note that the OCoPs in our sample were same-function, making functional differences less salient).</p>
<p>Regarding the question of why nationality differences should matter for OCoP performance, nationality differences represent several group attributes that help drive the success of these communities. For example, within OCoPs, especially those charged with problem-solving and process-improvement tasks, nationality diversity is a potent marker for contextually anchored knowledge and experience. To illustrate, the communities in our sample (i.e. a Fortune 100 US-based multinational mining and minerals processing firm) were charged with identifying variations in operational practices that have evolved in refineries located in different countries. Their primary goal was to identify best practices from members’ descriptions of the different ways processes are done and to codify these as new and generalizable operational routines that are suitable to be implemented across the company’s global refinery network. So, a community may have become aware of a promising modification to the design and maintenance regime of a pump that has been in use in a refinery in South America. The community then discusses and reviews all aspects of that refinery’s approach to distill the key generalizable elements of best practice and makes recommendations for implementing specific changes to pump design and maintenance in refineries located in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.</p>
<p>The degree of nationality diversity within a global OCoP is thus functional in several ways. First, it increases the potential knowledge about why things are done differently in particular countries (e.g. cultural norms, infrastructure differences, approaches to research and development, plant design, historical accident). Second, it also improves the contextual and cultural knowledge that is relevant to how best practice can be introduced in locations other than the one in which it was developed. In short, people from different nations are expected to bring different perspectives, values, skills, and attributes that, when combined, produce better outcomes for tasks that are complex and global (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726712464076">Maznevski, 1994</xref>). Nationality diversity is a much broader construct than cultural value diversity. Because nationality encompasses a great number of important differences, including values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712464076">Earley and Mosakowski, 2000</xref>), nationality diversity should provide a powerful explanation for how composition differences affect OCoP performance.</p>
<p>This leads to our third question: why would we predict that nationality diversity would be curvilinearly (i.e. U-shaped) related to performance? Our curvilinear prediction is based on two competing processes that are widely recognized as influencing the productive output of groups: social categorization and information/decision-making. Social categorization theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726712464076">Hogg and Terry, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0018726712464076">Tajfel, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0018726712464076">Turner, 1987</xref>) suggests that people sort one another into categories based on demographics, perceive members of their own category as superior, and engage in stereotyping, distancing, and disparaging treatment of people in other categories. Simply stated, the potential for social categorization increases with greater group diversity, such that performance is likely to decline, rather than improve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0018726712464076">Van Knippenberg and Schippers, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0018726712464076">Williams and O’Reilly, 1998</xref>). The information/decision-making perspective, on the other hand, suggests that diverse individuals bring different perspectives to tasks, which can result in better quality decisions and better collaborative performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0018726712464076">Williams and O’Reilly, 1998</xref>). Whether diversity has positive or negative effects on group performance will likely depend on which of these underlying processes is most strongly activated in a given situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726712464076">Ely and Thomas, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712464076">Horwitz and Horwitz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0018726712464076">Van Knippenberg et al., 2004</xref>), and it is this contingency perspective that we use to justify our prediction of the U-shaped relationship.</p>
<p>Theoretically, we propose that positive effects for nationality diversity will emerge when social categorization effects are minimized, while the information/decision-making effects are more pronounced. Low levels of social categorization effects would mean that OCoP members would find it easier to create a unified community culture, which typically outperforms ones that have subgroups or fractured cultures (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712464076">Earley and Mosakowski, 2000</xref>). In addition, strong information/decision-making effects would mean that members have the diverse knowledge to generate breakthrough ideas. Thus, our U-shaped prediction is based on knowing when unified community cultures are most (or least) likely to occur and when members have the necessary knowledge and expertise to complete their tasks.</p>
<p>When comparing communities with low, moderate, and high levels of nationality diversity, we suggest that the most powerful social categorization effects are likely to occur at moderate levels. This argument is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726712464076">Lau and Murnighan’s (1998)</xref> faultline theory, which suggests that groups will be more likely to fracture along a particular attribute when there is a roughly even division of members along that attribute. Social categorization processes engaged by moderately diverse group composition increases the chance for subgroup formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712464076">Lau and Murnighan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726712464076">Li and Hambrick, 2005</xref>), meaning that a unitary group identity will be less likely to emerge, resulting in less effective group processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726712464076">Gibson and Vermeulen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726712464076">Li and Hambrick, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0018726712464076">O’Leary and Mortensen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726712464076">Polzer et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Subgroup formation would be particularly problematic because a primary purpose of OCoPs is to identify, create and share new knowledge within organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726712464076">Cox, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726712464076">Kimble et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726712464076">Wenger et al., 2002</xref>). The development of effective learning mechanisms requires the acquisition and sharing of knowledge within groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726712464076">Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726712464076">Edmondson, 1999</xref>). Subgroups that are generated as a consequence of social categorization processes will likely disrupt the communication, coordination, knowledge sharing, and integration mechanisms so critical for learning-oriented tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712464076">Cramton and Hinds, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0018726712464076">Zollo and Winter, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712464076">Carton and Cummings (2012)</xref> theorized that as the number of identity-based subgroups increases, identity fragmentation increases, which also enhances social categorization effects while reducing any positive potential from the information/decision-making perspective. Thus, despite the potential advantages predicted by the information/decision-making perspective in moderately nationally diverse groups, strong social categorization effects likely make the communication and integration of such knowledge much less likely. Supporting this view, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726712464076">Gibson and Vermeulen (2003)</xref> found that strong subgroups formed on the basis of demographic differences in globally diverse face-to-face groups resulted in lower levels of group learning compared with moderately strong subgroups. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0018726712464076">O’Leary and Mortensen (2010)</xref> found that subgroups based on location in geographically distributed teams were associated with lower team identification, less effective transactive memory, and more conflict and coordination problems.</p>
<p>Regarding the very low and very high levels of nationality diversity, in line with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712464076">Earley and Mosakowski, 2000</xref>), we predict that the performance of communities will be roughly similar at both levels (i.e. U-shaped). For example, at very high levels of nationality diversity, members are likely to represent many different nationalities, making social categorization on nationality less likely and a unified community culture more likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712464076">Earley and Mosakowski, 2000</xref>). In addition, the range of knowledge and experience represented by the different nationalities creates stronger effects from the information/decision-making perspective at higher levels of nationality diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712464076">Cramton and Hinds, 2005</xref>). Low social categorization effects combined with high information/decision-making effects create the optimal conditions for nationality diversity to pay off, with very high OCoP performance.</p>
<p>Similar to communities with higher nationality diversity, those with lower levels of nationality diversity will also exhibit fewer tendencies for social categorization effects on nationality because all members will be from the same nation, and thus unified community cultures are more likely. Unfortunately, identical or highly similar member nationalities in communities also dampen potentially beneficial effects as there will be less diversity of information, knowledge, or perspectives to generate the type of breakthrough innovations that OCoPs are intended to create. However, while nationally homogeneous communities may not possess the information diversity advantages common to more heterogeneous ones, members are still likely to engage in high levels of information exchange and idea integration and form unified cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712464076">Earley and Mosakowski, 2000</xref>). Indeed, members might still possess divergent information and ideas that originate from sources other than nationality (e.g. previous experience, use of relevant networks, conducting appropriate research). As a result, we predict that OCoPs will perform better when nationality diversity is either high or low but will perform worse with moderate levels of nationality diversity.</p>
<p>In support of our theoretical prediction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712464076">Earley and Mosakowski (2000)</xref> found a U-shaped relationship between nationality diversity and team performance, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726712464076">Dahlin et al. (2005)</xref> found the same relationship between nationality diversity and range of information use. However, unexpectedly, Dahlin et al. found inverted U-shaped relationships between nationality diversity and both depth and integration of information use despite their theoretical arguments supporting a U-shaped relationship. Despite these unexpected findings, we maintain our U-shaped prediction for two reasons. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726712464076">Dahlin et al. (2005)</xref> coded the range, depth, and integration of student case study reports – which they employed as outcomes or products of team interaction. In other words, their measures were the extent that these informational characteristics were evident in the products of students’ case responses. While interesting outcomes to consider, these say nothing about how the students interacted to produce those reports. Whether such reports exhibited a high or low range, depth, or integration of information reveals nothing about the media richness of members’ interactions that produced them. In contrast, in our study, we incorporate the media richness of interactions as an important contingency affecting team outcomes. Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726712464076">Dahlin et al. (2005</xref>: 1120) reasoned that their unexpected findings might have resulted from nationality differences fading ‘into the background’ as team members increased familiarity with one another. However, as we have already argued, nationality of OCoP members is likely to remain highly salient because global virtual OCoP communication has to be arranged by time zones, thereby reinforcing member nationality differences. Thus, for these reasons, we propose:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: The relationship between nationality diversity and OCoP performance is U-shaped.</p>

<title>Moderators of the nationality diversity−OCoP performance relationship</title>
<p>It is noteworthy that the laboratory studies that found a curvilinear relationship between nationality diversity and group processes or performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726712464076">Dahlin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712464076">Earley and Mosakowski, 2000</xref>) did not identify potential moderators. However, given that diversity effects have generally been found to depend on contingency factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0018726712464076">Van Knippenberg et al., 2004</xref>), we believe that it is theoretically and practically important to explore moderators of our hypothesized curvilinear relationship. Such moderators would suggest that nationality diversity effects depend not only on the particular configuration of diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726712464076">Polzer et al., 2006</xref>) but also on other aspects of the collaborative entities and their environments. We identified two moderators of the nationality diversity–OCoP performance relationship – psychological safety and the extent of rich communication media use – and we used three criteria to narrow down our choice of moderators.</p>
<p>First, in line with our theoretical discussion above, we chose moderators that are likely to enhance positive information/decision-making effects and reduce the likelihood of negative social categorization effects. For example, in order for diversity to have positive effects based on the information/decision-making perspective, community members would have to feel psychologically safe enough to fully elaborate their differing perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0018726712464076">van Knippenberg et al., 2004</xref>); and richer media would also reduce miscommunication and allow for more accurate elaboration of different viewpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726712464076">Hinds and Weisband, 2003</xref>). Second, we focused on elements of the global OCoP environment that are relevant to the effective performance of learning-oriented tasks. For example, psychological safety has been shown to enhance the learning and innovation performance of collaborative entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726712464076">Edmondson, 1999</xref>), including those in virtual environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712464076">Gibson and Gibbs, 2006</xref>), while richer media would again enhance the accuracy of communication to enhance learning. Finally, we chose moderators that reflect the specific context in which global OCoPs operate. For example, from a contextual perspective, the OCoPs in our sample are both globally diverse and geographically distributed, meaning that the communities will carry out their tasks using a variety of electronically mediated communication tools, making communication richness and a psychologically safe community climate instrumental. While not exhaustive, our choices were driven by the dominant theories underlying diversity effects, the learning-oriented tasks the communities perform, and the global, virtual context in which the OCoPs operate, which have been argued to be the primary criteria when deciding on which constructs to include in group level performance models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726712464076">Kozlowski and Bell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726712464076">Mathieu et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-0018726712464076">
<title>Psychological safety</title>
<p>Groups engaging in learning-oriented, knowledge-based work have been found to be more effective to the extent that members feel psychologically safe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726712464076">Edmondson, 2003</xref>). Psychological safety implies that group members value each other’s skills and talents, feel free to take risks, share unique information, and discuss mistakes without fear of retribution despite the possible formation of subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726712464076">Edmondson, 1999</xref>). While most of the research has been carried out in face-to-face collaboration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726712464076">Hulsheger et al., 2009</xref>, for a meta-analytic review), psychological safety has been found to counteract some of the potential negative effects of nationality diversity in global virtual teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712464076">Gibson and Gibbs, 2006</xref>). However, given that we are proposing a curvilinear U-shaped relationship between nationality diversity and global virtual OCoP performance, we predict a very different form for this moderating effect.</p>
<p>For example, as one moves from completely nationally homogeneous communities to moderately heterogeneous ones (i.e. the lower portion of the U-shaped curve), we expect that psychological safety will reduce the negative impact of increasing nationality diversity on OCoP performance, providing a counteractive force to the otherwise negative influence of social categorization processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726712464076">Polzer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0018726712464076">Williams and O’Reilly, 1998</xref>). That is, even though subgroups based on nationality are more likely to form as nationality diversity increases to moderate levels, psychological safety should help to stimulate countervailing information sharing and communication processes. Despite the salience of subgroups, OCoPs high in psychological safety can still achieve mutual positive distinctiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712464076">Cramton and Hinds, 2005</xref>), or view their differences with respect and as sources of advantage for the whole community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726712464076">Ely and Thomas, 2001</xref>, refer to this as an integration-and-learning perspective). However, this is only half of the story. As OCoPs become increasingly heterogeneous with respect to nationality, and the slope of the relationship between diversity and OCoP performance switches to positive, a climate of psychological safety should reduce any residual feelings of discomfort associated with communication and information sharing. Psychological safety will thus begin to amplify the positive effects of high nationality diversity on OCoP performance. In effect, the U-shaped curve should rotate in a counter-clockwise fashion to the extent that communities are higher on psychological safety. Thus, we propose:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: The relationship between nationality diversity and global OCoP performance is moderated by psychological safety such that: (a) at relatively low levels of nationality diversity, the relationship (i.e. the downward slope of the U-curve) is weaker for OCoPs higher in psychological safety; and (b) at relatively high levels of nationality diversity, the relationship (i.e. the upward slope of the U-curve) is stronger for OCoPs higher in psychological safety.</p>

<sec id="section5-0018726712464076">
<title>Extent of rich communication media use</title>
<p>Of necessity, global OCoPs use a variety of technology-mediated communication tools that vary in communication richness, defined as the information-carrying capacity of a communication channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726712464076">Daft and Lengel, 1986</xref>). Media such as video- or phone-conferencing are generally regarded as richer owing to their ability to convey nonverbal cues such as tone of voice, facial expressions, or body language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726712464076">Daft and Lengel, 1986</xref>). Richer communication media enhance social presence, or the degree to which a communication channel develops interpersonal connections through the transmission of cues such as attentiveness, warmth, emotion, and understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0018726712464076">Short et al., 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>We argue that, to the extent that communities use richer communication media, the U-shaped curve of the relationship between nationality diversity and OCoP performance will also rotate counter-clockwise. For example, research consistently shows that nationality has a direct effect on the communication preferences and interactions of collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712464076">Anawati and Craig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726712464076">Davis and Bryant, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712464076">Earley and Mosakowski, 2000</xref>). In nationally homogeneous communities, communication preferences will likely be similar and accepted. Much less opportunity for miscommunication exists, because the unwritten ‘interaction rules’ of communication are shared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712464076">Earley and Mosakowski, 2000</xref>: 27; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726712464076">Ely and Thomas, 2001</xref>). Conversely, in nationally heterogeneous communities, members will likely have different preferences for communication practices and media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726712464076">Hall, 1976</xref>). As a result, opportunities for miscommunication will likely be higher compared to nationally homogenous communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726712464076">DeSanctis and Monge, 1999</xref>). Similarly, at moderate levels of nationality diversity, different communication preferences will likely result in miscommunication, particularly across, rather than within, subgroups.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726712464076">Hinds and Weisband (2003)</xref> argued that less knowledge-sharing takes place when group members use more technology-mediated communication, owing to the difficulty of sharing complex information. In nationally diverse OCoPs, reduced information- sharing will be compounded by differences in communication preferences and interaction styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712464076">Earley and Mosakowski, 2000</xref>). Richer communication media facilitate the sharing of complex information because richer auditory and visual cues are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712464076">Griffith and Neale, 2001</xref>). Such media are also likely to be more inclusive of all members in the community, because leaner media is more typically used for communication within subgroups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712464076">Cramton and Hinds, 2005</xref>). Thus, the use of richer communication media should strengthen the relationship between nationality diversity and OCoP performance in more nationally heterogeneous communities. While richer media may sometimes be eschewed by members who are not comfortable with the spoken language used by the community, we argue that richer media will tend to ‘level the playing field’ by allowing for a wider range of communication preferences to be satisfied.</p>
<p>We know of no research examining the moderating effect of rich communication media use on the relationship between nationality diversity and OCoP performance. However, while some have argued that people can use leaner communication media to create richer exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712464076">Carlson and Zmud, 1999</xref>), researchers generally agree that richer media are still necessary, especially for tasks such as negotiation and conflict management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712464076">Cramton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726712464076">DeSanctis and Monge, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712464076">Griffith and Neale, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712464076">Malhotra and Majchrzak, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726712464076">Maznevski and Chudoba, 2000</xref>). Global virtual group members also prefer either face-to-face or videoconferencing, especially early in a group’s lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712464076">Anawati and Craig, 2006</xref>), and global virtual teams that use some face-to-face meetings perform better than those that do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726712464076">Davis and Bryant, 2003</xref>). Practitioners recommend that global virtual team members meet at least initially and periodically during a team’s life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712464076">Malhotra and Majchrzak, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of our specific moderating prediction for extent of rich communication media use, as one moves from completely nationally homogeneous communities to moderately heterogeneous ones (i.e. the lower portion of the U-shaped curve) and subgroup formation increases, one would expect that the extent of rich communication media use will reduce the negative impact of increasing nationality diversity on performance because it enhances inclusiveness and minimizes miscommunication across subgroups. For the upward slope of the U-curve, we anticipate that the relationship between nationality diversity and OCoP performance will be more strongly positively related as subgroup formation decreases, and richer media compensate for miscommunication owing to varying media preferences. Once more, we expect a counter-clockwise rotation of the U-shaped curve to the extent that communities use rich communication media. Thus, we propose:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: The relationship between nationality diversity and OCoP performance is moderated by the extent of rich communication media use such that (a) at relatively low levels of nationality diversity, the relationship (i.e. the downward slope of the U-curve) is weaker for OCoPs using richer communication media; and (b) at relatively high levels of nationality diversity, the relationship (i.e. the upward slope of the U-curve) is stronger for OCoPs using richer communication media.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>We examined a Fortune 100 US-based multinational mining and minerals processing firm with over 300 operations in 44 countries that had formally implemented global OCoPs. To aid survey development, we conducted in-depth interviews with 56 employees, including at least one person from each of the global OCoPs that appear in our final sample. These interviews were designed to elicit descriptions of how and why the OCoPs had been constituted, where they existed within the overall structure of the organization, how they were led, and how their performance was assessed. We subsequently also interviewed 16 OCoP leaders to obtain their views on the aforementioned issues. The OCoPs were functionally based, rather than cross-functional, and were charged with generating breakthrough innovations designed to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the company worldwide. An example improvement included the development of a risk assessment tool for operating valves, resulting in increased processing capacity.</p>
<p>The OCoPs had been operating for an average of four years, and both leaders and core members were formally assigned. Many of the OCoPs also had volunteers move in and out depending on interest and specific OCoP activities. As the charge of the OCoPs was to integrate ideas from operations worldwide, some were composed of people from many different countries. Because different processes were typically used in different ways in the variety of countries where the organization operated, the nationally diverse OCoPs provided a means to integrate the disparate knowledge needed to develop breakthrough innovations. However, other OCoPs had lower nationality diversity depending on the countries involved in OCoP implementations. Owing to the high cost of getting all members physically together in the same location on a regular basis, members relied heavily on technologies such as video-conferencing, teleconferencing, email, instant messaging, virtual meeting software, and knowledge repositories.</p>
<p>A total of 229 out of 337 core OCoP members responded to an on-line survey, representing 20 countries and 37 OCoPs, for an individual response rate of 68 per cent. More than 85 per cent of community members were working in the countries in which they were born. We focused on core OCoP members because volunteers were not easily identifiable and often participated in multiple OCoPs, which made it impractical for them to participate. OCoPs ranged in size from five to 36 members, with an average size of 12 members. A total of 33 out of 37 OCoP leaders responded to a different on-line survey for a response rate of 89 per cent. Additionally, three OCoPs were dropped from the sample owing to low response rates, leaving a total of 30 OCoPs and 218 individuals for analysis. Dropping these OCoPs increased the average within-community response rate to 82 per cent, which is important given we were examining nationality diversity at the OCoP level of analysis. Other field studies of nationality diversity had similar response rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712464076">Gibson and Gibbs, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018726712464076">Table 1</xref> shows demographic characteristics for both OCoP members and leaders.

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The final sample of 30 OCoPs met our criteria for selection, which included: (a) a minimum life span of one year to ensure that members had adequate time to work together to allow for the effects of nationality diversity to emerge; (b) clear identity such that the OCoPs had names, and boundaries existed between the OCoPs; and (c) the physical separation of members because we were interested in factors moderating the nationality diversity−OCoP performance relationship in a virtual context. We contacted each OCoP member and leader via email to explain the survey purpose and logistics, and included a website link to an on-line survey. Respondents had to indicate to which OCoP they belonged in order to aggregate the data but, to protect anonymity, did not have to report their name. Respondents were also assured of confidentiality by indicating that no one from the company would see their individual responses to the survey, and all data would be stored by the first author’s university. To lower concerns about cross-sectional designs, the survey link was sent to OCoP leaders approximately 60 days after the member surveys were completed. We administered surveys in English because all business was conducted in English.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section10-0018726712464076">
<title>Nationality diversity</title>
<p>Nationality diversity was assessed using a single survey question asking the respondents to indicate their birth country. A second question asked them to indicate the country in which they were raised primarily. In most cases (greater than 97 %), respondents listed the same two countries. In the case of differences, we selected the country in which the person indicated he or she was raised primarily (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726712464076">Hambrick et al., 1998</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0018726712464076">2</xref></sup> Consistent with our theoretical treatment of nationality diversity as a type of variety diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726712464076">Harrison and Klein, 2007</xref>) and in line with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726712464076">Bunderson and Sutcliffe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712464076">Gibson and Gibbs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726712464076">Polzer et al., 2006</xref>), we assessed it with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726712464076">Blau’s (1977)</xref> index. Values range from zero, indicating a complete lack of diversity to close to one, indicating a very high level of diversity. In our study, the minimum value was .32, while the maximum value was .87. The mean diversity score was .65, with a standard deviation of .14.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0018726712464076">
<title>Psychological safety</title>
<p>We measured psychological safety using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726712464076">Edmondson’s (1999)</xref> 7-item measure, replacing the word ‘team’ with ‘community’ (α = .74). Example items included: ‘Members of this community are able to bring up problems and tough issues with other members’ and ‘It is safe to take a risk in this community.’ We calculated the within-community interrater agreement statistic using r<sub>wg</sub> and obtained a sufficiently high median level = .78 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712464076">James et al., 1993</xref>), supporting the aggregation of OCoP members’ survey responses. We also calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). The resulting ICC(1) of .20 (<italic>F</italic> = 1.89; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) indicates that a significant portion of the variance in individual responses can be accounted for by OCoP membership; and the ICC(2) value of .61 indicates that the measure exhibited sufficient variance to be modeled at the OCoP level of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712464076">Bliese, 2000</xref>). Thus, we averaged responses across OCoP members to yield a community-level score.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0018726712464076">
<title>Extent of rich communication media use</title>
<p>Based on an existing measure of electronic communication dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726712464076">Kirkman et al., 2006</xref>), the extent of member-rich communication media use was assessed by listing the various communication media available to OCoP members generated from the interviews with members and leaders. Possible media choices included: face-to-face meetings, videoconferencing, teleconferencing, discussion boards, email, instant messaging, knowledge repositories, and planning and scheduling tools. Respondents were asked to report the percentage of time they spend using each type of media when carrying out OCoP-related work, with their percentages summing to 100 per cent. Because communication media that are synchronous with communication occurring in real time and that allow for a wider range of non-verbal communication are generally regarded as richer media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726712464076">Daft and Lengel, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726712464076">Kirkman and Mathieu, 2005</xref>), we classified face-to-face meetings, video-conferencing, and teleconferencing as richer communication media, as compared with the other options. Thus, the measure of rich communication in our study included the percentage of time members indicated that they used these three forms of media when carrying out OCoP work. We calculated the within-community interrater agreement statistic using r<sub>wg</sub> and obtained a sufficiently high median level = .70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712464076">James et al., 1993</xref>), which supports aggregation of members’ responses. Percentages ranged from 5 to 40 per cent (mean = 21%, SD = 9%). The associated ICC(1) = .08 (<italic>F</italic> = 7.27; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and ICC(2) = .40 indicate that communities sufficiently varied in terms of their use of rich media. Therefore, we averaged responses across OCoP members to yield a community-level score.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0018726712464076">
<title>OCoP performance</title>
<p>To ascertain the nature of OCoP performance, we asked interviewees the following questions: ‘How is performance measured’, ‘Have you some specific examples of performance improvements’, and ‘Are there any ongoing performance tracking/monitoring processes in place? Give examples.’ Their responses illustrated that OCoP performance is defined in terms of their goals and mission accomplishment along several lines. We therefore constructed a 13-item measure of OCoP performance (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0018726712464076">Appendix</xref> for items) based on the common themes that were mentioned. OCoPs were assessed by their external leaders using this measure. Their ratings constituted a single underlying dimension (α = .95), and thus we averaged them to represent overall OCoP performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0018726712464076">
<title>Covariate</title>
<p>Previous research has demonstrated that task interdependence can significantly influence collective performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726712464076">Kirkman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726712464076">Kozlowski and Bell, 2003</xref>). Therefore, we obtained a measure of task interdependence from OCoP leaders using a 3-item scale (α = .84) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726712464076">Campion et al. (1993)</xref>. The mean level of task interdependence was 5.2 (on a 7-point, Likert-type scale), suggesting a moderately high level of interdependence.</p>

<title>Hypothesis tests</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018726712464076">Table 2</xref> displays the means, standard deviations, reliability coefficients, and zero-order correlations for the study variables. To test H1 (i.e. the curvilinear relationship between nationality diversity and OCoP performance), we centered all predictor variables and used polynomial regression (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018726712464076">Table 3</xref>). In Step 1, we entered the linear effects of task interdependence, psychological safety, and extent of rich communication media use, which yielded a marginal <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .23 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). However, the only significant unique influence was a positive relationship of the covariate task interdependence (β = .43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In Step 2, we entered the linear effect of nationality diversity, which was not significantly related to OCoP performance (Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .04; β = .23, n.s.). In Step 3, we added the squared nationality diversity term, which carries the curvilinear trend, to the equation, which generated a significant increment in performance variance accounted for [(Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .14; β = .46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05)], supporting H1. Notably, the fact that both the linear and curvilinear terms were positive is consistent with the expected U-shaped form of relationship. Plotting the pattern of this effect (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726712464076">Aiken and West, 1991</xref>: 66, and the dashed curve associated with the moderate level of psychological safety in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018726712464076">Figure 1</xref>) revealed the expected U-shaped pattern between nationality diversity and OCoP performance. That is, performance was lowest among OCoPs with a moderate degree of nationality diversity and rose higher at both relatively lower and higher levels. Notably, our results appear to exhibit a nonsymmetrical ‘J-shaped’ rather than the expected ‘U-shaped’ relationship. To explore this, we partitioned the OCoPs into quartiles according to their nationality diversity scores and found that the upper quartile of OCoPs (<italic>N</italic> = 9, <italic>M</italic> = 5.17, SD = .55) exhibited significantly higher performance (<italic>t</italic>(17) = 2.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) than did the lowest quartile (<italic>N</italic> = 9, <italic>M</italic> = 4.08, SD = 1.39), suggesting that the observed curvilinear results are actually better approximated by a more nuanced J-shaped rather than a symmetrical U-shaped relationship.</p>

<p>Relationship between nationality diversity and organizational community of practice performance as moderated by psychological safety</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0018726712464076-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>To test H2 and H3, we added moderators to the polynomial regressions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018726712464076">Table 3</xref>). Building on the model testing H1, in Step 4, we entered simultaneously the interaction terms computed between OCoPs’ linear nationality diversity scores and both psychological safety and the extent of rich communication media use. It is important to highlight that adding product terms computed between the moderators and the <italic>linear</italic> nationality diversity score to an equation that also contains the nationality diversity squared term permits one to model changes in the relative degree of arc of a given curvilinear relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726712464076">Aiken and West, 1991</xref>). This approach to moderated polynomial regression tests relatively subtle changes in the degree of a general relationship – akin to ordinal interactions in moderated regression techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0018726712464076">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0018726712464076">Table 3</xref> shows, adding the interaction terms resulted in a significant increase in criterion variance accounted for [(Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05], indicating that one or both of the moderating effects were significant. Inspection of the specific parameter estimates revealed that the interactions between nationality diversity and both psychological safety (β = .47; p &lt; .05) and the extent of rich communication media use (β = .44; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) were significant, supporting H2 and H3, respectively.</p>
<p>To plot the significant interactions, we followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726712464076">Aiken and West’s (1991)</xref> guidelines for interpreting interactions with curvilinear relationships. Specifically, we estimated curves between nationality diversity and OCoP performance for <italic>average</italic> (mean), <italic>low</italic> (minus one SD) and <italic>high</italic> (plus one SD) values of the moderators. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018726712464076">Figure 1</xref>, the influence of psychological safety on the curvilinear nationality diversity−OCoP performance relationship was to induce a counter-clockwise rotation of the arc, as expected. The positive relationship between high nationality diversity and OCoP performance became stronger amidst high levels of psychological safety (solid curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018726712464076">Figure 1</xref>), whereas the negative relationship between low nationality diversity (dotted curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018726712464076">Figure 1</xref>) and OCoP performance became weaker when combined with high psychological safety (supporting H2). Similarly, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018726712464076">Figure 2</xref>, the moderating effects of the extent of rich communication media use on the curvilinear nationality diversity–OCoP performance relationship evidenced the same pattern, although the magnitude of counter-clockwise shift was stronger. The positive relationship between high nationality diversity and OCoP performance became stronger when combined with high levels of rich communication media use (solid curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018726712464076">Figure 2</xref>), whereas the negative relationship between low nationality diversity and OCoP performance became weaker when combined with relatively high amounts of rich communication media use (dotted curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018726712464076">Figure 2</xref>, supporting H3).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We examined global OCoPs, a relatively new and interesting organizational collaborative form designed to generate knowledge and innovation for competitive advantage. Because they are frequently designed to stimulate learning across locations worldwide, they are often nationally diverse. Thus, our primary purpose was to determine the nature of the relationship between nationality diversity and global OCoP performance, as well as to better understand the conditions under which such diversity pays dividends for performance. We found that global OCoP nationality diversity was curvilinearly (i.e. U-shaped) related to performance, and that the overall relationship was augmented to the degree that community members felt psychologically safe and used relatively rich communication media. We next discuss theoretical and managerial implications, limitations, and future research.</p>
<sec id="section18-0018726712464076">
<title>Theoretical implications</title>
<p>As globalization continues to increase for organizations worldwide, people of many different nationalities are being asked to work across various country locations using primarily electronically mediated communication tools. As discussed earlier, nationality is generally considered to be a superordinate determinant of identity that transcends other demographic characteristics such as age or gender. Nationality differences in global OCoPs can hinder performance because members bring different expectations to their communities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726712464076">Gibson and Vermeulen, 2003</xref>), and identification with the OCoP as a whole is reduced (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726712464076">Hambrick et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712464076">Lau and Murnighan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726712464076">Polzer et al., 2006</xref>). In attempting to identify and examine the exact nature of the relationship between nationality diversity and global OCoP performance, we focused on several factors that might work to facilitate this relationship positively.</p>
<p>First, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018726712464076">Figure 1</xref>, OCoPs performed better when they were either very low or very high in nationality diversity and worse when it was moderate. Our findings support the small amount of research that found curvilinear relationships between nationality diversity and face-to-face team performance using students in laboratory studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726712464076">Dahlin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712464076">Earley and Mosakowski, 2000</xref>). To our knowledge, we are the first demonstrate this effect in collectives that work primarily through virtual means. We had theorized that moderate levels of nationality diversity could produce faultlines, which OCoP members might use to categorize one another, resulting in subgroup formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712464076">Lau and Murnighan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726712464076">Li and Hambrick, 2005</xref>). Such configurations are challenging for global, virtual OCoPs because of the intersection of nationality and physical separation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712464076">Cramton and Hinds, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712464076">Gibson and Gibbs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0018726712464076">O’Leary and Mortensen, 2010</xref>), amplifying the categorization effects found in nationally diverse face-to-face groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712464076">Earley and Mosakowski, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>While these results may have some applicably to more traditional virtual teams, it is likely that our outcome may be partly based on the specific nature of OCoPs. As previously noted, we believe that OCoPs function within a ‘weak situation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0018726712464076">Mischel, 1977</xref>), as participation is voluntarily, they exist as a parallel function, and there is no consequence for low community performance or failure. Considering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0018726712464076">Mischel’s (1977)</xref> conceptualization of strong and weak situations, researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712464076">Beaty et al., 2001</xref>) have found that personality and contextual performance behavior would be most strongly correlated when there are only weak cues and less correlated when there are strong cues. In our study, we found that OCoP performance depends a great deal on nationality diversity. It may well be that the weaker OCoP context makes them ripe for the impact of individual differences based on nationality diversity, whereas a stronger traditional virtual team context may restrict the influence of such differences.</p>
<p>Second, we found that higher levels of OCoP performance occurred at higher and lower levels of nationality diversity. Interestingly, our actual findings revealed a more specific form of a U-shaped relationship − a J-shaped relationship − meaning that the highest levels of performance occurred in OCoPs with a very high level of nationality diversity. Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712464076">Earley and Mosakowski (2000)</xref>, we made no a priori predictions about the level of performance between OCoPs that were either low or high on nationality diversity. However, our J-shaped findings are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the information/decision-making perspective on diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0018726712464076">Williams and O’Reilly, 1998</xref>), which would suggest that a greater diversity of perspectives and information should result in the superior performance. Our findings parallel those showing that nationally heterogeneous face-to-face student teams produced a greater range of perspectives and generated more alternatives than did homogeneous teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0018726712464076">Watson et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, we were interested in contingency factors that could alter the strength of the relationship along the curvilinear path between nationality diversity and OCoP performance (i.e. psychological safety, extent of rich communication media use). Our moderating predictions were designed to help ascertain how global organizations can get the most out of their nationally diverse global OCoPs. As predicted, psychological safety weakened the negative relationship between nationality diversity and performance for OCoPs lower in nationality diversity, and then strengthened the positive relationship between these two variables at higher levels of nationality diversity. While the moderating effect was most pronounced at very high levels of nationality diversity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018726712464076">Figure 1</xref> also shows an improvement in performance for moderately diverse OCoPs, those that are most vulnerable to faultline and subgroup formation effects. Psychological safety may work against categorization by reducing the drive to sort OCoP members into subgroups based on nationality. Motivation to categorize comes primarily from the need to enhance self-image by identifying more closely with similar others and disparaging dissimilar others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0018726712464076">Tajfel, 1981</xref>). If members experience high psychological safety with an entire OCoP in spite of nationality diversity, however, this likely facilitates identification with the whole OCoP rather than small groups of similar others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712464076">Lau and Murnighan, 2005</xref>). For nationally homogeneous OCoPs, moderating effects for psychological safety were not as pronounced.</p>
<p>Also as predicted, the extent of rich communication media use moderated the curvilinear relationship between nationality diversity and OCoP performance. Using richer communication media weakens the negative relationship between nationality diversity and OCoP performance for those lower in nationality diversity, and then strengthens the positive relationship between these two variables for OCoPs higher in nationality diversity. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018726712464076">Figure 2</xref>, the findings were similar to those for psychological safety. For OCoPs low in the extent of rich media use, OCoP performance is actually higher for those that are more homogeneous with respect to nationality diversity. These findings suggest that leaner media are more effectively used by nationally homogeneous OCoPs as the chances for miscommunication are lower.</p>
<p>In contrast, when the extent of rich communication media use is higher, the upward slope of the curve is dramatically higher and steeper than that for OCoPs using leaner communication media, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018726712464076">Figure 2</xref> shows. Thus, we show that richer communication media is most important for maximizing OCoP performance when they are nationally diverse. To our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate this result. Our findings also are consistent with those showing positive effects for rich communication media in global virtual teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712464076">Anawati and Craig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726712464076">Davis and Bryant, 2003</xref>), practitioner recommendations that virtual collaborators should meet initially face-to-face as well as periodically throughout a team’s life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712464076">Malhotra and Majchrzak, 2005</xref>), and theoretical arguments that complex tasks in virtual collaborations will be best accomplished using richer media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712464076">Griffith et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726712464076">Bell and Kozlowski, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, while we found that richer communication media helped highly nationally diverse OCoPs perform better, our findings are not entirely consistent with other research on global virtual collaboration. For example, previous research has found that it is actually leaner media that was associated with superior group outcomes owing to higher minority participation and fewer demographic biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726712464076">Bhappu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726712464076">Bordia, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712464076">Jarvenpaa and Leidner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726712464076">McLeod et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0018726712464076">Staples and Zhao, 2006</xref>). Social presence theory suggests that the fewer channels available within a medium, the fewer social cues exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0018726712464076">Sproull and Kiesler, 1986</xref>) and the fewer members pay attention to the actual presence of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0018726712464076">Short et al., 1976</xref>), which could result in fewer negative diversity effects. Our finding that it is richer, not leaner, communication media that accelerate the upward slope of the curve for highly nationally diverse communities is most likely owing to the complex, on-going problem-solving tasks the OCoPs in our study were carrying out, necessitating the use of richer communication media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712464076">Cramton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726712464076">DeSanctis and Monge, 1999</xref>). Noticeably, most previous research showing positive effects for leaner media involved laboratory studies and relatively simple tasks being performed over short time frames. This finding is critical for the increasing global virtual collaboration used by companies worldwide, and sheds new light on theories of electronic communication media use in these complex, knowledge-based entities.</p>

<title>Managerial implications</title>
<p>Practically speaking, our goal was to inform global leaders as to how they can best manage their nationally diverse global OCoPs in today’s organizations. Our findings suggest that managers have two possible courses of action available to them in leading these increasingly used and important entities. The first centers on increasing the psychological safety members feel when they collaborate. This may involve being consistently accessible, asking for members’ input, and encouraging community members to discuss their own mistakes in a constructive manner (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726712464076">Edmondson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726712464076">Edmondson et al., 2001</xref>). Other interventions, such as community charters or structuring activities, could be helpful for building members’ psychological safety during their early interactions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0018726712464076">Mathieu and Rapp, 2009</xref>). Second, managers should stress the need for face-to-face meetings, videoconferences and teleconferences for OCoPs higher in nationality diversity. Resource constraints may make face-to-face contact difficult, and many OCoP members eschew videoconferencing in favor of teleconferencing owing to poor-quality video and lack of bandwidth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0018726712464076">Majchrzak et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, teleconferencing will likely be a common choice among OCoP members for richer media communication. However, our results indicate that it is the combination of all three media that is important to enhancing the relationship between nationality diversity and OCoP performance. Given the rapid development of sophisticated technology, such as voice and video over the web, however, the cost−benefit ratios of using such systems are getting more attractive. For less nationally diverse global, virtual OCoPs, our results showed that using leaner communication media such as email, instant messaging, and knowledge repositories was associated with higher OCoP performance.</p>
<p>Because leaders are not solely responsible for creating and maintaining a psychologically safe climate or encouraging the use of richer communication media, global OCoP members should also be actively involved in enhancing these two aspects. To create a psychologically safe communication climate, members should actively support fellow OCoP members when they take risks or make mistakes, value members’ unique talents and skills, and encourage members to discuss problems and difficult issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726712464076">Edmondson, 1999</xref>). Regarding communication richness, while it may be tempting for OCoP members to rely more on leaner, asynchronous media owing to fewer coordination difficulties, they should encourage one another to communicate using richer, synchronous media to take full advantage of nationality diversity.</p>

<sec id="section20-0018726712464076">
<title>Limitations and future research</title>
<p>As with any study, our research has a number of limitations that might open up interesting avenues for future research. For example, we were particularly interested in the question of when nationality diversity will have the biggest payoff for global OCoP performance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0018726712464076">Van Knippenberg et al., 2004</xref>), but did not attempt to directly answer the question of <italic>how</italic> nationality diversity affects performance. While our approach is consistent with recent research on nationality diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726712464076">Dahlin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712464076">Gibson and Gibbs, 2006</xref>), it would certainly be helpful for future research to examine directly potential mediators of the nationality diversity−performance relationship such as identity, efficacy, role expectations, communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712464076">Earley and Mosakowski, 2000</xref>), and subgroup formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0018726712464076">O’Leary and Mortensen, 2010</xref>). The latter, it will be recalled, formed part of our rationale for the curvilinear relationship between nationality diversity and OCoP performance. What is needed to supplement our research are observational, case, and longitudinal studies to capture the internal dynamics of OCoPs. It would be interesting, for example, to follow the quality and frequency of participation of both minority and non-minority members on nationality and examine whether minority status is a larger barrier to participation for members in some cultures compared to others. However, it is also worth noting that, because most research on nationality diversity has been carried out in face-to-face collaboration, identifying internal processes for global, virtual collaboration may not parallel those identified previously.</p>
<p>Another limitation is that, while our measure of nationality diversity is consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726712464076">Bunderson and Sutcliffe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712464076">Gibson and Gibbs, 2006</xref>), cultural distance (i.e. relative differences on nationality between OCoP members) might also be important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726712464076">Hambrick et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726712464076">Lau and Murnighan, 1998</xref>) and affect perceptions of OCoP nationality heterogeneity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712464076">Earley and Mosakowski, 2000</xref>). While our measure of nationality diversity was highly correlated with a cultural distance measure created using the GLOBE country scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712464076">House et al., 1999</xref>), future research on nationality diversity might consider these relative differences.</p>
<p>Our sample size of 30 OCoPs might also be considered a limitation even though it is in line with previous studies of virtual collaboration (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726712464076">Kirkman et al., 2004</xref>). Low sample sizes are susceptible to the influence of extreme or outlier cases, although, to insure against this, we closely inspected the variable distributions to ensure that no outliers unduly influenced these results and found no evidence of such anomalies. Low sample sizes also limited the number of predictor variables that we could examine. For example, we focused on only one aspect of heterogeneity, nationality. Clearly, there are other demographic differences that might affect OCoP performance. However, the primary research question we set out to answer − how to maximize the benefits of OCoP nationality diversity − was best addressed with this focus.</p>
<p>In light of the above, we took two steps to help bolster our earlier claim that nationality diversity is a superordinate determinant of identity. First, we re-ran all analyses while controlling for age and gender diversity, as well as average member tenure and size of the OCoPs, and the results remained largely unchanged. Second, we substituted age and gender diversity for nationality diversity in our analyses and found no significant linear, curvilinear, or interactive effects. While our focus on nationality diversity is consistent with the notion that nationality is a superordinate determinant of identity, with larger sample sizes future researchers should examine whether other types of diversity contribute to the prediction of OCoP performance beyond that accounted for by nationality diversity or other relevant explanatory variables (e.g. experience living abroad, number of visits to fellow member sites, personality).</p>
<p>Because our interest was focused primarily on nationality diversity, regardless of where OCoP members were physically located, we did not include measures of physical location or geographic dispersion. Another reason for excluding these measures was that the vast majority (greater than 85%) of community members in our sample were working in the countries in which they were born.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0018726712464076">4</xref></sup> However, in samples in which the majority of members work and reside in countries other than their birth country, assessing physical location and geographic dispersion will likely be more critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712464076">Cramton and Hinds, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0018726712464076">O’Leary and Cummings, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>OCoPs are prevalent in many of today’s organizations, and they represent an especially valuable form of collaboration for large organizations whose members are globally distributed. Global OCoPs represent a relatively new mechanism for global coordination and collaboration and, unfortunately, research lags practice with respect to this collaborative form. With more and more organizations turning to OCoPs for competitive advantage, it will be imperative for organizational scholars to focus their attention on ways to maximize their benefits. Our research showed that the relationship between nationality diversity and OCoP performance is far from straightforward and depends, to an extent, on factors often under members’ and managers’ control. These include feelings of psychological safety and the extent to which members use rich communication media. By taking the actions supported by our research, it is hoped that managers can begin to ensure that the promises of global OCoPs are fully realized.</p>
