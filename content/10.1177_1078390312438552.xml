<abstract>
<p><bold>BACKGROUND</bold>: Assuring patient safety on inpatient psychiatric units is a complex issue that involves mitigating risks as well as promoting safety by building an environment that supports engagement and constructive activity. <bold>OBJECTIVES</bold>: To review the concerns surrounding inpatient psychiatric units in the United Kingdom that led to a service user–designed program, Star Wards. The essential elements of the program are outlined along with a rationale for how Star Wards’ 75 ideas effectively build greater engagement, address boredom, and enhance safety on inpatient psychiatric wards. <bold>DESIGN</bold>: This article reports on the development and dissemination of Star Wards. Included is information on the program’s effectiveness; data were drawn from an evaluation of Star Wards conducted by a U.K. university. <bold>RESULTS</bold>: Psychiatric wards that have adopted Star Wards have demonstrated improvements in patient satisfaction, staff morale, levels of boredom, and incidents of aggression. <bold>CONCLUSION</bold>: Boredom and poor staff–patient engagement on psychiatric wards may contribute to aggression and violence. Drawing on Star Wards ideas, nurses and service users can work together to enhance safety via an active ward program and greater staff–patient engagement. The innovations suggested by Star Wards are practical ways to build programming and create platforms for dialogue with service users, particularly around what they need to move toward recovery.</p>

<p>Safety on mental health wards<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1078390312438552">1</xref></sup> is both a quality priority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078390312438552">Delaney &amp; Johnson, 2008</xref>) and, for service users, a deeply personal practical concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390312438552">Frueh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1078390312438552">Quirk, Lelliott, &amp; Seale, 2004</xref>). On the most basic level, safety is primarily about the avoidance of immediate physical harm to patients or staff. Attempting to understand and prevent violence on inpatient wards, researchers have examined the conditions and interactions that correlate to aggression on psychiatric inpatient units (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1078390312438552">Whittington, Lancaster, Meehan, Lane, &amp; Riley, 2006</xref>). One of the safety issues that has been identified is the environmental contexts that seed tension and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078390312438552">Daffern, Howells, &amp; Ogloff, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078390312438552">Hamrin, Iennaco, &amp; Olsen, 2009</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078390312438552">Hamrin et al. (2009)</xref> point out, factors such as staff detachment, lack of patient autonomy, and insufficient ward activities are all precipitants for aggression and violence.</p>
<p>As a service user, advocate, researcher, and innovator, I (MJ) have studied issues surrounding inpatient ward safety, particularly the contextual variable of patient boredom and lack of engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078390312438552">Janner, 2009</xref>). Understanding the issues surrounding poor care on inpatient psychiatric wards, from both the clinical literature and service user’s perspectives, an innovative U.K. program (Star Wards) was developed to address these issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078390312438552">Janner, 2006</xref>). This article reviews the literature on issues of boredom and lack of patient–staff engagement and traces how they contribute to both aggression and a negative experience for patients on psychiatric wards. Next, the Star Wards program will be described: its grounding principles, structure, evaluation, and practical application.</p>
<sec id="section1-1078390312438552">
<title>Framing the Issue of Care and Safety in U.K. Wards</title>
<p>In the United Kingdom, the heartening improvements in inpatient care over the past few years arrived in the context of unacceptably low historic norms. Although the intention of every ward is to provide the most therapeutic experience possible, over the past 10 years, a series of government reports in the United Kingdom documented that the quality of wards varied considerably across the United Kingdom. As noted in <italic>The Search for Acute Solutions</italic>, “Acute units have been starved of resources, marginalized when it comes to service development, and then criticised for an excessively custodial form of care” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1078390312438552">Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, 2006</xref>). At this time, government and agency reports depicted several key issues with mental health wards; that is, they were poor on services, staff, physical amenities, and had unacceptable variations in physical design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078390312438552">DH Estates and CSIP Acute Care Programme, 2008</xref>). Noted were issues with budgets, staff training and support, policies and procedures, culture, occupancy levels,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1078390312438552">2</xref></sup> and usage of street drugs among particular patient populations. These variations were also evident in care (particularly in the far end of the care continuum) where despite national guidelines and regulation, patients had experiences of locked doors, special observation, seclusion rooms, “physical restraint,” nurses holding a patient (usually on the floor), and rapid intramuscular tranquilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1078390312438552">Whittington et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the points raised in these reports was the issue of patient boredom and lack of programming, a problem noted in both government reports and qualitative research on the patient experience on U.K. psychiatric wards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078390312438552">Lindow &amp; McGeorge, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078390312438552">Quirk &amp; Lelliott, 2001</xref>). The Centre for Mental Health (formerly the Sainsbury Center for Mental Health) reported that of the 600 hours of potential activity in the average 7-day stay, patients may have constructive activity in approximately 10 of the 600 hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1078390312438552">Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, 2006</xref>). The phenomenon of boredom and lack of engagement has also been noted in qualitative literature documenting the patient experience on U.S. inpatient psychiatric units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1078390312438552">Shattell, Andes, &amp; Thomas, 2008</xref>). Boredom implies the lack of any meaningful daily activity, a situation antithetical to active treatment. Lack of activity and involvement may also seed disturbance and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078390312438552">Hamrin et al., 2009</xref>). Why is a ward with constructive programming and greater staff engagement a safer ward?</p>
<p>It is a complex relationship. As explained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1078390312438552">Shepherd and Lavender (1999)</xref> when patients are unoccupied in an environment marked by poor staff–patient interaction and low levels of structured activity, “violence may be fostered through the absence of opportunities to learn and be reinforced for appropriate alternatives to aggression. Aggression may become one of the most effective ways to communicate distress and gain attention” (p. 160). In their examination of the context of aggressive events, the authors note that incidents decreased when patients were occupied in therapeutic or recreational activities, leading them to conclude the provision of planned, structured activity and the opportunity for positive interpersonal contact may reduce the incidence of aggressive incidents. This theoretical explanation for the phenomenon was borne out by the National Audit on Violence, which documented boredom as one of the six main factors contributing to unsafe wards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078390312438552">HealthCare Commission, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Staff engagement with patients is an additional concern on both U.K. wards and U.S. inpatient psychiatric units. Inpatient units are hectic places where staff seek a more therapeutic engagement with patients but report that numerous work demands make it difficult for them to engage in therapeutic relationships (Cleary &amp; Edwards, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1078390312438552">Shattell et al., 2008</xref>). This lack of patient contact is associated with lower staff satisfaction scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1078390312438552">Seed, Torkelson, &amp; Alnatour, 2010</xref>). Although expert nurses can articulate the complexity of their role and engagement with patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390312438552">Carlsson, Dahlberg, Ekebergh, &amp; Dahlberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078390312438552">Johnson &amp; Hauser, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078390312438552">McElroy, 1996</xref>), time studies over two decades report a consistent finding: nurses spend as little as 4% of their day engaged in therapeutic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078390312438552">Mental Health Act Commission, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1078390312438552">Sharac et al., 2010</xref>). Staff involvement builds the culture of the unit. Conversely, lack of engagement can contribute to increased patient tensions, which are in turn associated with increased adverse incidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390312438552">Bowers et al., 2006</xref>). Given the presence of staff on the ward, what explains the lack of interaction with patients?</p>
<p>Investigating this phenomenon, Janner proposed several reasons for staff being physically present on the ward yet often not interacting with patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078390312438552">Janner, 2006</xref>). One explanation rests with the notion of defensive practice. As explained in the <italic>Search for Acute Solution</italic>, defensive practices arises when, for fear of litigation or blame, nurses focus attention of anticipating volatile or violent situations. A culture builds where rather than interacting, nurses stand vigilant, “on standby for difficult incidents” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1078390312438552">Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, 2006</xref>). This idea was echoed in a recent study of barriers to enacting change on inpatient wards, in the United Kingdom: “They (nurses) are subject to sustained overt or implied criticism for the perceived failure of acute care, ranging from poor standards, through inadequate levels of engagement with patients to poor leadership and inadequate educational preparation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078390312438552">Brennan, Flood, &amp; Bowers, 2006</xref>, p. 481). This phenomenon that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078390312438552">Brennan et al. (2006)</xref> called protective defensiveness results in stagnation: “It was very evident in the work of City Nurses that clinical workers are averse to taking risks no matter how therapeutic” (p. 479). As explained in this study, in this situation the focus becomes violence management and adherence to legal requirements rather than creative therapeutic work. Thus, defensive practice may help protect units from negative media coverage and patients from immediate physical harm, but the costs are high in terms of limiting interactions vital to patients’ recovery.</p>
<p>Examining the lack of engagement on a typical ward, Janner also suggested that another reason for poor levels of patient–staff interaction is that there is both too much and too little to talk about (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078390312438552">Janner, 2006</xref>). On one hand, there is much going on with patients around issues with their current emotional state, symptoms, physical health, and relationships. On the other hand, on a typical psychiatric ward with little activity and scant structure, there is nothing happening around patients or staff. In this situation, there is too little to say and the lack of natural platforms for interaction becomes a barrier to engagement. As described below, one of the core ideas of Star Wards was to provide activities that made interaction a more natural part of everyday practice.</p>

<title>Star Wards</title>
<p>Star Wards was conceived following the first author’s (very healing) time as a detained mental health inpatient. Following this difficult time of dealing with intense issues (with a nursing staff that was extremely sensitive and supportive), I began to reflect on what would create inpatient stays that were actively therapeutic and ward cultures where engagement replaced observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078390312438552">Janner, 2009</xref>). Star Wards began to take shape. At its inception was my vision of acute wards where talking therapies played a substantial role, patients were supported in management of symptoms, the unit culture was marked by mutual support, the schedule was organized around a full program of activities that not only eliminates boredom but also contributes to recovery, and, finally, patients retained and built on community ties. What resulted was 75 practical, mainly low-cost and easy to implement, ideas for increasing engagement on inpatient wards.</p>
<p>Star Wards is not intended to be a prescriptive on what a ward unit must do to improve engagement and quality of care. At its inception, Star Wards was designed to act as a catalyst for an engaging staff and service users through practical, accessible, and inspirational resource ideas. Thus, the 75 ideas of Star Wards are meant to be a springboard for improvement, providing staff with examples and suggestions for how to think about the current situation on their wards and the areas for potential improvement. In the Star Wards guide, the 75 core ideas for action are presented in a straightforward manner along with the accompanying research that supports the effectiveness of talking therapies and the theoretical importance of being listened to, physical activity, and recreation. The 75 ideas of Star Wards are organized into seven categories, but all the activities share a common aim, that is, creating a ward culture marked by engagement and meaningful activities. They include suggestions around talking therapies, recreation, physical health, care planning, ward community, patient responsibility, and visitors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078390312438552">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The Star Wards program is contained in a guide, available on the Internet, that describes the 75 ideas, rationale for action, and consumer/professional perspectives on how Star Wards addresses needed change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078390312438552">Janner, 2006</xref>). Initially, in helping implement the program on select units, the Star Wards team<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1078390312438552">3</xref></sup> worked collaboratively with a full range of mental health wards from acute admission to high security, to improve inpatients’ experiences and outcomes. The approach to the project was then and remains now one of “appreciative inquiry”: finding out what’s going <italic>well</italic> in inpatient care and validating the gain while working to find areas of improvement.</p>
<p>A psychiatric unit does not need the assistance of the Star Ward team to begin to implement these ideas; any psychiatric ward or unit staff could access the Star Wards guide and begin to think about ways to adopt the suggestions. Indeed, the role of the Star Wards team has increasingly become a catalyst to change through inspiring, collecting, and disseminating best practice in inpatient care. The Star Wards program, the research supporting its inception, and the testimony of early adapters of the program is available on the Internet through the Star Wards website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078390312438552">Janner, 2006</xref>). At the current time, 600 wards in the United Kingdom are taking part in Star Wards, which is about 70% of all U.K. mental health wards, from acute admission to high security.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1078390312438552">
<title>Program Evaluation</title>
<p>In 2007, the Star Wards team initially sought feedback on the program from the 100 units that had adopted the strategies. A survey was sent to them of largely open-ended questions and several Likert-type items. The 87 units that responded to this survey reported positive changes, particularly shifts in ward culture and increased staff morale. In the Likert-type questions, respondents indicated that they were very likely to recommend the program to other wards. The Star Wards team used the survey to ask what elements of the program were useful, for additional suggestions of activities, and for sharing of best practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078390312438552">Bright, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2009, in collaboration with Dr Allen Simpson and City University, the Star Wards team conducted a more extensive survey of program participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1078390312438552">Simpson &amp; Janner, 2010</xref>). At the time of the survey, approximately 500 wards were registered as participants in Star Wards. The broad purpose of the survey was to explore the impact of Star Wards on the participating wards; to evaluate the use and value of Star Wards resources including publications, website, and newsletter; to identify the challenges and difficulties that remain; and to elicit members’ views on the substance and direction of future Star Wards activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1078390312438552">Simpson &amp; Janner, 2010</xref>). The survey consisted of 54 questions, which were a mix of forced choice, Likert scale, and open-ended responses. A shorter 14 item survey (to be completed by service users on the ward) was included in the survey envelope. It was composed of a similar mix of question types.</p>
<p>Topics covered in the 54-item survey included the amount of Star Wards–related activity being used, the main impacts on patients and staff (including aggression, patients leaving the ward, staff–patient contact, patient satisfaction), and the accessibility and usefulness of Star Wards resources. Respondents were also queried on the challenges and barriers to implementing the program and sustaining activities. Ideas for the future development of Star Wards were encouraged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1078390312438552">Simpson &amp; Janner, 2010</xref>). Particular demographics of the ward were also collected including the location, type of ward, and length of involvement with Star Wards.</p>
<p>The surveys (both staff and shorter service user form) were mailed to the 500 wards using some aspect of the Star Wards program. A total of 188 (37.6%) staff surveys were completed, with a majority of returns coming from the United Kingdom (94.6%) and 8 (4%) from Scotland and 1 each from Wales and Australia. Almost half (<italic>n</italic> = 84, 44.7%) were acute psychiatric wards and 17 (9%) were psychiatric intensive care units. A further 43 (22.9%) were rehabilitation wards; 20 (10.6%) were secure units and 18 (9.6%) wards for older people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1078390312438552">Simpson &amp; Janner, 2010</xref>). The survey yielded a mix of quantitative and qualitative data, which were analyzed using SPPS version 16 for descriptive statistics (Quantitative data) and analytic software (QSR N6), using conventional content analysis for qualitative analysis.</p>
<p>The main findings of the study indicated that following adoption of Star Wards the staff reported:</p>
<list id="list1-1078390312438552" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Improvements in staff morale, in patient satisfaction and quality of care</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Reduction in aggression on the ward (reported by 71% of respondents)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increased staff–patient contact on 81% of wards, with 30 wards reporting a “big” or “massive” increase<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1078390312438552">4</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Star Wards–related activities have improved ward atmosphere on more than 85% of wards, with 26% reporting a “big” or “massive” difference</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Physical environment had improved on 71% of wards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1078390312438552">Simpson &amp; Janner, 2010</xref>)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A third of the wards that responded (<italic>n</italic> = 62, 32%) returned additional surveys completed by service users on the ward: on 43 of these 62 wards, service users indicated they were aware of Star Wards–related activities with 19.7% reporting a few activities, 39.3% identifying “quite a lot” of Star Wards activities (see full report of data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1078390312438552">Simpson &amp; Janner, 2010</xref>)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The qualitative data from the survey were marked by positive themes, with many comments focused on improvements in staff–patient interactions and respondents noting that interactions were now more “rewarding,” “interesting,” “fun,” and “innovative.” Several themes were identified that captured why respondents believed the project resonated with nurses:</p>
<list id="list2-1078390312438552" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Its focus on patients’ daily experiences and promotion of staff autonomy, support, validation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Its approach being one of appreciative inquiry, affirming, trusting, friendly, human rather than bureaucratic, realistic, collaborative, egalitarian</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The implementation model: the ideas were the catalyst and the wards individually and collaboratively do all the implementation</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Its effect is disproportionately large and startlingly cost-effective</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The program’s flexibility, that is, everything is voluntary, modular, pick ‘n’ mix, highly adaptable even for the most secure settings</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The structure often relies on patient-led initiatives and independent actions, which creates trust, warmth, and credibility</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Given the limitations of a self-report survey and a rather low return rate (37.6%), this evaluation demonstrated that Star Wards had a significant impact on a great number of mental health units particularly on level of activities, staff–patient and patient–patient contact, patient satisfaction, staff morale, ward environments, and conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1078390312438552">Simpson &amp; Janner, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Additional Recognition of Star Wards</title>
<p>Star Wards uses a variety of social media and Internet methods to keep in contact with its members, gathering data on their use of the program and their innovations. One such unit in Northern Ireland reported that their discovery of Star Wards sparked an extraordinary momentum, resulting in rapid transformation. In only a few months, the ward went from a situation of entrenched lethargy and hopelessness among nurses and patients (the latter having previously spent most of their time in bed) to a truly dynamic and therapeutic service. Astonishingly, they have now qualified for our Full Monty award,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1078390312438552">5</xref></sup> just 18 months after becoming a member, and report improvements:</p>

<list-item><p>Community group providing tutors twice a week for educational and therapeutic activities</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Additional indicators of Star Wards success include the broad dissemination of the program in several aspects of patient care. Sheffield Partnership Trust<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1078390312438552">6</xref></sup> are including Star Wards’ communications guide and <italic>TalkWell</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078390312438552">Janner, 2010</xref>) in their Management and Prevention of Aggression training. This is the only training that health care assistants are guaranteed to have, making this a very important precedent.</p>
<p>Finally, the program has received recognition from U.K. nursing leadership. Ian Hulatt, the mental health lead at the Royal College of Nursing, recently offered this view when asked about what supports safe practices:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Safety is a diffuse concept in many ways and impacted by so many variables. There seems no doubt that the environment that is created in in-patient wards is a significant determinant in the outcomes that are achieved by patients and teams caring for them. We know that how staff behave, how they engage with patients and indeed what they offer as meaningful in the patients day is pivotal. Star Wards has been able to significantly impact upon this complex process by offering pragmatic and creative solutions to the challenge of inpatient care.</p></disp-quote>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Among regulatory agencies, researchers, and clinicians, there is a strong consensus of the multicausal nature of aggression and violence on wards and the corresponding need for a comprehensive set of safety-enhancing factors. These safety-enhancing factors center on patients being treated with respect and dignity, being provided with good information, given privacy and choice, being involved in decision making about their own care (including risk), and aspects of how the ward is run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078390312438552">College Center for Quality Improvement and the Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078390312438552">Marshall, Lelliott, &amp; Hill, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078390312438552">Royal College of Nursing, 2008</xref>). These reports also emphasize the importance of patients having meaningful occupation and therapeutic contact with staff. There is particular recognition of the relationship of boredom and the risk for violence. Drawing on Star Wards ideas, nurses and service users can work together to enhance safety via an active ward program and greater staff–patient engagement. The innovations suggested by Star Wards are practical ways to build programming and create platforms for dialogue with service users: particularly around what they need to move toward recovery. Program evaluation data support the effectiveness of Star Wards in reducing boredom, increasing engagement, and also reducing aggressive incidents.</p>
<p>Nurses and service users must work collaboratively to improve inpatient mental health treatment. The past 5 years have seen a welcome return to U.K. inpatient care receiving national attention and resources. Although the support has resulted in significant improvements in standards, national inconsistencies persist. The 2009 Care Quality Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078390312438552">CQC; 2009</xref>) survey of mental health inpatients found that when asked to rate the quality of their care, 73% of patients said it was excellent, very good, or good, and 12% said it was poor. Although 45% of patients said they always felt safe on the ward, 16 patients said they did not feel safe. Cynthia Bower, CQC’s Chief Executive, concluded:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>We see excellent examples of patients being actively involved and participating at each stage of their treatment, such as care planning meetings and reviews. Their care is tailored to their individual needs. This is the gold standard, but we have found many services that could do so much more to improve in this respect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390312438552">CQC, 2010</xref>).</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The strongest measure of the improvement in ward standards including safety is the finding that suicides by U.K. mental health inpatients fell by 56%, from 214 in 1997 to just 94 in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390312438552">Appleby et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Obviously there is room for continued improvements, and Star Wards aims to be a part of the effort. The Star Wards team is energetically introducing <italic>TalkWell</italic> training for all inpatient and community staff, a compendium of ideas on talking with people who have additional communication disadvantages such as psychosis or dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078390312438552">Janner, 2010</xref>). Star Wards’ 75 ideas were the first step in the process of building interaction and engagement. Star Wards was created thanks to St Ann’s Hospital (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078390312438552">Table 2</xref>). I am very grateful for the chance to reciprocate in a small way for the exceptional support they give me. There are also several pioneering U.S. inpatient units that have joined the Star Wards as members, and I (MJ) extend a warm invitation to others to join and thus expand collaboration and learning across the pond.

<td>I menopausally struggle to remember what I did a day ago but retain a vivid recollection of the afternoon 6 years ago when I was compulsorily detained under the Mental Health Act. Along with the devastating humiliation was a terror of what awaited me on the ward. In this state of extreme distress, the only heuristic I could grasp was the systematic abuse portrayed in <italic>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</italic>. I was suffering from suicidal depression rather than paranoia, but nevertheless I “knew” that there was a likelihood if not inevitability of my being killed on the ward. This was definitely not the final exit I craved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fortunately for me, my local, St Ann’s in Tottenham, has no seclusion room in any of their acute wards and nurses on Lordship Ward display exemplary self-restraint and humanity in preventing and defusing disturbances. Once I’d finally calmed down, I realized that the ward was tranquil, clean, bright—and actually a mellow and very supportive place to regain my equilibrium.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My three inpatient admissions at St Ann’s hospital illustrate, and indeed profoundly inform my understanding of, the main safety issues facing U.K. mental health wards. St Ann’s is an ugly, rather dilapidated 19th century sprawl of buildings, grossly underfunded and overoccupied. The nurses exemplify the value of patients being carefully and nonjudgmentally listened and responded to, and are experts at gently and effectively defusing volatile situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390312438552">Bowers, Brennan, Winship, &amp; Theodoridou, 2009</xref>). In contrast, many reports describe very different experiences across the country. My admissions provided me with welcome external backup when my suicide-control mechanism finally broke down. Family and friends were deeply relieved that I was locked up, and were, on the whole, sanguine about ward discomforts and low-key emotional and physical risks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Writing this article has made me check, perhaps strangely for the first time, how my experience chimes with Quirk’s research findings about patients’ evaluation and coping techniques in relation to their safety on the ward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1078390312438552">Quirk, Lelliott, &amp; Seale, 2004</xref>). I have certainly used all the “risk management” techniques Quirk describes, and won’t dwell here on how continuous, night and day requests for cigarettes resulted in me barricading myself in my bedroom. The factors reported by the National Audit of Violence and other research such as the ward being clean, homely, friendly, and staff being accessible, empathetic, and engaged were all contributors to me being and feeling safe. In fact, I still vividly remember my first 5 minutes on the ward when I was “sectioned.” I was experiencing an overwhelming combination of outrage, despair, and sheer terror. But through all this, I realized that the ward was clean, tidy, and devoid of nasty smells, and I subconsciously used this as an instant proxy indicator for the likely safety of the ward.</td>

Benefits of pets to mental health inpatients is now established through academic work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078390312438552">Haughie, Milne, &amp; Elliott, 1992</xref>), pioneering services such as The Eden Alternative (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.edenalt.org">www.edenalt.org</ext-link>) and my own experience of taking my support dog, Buddy, onto many wards.</td>
