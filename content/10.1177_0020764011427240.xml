<p>Dear Editor</p>
<p>Borderline personality symptomatology (BPS) has been associated with abusive experiences in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011427240">Sansone &amp; Sansone, 2007</xref>). In the only published study to our knowledge, we previously found statistically significant relationships between being a victim of bullying in childhood and pathological scores on two measures of BPS in a sample of men and women from an internal medicine outpatient clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011427240">Sansone, Lam, &amp; Wiederman, 2010</xref>). In the present study, we re-examined this relationship in a sample of women outpatients being seen in an obstetrics/gynaecology clinic.</p>
<p>Participants were consecutive women, aged 18 years or older, who were seeking non-emergent care through a university-affiliated obstetrics/gynaecology outpatient clinic. Exclusion criteria were intellectual, medical, psychiatric and/or cognitive impairment <italic>of sufficient severity</italic> to preclude the successful completion of a survey. A total of 427 individuals were approached and 402 agreed to participate, for a participation rate of 94.1%. Of these, 373 completed relevant study measures.</p>
<p>With regard to demographic characteristics, the average age of participants was 26.44 years (SD = 7.47), ranging from 18 to 61 years. Most participants were white (54.2%) or African American (39.1%). Approximately 88% of participants had at least completed high school, whereas 13% had completed college. The majority were never married (71.9%), with 16.9% being married, 6.8% divorced and the remaining separated or widowed. About 80% reported government insurance, 5.5% were privately insured, and 14.3% had no insurance or elected to self-pay.</p>
<p>As patients arrived at the clinic, one researcher (JC) solicited each, informally assessed exclusion criteria, and invited candidates to complete a four-page survey. The cover page of the survey contained the elements of informed consent, and completion of the survey was presumed to be implied consent (specified on the cover page).</p>
<p>The research survey contained: (1) three queries regarding being bullied (‘When you were growing up, were you ever a victim of bullying?’, ‘If yes, for how many years?’ and ‘If yes, how many individual bullies?’); and (2) two assessments for BPS – the borderline personality disorder scale of the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4 (PDQ-4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764011427240">Hyler, 1994</xref>), a nine-item, true/false, self-report version of the criteria for borderline personality as listed in the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition</italic>, and the Self-Harm Inventory (SHI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764011427240">Sansone, Wiederman, &amp; Sansone, 1998</xref>), a 22-item, yes/no, self-report measure for the disorder.</p>
<p>This project was approved by an institutional review board. Data were collected during October 2010.</p>
<p>Using point-biserial correlations, both the PDQ-4 (<italic>r<sub>pb</sub></italic> = .26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and the SHI (<italic>r<sub>pb</sub></italic> = .30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) demonstrated statistically significant relationships with being bullied, as did the number of years bullied in relationship to the PDQ-4 (<italic>r<sub>pb</sub></italic> [106] = .27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Participants who were positive on both BPS measures also demonstrated statistically significant relationships with being bullied (χ<italic><sup>2</sup></italic> [1, N = 373] = 22.41, <italic>r</italic> = .25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and longevity of such bullying (<italic>r<sub>pb</sub></italic> [106] = .23, <italic>p</italic> = .017). The remaining relationships did not evidence statistically significant findings.</p>
<p>The findings of this study indicate that in this outpatient sample of women, there were statistical associations between being bullied and BPS, according to two different measures for this type of personality pathology. The duration of bullying also demonstrated some statistical relationships with BPS whereas number of bullies was irrelevant.</p>
<p>The potential limitations of this study include the self-report nature of all data, including the assessment of BPS (i.e. a risk of false positives) and the atypical nature of the sample (i.e. low-income single women). However, findings reinforce those of a previous study, but in a very different population. To summarize, one potential outcome of being bullied in childhood may be BPS.</p>
