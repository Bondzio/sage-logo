<p>States across the United States are increasingly enacting harsh and punitive immigration laws to encourage what proponents refer to as self-deportation. This paper examines the ideological forces that are nurturing and legitimizing this movement. It specifically focuses on the notion of the <italic>good citizen</italic> as an ideological construct that inherently makes the undocumented immigrant a threat that must be neutralized for the sake of maintaining law and order. In this way, the good citizen emerges as a natural threat to the undocumented immigrant, as the good citizen is presumably first and foremost obligated to be law-abiding, including upholding laws that aim to push undocumented immigrants to self-deport. This paper looks at how these new immigration laws reify and expand this threat through the notion of good citizenship.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>States across the United States are increasingly enacting harsher and harsher immigration laws. These laws are passing with overwhelming popular support and states are promising aggressive enforcement. South Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Utah, Indiana, Oklahoma, Virginia, Colorado, Missouri, and Mississippi, amongst others, now have immigration laws with provisions that require law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of any suspect they believe may be in the country illegally, criminalize the sheltering, hiring, and transporting of undocumented immigrants, prohibit state or local officials or agencies from restricting enforcement of federal immigration laws, allow for the warrantless arrest of those suspected of being in the country illegally, deny most non-emergency state benefits to illegal immigrants 18 years old and older, require people to prove legal residency when applying for benefits or renewing their eligibility, and bar undocumented immigrants from attending all public universities.</p>
<p>These new immigration laws now sweeping the US have origins in a 2006 report authored by the Center for Immigration Studies, which claims to provide “immigration policymakers, the academic community, news media, and concerned citizens with reliable information about the social, economic, environmental, security, and fiscal consequences of legal and illegal immigration into the United States.” The report, titled <italic>Attrition through enforcement: a cost-effective strategy to shrink the illegal population</italic>, aims to counter the claim that forcibly removing the 11 million plus undocumented immigrants in the US is unworkable and therefore the only reasonable solution is legalizing these persons through an amnesty program. According to this report, such a program is most “likely to result in large numbers of ineligible individuals receiving status, including terrorists, and will spawn new illegal immigration.” This program should therefore be discouraged, which, according to the report, means devising a more effective and efficient way of reducing “the size of the illegal population [which] in turn will reduce the fiscal and social burdens that illegal immigration imposes on communities.” The report claims that the
<disp-quote>
<p>purpose of attrition through enforcement is to increase the probability that illegal aliens will return home without the intervention of immigration enforcement agencies. In other words, it encourages voluntary compliance with immigration laws through more robust interior law enforcement. When combined with a strategy to improve border security, this approach will bring about a significant reduction in the size of the illegal alien population and help deter future illegal immigration.</p>

<p>Core elements of this new attrition strategy that aim to “increase the heat” on undocumented immigrants include:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Eliminating access to jobs through mandatory employer verification of Social Security numbers and immigration status.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Ending misuse of Social Security and Internal Revenue Service identification numbers, which undocumented immigrants use to secure jobs, bank accounts, drivers’ licenses, and other privileges, and improving information-sharing among key federal agencies.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Increasing apprehensions and detention of illegal immigrants through partnerships between federal immigration authorities and state and local law enforcement agencies.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Reducing visa overstays.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Doubling the number of non-criminal, non-expedited removals.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Passing state and local laws to discourage the settlement of undocumented immigrants and to make it more difficult for them to conceal their status. For example, passing state and locals laws that deputize local police to enforce immigration laws beyond the initial arrest authority, enacting anti-scavenger laws (forbidding foraging through trash left on the street for pick-up), passing ordinances that prohibit certain types of check-cashing establishments, and enacting other ordinances that affect rental property licensing, occupancy regulations, permits for use of local parks, and a requirement that restaurants and bars comply with federal hiring regulations and maintain up-to-date health reports on all employees.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>According to the report from the Center for Immigration Studies:
<disp-quote>
<p>We now know that most terrorists have relied on immigration fraud and weak interior enforcement to remain in this country to carry out attacks. Consistent, everyday enforcement of routine immigration law infractions will nab criminals and terrorists, in addition to helping shrink the population of illegal aliens.</p>
<attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2a-1358229113489391">Vaughan, 2006</xref>)</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These new laws and ordinances, besides saving US citizens “the net fiscal drain of about $10 billion” that undocumented immigrants apparently cause, will also apparently save the US from terrorism. Although this tying in of immigration with terrorism has no basis in either fact or reality, what emerges is a rhetorical strategy that binds any opposition to these new laws and ordinances to either being nonchalant about the threat of terrorism or simply being complicit in promoting terrorism. Indeed, after September 11, immigration discourses shifted radically “so that the problem was no longer about being poor, it was about being undocumented, anyone undocumented, unidentified, was now perceived as a potential terrorist” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1358229113489391">Koulish, 2010</xref>: 15). Undocumented immigrants are now cast as elusive perpetrators capable of slipping through the US’s supposedly porous borders and getting past immigration controls and regulations. Framed this way, as Koulish explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>three things become evident: first, immigrants are elusive perpetrators; second, they place the nation at risk; and third, no expense is to be spared repairing the broken system. This prepares the way for punitive preemptive policies, overzealous enforcement and militarization of the border to be depicted as acts of patriotism, rather than inappropriate and illegal policies and practices.</p>
<attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1358229113489391">Koulish, 2010</xref>: 14)</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the foundation of nearly every immigration controversy is a violent ideological tension between the citizen and the undocumented immigrant. Citizens are law-abiding, whereas undocumented immigrants “break our laws.” Citizens are hard-working, whereas undocumented immigrants are “looking for handouts.” Citizens uphold traditions and customs, whereas undocumented immigrants have “no regard for anything.” Citizens are self-reliant, whereas undocumented immigrants are a “drain on our resources.” Immigration battles are fundamentally ideological and moral battles. Citizens are always assumed to be morally superior to immigrants. Immigrants presumably pose a threat to the way of life of US citizens, a way of life that is presumably superior to that which immigrants offer.</p>
<p>Immigrants also supposedly pose a threat to the unity and prosperity of US citizens, by speaking a different language, being of a different religion, adhering to different traditions and customs, or merely being racially different. Immigrants are always located within a moral and ideological context. By supposedly posing a threat to all that is good, immigrants must always deal with varying degrees of suspicion and hostility. Opponents of immigration promote and elevate a certain model of citizenship that is organically hostile to undocumented immigrants. A good citizen is presumably law-abiding, and thereby obligated to uphold even laws that impose all manner of hardship on undocumented immigrants. In this way, the good citizen is released from any moral burden of being personally hostile to immigrants. Instead, by being law-abiding, the good citizen is merely being an exemplary citizen by presumably saving the US from chaos and disunity, and thus preserving the stability and prosperity of the country. It is, after all, US laws that supposedly save US citizens from themselves. As President Theodore Roosevelt once famously said, “No man is above the law and no man is below it; nor do we ask any man’s permission when we require him to obey it. Obedience to the law is demanded as a right; not asked as a favor.” However, by promoting a certain notion of citizenship that emphasizes the upholding of all laws, immigrants must now fear every citizen.</p>

<title>A case study</title>
<p>The effectiveness of this ideological strategy of using the law (or, really, fear of chaos and disunity) to cultivate a certain model of good citizenship can be vividly seen in the debates surrounding Alabama’s immigration law of 2011. Titled Alabama Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act, the bill begins with the assertion that:
<disp-quote>
<p>The State of Alabama finds that illegal immigration is causing economic hardship and lawlessness in this state and that illegal immigration is encouraged when public agencies within this state provide public benefits without verifying immigration status. … [The state also] finds that certain practices currently allowed in this state impede and obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration law, undermine the security of our borders, and impermissibly restrict the privileges and immunities of the citizens of Alabama.</p>

<p>This new Alabama immigration law, which legal scholars view as the most comprehensive and punitive in the history of the US, passed overwhelmingly in both chambers of the Alabama Legislature and with a significant majority of local and national support. Republican State Senator Scott Beason, Chairman of the state Senate’s Rules Committee and a sponsor of the new immigration law, noted that the Alabama Legislature needed to “empty the clip” on the immigration issue, arguing, “We have plenty of needs from our own people. They come first” (Gray, 2011). For many sponsors of the new law, the aim of the law is to trigger a natural exodus of immigrants out of Alabama by making life unbearable for these persons. As always, undocumented immigrants are cast negatively, in this case, as being greedy and unfair. For Alabama Republican Representative Mo Brooks, “Those are the intended consequences [the exodus of immigrants] of Alabama’s legislation with respect to illegal aliens. The bottom line is illegal aliens consume far more of our tax resources than they generate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1358229113489391">Trowbridge and Weinger, 2011</xref>). Continuing, Brooks argues, “We don't have the money in America to keep paying for the education of everybody else’s children from around the world. We simply don’t have the financial resources to do that.” Brooks also claims that undocumented immigrants “commit heinous crimes against American citizens.” According to Brooks, the main purpose of the new immigration law is to remove undocumented immigrants from Alabama, and to that end the legislation is achieving its goal. Thus “these aren’t unintended consequences. We want illegal aliens out of the state of Alabama and I want illegal aliens out of the United States of America” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1358229113489391">Trowbridge and Weinger, 2011</xref>). Republican Representative Micky Hammon, another prominent sponsor of the new bill, posits that immigrants “were coming in here like thieves in the night and taking our jobs and tax revenue.” For Republican State Senator Rusty Glover, who voted for the law and is also a history teacher, “It’s heartbreaking to read about [children being pulled out of school], but it’s going to be an immigration bill or it’s not going to be one.” No sponsor of the immigration bill was obligated to show any evidence to support any of the founding claims of the bill.</p>
<p>Alabama’s new immigration law is also comprehensive from the standpoint of requiring residents to uphold the law or face harsh sanctions. These sanctions appear in the following sections of the bill:
<disp-quote>
<p>A person who is a United States citizen or an alien who is lawfully present in the United States and is a resident of this state may bring an action in circuit court to challenge any official or head of an agency of this state or political subdivision thereof, including, but not limited to, an officer of a court in this state, that adopts or implements a policy or practice that is in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1373 or 8 U.S.C. § 1644. If there is a judicial finding that an official or head of an agency, including, but not limited to, an officer of a court in this state, has violated this section, the court shall order that the officer, official, or head of an agency pay a civil penalty of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) and not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each day that the policy or practice has remained in effect after the filing of an action pursuant to this section. Every person working for the State of Alabama or a political subdivision thereof, including, but not limited to, a law enforcement agency in the State of Alabama or a political subdivision thereof, shall have a duty to report violations of this act. Any person who willfully fails to report any violation of this act when the person knows that this act is being violated shall be guilty of obstructing governmental operations as defined in Section 13A-10-2 of the Code of Alabama 1975. No official or agency of this state or any political subdivision thereof, including, but not limited to, an officer of a court of this state, may adopt a policy or practice that limits or restricts the enforcement of federal immigration laws by limiting communication between its officers and federal immigration officials in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1373 or 8 U.S.C. § 1644, or that restricts its officers in the enforcement of this act. All state officials, agencies, and personnel, including, but not limited to, an officer of a court of this state, shall fully comply with and, to the full extent permitted by law, support the enforcement of federal law prohibiting the entry into, presence, or residence in the United States of aliens in violation of federal immigration law.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>The bill’s preamble reveals that undocumented immigrants have already been judged and charged as being “a drain on our resources.” All that remains is for the “good citizens” of Alabama to uphold the entirety of this new law and Alabama’s supposed immigration problem will finally be solved. Within this model of good citizenship, communication has no moral or foundational ground. It is assumed to have no capacity to deal with the US’s most vexing problems and, ultimately, to bring forth all that is fair, good, and decent. For such things, legislation is presumably necessary, meaning that coercion is necessary. Good citizens presumably value the need for comprehensive and punitive legislation to deal with persons who pose a threat to “our way of life.” Thus, as much as the “good citizens” of Alabama may be troubled by children being removed from schools and parents being afraid to visit clinics and hospitals, good citizens will still uphold the law as achieving a good society presumably requires citizens who are law-abiding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1358229113489391">
<title>The Fugitive Slave Act</title>
<p>This notion of good citizenship is by no means new to Alabama. It was previously used against African Americans, who were also once perceived by most residents of Alabama as morally deficient and a threat to all that was good and decent in Alabama. It was the “good citizens” of Alabama who unleashed dogs on African Americans so as to uphold law and order. It was the “good citizens” of Alabama who fired water hoses on African Americans so as to uphold law and order. It was the “good citizens” of Alabama who fought federal efforts to implement school integration so as to maintain law and order. It was also the “good citizens” of Alabama who were members of the Klu Klux Klan and the notorious White Citizen Councils. Yet the ideological legacy of the good citizen model goes much further back. The “good citizens” of Alabama diligently upheld all the laws that institutionalized slavery and Jim Crow for over 350 years.</p>
<p>There are also sections of the Alabama immigration law of 2011 that are nearly fully interchangeable with sections in the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. The latter criminalizes any person
<disp-quote>
<p>who shall knowingly and willingly obstruct, hinder, or prevent such claimant, his agent or attorney, or any person or persons lawfully assisting him, her, or them, from arresting such a fugitive from service or labor, either with or without process as aforesaid, or shall rescue, or attempt to rescue, such fugitive from service or labor, from the custody of such claimant, his or her agent or attorney, or other person or persons lawfully assisting as aforesaid, when so arrested, pursuant to the authority herein given and declared; or shall aid, abet, or assist such person so owing service or labor as aforesaid, directly or indirectly, to escape from such claimant, his agent or attorney, or other person or persons legally authorized as aforesaid; or shall harbor or conceal such fugitive, so as to prevent the discovery and arrest of such person, after notice or knowledge of the fact that such person was a fugitive from service or labor as aforesaid, shall, for either of said offences, be subject to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, and imprisonment not exceeding six months, by indictment and conviction before the District Court of the United States for the district in which such offence may have been committed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, section 13 of the new Alabama immigration law criminalizes persons who
<disp-quote>
<p>(1) Conceal, harbor, or shield or attempt to conceal, harbor, or shield or conspire to conceal, harbor, or shield an alien from detection in any place in this state, including any building or any means of transportation, if the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that the alien has come to, has entered, or remains in the United States in violation of federal law. (2) Encourage or induce an alien to come to or reside in this state if the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that such coming to, entering, or residing in the United States is or will be in violation of federal law. (3) Transport, or attempt to transport, or conspire to transport in this state an alien in furtherance of the unlawful presence of the alien in the United States, knowingly, or in reckless disregard of the fact, that the alien has come to, entered, or remained in the United States in violation of federal law. Conspiracy to be so transported shall be a violation of this subdivision. (4) Harbor an alien unlawfully present in the United States by entering into a rental agreement with an alien to provide accommodations, if the person knows or recklessly disregards the fact that the alien is unlawfully present in the United States.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is merely one comparison.</p>
<p>The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 also mandates that:
<disp-quote>
<p>it shall be the duty of all marshals and deputy marshals to obey and execute all warrants and precepts issued under the provisions of this act, when to them directed; and should any marshal or deputy marshal refuse to receive such warrant, or other process, when tendered, or to use all proper means diligently to execute the same, he shall, on conviction thereof, be fined in the sum of one thousand dollars, to the use of such claimant, on the motion of such claimant, by the Circuit or District Court for the district of such marshal; and after arrest of such fugitive, by such marshal or his deputy, or whilst at any time in his custody under the provisions of this act, should such fugitive escape, whether with or without the assent of such marshal or his deputy, such marshal shall be liable, on his official bond, to be prosecuted for the benefit of such claimant, for the full value of the service or labor of said fugitive in the State, Territory, or District whence he escaped: and the better to enable the said commissioners, when thus appointed, to execute their duties faithfully and efficiently, in conformity with the requirements of the Constitution of the United States and of this act, they are hereby authorized and empowered, within their counties respectively, to appoint, in writing under their hands, any one or more suitable persons, from time to time, to execute all such warrants and other process as may be issued by them in the lawful performance of their respective duties; with authority to such commissioners, or the persons to be appointed by them, to execute process as aforesaid, to summon and call to their aid the bystanders, or posse comitatus of the proper county, when necessary to ensure a faithful observance of the clause of the Constitution referred to, in conformity with the provisions of this act; and all good citizens are hereby commanded to aid and assist in the prompt and efficient execution of this law, whenever their services may be required, as aforesaid, for that purpose; and said warrants shall run, and be executed by said officers, anywhere in the State within which they are issued.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, the Alabama immigration law of 2011 mandates that
<disp-quote>
<p>No official or agency of this state or any political subdivision thereof, including, but not limited to, an officer of a court of this state, may adopt a policy or practice that limits or restricts the enforcement of federal immigration laws by limiting communication between its officers and federal immigration officials. or that restricts its officers in the enforcement of this act. If, in the judgment of the Attorney General of Alabama, an official or agency of this state or any political subdivision thereof, including, but not limited to, an officer of a court in this state, is in violation of this subsection. […] All state officials, agencies, and personnel, including, but not limited to, an officer of a court of this state, shall fully comply with and, to the full extent permitted by law, support the enforcement of federal law prohibiting the entry into, presence, or residence in the United States of aliens in violation of federal immigration law.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, probably most revealing is the fact that both laws strip either slaves or undocumented immigrants of equal legal protection. In the Fugitive Slave law, no slave can bear witness against a citizen in any court proceeding: “In no trial or hearing under this act shall the testimony of such alleged fugitive be admitted in evidence.” Therefore, a fugitive slave who is raped by a citizen cannot go to court and bear witness against the perpetrator. In the Alabama immigration law, citizens have no obligation to uphold any employment contract with an illegal immigrant, and thus “shall not be liable for any claims made against the business entity or employer by the terminated employee [undocumented immigrant].” With both laws, slaves and undocumented immigrants have no comparable moral worth to that of citizens and are thereby not entitled to equal legal protection. What then does being law-abiding mean when neither law offers any kind of equal protection to slaves and undocumented immigrants? If good citizens are law-abiding, what are slaves and undocumented immigrants to do? Put differently, what is the moral worth of any law that purposely seeks to deny equal rights and protections to all peoples? How could such laws be assumed to be morally just and, as in the case of the new immigration laws, believed by many judges to be in harmony with the U.S. Constitution? On the other hand, what is the moral worth of any person who would uphold a law that would purposely deny equal rights and protection to all? This is the challenge that the Fugitive Slave Act poses to the new set of immigration laws now sweeping the US. Who would now claim that people were being morally just by upholding a law that was morally unjust by denying equal protection to all human beings? If slaves and abolitionists were morally just in violating the Fugitive Slave Act, then undocumented immigrants are also being morally just by disobeying any immigration law that deprives them of equal rights and protection.</p>
<p>The U.S. Constitution begins on the premise that all human beings are born with certain inalienable rights. These rights have nothing to do with race, ethnicity, gender, or resident status. These are rights that simply come with being human, thus the phrase inalienable rights. The U.S. Constitution mandates that no law deprives persons of these rights. According to the Fourteenth Amendment:
<disp-quote>
<p>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The amendment makes an important distinction between citizens and persons by deliberately moving from language of citizen to language of person when invoking the inalienable right to life, liberty, and property. As regards the Constitution, person trumps citizen. Whereas no state can make or enforce any law that abridges “the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States,” no state can “deprive any person [again, “any person”] of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person [again, “any person”] within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”</p>
<p>Thus the right of equal protection to “any person” rather than merely “citizens of the United States” is paramount. It is the cornerstone of US democracy and continues to be responsible for the moral evolution of US social, legal, political, and educational systems. The equal protection clause means that laws must be moral, and laws are inherently so by offering equal protection to all, regardless of legal status. It forms the foundation of notions of decency and fairness for US citizens. Indeed, the equal protection clause best reflects the morality of US citizens, that is the belief that all human beings, in being born with certain inalienable rights, are deserving of various protections, and the US’s commitment to guarantee those protections. This is supposedly what the US legal system is fundamentally about—guaranteeing equal protection to all, regardless of race, ethnicity, or immigration status—and why the abolitionist movement, the civil rights movement, and the women’s movement all challenged the courts to do what was morally just by upholding the principle of all persons possessing certain inalienable rights. What should therefore be made of the fact that every new immigration law egregiously violates the equal protection clause, by denying various persons, besides the right to have others honor contracts, the right to shelter, water, and any means to sustain themselves? What should also be made of the fact that upholding these morally unjust laws makes US citizens morally unjust? That is, what should be made of the fact that these laws aim to stop US citizens from doing what is morally just, such as refusing to uphold laws that deny equal protection to all, regardless of immigration status? Against the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, the new immigration laws show almost no moral progress. We are yet to fully understand what being born with certain inalienable rights (such as the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness) really means. For what is the possibility of life when a law—such as the Alabama immigration law—criminalizes a person for “knowingly” applying for work so as to afford food and shelter? Citizens are morally—rather than merely legally—obligated to treat all human beings—rather than merely fellow citizens—with the dignity and respect all citizens would demand of each other. It is, again, this obligation that led to the abolitionist movement, the civil rights movement, the women’s movement, the gay rights movement, and the disability movement. All these movements faced enormous struggles and involved tremendous sacrifices, but what would the US be now without these movements and the courage of so many to refuse to obey laws that were morally unjust by depriving all persons of equal protections?</p>
<p>Evidently, the notion of the “good citizen”—as in the Fugitive Slave Act encouraging “all good citizens to aid and assist in the prompt and efficient execution of this law”—has deep ideological roots and has long been used as a rhetorical and communicational apparatus to control and oppress other human beings. The fact that Alabama now has one of the most comprehensive and punitive immigration laws of all 50 states is no anomaly. This reality speaks to the fact that ideological apparatuses can be enduring—from slave codes to immigration laws—and extremely difficult to disrupt, much less end.</p>

<title>On the origins of just and unjust laws</title>
<p>To look at history anew is to find that our differences have nothing to do with the Holocaust or any of the abominations that stain us. Our differences merely function as context and pretext to mask our unwillingness to do other things, such as our unwillingness to do what every prophet asks us to do—to love, to share, to forgive. Thus, what should be made of the fact that the good citizen model that Alabama promotes makes no such demands on citizens with regards to enlarging their humanity? Yet most of the “good citizens” of Alabama, as polls show again and again, profess to be staunch disciples of Jesus Christ, who explicitly called for loving your neighbor and caring for the most vulnerable amongst us. In fact, during the times of slavery and the Jim Crow laws, the “good citizens” of Alabama were professing to be fervent disciples of Jesus Christ. By any interpretation there is nothing in the new immigration law that squares with anything found in the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The Center for American Progress recently listed a set of public health consequences that are most likely to result from the new immigration provisions that require proof of lawful status for any transaction with any state or political subdivision, law enforcement, public utility or government agency, and schools:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Children will be deprived of required immunizations for infectious diseases as a result of people being afraid to visit clinics and hospitals to get to these vaccinations.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Communicable diseases will spread because of people being afraid to visit clinics and hospitals when sick.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Mothers being deprived of adequate prenatal care because of being afraid to visit clinics and hospitals.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Babies born prematurely as a result of a lack of prenatal care will require more medical services.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>U.S. born children and those in lawful status would be deprived adequate health care because their parents being afraid to visit clinics and hospitals.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Water will be less safe because of people being unable to get permits to repair or install safe septic tanks.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Restaurants will be unable to get health permits because the Alabama Department of Public Health now requires proof of citizenship for health permits for restaurants.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Food supplies will be less safe as residents will be unable to obtain septic permits.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Public health costs will increase as the overall cost of medical care for all residents of Alabama will rise to deal with increased risk to various diseases.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The rise of public health costs to deal with increased risks will undermine the integrity of the entire health care system in Alabama.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The model of good citizenship that the new Alabama immigration law promotes is fundamentally different from that found in the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. In fact, again and again Jesus Christ was accused of having no regards for the laws of the state. Destroying the property of the money-changers is a case in point. Preventing a woman accused of adultery from being stoned to death is another. Thus what should be made of the popularity of Alabama’s new immigration law and Jesus Christ’s command to protect and care for “the least of these” and to forgive those who trespass against us? What also should be made of the fact that the civil rights movement, the abolitionist movement, the women’s movement, and the gay rights movement, which all brought moral progress to the US, were all dependent on persons who purposely refused to be law-abiding? That is, what should be made of the citizenship of John Brown, Martin Luther King Jr, Harriett Tubman, and so many others?</p>
<p>A case in point would be King’s “Letter from Birmingham [Alabama] Jail.” King was being chastised for taking an unpopular position—demanding that the US’s apartheid system be immediately dismantled. The popular view, as seen by the position of the Christian theologians who opposed King, was for African Americans to be patient and remain law-abiding. For these theologians, King was the one causing mischief and inviting chaos by encouraging African Americans to disobey various segregation laws. Indeed, what is striking about the Birmingham case is that King was going up against theologians, those who were supposed to know well that the cause of love, mercy, and compassion can involve neither patience nor tolerance. There was nothing that King was doing that was contrary to the teachings of Jesus Christ. He was merely siding unequivocally and unconditionally with whom Jesus Christ refers to as the least of these.</p>
<p>King was doing what Jesus Christ said Christians must do, exercise moral courage—stand courageously, unequivocally, and non-violently for the betterment of all peoples, which includes refusing to obey unjust laws. In fact, according to King:
<disp-quote>
<p>there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience. It was evidenced sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar, on the ground that a higher moral law was at stake. It was practiced superbly by the early Christians, who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating pain of chopping blocks rather than submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, the new immigration law in Alabama contains provisions that would demand the incarceration of King for doing the same thing. By King’s own reasoning, as found explicitly in the “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” this law is unjust by encouraging the persecution and incarceration of the least of these. According to King,
<disp-quote>
<p>One may well ask: “How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?” The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that “an unjust law is no law at all.” The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.” Now, what is the difference between the two? How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an “I it” relationship for an “I thou” relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things. Hence segregation is not only politically, economically and sociologically unsound, it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not segregation an existential expression of man’s tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? Thus it is that I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court, for it is morally right; and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances, for they are morally wrong.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>King’s model of good citizenship is about upholding only just laws and working against those that are unjust. He is by no means encouraging anarchy. For King:
<disp-quote>
<p>One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With the Alabama immigration law, human beings are assumed to have no capacity to act reflectively and mindfully, and doing so is necessary for our moral development. It assumes a fundamentally different conception of what being human means from what is found in the model of citizenship the Alabama immigration law promotes. With the latter, human beings have no such capacity, thus the many provisions in the law prohibiting persons from doing anything that could impede the full implementation of the law. Morality must be imposed upon us. We must be legislatively coerced into doing what is just and decent. This, of course, is exactly what the new immigration law is seeking to do. It is coercively imposing a morality on all the residents of Alabama. To resist or refuse to comply with the law is to face sanction and even the threat of incarceration. The goal of this model of citizenship is to coercively impose a certain morality evenly and comprehensively. In other words, the goal is to attain perfect conformity and homogeneity. This, again, is why Alabama’s legislators boast of producing the most comprehensive immigration law in the history of the US, meaning that this law covers every contingency. All residents must comply or face serious sanctions. There is no possibility of deviation. Residents must do as the law requires or face sanctions. In this model of citizenship, conformity and homogeneity are good and necessary. Lack of uniformity will supposedly bring chaos, such as creating loopholes that will allow immigrants to stay in Alabama and continue “to be a drain on our resources.”</p>
<p>The model of good citizenship that the new immigration law promotes is devoid of any conceptual means to encourage, much less legitimize, the likes of King, Tubman, and Brown. It releases us of all the struggles and challenges that come with a world laden with complexity, ambiguity, and diversity. Existentially, epistemologically, and communicationally, such a world requires much from us as most things lend for a variety of meanings, interpretations, and understandings. Confusion pervades most things. Doubt is a constant companion. Accordingly, in a world laden with complexity, ambiguity, and diversity, humility is necessary. We must struggle to remain open to the possibility that even our most prized truths could be wrong. We must also struggle to remain open to the truths of others. We even have to become comfortable with the possibility of there being no final truth—that is, no truth that could possibly conquer the world’s ambiguity. Possibility is always upon us. There is no doubt that a world of ambiguity, complexity, and diversity is existentially, epistemologically, and communicationally hard on us. The struggles and challenges are many. However, engaging and embracing these struggles and challenges saves us from ourselves, for example by discouraging us from enacting harsh and punitive immigration legislation that only promises to bring misery on others, and from persecuting and incarcerating those who capture the best in us by steadfastly refusing to obey laws and customs that bring hardship on the most vulnerable amongst us (“the least of these”).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Intercultural communication theory allows us to avoid our hypocrisy as well as our own complicity in impeding the kind of ethics that King advocates. Our problems presumably reside in our differences, specifically in others’ differences. This is presumably why the world is in peril. We are faultless. The fault presumably resides with the differences of others. If only those differences could be managed and bridged, all would, supposedly, be well with the world. This is the ethos that pervades popular models of intercultural communication theory. This is also why intercultural communication theory remains obsessed with taming and neutralizing our differences. By fixing this problem of our differences, intercultural communication promises to save us from strife and peril.</p>
<p>However, as our differences pose no such threat, what exactly are popular models of intercultural communication seeking to accomplish? In fact, what exactly can such models of intercultural communication really accomplish by focusing on something that has nothing to do with anything? The reality is that mainstream intercultural communication theory is nothing but a distraction. However, as the world is now fraught with so much peril, this is a distraction that nobody can really afford. We need a new intercultural communication theory that invites us to look at communication as the womb of possibility. Without communication, nothing happens, meaning that nothing can live, change, and evolve outside of communication. We become human only through communication. We create and shape our social worlds through communication. We also perceive and experience the sacred through communication. Through communication the sacred dwells. Thus, in a world that diminishes communication, there would be no recognition and appreciation of the sacred. Everything will be reduced to the workings of natural and biological processes. We would be nothing but, to use Richard Dawkins’s language, survival machines. Information would be status quo, and networks, rather than relationships, would rule the world.</p>
<p>A world devoid of the sacred means that there is no onus on us to treat anything or anyone with care, love, and reverence. This makes inevitably for a world laden with abuse and violence. We would have no qualms about emptying “the clip” on the most vulnerable amongst us. When nothing is sacred, punitive immigration laws are passed overwhelming and enjoy popular support. Ultimately, the consequences are never good. This is also what happens when communicated is eroded. Communication brings the sacred into being by pulling us towards each other. Communication is a social, spiritual, and ecological practice. Without the generous support and involvement of others, communication degrades and devolves, and as this happens communication loses the ability to nurture possibility. Communication requires a sharing of ourselves, and a giving of ourselves. Without such generosity, communication perishes. Moreover, without vulnerability, communication devolves. We attend to the needs of each other through communication, and only through communication. We nurture each other through communication, and only through communication. We attend to the needs and concerns of life through communication, and only through communication. As life dwells and flourishes in communication, to attend to communication is to attend to life.</p>
<p>When we enlarge what we are capable of meaning and understanding, we also enlarge what life is capable of being and becoming. This is how communication promotes possibility, such as the possibility of different peoples, even when resources are limited, achieving harmony. The generosity that communication requires of us enlarges our humanity, making us vulnerable to new realms of possibility. This is the case for communication. It promotes life by bringing possibility into the world. This is also why attending to communication is a sacred matter. As communication goes, so goes the world. Our destiny is bound up with what becomes of communication, which really means that our fates—regardless of our differences and our different places of origins—are intertwined.</p>
