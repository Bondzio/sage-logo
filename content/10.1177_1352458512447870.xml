<title>Background:</title>
<p>Magnetic resonance (MR) phase imaging using high field MR scanners has demonstrated excellent contrast in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions that is thought to be closely correlated to the local iron content.

<title>Methods:</title>

<title>Results:</title>
<p>Five non-enhancing ring and 70 nodular phase lesions were found in the five patients at baseline.

<p>The observation that ring phase lesions remained unchanged over 2.5 years of follow-up challenges the notion that such lesions reveal the presence of acute activated iron-rich macrophages.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and demyelinating neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that MS lesions show high contrast in phase and susceptibility-weighted images (SWI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512447870">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512447870"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512447870">8</xref></sup> However, the source of this contrast remains unclear. Accumulating evidence has suggested that the underlying contrast mechanism for MS lesions seen on phase images is at least in part due to abnormal iron deposition, content, or presence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512447870">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512447870">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512447870"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512447870">11</xref></sup> The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of serial phase imaging for MS and to have a better understanding of the time course of phase contrast and its implication for iron accumulation in MS lesions.</p>
<p>MRI is sensitive to iron accumulation in MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512447870">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512447870">13</xref></sup> and is associated with hypointensity on conventional T2 or T2*-weighted MR images,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512447870">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512447870">15</xref></sup> which can be used to make quantitative measurements of iron concentration by mapping relaxation time, R2 or R2*.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512447870">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512447870">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512447870">16</xref></sup> However, these methods may be confounded by changes in water diffusion and relaxation times,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512447870">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512447870">13</xref></sup> which can lead to inaccurate measurement of iron, especially for MS white matter plaques, in which iron deposition and free water components in edema, inflammation, and gliosis are usually co-localized. Recently, with the combination of T2*-weighted gradient echo (GRE) sequence and advanced image post-processing methods, MR phase and SWI images that are sensitive to paramagnetic susceptibility effects of iron have been applied for MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512447870">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512447870"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512447870">8</xref></sup> Phase accumulation as a result of local perturbation of the main magnetic field due to iron deposition can be revealed on high-pass-filtered phase images, or further processed and combined with magnitude images to create SWI images.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512447870">3</xref></sup> Since susceptibility effects are independent of water relaxation and scale with field strength, phase images of MS subjects at high field provide contrast specific to field perturbations and show excellent contrast of local iron in white matter plaques. Furthermore, phase images have demonstrated potential clinical utility in identifying a subset of MS lesions that are not detected on magnitude images.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512447870">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512447870"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512447870">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Imaging iron in MS is of interest because abnormal elevation of iron concentrations has been proposed to have a pathogenic role in MS by promoting oxidative damage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512447870">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512447870">17</xref></sup> although it is more likely to represent an epiphenomenon rather than a causal event. The increased iron in MS may come from several different sources, including damaged oligodendrocytes and myelin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512447870">17</xref></sup> blood brain barrier (BBB) compromise,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458512447870">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512447870">19</xref></sup> macrophage infiltration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512447870">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458512447870"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512447870">19</xref></sup> and astrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458512447870">20</xref></sup> Oligodendrocytes and myelin have high concentrations of iron in order to catalyze their high-level lipid production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512447870">17</xref></sup> This iron can be released in the extracellular compartment when these cells, the primary targets of MS, are destroyed. Impairment of the BBB may increase iron concentration by allowing blood iron to leak into perivascular regions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458512447870">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512447870">19</xref></sup> Iron from these sources can be sequestered in macrophages and microglia, making them iron-rich as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458512447870">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458512447870"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458512447870">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because the cellular activity of MS lesions changes over time, the presence and spatial distribution of iron in MS lesions is expected to vary as lesions form and evolve and this variability should be detectable by serial clinical MR phase imaging. The purpose of this pilot study was to test this hypothesis by following the evolution of MS lesions in serial images acquired at a field strength of 7T. Such high field strength permitted acquiring high-resolution images with heightened phase contrast in clinically acceptable scan times.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Five clinically stable (no clinical attacks documented during the observation period) relapsing–remitting MS subjects were serially scanned at 3T and 7T. The demographics were three females, two males, mean age of 51 years, mean disease duration of 17 years, mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 3.1. All subjects were on the same injectable FDA-approved therapy for the duration of the study and all gave their written inform consent to participate in the longitudinal study approved by the UCSF Committee of Human Research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1352458512447870">
<title>Image acquisition</title>
<p>The subjects were serially scanned using a whole-body GE 7T scanner (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) equipped with an eight-channel receive phased array coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA). Axial oblique 2D T2*-weighted GRE images were acquired at a spatial resolution of 195 µm × 260 μm or 350 µm × 350 μm with TE/TR of 12 to 15/250 ms, flip angle of 20°, slice thickness of 2mm, matrix/field of view 1024 cm ×768/20 cm or 512 cm × 512/18 cm, 3 NEX (number of excitations), and scan time of approximately 9 or 6.5 min. Nine consecutive slices were prescribed parallel to the inferior callosal line from a mid-sagittal scout image to assure coverage of the corpus callosum, the location where MS lesions are frequently seen. If more coverage was needed, another nine slices superior to the previous block were also acquired using the same sequence. Immediately after the 7T scan, the subjects also received a post contrast gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced clinical scan with a GE 3T scanner to determine whether any contrast-enhancing lesions were present. The mean follow-up time for the five subjects was 21.8 months (ranging from 16 to 31 months) with an average of 3.2 scans/subject (16 scans total). The interval between scans varied from one month to 31 months.</p>

<sec id="section9-1352458512447870">
<title>Image processing</title>
<p>The magnitude and phase images were reconstructed using the method previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512447870">2</xref></sup> In brief, the magnitude signal from each channel in the complex image volume was combined using a root-sum-of squares algorithm to obtain a magnitude image; individual phase images from each channel were then unwrapped on a slice by slice basis using the PRELUDE algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458512447870">21</xref></sup> to generate a full range of phase images; each unwrapped image was high-pass filtered by complex division of the unwrapped image by a low-pass filtered unwrapped image; the filtered phase images from each coil were finally combined by weighting by the magnitude image and summing across channels. The follow-up magnitude images were first co-registered (3D rigid body registration) to magnitude images from the baseline using software based on the VTK CISG registration toolkit,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458512447870">22</xref></sup> and the transformation matrix obtained from magnitude image co-registration was then applied to the corresponding phase image at each time point.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 75 phase lesions were found in the five subjects at baseline. None of the lesions showed gadolinium-enhancement (Gd-). As the source of iron in an MS lesion may differ based on the appearance or morphology of the phase contrast, lesions were divided into two categories according to their phase contrast patterns: (1) nodular and uniform hypointense lesions (<italic>n</italic>=70) and (2) ring lesions with a hypointense rim at the edge of a lesion (<italic>n</italic>=5). Fifty-nine of the 70 nodular lesions were observed both on magnitude and phase images, while the remaining 11 were visualized only on phase images. The ring of all five ring phase lesions (from four different patients) was either not detected on magnitude images or better contrasted on the phase images.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458512447870">Figure 1</xref> shows the five ring phase lesions followed from baseline to month 1, month 4 and month 16 (lesions 1–3), month 28 (lesion 4), and month 31 (lesion 5). None of the phase ring lesions disappeared over time, even when followed for up to 31 months. Similarly, none of the nodular phase lesions disappeared over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512447870">Figure 2</xref>). As can be seen, once detected, all of the lesions maintained the same contrast, size, and morphological appearance over time on both phase and magnitude images.</p>

Note that none of the lesions underwent obvious change in terms of image intensity and morphology.</p>

<p>Lastly, we made the following observation during follow-ups. Three magnitude lesions (lesions 6–8 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458512447870">Figure 3</xref>), not prospectively identified as abnormal signals initially, were either better appreciated using phase contrast imaging (lesions 6 and 8) or preceded (lesion 7) by phase changes. Lesion 6 showed minimal magnitude contrast at baseline, which was not obvious and read as abnormal until month 4, whereas it had already shown substantial and stable phase contrast since baseline. Lesion 7 (from a different patient) developed an abnormal magnitude contrast signal at month 16 but had showed apparent phase contrast on all scans since baseline. Lesion 8 (from the same patient as lesion 7) appeared at month 16, but the abnormality was more clearly seen on the phase rather than magnitude images (again the corresponding magnitude abnormality was subtle). Of note, all three lesions were Gd- on the corresponding 3T post-gadolinium images (data not shown here).</p>

At the same time, the signal abnormality on the magnitude image was so subtle that it was only slightly observable on retrospective review.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This pilot study followed several white matter lesions from patients with clinically stable relapsing–remitting MS for up to 2.5 years using a T2*-weighted GRE imaging sequence at the high field strength of 7T and using conventional contrast-enhancing scans acquired at 3T. Two major observations were made. Firstly, phase lesions did not disappear over time and, secondly, phase lesions preceded the appearance of hyperintense lesions on magnitude images.</p>
<p>Two distinct types of MS lesion appearance were observed in the phase images: (1) ring lesions showing a dark rim at the lesion edge; and (2) nodular lesions showing roughly uniform hypointensity. These have both been reported in several previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512447870">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512447870"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512447870"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512447870">8</xref></sup> None of the lesions observed in the MRI phase images at baseline showed obvious changes in radiological features such as intensity, size, and morphology through the course of the follow-up, suggesting that all baseline phase lesions were chronic lesions. This is further supported by the findings that lesions never showed enhancement on post-contrast T1-weighted images, which is generally a hallmark of active lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458512447870">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ring phase lesions were associated with central penetrating veins, surrounded by a classic abnormal ovoid signal on the corresponding magnitude image. Although this pattern could be consistent with the presence of infiltrating iron-rich activated macrophages surrounding a demyelinating area, as reported in previous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512447870">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512447870">8</xref></sup> the persistence of the signal on serial images (over 2.5 years in some cases) speaks against the acute active stage of the macrophages, because only few activated macrophages can be found in chronic lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458512447870">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458512447870">24</xref></sup> However, since the phenotype of macrophages may undergo changes with chronicity, as shown in histopathological studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458512447870">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458512447870">26</xref></sup> activated pro-inflammatory macrophages that contain myelin debris (and hence iron) may later become anti-inflammatory, promote tissue repair, and stay for an extended period of time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458512447870">27</xref></sup> It is unclear why the macrophages could stay there for such a long time, but similar observations have been found in MR studies of intracerebral hemorrhage, where perivascular collections of iron in hemosiderin within macrophages may be visible indefinitely on MRI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458512447870">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Phase contrast in chronic nodular lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458512447870">Figure 2</xref>) may be from astrogliosis, the scar-like tissue that usually appears within a few months of the appearance of a fresh lesion and is a pathological hallmark of chronic lesions. Astrocytes have been reported to accumulate iron in the absence of oligodendrocytes and myelin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458512447870">29</xref></sup> A possible mechanism for astrocytes to become iron-rich under neurological affliction could be the overexpression of heme oxynenase-1, an enzyme that promotes mitochondria iron sequestration in oxidative stressed astrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458512447870">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458512447870">30</xref></sup> The sustained presence of nodular lesions may be explained by the prolonged survival of iron-laden astrocytes due to their robust ability to antioxidant defenses, cytoprotection, and anaerobic metabolism compared with other neural cell types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458512447870">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study also demonstrated that longitudinal changes in lesion contrast could, in some cases, be better appreciated on phase compared with magnitude images. In one case (lesion 7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458512447870">Figure 3</xref>), the presence of a phase lesion even preceded the appearance of an hyperintense signal on the corresponding magnitude images. Although larger controlled experiments are needed to validate this observation, the importance of this finding and its potential impact on our understanding of the pathological course of MS were worth reporting in this pilot study. As previously described, abnormal signal changes from magnetization transfer imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458512447870">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458512447870">32</xref></sup> and diffusion-weighted imaging studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458512447870">33</xref></sup> preceded MS lesions detected by conventional MR images. Such phase contrast changes could also reflect an early process of myelin breakdown or abrupt loss of white matter tissue integrity as pointed in an experimental study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512447870">11</xref></sup> Alternatively, the discrepancy between phase and magnitude images may also be explained by opposing contrast mechanisms on magnitude and phase images due to different pathological processes. The T2* prolongation induced by inflammation and edema may be offset by the T2* shortening due to iron deposition, leading to poor visibility of hyperintense lesions on T2* magnitude images.</p>
<p>There are several limitations in this pilot study. All patients investigated had a diagnosis of stable relapsing–remitting MS. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the role of phase imaging in studying the evolution of MS, future studies would need to include patients with different types of MS (e.g. early RRMS, secondary and primary progressive MS) and include contrast-enhancing lesions. Such studies should also address the sensitivity of phase over conventional post-contrast T1-weighted imaging. The qualitative findings of these pilot results call for a larger sample size study with rigorous standardized frequent imaging protocol, including the use of quantitative susceptibility mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1352458512447870">34</xref></sup> to generate intrinsic magnetic susceptibility map from phase images. Such quantitative mapping may offer a more robust tool to quantify the susceptibility contrast from MS lesions, especially in longitudinal monitoring of lesion progression. Lastly, one cannot emphasize enough the need for additional histopathological-MRI studies specifically investigating the source of iron content in different central nervous system regions, such as chronic lesions, active lesions, and normal appearing white and gray matter MS tissue.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Phase lesions from five relapsing–remitting patients were serially followed using a 7T high field MR scanner. All five ring phase lesions observed at baseline remained unchanged for up to 31 months, challenging the notion that such lesions reveal the presence of acute active iron-rich macrophages. It suggests that either different phenotypes of iron-rich macrophages persist longer than previously expected or other mechanisms of tissue injury contribute to the contrast. Also the appearance of some lesions may be better appreciated on phase rather than on magnitude images, suggesting that phase imaging could potentially be used to further study early indicators of emerging lesions.</p>
