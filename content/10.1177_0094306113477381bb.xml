<p>Quick, what’s your favorite genre of music? Blues? Rap? Do you prefer Milwaukee polka or are you an aficionado of the South Texas variety? Those aren’t genres, by they way, they’re <italic>styles</italic>. Which should never be confused with a genre <italic>form</italic>. If you’re feeling bewildered, no need to worry—Jennifer Lena will explain. In <italic>Banding Together: How Communities Create Genres in Popular Music</italic>, Lena offers a spirited romp through twentieth-century American music that provides fresh insight into the development of music.</p>
<p>Innovations in music are often attributed to lone geniuses or fits of artistic inspiration. The problem with this thinking, Lena asserts, is that it ignores the larger social processes at play. To correct for this, the author delves into the histories of sixty styles of twentieth-century American music, relying on more than 300 primary and secondary texts. Sources include everything from academic treatments by Richard Peterson and David Grazian to journalistic accounts of disco. The result is a music lover’s smorgasbord that serves up a novel way to consider the life course of musical styles.</p>
<p>It turns out that if one reads every historical account ever written about twentieth-century American music, as the author appears to have done, there are more similarities than differences. Per Lena, these patterns form the basis of four distinct genre forms: Avant-garde, Scene-based, Industry-based, and Traditionalist. Music of every stripe, be it bluegrass or black metal, can be placed into one of these genre forms. But not necessarily for long.</p>
<p>There is a trajectory here, a sort of stylistic path of development. In the most common sequence, a musical style is spawned as a small, avant-garde scene, nurtured by a few pioneers. It gains in popularity and progresses to the next phase, where it blossoms into a full-blown scene, replete with beloved local bands raved about in the free alterative newsweekly. Smelling blood, corporate sharks swim in, wielding their marketing acumen, piles of cash, and major-label contracts in order to take the style national. In time, finicky mainstream audiences get bored and move on, leaving only traditionalists, who dress like college professors, canonize certain compositions, and pontificate about how much <italic>better</italic> it all used to be.</p>
<p>Not all styles of music, however, pass through the trajectory in this manner or at the same pace. Some styles get stuck or collapse. (New jack swing, we hardly knew ye.) Others, such as tango and conscious rap, skip the avant-garde phase and begin as music scenes. Soul and outlaw country originated as industry-driven entities before progressing elsewhere. Three mechanisms account for the atypical development or stalling out of a music style: racism, absorption of artists and fans into other styles, and various kinds of resistance to commercialization. Lena’s concept of genre trajectories, including the tipping points that push musical styles from, say, avant-garde to scene-based genre forms, makes a genuine contribution to scholarly studies of music.</p>
<p>The drawback to grand models like this, which incorporate such extensive histories and so many varieties of music, is their tendency towards squishiness. Lena’s is not a hard theory that applies to every imaginable flavor of music, but a more general model. In applying it, the author eliminates several well-known categories of music that a lot of folks might believe warrant inclusion: Top-40 pop, Tin Pan Alley ditties, and even Broadway show tunes get the axe. (Don’t tell my Aunt Judy about that last one, because the only thing Aunt Judy loves more than her favorite nephew is a good Broadway show tune.) Is it true that these are not styles of music, or is it that they do not easily fit Lena’s model?</p>
<p>Also downplayed is the centrality of music itself in genre-form advancement. Songs such as “Rapper’s Delight” and “Smells Like Teen Spirit” functioned as sonic catalysts that instantly enabled, respectively, rap and grunge to reach huge new audiences. Remove these tunes from the equation and genre trajectories become less predictable. Despite objections to “great man” theories of musical development, Lena sometimes applies similar logic to prime movers such as funk pioneer James Brown. Had Brown not gained the right to oversee his recording sessions sans record-company interference, she asserts, “funk’s history would have been significantly different” (p. 80).</p>
<p>Fortunately, Lena does not forget about the music altogether. Part of what makes <italic>Banding Together</italic> so enjoyable is her frequent peppering of theory with choice anecdotes, culled from every imaginable mode of music. There is something for everyone here, whether your listening preferences lean toward grindcore or Contemporary Christian—even the most learned music geek will discover something new.</p>
<p>To that end, when Lena ventures outside the United States in Chapter Four, <italic>Banding Together</italic> is at its most intriguing. (An enterprising scholar could easily get a book out of this chapter alone.) Lena explores four countries—China, Chile, Nigeria, and Serbia—and discovers what she terms the government-purposed genre of music. Here, styles of music are shaped by the politicocultural agendas of governments and/or antistate oppositional groups. These objectives take precedence over market forces or technological breakthroughs, resulting in musical styles and scenes that are often manifestly different from those found in the United States. In contrasting the government-purposed genre with the genre forms explicated earlier in the book, Lena offers real insight into the impact of large-scale social forces and smaller cultural influences on music-making the world over.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Lena’s contribution is in detailing the processes by which music styles advance through differing stages of reception, steered by macro-level factors and choices made at the individual and organizational level. This sheds light on cycles of innovation, because progress may be more likely to occur during one genre form than in another. (Lena cleverly illustrates how, contrary to popular belief, corporate interference sometimes leads to greater musical innovation.) Moreover, the book’s tone, while appropriately academic, never forgets that music is supposed to be fun. Scholars interested in musical categorization, subcultures, and development would do well to consider <italic>Banding Together</italic>, which—like a great song—stirs heart and head in equal measure.</p>
