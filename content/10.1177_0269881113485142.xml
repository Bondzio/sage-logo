<abstract>
<p>Reduced amplitude of the cortical P300 event-related potential (ERP) component during response inhibition is associated with vulnerability to alcohol use disorders. In the current study, we investigated the effect of an experimental manipulation of response conflict on the amplitude of the P300 component during response inhibition, and examined whether individual differences in the amplitude of this P300 component would predict voluntary ad-lib alcohol consumption, in social drinkers. Using a repeated measures design, 16 participants performed a stop-signal task after receiving instructions that either emphasised or de-emphasised response conflict while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was concurrently recorded, before their ad-lib drinking was assessed. Results revealed that task instructions had the predicted effects on behavioural indices of response inhibition and the associated P300 components. Most importantly, individual differences in the amplitude of P300 subcomponents during response inhibition were negatively correlated with ad-lib alcohol consumption. Results provide the first experimental support for theoretical models that posit that reduced amplitude of the P300 during response inhibition is associated with alcohol-seeking behaviour in humans.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Response inhibition (the ability to change or inhibit a motor response) enables organisms to adapt their behaviour in response to environmental demands. The ability to adapt behaviour in this way is a recognised component of executive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881113485142">Miyake et al., 2000</xref>) and ‘impulsivity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881113485142">Bickel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881113485142">Reynolds et al., 2006</xref>). Deficits in this ability are closely associated with various psychopathologies including alcohol use disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881113485142">Goudriaan et al., 2006</xref>) and other substance use disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881113485142">Verdejo-García et al., 2008</xref>). While there is some debate as to whether poor inhibitory control in alcohol use disorders is best characterised as a consequence of chronic heavy drinking or a pre-morbid risk-factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881113485142">de Wit, 2009</xref>), a series of recent studies have demonstrated that poor inhibitory control may pre-date alcohol involvement and it serves as a risk factor for the development of alcohol use disorders later on in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881113485142">Nigg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881113485142">Wong et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Response inhibition is typically assessed in the laboratory using computerised tasks such as the stop-signal task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881113485142">Logan and Cowan, 1984</xref>). In this task, participants make a rapid motor response in order to categorize visually presented ‘go’ stimuli, but on a minority of trials (typically 25%), they must inhibit their response whenever an auditory stop signal is presented. The task thus establishes a response conflict between rapid responding and successful inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881113485142">Band et al., 2003</xref>). In two recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881113485142">Jones et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881113485142">2011b</xref>), we modified the task instructions before participants completed the stop-signal task in order to emphasize the importance of either rapid responding (at the expense of successful inhibition) or vice versa. This manipulation reduces the response conflict that is normally inherent in the task and instead places participants in either a disinhibited or restrained mental set, depending on whether instructions emphasized the importance of rapid responding or successful inhibition, respectively. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that experimentally-induced fluctuations in response inhibition influenced ad-lib alcohol consumption in the laboratory in social drinkers. Furthermore, in both studies we found that individual differences in response inhibition were associated with alcohol consumption, such that more disinhibited participants drank more alcohol. Therefore, these studies provide the first experimental evidence that disinhibited ‘states’ have an immediate causal influence on alcohol consumption in human participants, as predicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881113485142">de Wit (2009)</xref>.</p>
<p>Electrophysiological research into the brain mechanisms that underlie response inhibition has identified two important components of the event-related potential (ERP): the N200 and P300. The N200 is a negative peak which occurs in fronto-central regions between 200 ms and 300 ms after presentation of the stop signal, whereas the P300 is a positive peak with a more posterior distribution which follows the N200 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881113485142">Kok et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881113485142">Polich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881113485142">Polich and Criado, 2006</xref>). The consensus is that when individuals have to actively inhibit a motor response both of these components show an increased amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881113485142">Bokura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881113485142">Dimoska et al., 2006</xref>) with successful inhibition associated with a P300 of greater magnitude than unsuccessful inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881113485142">Dimoska et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881113485142">Kok et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The degree of response conflict within the stop-signal task influences the amplitude of N200 and P300 ERPs during response inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881113485142">Ramautar et al., 2004</xref>). However, whilst N200 is often elicited during response inhibition tasks such as the stop-signal task, this component is sometimes larger during unsuccessful, compared to successful, inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881113485142">Kok et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, the functional specificity of this component is still unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881113485142">Dimoska et al., 2006</xref>). On the other hand, the amplitude of P300 is consistently larger during successful, compared to unsuccessful, inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881113485142">Dimoska et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881113485142">Kok et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881113485142">Ramautar et al., 2004</xref>). In relation to alcohol use disorders, reduced amplitude of the P300 (but not N200) during response inhibition is thought to represent a component of the alcoholic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881113485142">Cohen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881113485142">Euser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881113485142">Kamarajan et al., 2005a</xref>). Consistent with this, blunted P300 during response inhibition is present in individuals considered ‘at risk’ for the development of alcoholism such as the children of alcoholics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881113485142">Kamarajan et al., 2005b</xref>). Furthermore, the P300 during response inhibition is attenuated in alcoholics who are prone to relapse compared to alcoholics who are able to maintain abstinence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881113485142">Glenn et al., 1993</xref>). Therefore, this evidence suggests that a blunted P300 during response inhibition may index the underlying processes that cause excessive alcohol consumption, in particular poor inhibitory control.</p>
<p>Importantly, no previous study has examined whether electrophysiological markers of response inhibition are associated with subsequent ad-lib alcohol consumption in social drinkers. Our primary aim in the present study was to investigate this relationship. Our secondary aim was to corroborate previous demonstrations that an experimental reduction of response conflict during the stop-signal task would reduce the amplitude of the P300 during response inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881113485142">Ramautar et al., 2004</xref>) by using our previous methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881113485142">Jones et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881113485142">2011b</xref>) in which we manipulated task instructions in order to increase or decrease the conflict between rapid responding and successful inhibition, and thereby influence behavioural indices of response inhibition.</p>
<p>To achieve these aims, participants performed a stop-signal task on two separate occasions: once with an emphasis placed on cautious responding and successful inhibition, and once with standard instructions that emphasised the conflict between rapid responding and successful inhibition. Immediately after completing the stop-signal task, participants completed a bogus ‘taste test’ in which their ad-lib alcohol consumption was assessed. Our primary hypothesis was that individual differences in the amplitude of the P300, and a behavioural index of response inhibition (stop-signal reaction time (SSRT); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881113485142">Logan et al., 1997</xref>), would both be correlated with alcohol consumption, albeit only when participants completed the stop-signal task following standard instructions which emphasised the conflict between rapid responding and successful inhibition. Our secondary hypothesis was that the amplitude of P300 during successful inhibition would be significantly attenuated following instructions which placed the emphasis on successful restraint (and thereby reduced response conflict) compared to standard instructions which emphasised response conflict (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881113485142">Ramautar et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0269881113485142">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Sixteen participants (seven females and nine males, mean age 20.50±2.56 yrs) took part in the study. Inclusion criteria were: social drinking (consumption of alcohol at least once per week), no history of any neurological/neuropsychiatric disorders, a liking for beer and fruit juice, and age between 18–30. Participants were asked to refrain from consuming caffeine for two hours, and from alcohol for the entire day, before attending the laboratory. Participants were recruited via advertisements placed around the University campus and on the intranet. All participants provided informed consent before taking part in the study, which was approved by the University of Liverpool Research Ethics Committee and carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269881113485142">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Experimental sessions took place in electroencephalogram (EEG) laboratories in the School of Psychology, University of Liverpool, between the hours of 1200–1800. Task instructions (conflict or restraint, see below) and drink type (see below) were counterbalanced across sessions. In the first session participants provided informed consent before completing a questionnaire battery consisting of: two week alcohol Timeline Follow-Back Diary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881113485142">Sobell and Sobell, 1992</xref>), the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881113485142">Saunders et al., 1993</xref>), the Temptation and Restraint Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881113485142">Collins and Lapp, 1992</xref>), and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881113485142">Patton et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The electrode cap was fitted before participants were seated inside a sound attenuated chamber, approximately 1.5 m from the stimulus presentation monitor. The stop-signal task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881113485142">Logan and Cowan, 1984</xref>) was programmed using Inquisit 3.0 (Millisecond Software: Seattle, Washington, USA), and presented on a standard PC with a 15 in monitor. The task began with a fixation point ‘+’ that was presented for 500 ms. Following this, one of two ‘go’ stimuli were presented, either ‘X’ or ‘O’. Participants were required to press one key upon presentation of ‘X’ and a different key upon presentation of ‘O’, using different fingers of the right hand. The go stimuli were uninterrupted on 75% of trials, and a stimulus timeout of 1000 ms was used (incorrect responses, or those that occurred after the timeout period were coded as errors of omission). On 25% of trials an auditory ‘stop’ signal was presented at one of two delays (150 ms or 250 ms) after onset of the go stimulus, which signalled that participants should inhibit their motor response. Failures to inhibit were coded as errors of commission. There was an inter-trial interval of 1500 ms. The task was split into six blocks of 64 trials, with 48 go trials and 16 stop trials (8 at 150 ms and 8 at 250 ms) in each block. The task took around 45 min to complete.</p>
<p>Participants were given different instructions for the stop-signal task in different experimental sessions, based on those used in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881113485142">Jones et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881113485142">2011b</xref>). In the ‘conflict’ condition, participants were instructed to:<disp-quote>
<p>Respond as quickly as possible to the go stimuli, and if you hear the tone you should inhibit your response. The tone is infrequent and you may not always be able to inhibit. You should not wait for the tone.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Note that these are ‘standard’ instructions for the stop-signal task because they set up a conflict between rapid responding and successful inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881113485142">Logan and Cowan, 1984</xref>). In the ‘restraint’ condition participants were instructed: Respond as carefully and accurately to the stimuli as possible. The stop tone is infrequent and random and you should be careful to inhibit your response to this tone’. Therefore, participants were instructed to inhibit their responses when stop signals were presented in both sessions, but the ‘restraint’ instructions place more emphasis on successful inhibition: in previous studies, these instructions led to slower reaction times to go cues and a higher rate of successful inhibitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881113485142">Jones et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881113485142">2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>Following the stop-signal task, the EEG cap and electrodes were removed before participants completed the Approach and Avoidance of Alcohol Questionnaire (AAAQ) and the Brief Mood Introspection Scale (BMIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881113485142">Mayer and Gaschke, 1988</xref>). Data from these questionnaires are not reported here but we note that, as in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881113485142">Jones et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881113485142">2011b</xref>), there were no significant differences between conflict and restraint conditions on either questionnaire. Participants then completed a bogus taste test, which was identical to that used in our previous studies. They were given 250 mL of chilled beer (either ‘Kronenbourg 1664’ or ‘Becks’, both alcohol by volume (ABV) 5%) and 250 mL of fruit juice (either J20 apple and blueberry or J20 blackcurrant and raspberry), in unmarked glasses. They were instructed to consume as much or as little as they liked of each drink in order to rate them on 10 adjectives (such as bitterness, fruitiness etc.). Taste ratings were not analysed as their only purpose was to obscure the true purpose of the taste test, which was to measure voluntary alcohol consumption. The dependent variable was the volume of beer consumed as a percentage of total fluid.</p>
<p>Participants returned for the second session 4–7 days later and they again completed the stop-signal task while EEG activity was recorded. This time, task instructions were different from those used in the first session (so those who had received ‘conflict’ instructions in the first session received ‘restraint’ instructions in the second session, and vice versa). Participants then completed the AAAQ and BMIS followed by the bogus taste test, but with different drinks to those used in the first session. At the end of the study participants received £20 or course credit before being debriefed and discharged.</p>

<sec id="section5-0269881113485142">
<title>EEG recording</title>
<p>EEG activity was recorded continuously using 64 scalp electrodes based on the extended 10/20 system using a Biosemi ActiveTwo system (Biosemi, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Vertical electrooculograms (EOG) were recorded in parallel with EEG signals above and below the right eye using flat disc electrodes, and all signals were recorded continuously with 512 Hz sampling frequency. A reference electrode was placed on the right mastoid. Data were recorded with a low pass filter of 200 Hz similar to prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881113485142">Enoch et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269881113485142">
<title>Data reduction and analysis</title>
<p>SSRT was computed using the integration method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881113485142">Logan et al., 1997</xref>). This method involved ranking individual reaction times on ‘go’ trials (fastest to slowest), before defining SSRT for each separate stop-signal delay by subtracting the delay (150 or 250 ms) from the <italic>N</italic>th reaction time. <italic>N</italic>th reaction time is obtained from the ranked ‘go’ trials by multiplying the number of ‘go’ reaction times in the distribution by the proportion of commission errors. SSRT was calculated separately for the two stop-signal delays (150 ms and 250 ms) and then averaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881113485142">Verbruggen and Logan, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Brain Electrical Source Analysis (BESA) v5.2 program (MEGIS, Germany) was used to analyse EEG data. EOG artefacts were removed by principal component analysis procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881113485142">Berg and Scherg, 1994</xref>), and muscle artefact rejection was completed manually by visual inspection before averaging. Data were spatially transformed to reference-free data using the common average reference method. Continuous EEG data was broken down into epochs of 1100 ms (100 ms pre-stimulus and 1000 ms post-stimulus presentation) with ERPs time-locked to the onset of the go stimulus during stop-signal trials, on which participants successfully inhibited motor responses to the stop signal. Data were initially preprocessed using filters of 0.5–70 Hz (to remove artefacts), with a notch filter of 50 Hz. Epochs containing artefacts were removed from analysis, as were data from trials in which commission errors were made. The remaining epochs were averaged across all six blocks of the task. Filtering was done on the averaged data at 0.5–40 Hz. For individual electrode analysis, grand averages were exported to Matlab R2009a (Mathworks: Natick, Massachusetts, USA).</p>
<p>In accordance with methods used in previous studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881113485142">Kamarajan et al., 2005a</xref>) the P300 component was identified as the largest positive peak following presentation of the stop signal. The N200 component was identified by searching backwards for the first negative peak occurring prior to the P300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881113485142">Nieuwenhuis et al., 2003</xref>), which corresponded to the period 240–280 ms on trials with a 150 ms stop-signal delay, and the period 380–420 ms on trials with a 250 ms stop-signal delay. The amplitudes of the N200 and P300 were calculated as the mean amplitudes within the specific epochs described. We computed mean amplitude instead of peak amplitude because the former is preferable when there are unequal numbers of trial to be averaged in different experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881113485142">Luck, 2005</xref>), as was the case in the present study. The restraint and conflict conditions did not differ in the number of trials lost due to artefact rejection (conflict=6%, restraint=4%, (<italic>t</italic>(15) 0.90, <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.1). However, participants made more commission errors in the conflict condition compared to the restraint condition (23% vs 4%: <italic>t</italic>(15)=7.14, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01), as would be expected given that inhibition was more difficult in the former condition (in which there is increased conflict between rapid responding and successful inhibition) compared to the latter. Furthermore, participants made more commission errors on trials with a 250 ms stop-signal delay compared to trials with a 150 ms stop-signal delay (22% vs 5%; t(15)=7.89, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01), again as we would expect given the increase in difficult of inhibition with increasing stop-signal delays. Midline electrodes (Fz, Cz and Pz) were selected for analysis in accordance with previous research examining inhibition P300 in alcoholics and other drug users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881113485142">Gamma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881113485142">Kamarajan et al., 2005a</xref>).</p>

The N200 component showed a negative spatial maximum at fronto-central electrodes with some left-side predominance. The P300 component showed the strongest positive maximum at centro-parietal electrodes. To investigate effects of task instructions on ERP components, electrodes Fz, Pz and Cz were analysed in detail. Visual inspection of these grand averages revealed that both P300a and P300b could be distinguished at the 150 ms stop-signal delay (see Polich and Criado, 2007), whereas only P300b was evident at the 250 ms stop-signal delay.

Visual inspection of the N200 component revealed a shift toward activity in the left hemisphere that appeared more pronounced in the restraint group. Statistical analyses showed that there was a main effect of electrode, in that overall, amplitudes were larger on the left central electrode (C3) compared to the midline central (Cz) and right central (C4) electrodes (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). However, there were no significant interactions between electrode position and any of the other variables, including condition (<italic>p</italic>s&gt;0.1), which demonstrates that this general shift of N200 to the left hemisphere was not significantly different in the restraint versus conflict conditions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>P300 amplitude during successful response inhibition was reduced when task instructions placed the emphasis on successful inhibition before participants completed a stop-signal task. More importantly, when participants performed the task after receiving standard instructions (which emphasised the conflict between rapid responding and successful inhibition), reduced amplitude of the P300 during successful response inhibition was associated with increased voluntary ad-lib alcohol consumption. To our knowledge, this is the first study to experimentally manipulate electrophysiological markers of response inhibition by using modified task instructions, and it is the first demonstration that P300 amplitude during response inhibition is associated with subsequent alcohol consumption measured in the laboratory.</p>
<p>We demonstrated that when participants completed the stop-signal task after instructions which emphasised the importance of successful inhibition, and therefore reduced the usual conflict in the task (between rapid responding and successful inhibition), the amplitude of P300 during successful inhibition was significantly reduced. This finding is consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881113485142">Ramautar et al., 2004</xref>), in which a different method was used to reduce conflict within the task by increasing the frequency of stop-signal trials from 25% of trials to 75%. Furthermore it is consistent with a hypothesis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881113485142">Kok et al., (2004)</xref> who suggested that P300 may represent an ‘urgent inhibitory brake’.</p>
<p>Our most important finding was the demonstration that individual differences in the amplitude of the P300 during successful response inhibition were negatively correlated with participants’ ad-lib alcohol consumption, which was assessed immediately after participants completed the stop-signal task. However, this was only the case when participants completed the task after receiving standard instructions (which emphasised the response conflict between rapid responding and successful inhibition) but not when task instructions emphasised successful inhibition at the expense of rapid responding. This suggests that the P300 during response inhibition is directly associated with momentary fluctuations in the motivation to drink alcohol, such that individuals in whom the P300 during response inhibition is of relatively small amplitude are more likely to drink alcohol to excess at that moment in time. These results complement previous studies which demonstrate that reduced amplitude of the P300 during response inhibition is a biomarker for alcohol problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881113485142">Cohen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881113485142">Euser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881113485142">Kamarajan et al., 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881113485142">2005b</xref>), and is a risk-factor the development of alcohol use disorders later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881113485142">Justus et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881113485142">Kamarajan et al., 2005b</xref>). Our results extend this finding by demonstrating that individual differences in the amplitude of the P300 during response inhibition are associated with the volume of alcohol that participants choose to consume at that exact moment in time, and therefore they support theoretical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881113485142">de Wit, 2009</xref>) and recent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881113485142">Jones et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881113485142">2011b</xref>) which demonstrate that inhibitory control can fluctuate within individuals, and that both behavioural and electrophysiological markers of inhibitory control are associated with laboratory measures of the motivation to drink alcohol.</p>
<p>The trend for a negative association between the amplitude of the P300 during successful inhibition and the behavioural measure of inhibitory control (SSRT) is also important as it validates P300 as a biomarker of inhibitory control, albeit only when participants complete the stop-signal task after receiving standard instructions for the task which emphasise the equal importance of rapid responding to go signals and successful inhibition to stop signals, thereby establishing a response conflict. It is perhaps unsurprising that the amplitude of P300, SSRT and ad-lib alcohol consumption were not inter-correlated following the modified ‘restraint’ instructions, as these instructions deliberately remove the response conflict from the task and place the emphasis on successful inhibition, with rapid responding only of secondary importance. Therefore, the present results are informative as they reveal that response conflict during the stop-signal task has a major influence on behavioural and electrophysiological indices of response inhibition, although these instructions also render the task invalid as a measure of inhibitory control.</p>
<p>Whilst the different task instructions led to fluctuations in amplitudes of the P300 component, no such effect was found with the N200. We speculate that P300 and N200 may underlie different processes related to inhibitory control. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881113485142">Luijten et al. (2011)</xref> found that reduced N200 (rather than P300) was associated with a behavioural index of inhibitory control during a go/no-go task. Therefore, N200 may be representative of dysfunctional activation of inhibitory processes at an early stage when inhibition is initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881113485142">Kok et al., 2004</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881113485142">Schmajuk et al., 2006</xref>), whereas the P300 is reflective of actual inhibition of the motor system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881113485142">Kok et al., 2004</xref>). Future research should focus on improving our knowledge of the precise processes involved in these different aspects of response inhibition.</p>
<p>Limitations of our study include the use of a simplified version of the original stop-signal task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881113485142">Logan and Cowan, 1984</xref>). We opted to use only two stop-signal delays (150 and 250 ms) in order to generate reliable patterns of electrophysiological activity at each stop-signal delay. One disadvantage of this approach is that we were unable to map activity across a broader range of inhibitory performance, as the original stop-signal task employs a range of delays which make inhibition very easy (e.g. 50 ms) in addition to delays which make inhibition almost impossible (e.g. 450 ms). Future studies of this type should use a broader range of stop-signal delays in order to investigate if task instructions influence the magnitude of the P300 during successful response inhibition at a range of stop-signal delays. In addition, we did not measure cigarette smoking, a variable that is known to influence the amplitude of the P300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881113485142">Anokhin et al., 2000</xref>), in our participants. However, any between-subject differences that arise as a result of smoking status should have a negligible effect on our findings given that we used a within-subjects experimental design. Finally, as this was a pilot study we recruited a relatively small number of participants and therefore the magnitude of the effects reported here may differ if larger samples are studied in future replications of our work. However, we note that similar studies have investigated both group differences and individual differences in ERP components associated with inhibitory control with comparable sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881113485142">Gamma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881113485142">Petit et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881113485142">Stancak et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>To summarise, this study is the first to examine the association between the magnitude of the P300 during response inhibition, and subsequent ad-lib alcohol consumption. Results suggest that an experimental manipulation of response conflict can affect the magnitude of the P300 during successful inhibition, which is consistent with previous reports. Most importantly, the amplitude of the P300 during successful inhibition was negatively correlated with subsequent alcohol consumption, such that individuals in whom the P300 amplitude was relatively small tended to drink more alcohol when given ad-lib access to it. These results extend previous studies of the P300 in the context of response inhibition in alcoholics and individuals ‘at risk’ for alcoholism.</p>
