<abstract>
<p>One of the most common types of interaction between parents and their very young children is picture-book reading, with alphabet books being one of the most popular types of book used in these interactions. Here we report two studies examining alphabet letter learning by 30- to 36-month-old children in book-reading interactions with an adult. Each child encountered either a standard type of children’s book or a book with manipulative features – flaps, levers, textures and other elements designed to elicit physical manipulation. In the first study, the children learned more letters with the relatively plain books than with a book with manipulative features. The manipulative elements apparently distracted them from the information in that book. In the second study, a manipulative feature that was specifically designed to attract children’s attention to the letters did not facilitate performance. These results are consistent with the theoretical concept of dual representation and they have important practical implications for the design and selection of educationally oriented books for very young children.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1468798411430091" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Books become part of children’s lives at a very early age. Nearly all (96%) American parents with children under the age of six believe that book reading is important to their children’s intellectual development, and the majority (79%) engage in book-centred interactions with their children on a daily basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468798411430091">Rideout et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Parents’ intuition that picture books are beneficial to their young children’s development is supported by research. In general, parent–child book-reading interactions are associated with advanced early literacy skills, including print awareness and alphabet learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468798411430091">McGee and Richgels, 1989</xref>). Further, children’s later reading achievement is related to the amount of early exposure they have to books (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468798411430091">Cunningham and Stanovich, 1991</xref>), and young children who love books tend to become better readers than do those with little early interest in books (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468798411430091">Crain-Thoreson and Dale, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468798411430091">Whitehurst and Lonigan, 1998</xref>). More recently, in a meta-analysis of 16 studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468798411430091">Mol et al. (2008)</xref> found that interactive shared book reading was associated with increased expressive vocabulary, especially for two- to three-year-olds.</p>
<p>One of the earliest domains of literacy-related achievement is learning the alphabet. Young children typically begin letter learning with recognizing the first letter of their own name (‘K’ is for ‘Katie’), and they later link letter names with letter sounds (‘K’ represents ‘kuh’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468798411430091">Treiman and Broderick, 1998</xref>). Full understanding of the alphabet is achieved when children come to realize that when letters are put together, they stand for the meaning of words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468798411430091">Bialystok, 1992</xref>). Alphabet learning thus provides crucial support for learning to read (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468798411430091">Byrne and Fielding-Barnsley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468798411430091">Hohn and Ehri, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>The best method for teaching children to read is still hotly debated. However, it is widely accepted that reading in an alphabetic orthography and understanding its basic design principles go hand in hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468798411430091">Byrne, 1998</xref>). One of the National Reading Panel’s ‘Big Five’ components of reading instruction is phonics, which teaches students about the relationship between phonemes and printed letters and explains how to use this knowledge to read and spell (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nationalreadingpanel.org">http://www.nationalreadingpanel.org</ext-link>). Research has shown that children who master the alphabetic principle early go on to become good readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468798411430091">National Reading Panel, 2000</xref>). Learning the alphabet is an important precursor to learning how to read.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly then, alphabet picture books constitute one of the most common types of picture book designed and marketed for very young children. A goal that is presumably shared by writers and publishers of these books, and by parents who purchase them, is that children will learn to recognize the letters of the alphabet. These books vary in many dimensions, including the nature of the pictures in them. To what extent might characteristics of the pictures in a book affect very young children’s learning from them.</p>
<p>Recent research has revealed effects of the nature of the pictures in a book on children’s learning and extension of information from the book to the real world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468798411430091">Ganea et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468798411430091">Simcock and DeLoache, 2006</xref>). In picture-book interactions with an experimenter, 15- and 18-month-old children were taught either a novel name for a novel object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468798411430091">Ganea et al., 2008</xref>), or how to perform a series of actions on novel objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468798411430091">Simcock and DeLoache, 2006</xref>). They were then tested with real versions of the objects depicted in the book. The nature of the pictures with which they had been taught influenced how well the children performed in the tests. In both sets of studies, they extended what they had learned from the book to the real world much more successfully when the book was illustrated with highly realistic colour photographs, rather than with cartoons. These results indicate that very young children’s learning of new information from picture-book interactions is relatively fragile and affected by the nature of the illustrations in the books they read.</p>
<p>Another way in which books for very young children vary widely is the extent to which they deviate from the traditional book format. For example, many children’s books come in a shape associated with the topic on which they focus (e.g. a book about trucks in the shape of a truck). Particularly common are what we refer to as <italic>manipulative</italic> books, which contain a variety of features that invite children to interact physically with them, including dials to spin, levers to pull and flaps to lift to reveal hidden items, as well as textures to feel.</p>
<p>Do such features enhance very young children’s learning from picture books? On the one hand, to the extent that manipulative elements increase children’s interest in a book, they might enhance learning from it. On the other hand, to the extent that children devote more attention to the manipulative features per se than to the information presented, their learning of that information could be compromised. Time spent feeling textures and pulling flaps is time spent on something other than content. Thus, there are common sense reasons to question the efficacy of manipulative books for conveying information to very young children.</p>
<p>There is also a strong theoretical basis for doubting the efficacy of manipulative elements. According to the concept of <italic>dual representation</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468798411430091">DeLoache, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468798411430091">2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468798411430091">2002b</xref>), understanding and using something as a symbol requires mentally representing the symbolic object, such as a picture or letter, in two different ways at the same time. The picture or letter is a real entity – marks on the surface of a page – but it also stands for something else, its referent. The more interesting the symbol is as an object, the more difficult it is for young children to appreciate its primary function of representing something other than itself.</p>
<p>Manipulative elements in picture books that invite very young children to treat them as objects in and of themselves, rather than as representations of something else, may make it more difficult for young children to achieve dual representation with respect to the book’s content. Feeling the fuzzy texture of the letter ‘J’ or lifting a ‘T’-shaped element to see the picture concealed underneath may distract their attention from the letter itself. To the extent that children’s attention is focused on the manipulative elements per se, they may fail to appreciate the relation of those elements to their referents.</p>
<p>In the only study of which we are aware to investigate young children’s interaction with manipulative books (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468798411430091">Kaderavek and Justice, 2005</xref>), mothers of four young language-impaired children read either narrative or manipulative books with their children over a four-week period. When observed at the end of the period, the children to whom had been read the manipulative books spoke more and asked more questions than did the other children.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, there are many benefits to reading books. Different types of books and different types of book-reading interactions may offer different benefits. In the studies reported here, we focus on two aspects of very young children’s learning of alphabet letters from manipulative versus standard picture books.</p>
<p>First, we consider children’s learning of content. Arguably, one of the foremost reasons that parents purchase books is to teach their child the information contained in them. Although parents may buy one alphabet book over another because it might promise to be more fun for their child or because the pictures feature the child’s favourite things and places, they are probably buying it in the first place with the aim of helping their child learn the alphabet.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468798411430091">Kaderavek and Justice (2005)</xref> reported that with repeated adult-guided readings, manipulative books increase children’s interest in a book. Unfortunately, they did not compare how well the children had <italic>learned</italic> from the two types of books. Thus, the present studies focus on very young children’s learning of the initial steps of understanding the alphabetic principle – letter naming and letter recognition.</p>
<p>A second area where we narrow the focus is the type of book-reading interaction. The goal of the two studies presented here was to explore what type of book parents or teachers should use to teach very young children alphabet letters. Thus, the interaction was designed to be adult-led book reading. Specifically, 30- to 36-month-old children participated in a one-time picture-book-reading session in which an experimenter attempted to teach them to name and recognize four alphabet letters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1468798411430091"><title>Study 1</title>
<p>In Study 1, we compared children’s letter learning from three quite different alphabet books, including two commercial books – a plain, rather old-fashioned picture book and a manipulative (‘pop-up’) book with many interactive features. The third book was a version of the manipulative book modified to have no manipulative features.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1468798411430091" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants were 48 (24 girls and 24 boys) 30- to 36-month-olds (mean age = 32.8). Six additional participants (1 girl, 5 boys) were excluded due to fussiness. For both studies reported here, names of participants were obtained through birth announcements and recruiting events; parents were contacted by telephone, and the samples were predominantly white and middle class. Equal numbers of boys and girls at each age were randomly assigned to three book conditions.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1468798411430091"><title>Books</title>
<p>The stimuli were three alphabet books, including two commercial books (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468798411430091">Figure 1</xref>). The Standard book, <italic>My ABC Book</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468798411430091">Izawa, 1971</xref>) (12.7 cm x 21.6 cm), had a very simple format: two pictures per page, each accompanied by a prominently displayed upper- and lower-case letter, and with the name of the depicted item displayed beneath the letters. The Manipulative book, <italic>First Concepts ABC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411430091">Graham and Pinnington, 2002</xref>) (20.1 cm x 20.1 cm) contained flaps to lift, shiny materials to touch and tabs to pull. Each letter was accompanied by two to three objects (e.g. ‘T’ for ‘twin’, ‘tire’ and ‘truck’). The letters varied across pages in terms of size, colour, number and placement; in some cases, the letter was part of a manipulative feature (e.g. the vertical line of the ‘L’ lifted up to reveal a long ladder). Some of the depicted objects were accompanied by text, such as ‘Under an umbrella’. A third book, the 2-D book, was constructed by scanning the Manipulative book and laminating and binding the scanned pages. The book thus contained most of the pictures and letters in the Manipulative book, but none of its manipulative features.

<sec id="sec7-1468798411430091"><title>Test materials</title>
<p>Laminated white cards (10.2 cm x 10.2 cm) were used to test letter recognition. Each depicted one uppercase large letter in black Times New Roman font, size 200.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1468798411430091" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<sec id="sec9-1468798411430091"><title>Prior letter knowledge</title>
<p>To determine the target letters to be taught to each child, parents were asked which letters they thought their child either <italic>knew</italic> or <italic>might be able to recognize</italic>; all letters indicated by the parent were excluded. ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ and the initial letter of the child’s first name were also excluded. The experimenter then randomly chose four of the remaining letters to be the target letters for the child. A parent survey was used to determine the children’s prior letter knowledge. Given the young age of the participants, a 26-trial pre-test might have resulted in testing fatigue and high drop-out rates. Hence, the parent survey was deemed a better method of determining the children’s prior letter knowledge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1468798411430091"><title>Book reading</title>
<p>The child and experimenter sat together on a couch, as the experimenter engaged the child in a natural adult-guided conversation about the pictures in the book. Of most importance, she repeatedly named the child’s four target letters. As the letters appeared in the book, the experimenter pointed to each one, labelled it three times and named the picture with which it was associated, for example: ‘Look, this is the letter “<italic>X</italic>”. “<italic>X</italic>” is for xylophone. See, the letter “<italic>X</italic>”.’ None of the non-target letters was labelled. The pair then went through the book a second time. Thus, the child heard each target letter labelled a total of six times. The book reading took approximately five to seven minutes. The book-reading procedure for the two books was identical except that, with the Manipulative book, the children were also encouraged to interact with the manipulative elements of the book (e.g. ‘What’s under there?’, ‘Feel this!’).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1468798411430091"><title>Testing</title>
<p>After the book-reading interaction, the experimenter and child sat opposite one another at a small table. The child was given two tests – letter naming and letter recognition. In the letter-naming task, the child was shown the four target-letter cards, one at a time in random order, and was asked: ‘Can you tell me what letter this is?’ In the letter-recognition task, all four target-letter cards were placed in front of the child and the experimenter asked: ‘Can you show me which one is the letter [X]?’ For the next trials, the cards were rearranged so that the target letter appeared once in each position. The experimenter recorded the child’s responses.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1468798411430091" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>The results were quite straightforward with respect to letter recognition. The children in the Standard and 2-D book groups identified more letters than did those in the Manipulative book group.</p>
<sec id="sec14-1468798411430091"><title>Prior knowledge</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468798411430091">Table 1</xref> shows the average number of letters that the children were reported to know. A simple analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no significant difference between conditions in letter knowledge. Correlations between the children’s prior letter knowledge and their subsequent performance on the two tasks were not significant. Nevertheless, because it was crucial that any differences in performance should not be due to prior knowledge, the number of letters the children already knew was used as a covariate in most of the following analyses. We also examined the response patterns for the target letters. Nineteen of the 26 alphabet letters were used as target letters in the Standard condition and 16 for the Manipulative. We did not detect any differences in correct performance among the letters.

<p>As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468798411430091">Figure 2</xref> shows, the participants in the three conditions named equally few letters in the letter-naming task; the mean proportion correct (maximum score of 1.00) was only 0.13 (SD = 0.16), 0.14 (SD = 0.20) and 0.19 (SD = 0.30) for the Standard, Manipulative and 2-D groups, respectively.

<sec id="sec16-1468798411430091"><title>Letter recognition</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468798411430091">Figure 2</xref> also shows the results for the three groups in the test of letter recognition. A single value 95% confidence interval of expected frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468798411430091">Hays, 1973</xref>) revealed that performance in both the Standard (<italic>M</italic> = .63, SD = .24) and 2-D book (<italic>M</italic> = .58, SD = .38) conditions was significantly above the chance level of .25, but performance in the Manipulative book (<italic>M</italic> = .41, SD = .26) condition was not. The only significant result in a simple between-subjects analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with initial letter knowledge as covariate, was the main effect for condition (<italic>F</italic> (2, 46) = 3.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>(31) = .27). Post-hoc tests indicated that the children in the Standard condition outperformed those in the Manipulative condition.</p>
<p>These results show that the children who interacted with a book containing manipulative features learned to recognize fewer letters than did those who interacted with books without such features. These results provide empirical evidence that how well very young children learn new information from picture-book interaction can be affected by the nature of the book. Specifically, it appears that interacting with manipulative features interferes with children’s attention to letters.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1468798411430091"><title>Study 2</title>
<p>The results from Study 1 support the hypothesis that manipulative books can hinder children’s learning, compared to books without such features. The primary goal of Study 2 was to examine the effect of manipulative features on young children’s learning with extremely simple books that differed <italic>only</italic> in respect of the presence or absence of a manipulative element.</p>
<p>The second goal of Study 2 was to ask whether manipulative elements might actually assist learning if they are coordinated with the information to be learned, rather than being irrelevant or even distracting from it (as in many commercial books, including the manipulative book used in Study 1). Specifically, we explored whether learning would improve if the manipulative elements encouraged tracing letters.</p>
<p>Kinaesthetic or tactile learning is when students are physically involved in the learning process, rather than just listening to or watching a teacher. Research has long shown that this type of learning, specifically the act of tracing letters, can be effective for non-readers when they first start to write (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468798411430091">Fernald and Keller, 1921</xref>). Tracing can also help strengthen alphabetic principle skills for young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468798411430091">Bara et al., 2004</xref>). Taking it a step further, letters made from sandpaper or other types of material that provide tactile feedback are commonly used in Montessori preschools, the idea being that both the sandpaper and the action of tracing serve to direct children’s attention to, and highlight, a letter, thereby facilitating learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468798411430091">Lillard, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Accordingly, we constructed two simple alphabet books with very large alphabet letters, each accompanied by one picture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468798411430091">Figure 3</xref>). The single manipulative element provided tactile stimulation: each letter was covered with sandpaper and the children were encouraged to trace the letters.

</fig></p>
<p>The design of Study 2 thus involved four conditions: half the children interacted with simple books with sandpaper letters, and half with the same books with plain letters; half the children in each book condition were encouraged to trace the letters, and the other half were simply asked to point to them.</p>
<sec id="sec18-1468798411430091" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>Sixty-four 30- to 36-month-olds (32 girls and 32 boys, <italic>M</italic> = 33.5 months) were tested. Ten additional participants (4 girls and 6 boys) were excluded due to fussiness. Equal numbers of boys and girls were randomly assigned to four conditions: Plain-Point, Plain-Trace, Sandpaper-Point and Sandpaper-Trace.</p>

<sec id="sec19-1468798411430091" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title>
<p>Two 16.5 cm x 12.7 cm alphabet books were constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468798411430091">Figure 3</xref>). They were identical except that the 26 letters in the Sandpaper book were covered with sandpaper, whereas those in the Plain book were simply printed in the tan colour of sandpaper. One uppercase letter and a picture appeared on each page; the pictures were copied from the Standard book used in Study 1. The large alphabet letters were displayed in Arial Black font, size 200.</p>
<p>Laminated white test cards (10.2 cm x 10.2 cm) each depicted one uppercase letter in tan Arial Black, font size 200.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1468798411430091" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<p>The procedure was similar to that of Study 1. During the book interaction, the experimenter drew the child’s attention to each letter and the accompanying picture, labelling the letter three times. Half of the children in each book condition (Plain and Sandpaper) were asked to trace the target letters, and the other half were simply asked to point to the letters (e.g. ‘Look, this is the letter “J”. “J” is for Jelly. See, I’m <italic>tracing/pointing to</italic> the letter “J”. Now, can <italic>you trace/point to</italic> it?’). The book reading was repeated so the children either traced or pointed to each target letter twice. As in Study 1, letter-naming and letter-recognition tasks were given immediately after the book reading.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-1468798411430091" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>The children in the four conditions performed comparably poorly in the letter-naming task. Similar numbers of letters were recognized, with the children in the Sandpaper-Trace condition performing slightly better than the others. They were the only group to identify letters significantly above the chance level of .25.</p>
<sec id="sec22-1468798411430091"><title/>
<sec id="sec23-1468798411430091"><title>Prior letter knowledge</title>
<p>The children’s prior letter knowledge was assessed, as in Study 1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468798411430091">Table 1</xref>). Although there were no significant differences in prior letter knowledge among the four conditions, it was significantly correlated with the children’s performance on the two tasks: letter naming: <italic>r<sup>2</sup><sup> </sup>= </italic>.38, <italic>p &lt; </italic>.01; letter recognition: <italic>r<sup>2</sup><sup> </sup>= </italic>.35, <italic>p &lt; </italic>.01. Accordingly, in the following analyses, prior letter knowledge was used as a covariate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-1468798411430091"><title>Letter naming</title>
<p>As in Study 1, when the children were asked to name the letters, they rarely responded correctly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468798411430091">Figure 4</xref>). The mean proportion correct was Plain-Point: .25 (SD<italic> = </italic>.27); Plain-Trace: .16 (SD = .27); Sandpaper-Point: .28 (SD<italic> = </italic>.36); and Sandpaper-Trace: .28 (SD<italic> = </italic>.30). A simple ANCOVA with initial letter knowledge as the covariate indicated no significant difference in performance among the groups.

</fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec25-1468798411430091"><title>Letter recognition</title>
<p>Only the performance of the children in the Sandpaper-Trace condition (<italic>M = </italic>.59, SD<italic> = </italic>.27) was significantly above chance (.25) on the letter recognition test (Plain-Point: <italic>M = </italic>.52, SD<italic> = </italic>.25; Plain-Trace: <italic>M = </italic>.53, SD<italic> = </italic>.31; Sandpaper-Point: <italic>M = </italic>.50, SD<italic> = </italic>.29) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468798411430091">Figure 4</xref>). However, letter recognition in the Sandpaper-Trace condition was not significantly better than in the other three conditions, according to a between-subjects ANCOVA with initial letter knowledge as the covariate.</p>
<p>The essentially null results of Study 2 indicate two things. First, the children’s learning was not <italic>positively</italic> affected by a manipulative feature specifically designed to focus their attention on the letters to be learned. Although performance in the Sandpaper-Trace condition was significantly above chance, the absolute difference between that condition and the other three was quite modest, and there was no significant difference among conditions in the primary analysis. Thus, there was no compelling evidence for a beneficial effect of physical interaction with the manipulative element.</p>
<p>Notably, there was also no evidence of a <italic>negative</italic> effect of texture. The relatively even performance across the four conditions indicates that the manipulative feature of sandpaper and the action of tracing did not <italic>hinder</italic> the children’s performance in this study. Unlike in Study 1, both the manipulative feature and the associated action were designed to draw attention to the letters themselves. Thus, this result offers the possibility that manipulative elements that are carefully designed to highlight information to be learned could be beneficial.</p>

<sec id="sec26-1468798411430091"><title>General discussion</title>
<p>The two studies reported here provide important information regarding the effect of different types of books on very young children’s learning from them. In the first experiment, children between 30 and 36 months of age evidenced modest levels of learning to recognize alphabet letters after a brief picture book interaction, with the most important result being that the amount learned was related to the nature of the books. Specifically, the children identified more letters after having interacted with a quite simple alphabet book, rather than a book containing a variety of interactive features presumably designed to be attractive to young children. The most salient of these features were manipulative elements, including flaps, levers and textures that invited the children to interact physically with them. The poorer performance with this book suggests that these elements drew the children’s attention away from the letters we were trying to teach them. In Study 2, a very simple manipulative feature – texture provided by sandpaper, that had been specifically designed to attract children’s attention to the letters to be learned – had only a small positive impact.</p>
<p>The results of the research reported here have theoretical relevance. Consistent with the concept of dual representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468798411430091">DeLoache, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468798411430091">2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468798411430091">2002b</xref>), they reveal that very young children’s learning of abstract symbolic information, such as alphabet letters, can be impeded by the concrete features of manipulative books. Interacting physically with these features apparently makes it difficult for young children to represent them mentally as standing for something else. For example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468798411430091">DeLoache (1995)</xref> 2½-year-olds were asked to find an object hidden in a room. They were shown where the object was hidden in a scale model of the room. Although they could remember where the miniature object was hidden within the scale model, they could not find the corresponding larger object in the real room. They had difficulty in thinking of the scale model as not just an object in itself but also as a referent for the real room. However, when the hiding event in the scale model was performed from behind a window rather than right in front of the child, the children were able to find the object in the real room. Decreasing the physical salience of the model room helped the children to think of the scale model as both an object in its own right and also as a representation of the real room.</p>
<p>The same reasoning can be applied to the manipulative book. The manipulative features often involved physically interacting with the letter itself. Perhaps, lifting up the ‘L’ heightened the physical salience of the letter, thereby distracting the children from thinking of it as a letter.</p>
<p>Another factor that may have made it difficult for the children to achieve dual representation is the visual cognitive load in the situation. In addition to the pictures and letters visually represented on the page, they could also see an array of flaps, tabs and textures. The heightened complexity (compared to a plain book) may have made it difficult for the children to learn the letters. It is possible that if the session were longer or if there were repeated sessions, then the novelty of the manipulative features would decrease and they would become less distracting, cognitively demanding and physically salient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec27-1468798411430091" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although this study used a relatively small sample, we have found the same results using a similar design to teach young children labels and simple facts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468798411430091">Tare, et al., 2010</xref>). Children learned more labels for animals and facts about them when taught with a 2-D book, rather than with a pop-up version of the same book. Thus, together, these findings provide strong evidence that the type of book can not only affect young children’s learning of the alphabet, but of other domains as well.</p>
<p>The results of these studies also have very clear practical/educational implications. In the design and selection of alphabet books for very young children, publishers and parents alike should take into consideration the extent to which the features of a book are likely to promote versus distract from learning. Even though children may enjoy interacting with the levers, flaps and other features of manipulative books, their attention to such features comes at the cost of attention to whatever educational goal a parent or teacher might have in the interaction. Instead of being filled with features that draw attention away from the information to be learned, educationally relevant books for young children should be designed to draw their attention <italic>to</italic> that information.</p>
