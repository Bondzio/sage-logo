<abstract>
<p>To date, there is no article that addresses the dissertation process in the vocative case to demystify doctoral expectations. This article provides guidance to doctoral students, within accredited doctoral counselor education and supervision programs, who face paralyzing emotions as they navigate through degree attainment processes. Herein, the authors instigate discussion among seasoned academics to better equip doctoral candidates as they culminate their studies. This presentation is within an historical context of the evolution of the counseling profession and concludes with reflections on current events that contribute to the evolving nature of American culture and academia.</p>

<p>Doctorates of philosophy are higher education’s apex in the United States. Since late 19th century America, dissertations have formally separated undergraduate from graduate studies. During that time, educators agreed that doctorates should be awarded only after successful completion of thorough comprehensive examinations (CEs) committed to discovering knowledge for its own sake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480711429265">Goodchild &amp; Miller, 1997</xref>). In consequence, both CEs and dissertations have served to ascertain students’ “ability to critically analyze their research area, seek out new relationships between seemingly unconnected phenomena, resolve ambiguities, frame their own research, and pose timely research questions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480711429265">Fitt, Walker, &amp; Leary, 2009</xref>, p. 3). More precisely, dissertations have adduced doctoral candidates’ ability to conduct original research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480711429265">Davis &amp; Parker, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Usually students who complete CEs and dissertations commence a lifestyle dedicated to research and docency in American academia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480711429265">Goodchild &amp; Miller, 1997</xref>), but not all who complete their comprehensives complete their dissertations. Studies on dissertation completion have reported attrition rates of up to 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480711429265">Baird, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480711429265">Bowden &amp; Rudenstine, 1992</xref>). This means after all their efforts, only one of the every two doctoral candidates actually complete their degrees.</p>
<p>A review of degree attainment statistics at the turn of the 21st century revealed that 44,904 Americans, or only 16 of every 100,000 Americans, received doctorate degrees (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480711429265">Digest of Education Statistics, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1066480711429265">United States Census, 2000</xref>). One decade later, as the American population increased considerably (by 27.3 million people), 68,800 Americans, or only 22 of every 100,000 Americans, were projected to attain doctorate degrees (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480711429265">Digest of Education Statistics, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1066480711429265">United States Census, 2010</xref>). Although actual degree attainment data for academic year 2010 (e.g., 2009–2010 and 2010–2011) are not yet available at the time of this writing, these projections suggest the scarcity of doctorates just as their academic requirements suggest the heart of scholarship. Yet, an observable doctorate attainment rate increase of 6 points (between 2000 and 2010) means that even though doctorate degrees’ attainment was projected to increase by as much as 100% in various disciplines, an actual 0.7% decrease was observable in 2008–2009 regarding counselor education and supervision doctorates within the field of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480711429265">Digest of Education Statistics, 2008</xref>–2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480711429265">Ferrer de Valero, 2001</xref>). Their scarcity is troublesome.</p>
<p>Counseling as a profession within the mental health nomenclature emerged from the guidance counseling movement of late 19th and early 20th centuries. Its emphasis on matching individuals’ traits/skills to work environments/opportunities expanded with the practice of psychometrics and psychoanalysis. As the 20th century advanced, counseling evolved in tandem with historical events that shaped American society, including (a) postindustrial revolution technologies, (b) migration of unskilled workers, (c) two World Wars, (d) one major economic depression, (e) a national emphasis on freedom and personal autonomy, (f) women joining the workforce, (g) the civil rights movement, (h) outer space technologies, and (i) the information and computer era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480711429265">Aubrey, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480711429265">Hoyt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066480711429265">Pope, 2000</xref>); and, more recently, (j) a new paradigm of dyadic and familial systems, (k) increased unemployment, (l) a global economic recession, and (m) adjustment to the war on terror.</p>
<p>At every step of America’s historicity, counseling has morphed to provide developmental perspectives to diverse clients from all walks of life, economic status, and demographic identities as they face daily vicissitudes. No other therapeutic profession has been as malleable as counseling to respond to the diversification of clients’ needs when adjusting to the historical events that have fashioned American society. No other therapeutic profession, as counseling, has been put under the microscope of accountability and political lobbyists’ agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480711429265">Alberding, Lauver, &amp; Patnoe, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480711429265">Bradley, 1978</xref>). Rather, counseling has become robust from welcoming challenges and from constructing upon some of the contributions that critics and other professions have brought to influence health care’s effectiveness. For example, these challenges and contributions include emphasis on empirical research, development of theoretical frameworks, application of techniques and strategies, adoption of diagnostic methods, openness to the evolving nature of society in which individuals live and interact, and the application of ethical principles to nascent case law and statutory regulations placed upon counseling practices—whether these regulations serve only political agendas or are meant to prioritize the common good of society and the welfare and the dignity of each American individual.</p>
<p>Counseling’s theoretical development was first visible between the 1940s and 1950s when various frameworks emerged, professional associations evolved, and professional competencies began to be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066480711429265">Pope, 2000</xref>). These variables made counseling a more complex profession with multiple counseling specialties that have continued to emerge to this day. Their emergence has been an ethical response to the evolutionary culture of America. At the national level, four counseling areas of practice cover the 19 existent divisions (or counseling specialties) of the American Counseling Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480711429265">ACA Divisions, 2011</xref>). These areas of practice include (a) school counseling, (b) community/mental health counseling, (c) counselor education and supervision, and (d) couples and family counseling.</p>
<p>Of these four areas of practice, counselor education was recognized in 1961 as a pivotal component of what was to become counseling professional competency. Hence, counselor education and supervision formally was dedicated to educate future counselor academics and counselor practitioners. Currently, Counselor Education and Supervision (CES) programs prepare professional practitioners at the master and doctorate levels. Among doctorates, only doctors of philosophy (PhDs) become primarily academicians, whereas, with few exceptions, “professional doctorate” individuals become practitioners in their own specialty areas (e.g., EdDs or education doctors, and DMFTs or doctors of marriage and family therapy).</p>
<p>By the 1980s, it was clear that CES programs were pivotal to the subsistence of professional counseling and its various specialties. Beginning in 1981, the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) has approved CES curricula in the United States. Since its inception, CACREP has been dedicated to ensure that academic programs are “optimal to provide human development” services through counseling and other related academic programs (Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480711429265">CACREP], 2011b</xref>). As of this writing, CACREP has accredited nationally 60 CES doctoral programs of which, for example, only two exist in the state of Illinois with 32 additional programs at the master level (with title variations by institutional profiles: 20 MAs or master of arts, 4 MSs or master of science, and 8 MSEds or master of science in education). Of the two CACREP approved doctorates in Illinois, only one is a PhD degree and the other is a professional doctorate (EdD) degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480711429265">CACREP, 2011a</xref>). Their scarcity is evident.</p>
<p>Complementary to accreditation’s importance is the certification standards that enable professionals to obtain practicing licenses within their own specialties in counseling. Beginning in 1982, the National Board for Certified Counselors (NBCC) has promoted the following: quality assurance in counseling practice, public awareness of quality counseling practice, professionalism, and leadership in credentialing (National Board for Certified Counselors [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066480711429265">NBCC], 2011b</xref>). Presently, NBCC provides national examinations/certifications for professional counselors’ subspecialties including the (a) National Certified Counselor examination (NCE), (b) National Certified School Counselor examination, (c) Certified Clinical Mental Health Counselor examination, and (d) Master Addictions Counselor examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066480711429265">NBCC, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>Whereas the NBCC offers examinations that state licensure boards accept for issuing practicing licenses to counselors, the regulation boards of each state review counselors’/applicants’ clinical experience and supervision. State variations are based on statutory law and they must be reviewed often. These variations pertain to education, experience, clinical hours/supervision, fees, and examination (for state law requirements, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066480711429265">NBCC, 2011c</xref>). However, it is fair to state that so long a counselor in the United States has graduated from a CACREP approved program, and has obtained a certification from NBCC; the same counselor will be eligible for licensure within a given state. State laws also allow for counselors to transfer their credentials from one state to another (for specific licensure transfers, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480711429265">NBCC, 2011d</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, there is no hands-on approach to guide doctoral students in CES accredited programs through degree attainment processes. These processes include clinical internships/practica, CEs, prospects, dissertations, and dissertations’ defenses. Several authors have speculated that this lack of guidance students face toward the end of their doctoral studies, may not only generate harmful emotions that in turn may be associated with an increase in students’ attrition at the dissertation stage (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480711429265">Hodge, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480711429265">Keuler &amp; Safer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1066480711429265">Wolensky, 1979</xref>) but also a lack of guidance may decrease the interest to pursue doctorate degrees. We believe this lack of guidance must end, and the myth toward the unknown, when entering a doctorate program, must be unveiled. Here, we intend to provide guidance and demystification. Each following section will address one of the five processes in doctoral programs in CES. We intend this contribution may provide enthusiasm to those few enrolled in CES doctorate programs, and may, perhaps, generate interest in others who may consider pursuing PhDs to educate future counselors. We believe this presentation’s vocative case is appropriate.</p>

<title>Doctoral Internship</title>
<sec id="section2-1066480711429265">
<title>Doctoral Internship as a Contract</title>
<p>Your college has information on what is required to form a doctoral committee, which in turn is required to approve your internship goals and objectives. Your academic department has outlines of competencies for your area of emphasis which comes from your academic program. For example, your PhD, may be in counselor education and supervision, but your emphasis may be in couples and family counseling, mental health or community counseling, or school counseling. You must comply with your specific area’s competencies during your internship. Generically, doctoral internships include clinical practica, research, teaching, and service components as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066480711429265">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<fig id="fig1-1066480711429265" position="float">

</fig>
<p>Usually, academic departments view your doctoral internship as a contract between your academic department and you (see <italic>Amendments</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066480711429265">Figure 1</xref>). Some students write lengthy papers to explain their internship plans. We believe it may be more useful to present your plans at a glance using a table format as in Figure1. This format enables your committee members, your supervisor, and you to make recommendations and to monitor completion of your goals and objectives. Your goals and objectives must be written in measurable terms (whether by semester units or by clock hours).</p>
<p>Under activities and evaluation, list not only what you expect to accomplish but the person in your department who may evaluate your performance. If that person were to leave the department, for example, it would be your responsibility to find a replacement with approval of your doctoral committee—unless your college allows for your committee chair to approve such change. It is important to keep a signed copy of your doctoral internship as well as any other documentation regarding involvement hours, especially servicing clients or supervising other counselors in training. Your internship work will be useful to obtain your clinical licensure.</p>
<p>The teaching component is crucial for counselor educators. Most programs will expect you to engage in co-teaching, at least one graduate course. Choose as many courses as your committee may allow you to expand your teaching skills, especially regarding your area of emphasis. Under the service component, not only serving on committees may be listed but also presenting at conferences whether regional or national, whether by yourself or with a faculty member or a student colleague.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1066480711429265">
<title>Certification and Licensure</title>
<p>Clinical certifications precede licensures, and licensures are required for professional practices. Despite polemic origins of credentialing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480711429265">Alberding, Lauver &amp; Patnoe, 1993</xref>), currently there are four sources of counselor credentials. First, CACREP accredits programs that grant counseling degrees. Second, NBCC administers examinations and issues certifications for counseling specialties. Third, ACA provides membership, professional standards, and codes of ethics for counseling practice. Fourth, governmental boards issue licensures for counseling practice as stipulated in each state’s statutes.</p>
<p>Your master’s CEs serve as preparation for NBCC examinations. Generically, passing the National Counselor Examination (NCE) provides you with a Nationally Certified Counselor (NCC) status. There is no need to obtain a specific certification for any other counseling specialty, but doing so emphasizes your professional identity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066480711429265">Figure 2</xref>). Most states require either a teaching certificate or a special exam for school counseling; and issue separate licenses for couples and family counseling (for an explanation, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480711429265">Eriksen, 1999</xref>). In either case, your NBCC certification replaces the examination to obtain a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) status, though its title changes in some states. For example, both NBCC and your state board accept CACREP-approved CES programs qualifications to renew your NCC and obtain your LPC and LCPC credentials. Simply said, whereas your master’s degree enables you to obtain NCC and LPC credentials, your doctorate internship and clinical practica will enable you to renew your NCC and obtain your LCPC credentials.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section4-1066480711429265">
<title>Supervisor Credentials and Clinical Hours</title>
<p>Whereas clinical consultation is recommended, clinical supervision is required by law. Acceptable supervision focuses on your clinical supervisor’s credentials’ qualifications. For example, it is possible that a nonqualified faculty member be your supervisor in as much as she or he receives supervision from a qualified professional. Your clinical supervisor must meet with you for supervision sessions on a weekly basis. Group supervision is also acceptable. But make sure your supervisor (or your supervisor’s supervisor) meets stipulated criteria both under state licensing law, and CACREP standards (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1066480711429265">White, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, it is important you develop a ledger in which you can register not only face-to-face hours with clients but also the time you spend in (a) progress notes, (b) case management, (c) intakes, (d) supervision, (e) crisis intervention, (f) case conceptualization and assessments, (g) treatment plan development, (h) professional studies (ethics), (i) diagnoses, (j) supervision to undergraduate/graduate students, (k) individual and conjoint therapy, (l) consultation, and (m) study hours—given a particular case that requires your familiarity with a given theory or therapeutic strategies. These are hours that count toward your state license after your first qualifying degree. It is your responsibility to keep these records up-to-date and if possible obtain signatures from your supervisor/supervisors periodically to make your ledger legitimate.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1066480711429265">
<title>Comprehensive Examinations</title>
<p>There is a preponderant discrepancy about the purpose/purposes of doctoral CEs in accredited mental health programs. This makes it difficult to ascertain commonality among CACREP-accredited CES programs throughout the United States. Programs differ not only on policies and procedures but also on pragmatic and logistical aspects. Among purposes for CEs, accredited programs have identified: (a) knowledge evaluation, (b) knowledge application, (c) rite of passage, (d) basic skills assessment, (e) evaluation for candidacy, and (f) training component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480711429265">Anderson, Kraskopf, Rogers, &amp; Neal, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480711429265">Manus, Bowden, &amp; Dowd, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066480711429265">Thomason, Parks, &amp; Bloom, 1980</xref>). Given this complex purpose/purposes, students experience anxiety toward that which is unknown to them. It is therefore important that you become familiar with your departmental policies and procedures for CEs.</p>
<sec id="section6-1066480711429265">
<title>Preparing for Comprehensive Examinations</title>
<p>Although some programs vary regarding preparation strategies for CEs, some programs have available literature lists to study for CEs. Do not limit yourself, however, to such literature lists but conduct searches for at least the past 3 years in journals relevant to CES programs, encompassing: <italic>Counselor Education and Supervision, The Family Journal, Counseling and Values, Career Counseling, Journal for Specialists in Group Work, Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development,</italic> and <italic>Journal of Multicultural Counseling and Development</italic>. Recent articles will provide you with a greater picture of your counseling specialty area and also prepare you to prepare cogent responses to your CEs.</p>
<p>Setting time apart to read without distractions, taking notes, and reflecting on information is crucial for providing quality responses to your CEs. Simply reading sources is not optional, particularly when some programs require you to include citations in your responses; you will later have the opportunity to complete your reference lists, but you must know your sources when responding to your exam’s questions. Knowing and being able to cite current sources in your responses is an indication of scholarship potential and familiarity with your specialty area.</p>
<p>Another way to prepare for your CEs is by responding to former years’ questions. Some departments make such questions available to help you prepare for your own examinations. You may find a faculty member willing to read your responses for clarity and completeness. We recommend you continue writing responses to questions <italic>daily at least 3 months in advance</italic> to your scheduled examinations.</p>
<p>Time yourself as you practice responding to questions as if you were responding to your comprehensives and stop exactly at the allotted time per question. You will see progress as you engage in this process. Though this process is arduous, crafting <italic>different</italic> responses to questions will help you express your ideas in coherent ways. Begin by breaking down questions into their components. These components can be used as headings or subheadings to your responses. Overall, this method provides you with an outline to respond to your examinations.</p>
<p>Ask other students to look over your responses and provide you with critiques. This feedback not only strengthens professional bonds among your cohorts but also provides you with the opportunity to compare your work to that of your colleagues. Ideally, having your supervisor comment on your practice-responses would be much beneficial and also strengthen a sort of mentorship between the two of you.</p>
<p>Some programs offer seminars in which students are given practice questions. Make the best of this opportunity by preparing quality responses to practice your writing skills. Also, when responding to practice questions, time yourself, as stated above. Leave your work unattended and then return and judiciously seek for what may be missing in your responses. Remember, breaking down questions into their components will provide you with an outline to fill in.</p>
<p>When no prior year questions or seminars are available, you may ask either your advisor or committee members to craft some practice questions for you. Granted that they are willing to give you feedback, you will be practicing already for your comprehensives. Alternatively, seek help from faculty from other departments. Ask them if they would be willing to read and to comment on your responses.</p>
<p>Some students also seek similarities among departments. Others form study groups. For example, doctoral students in psychology share courses with CES doctoral students, thus, exchanging reading lists or practice questions is a good opportunity to increase your chances to practice responses. You may also seek feedback from other advanced doctoral students who have passed their examinations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1066480711429265">
<title>Managing Emotions</title>
<p>Anxiety, stress, and other emotions accompany the preparation for doctoral examinations. These emotions may be diminished if not extinguished by facing your examinations through the suggestions provided above. The best way to conquer fear is to face fear itself. The best way to demystify a myth is by facing such myth and realizing that what is truly left is nothing but a sense of fear not toward that which is unknown, but a fear toward leaving behind that which is known to us. Simply put: Nothing happens as you pass your CEs! You remain the same, and nothing changes—except for the beneficial realization that the more you read, the less you actually know about your own discipline. There is no reason to fear CEs, unless your anxiety is truly due to other causes—perhaps endogenous—in which case you may seek professional help or reasonable accommodations in your department.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1066480711429265">
<title>Doctoral Prospectus</title>
<p>Albeit your CEs precede your doctoral prospectus, it is important to begin crafting your prospectus before your examinations. Your prospectus (from the Latin <italic>view</italic> or <italic>outlook</italic>) is your written research plan to obtain your doctorate. As you prepare for your CEs, you may use your research topic as a way to enrich your responses to practice questions, or you may collect research on your topic as you prepare for your examinations.</p>
<sec id="section9-1066480711429265">
<title>Time flies</title>
<p>The sooner you expect it; it will be time to present a cogent prospectus for your dissertation. Departmental prospectus procedures ought to emphasize what constitutes original contributions to the knowledge base of CES programs. Contrastingly no department delineates options for what specifically constitutes the knowledge base of CES specialties. For this reason, it is important that you develop a topic that is bound to contribute to your specialty area, and, indeed, will determine most of your scholarship upon graduation. Alternatively, you may wish to consider a topic in your discipline or replicate a given study, or augment to its original presentation in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480711429265">Davis &amp; Parker, 1997</xref>). Publications usually include recommendations for warranted or additional research topics. These topics may be developed into a prospectus outline (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1066480711429265">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>For example, some doctoral candidates undertake developing assessment tools on a given construct. This requires conceptual clarity to ensure that hypotheses become testable theories through empirical investigations. Exploring the psychometric properties of assessment tools cannot be accomplished on a single study, for instance. Usually several additional studies are necessary to achieve not only conceptual clarity of the measurable construct but also to establish acceptable construct validity and reliability indexes. With this in mind, you should be wise in selecting a topic that motivates you.</p>
<p>Many topics are available through the cognate stage of your doctoral studies. Some students have ideas they would like to explore in depth. Still others are lucky enough to share similar interests with their doctoral supervisors, who through their scholarly publications cannot only advise students but also provide directions for additional research on given topics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1066480711429265">
<title>Choosing Your Doctoral Chair</title>
<p>Spend some time thinking who in the department is a model to follow in your scholarly career. Have a conversation with that person to establish a supervisory relationship. Some ideal criteria include (a) openness to alternative approaches/ideas toward research, (b) commitment about completion/deadlines, (c) similar research interests with student, (d) reputation in her or his field, (e) willingness to support the student, and (f) enthusiasm to work toward dissertation completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480711429265">Ray, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As with other human interactions, your supervisory relationship is bound to experience conflict at some point of the process. It is best to be candid and explore this possibility with your preferred-potential supervisor, and to negotiate how to manage conflict if and when it presents in the process of your doctoral studies.</p>
<p>It is also appropriate to converse with more than one person. You must not narrow your possibilities to only one person. Ideally you want to achieve a mentoring relationship, but you can only ask or suggest you would like to attain such relationship. It is then your supervisor who decides whether she or he has the time to mentor you through your doctoral studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1066480711429265">
<title>Doctoral Committee</title>
<p>You want to choose individuals whose interests and expertise are related to your research topic. This makes it more likely that they will remain involved with your progress and perhaps motivate you when you need to be motivated. Similar to your doctoral supervisor, you want individuals in your committee who may stand by you and who may challenge you when needed. Keeping in touch with your doctoral committee not only lets them know of your progress/difficulties but also provides for an opportunity where feedback and appreciation can increase your sense of self-efficacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1066480711429265">
<title>Prospectus Logistics</title>
<p>Upon identifying a research topic and a methodology for its investigation, you should be on your way to your prospectus meeting. Ensure that your doctoral committee members have time to meet at a destined location (usually a conference room is appropriate) but most of all ensure that your advisor is able to attend your prospectus.</p>
<p>If any committee member’s status has changed, for example, someone has retired since you asked her or him to be in your committee, it is your responsibility to have quorum—that all committee members can sign to approve your prospectus—usually <italic>emeriti</italic> and <italic>emeritae</italic> faculty cannot do so. In this case, you and your advisor must discuss who is a viable candidate to either replace such faculty member or to be added to your committee in case you wish to preserve such retired committee member.</p>
<p>Bound copies of your prospectus on white paper are most recommended. Ensure that your committee members have received their copies in advance to allow them to read them and to make notes, and suggestions. Do not disseminate any copies without your advisor’s approval, and ensure that all details and errors have been carefully revised and corrected before your prospectus.</p>
<p>If any committee member cannot be present (because she or he may be on sabbatical, on vacation, ill, or overseas) you may be able to arrange their participation via telephone conference or webcam. Check with your advisor for inclusive technology options available in your department. Every committee member’s feedback during your prospectus presentation is important. Do not insult them, however, by reading directly from the materials you have disseminated to them. Synthesize your materials by preparing either a power point presentation or handouts. Speak amiably and in a modulated tone of voice. Welcome their feedback. You do not want to give the impression of being pedantic or closed to feedback—no matter how wedded you may be to your research topic.</p>
<p>Consider your prospectus presentation as an amicable meeting among colleagues who have gathered to find ways of making your ideas come to fruition through your dissertation. Let the committee know that you are interested in their feedback and keep your presentation simple (no longer than 30 min), then open up for discussion and questions; take notes and make eye contact with each person who speaks to you. If you do not hear someone or you do not understand someone, you may ask her to repeat or restate her point.</p>
<p>Appearance is important. Do not wear clothes inappropriate for your prospectus. Imagine it to be similar to an employment interview. Speak with your advisor to find out what may be appropriate. Once your committee approves your prospectus, it usually may not be changed. For this reason, ensure you spend enough time researching not only the best methodology but also germane questions about your chosen topic. This is the reason why a prospectus sort of precedes your CEs rather than follows them—although chronologically it is supposed to follow your comprehensives.</p>

<title>Writing Your Dissertation</title>
<sec id="section16-1066480711429265">
<title>As with comprehensives</title>
<p>Nothing happens as you write and complete your dissertation! A dissertation is not an impossible task! If you follow your prospectus outline, you will complete your dissertation. Writing a dissertation is, however, a rather enjoyable process. That is why the secret to crafting your dissertation is to plan your prospectus, or the blueprint of your dissertation. There is a sense of worth to be invested in writing one’s dissertation, gathering and interpreting its data, asking and answering questions as you look over your findings, as you reflect on the conclusions that follow from what you are studying. Writing a dissertation is indeed a transforming event!</p>
<p>There are, however, distractions and obstacles to be expected when writing your dissertation. For this reason, we recommend self-care: Do not forget to satisfy your needs and foment self-care, especially in times when struggles seem unbearable. You will need to remember you still have yourself and that you do not want to become a statistic that did not complete the work you set out to accomplish. Self-care is crucial in times of distress and anxiety to cope and to solve peripheral problems that otherwise may have the power to stop your work. For example, it is easy to forget to eat when you are reading, synthesizing primary sources, writing your literature review, analyzing data, and so on. When you do not eat, you are more likely to experience more anxiety and other negative emotions, including negative coping mechanisms.</p>
<p>Set a time line to complete your dissertation. Take time to recover from writer’s block by practicing self-care. This does not imply procrastination which takes over when writer’s block appears. The key is to be disciplined enough to take a break and to come back to where you left. Seeking editorial assistance may help you relax and regain your stamina. The point is not to forget about your work but to be refreshed enough to come back to it. Other distractions have to do with your lifestyle: whether it is an intimate relationship, childrearing, work, unfinished doctoral internship, your graduate assistantship, and so on. These issues require your creativity so that you can negotiate schedules, make pertinent arrangements, change expectations, or simply make decisions that will enable you to remain committed to your writing.</p>
<p>Perseverance is crucial to completing your dissertation. Make a plan to write at least two solid hours a day. In this way, you may complete each chapter within a 2-month period! Depending on your methodology, your number of chapters may vary. Check the current publication manual for American Psychological Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480711429265">APA, 2010</xref>). Unless you are attending a Liberal Arts institution or a private university, becoming familiar with the APA manual is important. If your institution prefers a different manual, ensure you own a copy. On line booksellers may provide you with the option to purchase a manual copy at an affordable price.</p>
<p>Your introduction usually states the relevance of your topic, the rationale for conducting your study, and any biases or limitations you foresee as a researcher. Make sure your statement of the problem and your purpose of study are cogent and straightforward. Avoid impersonal statements and the use of subjunctives or passive voice.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 usually reviews your topic’s germane literature. Avoid lengthy block quotations and run-on sentences. Remember the format style of the articles and books you read for your CEs in order to write a meaningful literature review (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066480711429265">Galvan, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1066480711429265">Pyrczak Publishing (n.d.)</xref> is one useful source for your writing process. This company has books relevant to quantitative and qualitative research methodologies. Also, make yourself familiar with professional writings so that your own style improves.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 usually reports your methodology. Keep it simple. It should reflect your prospectus. Do not deviate or add anything unless you and your advisor have agreed to change something that may directly affect your results. As you write Chapters 1 and 2, you should have obtained permission from your institution’s Human Subjects Committee to begin gathering your data. Data gathering can be lengthy and tedious. Make sure you start early and do not deviate from your methodology. Once you have gathered your data, you will commence to feel a sense of self-efficacy and accomplishment, because what follows, data analysis, is indeed a rewarding experience.</p>
<p>At times, students are compelled to seek for financial assistance to gather data, especially if your dissertation is truly a groundbreaking research project. In this instance, seek resources not only from your own institution and department (grants) but also from professional organizations that may be interested in your research. In which case, you may need your doctoral supervisor’s endorsement to seek assistance because some organizations only confer grants to doctors in a given discipline, but you are only a doctoral candidate which defeats the purpose of applying if you do not have the credentials you are seeking. Do not lose hope. Try every organization if you are in need of assistance.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 usually reports your findings; nothing else. You must remain ethical and understand what your data truly mean. Report only what you have discovered even if it is contrary to your original expectations. No research undertaking is perfect. Some erudites have faced similar limitations at their careers’ outset. Make sure you report any deviations from your methodology and the rationale for having done so.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 usually discusses your findings. Simplicity is more appreciated than the inverse, unless your investigation requires specific terminology to discuss your findings. In this case, providing a glossary of terms would be appropriate. Do not expect every member in your doctoral committee to be familiar with every word you write.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that your defense is the last step following your dissertation. Make sure that bound copies of your dissertation are disseminated to your committee members ahead of time. Your discussion’s limitations, implications for practice, and theoretical development within your counseling specialty should follow logically from your findings. Include directions for future research given the findings and limitations of your investigation. But you must remember that whatever you provide to your committee has to be first reviewed and approved by your doctoral supervisor. This is a process in which the two of you have worked together and it reflects not only on you.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section19-1066480711429265">
<title>Dissertation Defense</title>
<p>Sometimes it is difficult to get all committee members to find a specific time for your defense. Try to find a common meeting place and reserve it in advance—perhaps, a couple months while you obtain all your committee members’ availability. At times, finding a time for all to meet is a very difficult matter. It is your responsibility to find that time. You need to have quorum to successfully defend your dissertation. Provide your committee members with more than one option and work with them. Ensure you do not come across as demanding or imposing. You want to be seen as a team member who needs their approval to complete a doctorate of philosophy. However, it is okay to give a short rationale for the dates and meeting options you provide instead of just listing them and having individuals choose what works for them. At this stage, your committee members hopefully are not only familiar with the quality of your work, but because they know your potential as a future colleague, they may be more willing to work with you on your preferred dates and times for your defense.</p>
<p>Prepare a handout of your defense. Simply highlight the specific portions of your methodology, your findings, and their relevance according to your last chapter. List the limitations you encountered and the recommendations for future research that address such limitations in a logical manner.</p>
<p>Remember that your defense is not meant to be a defense. You must not appear pedantic or immobile regarding the comments you receive during your presentation of findings. Rather spend a limited amount of time (perhaps 20–30 min) explaining what you have discovered even if it is contrary to your original expectations and hypotheses. Then open up for questions and comments.</p>
<p>Take notes. Try to answer questions within the confines of your discoveries, but draw from your literature review in case an optional viewpoint has already been covered. Try not to dwell upon what is obvious. If you do not know the answer to a particular question say so, or ask that it be restated differently. If it still seems obscure to you, you may either defer to your chair for advice, or simply be humble enough and acknowledge you had not considered such viewpoint. It is possible that from the comments you receive, you may have to make revisions or additions to your dissertation. Work closely with your advisor in this endeavor. Only when you have completed and answered all questions from your defense and your committee signs your approval form, you can consider your dissertation to be almost completed. The last step comprises any corrections, or editions from your defense. Your dissertation is completed once you have turned it in to your graduate school dean or registrar and there are no corrections remaining.</p>

<sec id="section20-1066480711429265">
<title>Conclusion and Recommendation</title>
<p>Once you have obtained your doctorate of philosophy degree, your scholarly career commences. You have worked toward a life of research and docency in academia. Finding a faculty position is your aim—unless you wish to remain as a professional practitioner or university administrator.</p>
<p>Publishing in peer-reviewed journals augments your marketability in academia. Presentations you have made, topics germane to your dissertation, or your dissertation may all be publishable. Clinical observations, legal and ethical dilemmas, and other experiences during your doctoral internship, for example, may also become research topics for publication. Publications, teaching and clinical experiences, and licensures will help you build a curriculum vitae (CV). Your faculty’s CVs will show you how to build your own.</p>
<p>This discussion has addressed matters that surface during your doctoral studies. No article has done so thus far. Our intent was to briefly guide you to solve unknowns while completing your PhD requirements. By addressing topics about which no one speaks openly, we hope to demystify what may appear overwhelming. However, because of the scarcity of scholarship to promote counseling doctorates, we hope this discussion may engender interest among departmental chairs in CES programs to support and better prepare doctoral students achieve candidacy and complete their dissertations. The inverse is not an ethical option.</p>
<p>As we enter the second decade of the 21st century, counseling remains conflated with the guidance movement; and, in our culture, counseling is still equivocal to advice to solve problems. As the new century began, an emphasis on evidence-based practices has turned school counselors as ancillaries to improve primary education. As a consequence, “teaching to the test” and preventing misconduct seems more important than fomenting children’s reasoning and reflective skills critical to develop abstract thought and cognitive and emotional maturation. A similar scenario has entered higher education. Students wish to learn what is minimally expected to receive degrees and to get “jobs.” In consequence, the transforming power of learning and education remain at peril.</p>
<p>Our society has not recognized that counseling has been intrinsic to our country’s historicity and has provided services to the needs of individual and systemic clienteles. Taking from other professions, counseling has become its own profession capable of servicing many other facets that comprise what it means to be human, and not living in a vacuum.</p>
<p>Many variables intrinsic to America have changed. Counseling has changed with America. In fact, other areas of specialty are gaining recognition for the services they provide to the populations they serve. For example, given the rising unemployment rates in the country, community and career counseling will be foremost among specialty areas in the coming years. By the same token, because individuals live in families, the systemic needs of individuals, couples (not simply heterosexual), and families (no longer nuclear in make up) are bound to have resonance in the national spectrum. War veterans’ needs also demand rapid attention. Hence, there is no argument to discredit any professional counselor from doing the work of another regardless of different specialties.</p>
<p>Counseling has struggled to be seen as a profession in its own right, but much work is left to accomplish this goal. Crucial to the continuous development of counseling, is counselor education and supervision—PhDs in CES educate future counselors. Without new stamina and new scholars, there cannot be any anticipated progress for the field of counseling. (Truly, some scholars opine that counseling is ancillary to other professions, whereas others propose it is its own profession. The fact is that counseling has contributed to the historical development of America.)</p>
<p>When commencing a PhD program, students are usually enthusiastic, but their attitudes change due to myths they encounter along their programs of study. We hope that our brief guide may not only serve to demystify programmatic areas toward completing doctorates, but that, relative to our remarks on the importance of our profession, it may encourage students to complete their studies to educate future counselors—who in turn will advocate for their clienteles’ well-being and promote the common good of our society.</p>
