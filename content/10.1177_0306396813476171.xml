<abstract>
<p>Current literature sees expressions of popular racism in twentieth-century European state-socialist societies either as directly deriving from the official ideology of the state or else as happening despite it. This article argues that the ways in which Vietnamese workers were racialised in 1980s Czechoslovakia were neither directly derived from the state’s official ideology, nor did they arise in opposition to that ideology. Instead, it suggests that they are more usefully seen as <italic>reworkings</italic> of certain elements of the state’s official ideology. Most important among those elements were: the insistence that racism did not exist in Czechoslovakia; the centrality of ‘honest socialist work’; and the conception of the overseas foreign workers programme as a socialist civilising mission of sorts. In most cases, some or all of these notions worked in tandem, and, moreover, also built upon existing discourses in regard to the Roma.</p>

<p>In the mid-2000s, the following – politically incorrect – joke could be heard in the Czech Republic. It is surely still around; only the names of the protagonists have changed with election cycles:<disp-quote>
<p>Presidents Bush, Putin and Klaus are together on an airplane, returning from a summit. The plane experiences technical problems and crashes in the middle of the ocean, falling on an island inhabited by a tribe of cannibals. The cannibals immediately surround the three presidents, ready to attack them. President Bush says: ‘You can’t eat me, I am George Bush, the president of the United States, the most powerful country on earth.’ The tribal chief retorts: ‘I don’t care’, and orders the tribesmen: ‘Take him and slow-cook him with sour cream.’ Then it’s Putin’s turn: ‘You can’t eat me, I am Vladimir Putin, the ruler of Russia, the second most powerful country on earth.’ The chief replies again: ‘I don’t care, take him and make goulash out of him.’ Finally, it’s Klaus’s turn: ‘I am Václav Klaus, the president of the Czech Republic …’ The chief interrupts him excitedly and exclaims: ‘The Czech Republic! That’s where I got my degree! What would you like to eat? Slow cooked meat on sour cream or goulash?’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As do many jokes of such nature, it can point us towards some tentative insights about how the Czechs see themselves and their place in the globalised world. Not the least important of these insights would have something to do with racism – what, a <italic>cannibal</italic> chief who holds a (possibly higher-education) degree? The structure of the joke creates a narrative arc across time and links Czechs’ current lives with the state-socialist era, because that is the time to which the punch-line delivered by the ‘cannibal chief’ refers; specifically, the late 1960s through to the late 1980s, when Czechoslovakia – as an economically developed, advanced state-socialist society – provided citizens from poorer socialist (or socialist-leaning) countries with higher education, vocational school training, on-the-job training and factory work. The fact that the joke remains in circulation, even among young people who were not born when the programmes were in existence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306396813476171">1</xref></sup> indicates that the memory of these programmes occupies a fairly solid place in Czechs’ understanding of recent history.</p>
<p>In the world constructed by the joke, the foreigners that came to be educated are portrayed as savages, yet they are also assumed to have digested, quite literally, some core traits of Czech everyday life (if not Czech high culture, as their savage nature persists). The dishes in which the potentates are to be cooked are staples of Czech cuisine: meat with sour cream sauce (<italic>svíčková</italic>) and goulash (which, though not of local provenance exactly, has been thoroughly domesticated). The Czech president owes his luck to the fact that the ‘chief’ fondly remembers the internationalist aid provided to him more than twenty years ago by state-socialist Czechoslovakia. In the story, no explicit racial terminology is used, but there could hardly be a stronger marker of civilisational deficit than cannibalism; education occupies a central role in the story, but the persistence of cannibalism casts some doubt on the ultimate educability of the ‘savage’; and finally, the ‘savage’ is unequivocally grateful for the experience. All of these traits are suggestive of typical racialising discourses, and although the omission of an explicit racial descriptor is noteworthy, it is not entirely unique.</p>
<p>My subject here is the racialisation of Vietnamese workers in 1980s Czechoslovakia. What makes this case interesting is that, while in most scholarly accounts the emergence and practice of racism are fairly tightly bound with (a history of) colonial exploits, Czechoslovakia utterly lacked any first-hand colonial experience and, furthermore, globally, the ‘racial status’ of its citizens could be described as ‘borderline’ or ‘off-white’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306396813476171">2</xref></sup> (The origins of this status can be traced back to the Enlightenment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306396813476171">3</xref></sup> but the status became, if anything, only more entrenched during the cold war.) In addition, the country’s political leadership explicitly rejected racism; indeed, the workers and apprentice-workers programme was supposed to exemplify socialist internationalism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306396813476171">4</xref></sup> in practice, as its goal was to help bring about a global Communist society through the building of socialism in individual countries, for which industrial advancement was seen as crucial.</p>
<p>Given this context, how did racialised images of Vietnamese (and other foreign) workers come into being? If racialisation is always determined by economic and political forces, if politics and ideology play a crucial role in the shifting meanings of race, as Omi and Winant argue in their classic work,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306396813476171">5</xref></sup> what was it about the way in which the state-socialist government – which disavowed racism – framed the programme that made the racialisation of foreign workers possible? Or, to put it in another way, how did official state-socialist ideology, as relevant to the foreign workers programme, contribute to the racialisation of Vietnamese workers (and other foreign labourers, particularly Cuban) in Czechoslovakia in the 1980s? To begin to answer these questions, it is first necessary to look at the existing scholarship on race in state socialism.</p>
<sec id="section1-0306396813476171">
<title>Scholarship on state socialism and race</title>
<p>The spring 2002 issue of the <italic>Slavic Review</italic> carried a series of articles in which the contention articulated in the lead article by Eric Weitz was subjected to a lively debate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306396813476171">6</xref></sup> Weitz argued that the Soviet state, especially between 1937 and 1953, practised racial politics despite the fact that it had ‘explicitly and loudly rejected the ideology of race’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306396813476171">7</xref></sup> His argument rested on the assertion that certain groups ‘targeted as enemies of socialism became “racialized” in the sense that their suspect characteristics were seen to inhere in each and every member of the group bar none and were transmitted across generations’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306396813476171">8</xref></sup> In their rejoinders, critics convincingly disputed both of Weitz’s contentions. They showed that the Soviet state did, in fact, have a concept of race, but that that concept did not underwrite the state’s policies of discrimination and exclusion, ruthless as they may have been.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306396813476171">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>While the <italic>Slavic Review</italic> debate focused on groups internal to the Soviet state, the official authorities and the citizens of the Soviet Union, as well as those of Czechoslovakia and many other European state-socialist countries, also came into contact with groups of external (non-citizen) ‘others’. These were the groups of, first, foreign students, and, later on, foreign workers, arriving primarily from various African and Asian (but also some Latin American) countries. According to Woodford McClellan, although the ‘Soviet leadership unequivocally condemned racism and racial discrimination … lower-level officials … often perpetuated stereotypes and prejudices’, and hence, Africans and black Americans attending the Comintern schools in the Soviet Union in the mid-1920s and mid-1930s, were ‘stunned and disillusioned’ by the racism they experienced ‘precisely because it so blatantly contradicted the new regime’s official posture’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306396813476171">10</xref></sup> Julie Hessler’s investigation of the position of African students in the mid-1960s Soviet Union also notes numerous incidents involving ‘intimidation and harassment, such as an alleged episode on the Moscow subway in which [African] students were accosted by a couple of drunken Russians, who demanded that they give up their seats: “In your own country you aren’t even allowed to be in the same subway car as whites, whereas here you are sitting down while white people stand.”’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306396813476171">11</xref></sup> Hessler does not comment on the fact that the <italic>form</italic> in which the invective was delivered evoked <italic>American</italic> racist practices (as imagined by the two Russian drunkards) although, as I argue below, this displacement constitutes a key feature of racist discourse in state socialism. Hessler also observed that the typical way of handling racist complaints in the Soviet Union ‘avoided an outright denial of the problem, but minimized its significance by presenting racism as purely incidental, a product of criminal, pre-socialist attitudes and behaviour’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306396813476171">12</xref></sup> and, at least in some cases, the affected students accepted the officials’ argument that ‘racism was an <italic>unofficial</italic> aspect of Soviet life’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306396813476171">13</xref></sup> Allison Blakely, writing in 1986, reached a similar conclusion; he argued that ‘such racism as it exists in the Soviet Union is of the individual, rather than systematic, variety’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306396813476171">14</xref></sup> Charles Quist-Adade’s examination of Soviet media and textbook coverage of Africa pointed out the exotic and paternalist depictions of the continent; in these depictions, the Soviets ‘infused with “communist compassion” and fired by the ideas of a Soviet civilising mission [rescued] a helpless black victim’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306396813476171">15</xref></sup> He also argued that this ‘white man’s burden’ narrative started to turn into a more explicit and aggressive form of racism during the <italic>perestroika</italic> of the late 1980s when, for instance, a ‘member of the Russian parliament complained … that the former communist leadership “wasted precious Soviet resources on peoples who have only begun to call themselves a people, who have just descended from the palm trees, and have only managed to pronounce the word ‘socialism’”’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306396813476171">16</xref></sup> Maxim Matusevich, too, detected a certain ‘condescension’ among Soviets towards Africans, which adverse economic conditions sometimes pushed to ‘outright hostility’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306396813476171">17</xref></sup> In sum, these works suggest, even if with some caveats, that although popular racism against foreign students existed in the Soviet Union, it did so, for the most part, in spite of state officials’ efforts to the contrary.</p>
<p>In contrast to the articles discussed above, Jonathan Zatlin focuses on foreign workers, primarily Vietnamese and Mozambican, in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), and his conceptual argument also differs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306396813476171">18</xref></sup> Zatlin argues that the GDR government assumed an ‘imperialist posture’ and that ‘Marxist-Leninist practice revealed itself to be every bit as rapacious as its capitalist competitors. Rather than displaying solidarity with their socialist allies, the East German authorities sought to exploit the asymmetries of power inherent in these relationships for economic gain’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306396813476171">19</xref></sup> Zatlin then argues, in a stark contrast to the literature on foreign students in the Soviet Union, that it was precisely the ‘socialist state’s naked exploitation and outright abuse of non-Europeans [that] facilitated popular racism’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306396813476171">20</xref></sup> Thus, in his account, the commitment to socialist internationalism was no more than a fig leaf used by the GDR government to exploit foreign workers, which, moreover, fuelled popular racism.</p>
<p>It might be that the reason for the differences between the arguments presented earlier and Zatlin’s is that the Soviet and the East German states differed in their approaches. It is, however, perhaps more likely that the state-socialist states treated foreign students and foreign workers differently. It is clear, for instance, that their material conditions differed. One difference was the fact that foreign workers not only made money but, as a rule, also saved large amounts of their earnings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306396813476171">21</xref></sup> which they then used, especially at the end of their stay, to purchase goods to take back home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306396813476171">22</xref></sup> In the conditions of the command economy, in which shortages of certain goods would occur every so often, this frequently led to resentment on the part of East German customers, who felt that the Vietnamese or other foreign workers were ‘buying up’ the goods to which East Germans should have priority access. My own research confirms that Czechoslovak customers gave in to similar resentments.</p>
<p>Taken together, these works provide us with some valuable insights into the racialisation of foreigners in some state-socialist regimes. However, although they do not quite suggest that the practices of popular racialisation existed independently of, if not in contradiction to, the official ideology, they do not specify how an explicitly anti-racist official ideology became translated into, or perhaps refracted in, popular stances that trafficked in racialised images and attitudes.</p>

<title>The Czechoslovak-Vietnamese workers’ programme, 1967–1989</title>
<p>The programme’s beginnings go back to 1967, when the Vietnamese and Czechoslovak governments agreed that 2,100 Vietnamese citizens, classified as ‘trainees’ (<italic>praktikanti</italic>), should be trained under a programme which was to last between three and five years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306396813476171">23</xref></sup> The group included both engineers and experienced blue-collar workers who worked closely with Czechs and Slovaks in factories to develop specific skills that had been identified as important for the Vietnamese national economy by the Vietnamese government.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306396813476171">24</xref></sup> In the treaty, the Czechoslovak state agreed to cover all the expenses connected with the programme, except for the cost of transportation from Vietnam to Czechoslovakia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306396813476171">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the last of the trainees were finishing their stay in the early 1970s, the Vietnamese government approached its Czechoslovak counterpart again with a request for an expansion of the programme. The result was a treaty signed on 8 April 1974 under which more than 5,000 Vietnamese citizens arrived in Czechoslovakia during the 1970s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306396813476171">26</xref></sup> They spent the first two and a half to three and a half years as apprentices in Czechoslovak vocational schools, and then another two years as qualified labourers working, as a rule, for the companies that sponsored the vocational schools where they earned their certificates. Since it was the Czechoslovak state (along with the companies, which were state-owned) that paid for everything from their vocational training to healthcare, and even an initial gift of clothing, throughout this period (1967 until 1980), Czechoslovakia was, in accounting terms, ‘in the red’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306396813476171">27</xref></sup> In their reports, Labour Ministry clerks estimated that Czechoslovakia ‘recovered’, through the factory work of Vietnamese vocational schools’ graduates, about two-thirds of the financial resources it put in. In these earlier phases, the Czechoslovak leadership conceptualised the programme squarely as one of internationalist help. This conceptualisation exerted a powerful influence on the actions of Czechoslovak officials, as is evident from the instances when the Vietnamese presented requests that were difficult for the Czechoslovaks to fulfil due to logistical constraints (chiefly, scarcity of housing but also other logistical issues). In such cases, Czechoslovak officials stressed that the requests stemmed from an ‘urgent need to build and develop [Vietnam’s] national economy, and hence it is not possible to refuse [them]’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306396813476171">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>In November 1980, however, the two countries signed a new treaty, which changed the balance substantially. This treaty inaugurated a qualitatively new phase of the programme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306396813476171">29</xref></sup> While the tens of thousands of Vietnamese citizens who came to Czechoslovakia throughout the 1980s still received a donation of clothing, free (tax-supported) healthcare (just like Czechoslovak citizens), an initial stipend, as well as a state payment to Vietnam of a modest annual fee per worker, language training was shortened to a mere three months, and skills- specific training was to happen exclusively on the job. In other words, under this latest treaty, Vietnam supplied Czechoslovakia with a tax-paying workforce that did not cost the ‘host’ country much. Moreover, while in the preceding two phases, it was the Vietnamese government that, based on its needs, largely determined the industrial areas to which the trainees and apprentice-workers were assigned, in the third phase of the programme, the needs of the Czechoslovak economy took precedence.</p>

<title>Race is elsewhere</title>
<p>To see how official state ideology affected the popular racialisation of Vietnamese workers, it is necessary to sketch out, at least briefly, how race, race relations and racism were discussed in public discourse. In late state-socialist Czechoslovakia, race as an explicit topic of discussion appeared, as far as the general public was concerned, for the most part only in newspapers and biology textbooks. Biology textbooks treated race and racism in a highly uniform and abstract fashion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306396813476171">30</xref></sup> They started by positing that there are three main races (referred to usually as ‘breeds’, <italic>plemena</italic>) – white, yellow and black. These were always (in both elementary and high school textbooks, and in all editions) enumerated in this exact order.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306396813476171">31</xref></sup> This statement was then followed by some variation on the emphatic declaration that ‘members of all breeds that exist today are of the same origin, absolutely equal, and have the same potential for biological and cultural development’. This idea was made even more explicit in the coda, according to which ‘it is absolutely wrong to assert that human races are not equal – that contention lies at the basis of racism’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306396813476171">32</xref></sup> The last few lines were usually devoted to examples of such racisms in practice, using one or more examples of the following: German Nazism, the treatment of African Americans in the United States, and South African Apartheid.</p>
<p>This insistence that, to paraphrase Milan Kundera, race, and especially racism, was always elsewhere was exemplified in the print media. In a way, the stories appearing in newspapers could be read as just the latest examples of the thesis put forth in biology textbooks. One example, typical of many, was an article titled ‘Condemnation of racism’ published in the main Czechoslovak Communist daily, <italic>Rudé právo</italic>, in February 1982, in which the Republic of South Africa was discussed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306396813476171">33</xref></sup> It contained a mention of the United States as well, noting that ‘the American stance towards South African Apartheid is also a result of a thoroughgoing racism and racial discrimination as they exist in the United States’. Later on in the article, the ‘South African racists’ were accused of making use of ‘Hitler-style’ methods. So, in this case, it actually managed to fit in all three textbook cases into a single piece of journalism.</p>
<p>The following excerpt from a secret police report written in 1981 shows how the public at large – in this case, the inhabitants of a new housing development – incorporated this racism-is-elsewhere thesis into their own discourse about foreign workers, in this case Cubans:<disp-quote>
<p>Inadequate facilities in the housing development, such as shortages of roads, stores, and so forth, only increase the dissatisfaction with the institutions of the local government. In this group of dissatisfied residents, some have voiced the opinion that not addressing problems at the housing development, conjoined with the disturbances caused by the Cubans, might result in local elections not unfolding well. Recently, the situation has escalated to such an extent that groups of young people are saying that if the coloureds behave everywhere the way the Cubans do in [the town of] Blatná, then they are not surprised that there is racism in the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306396813476171">34</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As this report shows, the residents – who implicitly (they threaten to <italic>become</italic> racist) describe themselves as not racist – used the racism-is-elsewhere element of the state’s ideology in order to express an unabashedly racist stance. Besides being racist, the statement was also tactical. It can be interpreted as an attempt to use the foreign workers, or their putative ‘disorderly’ conduct, as a bargaining chip, a means to hold the state-socialist government – which sponsored foreign workers – to account for the pledges regarding living standards it had made to local people. In this regard, the reference to the local elections is crucial. By referring to them, the residents go beyond merely voicing dissatisfaction: they issue the state with an implicit threat, in fact, two. The first, and more obvious, is to disrupt the local elections. This would have been a potent threat since, as recent literature (in contrast to totalitarian theories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306396813476171">35</xref></sup>) argues, there is much evidence that the party-state needed at least some degree of legitimacy, leading to extensive negotiations between party elites and various groups of citizens in state-socialist countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306396813476171">36</xref></sup> However, through their complaints, the residents articulated another threat: by warning they might openly profess allegiance to racist attitudes, unless the state deliver on its promises, they threatened to challenge the state’s ideological definition of the country as one in which racism had no place. Thus, through these two threats, the residents challenged the competence of the state on two counts: as ultimate manager of economic allocations, and as the supreme ideologue. They were able to do this because, since official ideology posited that there was no racism in Czechoslovakia, the housing estate residents could present themselves as non-racist to begin with, and then use the threat of becoming racist to bargain with the state authorities.</p>

<title>‘Honest work’ and race</title>
<p>To get a sense of Czechoslovakia’s state-socialist racial politics in practice, one needs to look at the treatment of the Roma, the only group that sometimes figured in the passages devoted to race in biology textbooks. Even though in the late 1920s (still the pre-socialist era) some anthropologists and criminologists in Czechoslovakia started to ‘[emphasise] the “racial” or “biological” factors that allegedly influence the Gypsy character’, nonetheless, ‘the definition of the Gypsy remained suspended between ethnic and sociological criteria’, according to Celia Donert.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306396813476171">37</xref></sup> The Roma were seen by the Czechoslovak state as ‘a problem, indeed an obstacle to progress’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306396813476171">38</xref></sup> that is, to progress in the building of socialism, and the point of state interventions was precisely to undo the Roma’s ‘backwardness’. The meticulous study by Vera Sokolova makes it clear that, among other things, one important feature that characterised state-socialist Czechoslovakia’s approach to the Roma was its steadfast insistence on their ability to change, to leave behind behaviours that ‘ran against the idea of the modern state’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306396813476171">39</xref></sup> and to become proper socialist citizens. This belief was lodged so deeply in the core of the state’s policies that, if census commissioners or other authorities assessed particular Roma households (originally classified as Roma by the very same authorities) as having left behind their old ways of life and having adopted living ‘conditions considered “normal” enough to pass as “Czech” or “Slovak”’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306396813476171">40</xref></sup> they were no longer considered Roma. As a result, the numbers of Roma residents in state statistics constantly fluctuated, not because of changes in birth or death rates but because of these re-classifications.</p>
<p>This practice suggests an idea of race that is rather fluid and very different from the way the concept of race is used in current scholarship, where it is defined as a ‘symbolic category … that is misrecognized as a <italic>natural</italic> category’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306396813476171">41</xref></sup> and racism as the ‘dogma that one ethnic group is condemned by nature to congenital inferiority and another group to congenital superiority’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306396813476171">42</xref></sup> For, if anything, the efforts of the Czechoslovak state – even when misguided – were intended to undermine the idea of naturalness of race in as thoroughgoing a way as possible.</p>
<p>What is crucial to note here is the centrality of labour, specifically ‘honest socialist work’, as it was then often termed, to these efforts by state officials to ‘erase’ race. The role that ‘honest work’ played in this process can be exemplified by the fact that before the (pre-socialist) law on the registration of nomadic persons was rescinded in the 1950s, individuals could petition for an exemption from the obligation of being registered as a nomadic Gypsy if they were able to prove that they lived ‘by the honest labour of [their] own hands’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306396813476171">43</xref></sup> It is clear that this approach was perfectly in line with the Marxist understanding of race, and so it could be argued that its implementation was unsurprising. But given that one of the most frequent criticisms of the state-socialist state is that it did not put its money where its mouth was, so to speak, it is essential to note the centrality of this understanding of race to actual policies. What is more, this idea was not only a vital element of the state’s ideology, but also became another of the features of official discourse (along with the race-is-elsewhere element) that was accepted by the public at large and then reworked into one of the key tools used in the articulation of the relationship to foreign workers.</p>
<p>References to ‘honest socialist work’ in relation to foreign workers are frequently found in archival documents, particularly in accounts of conflict situations. For instance, a man testifying to the police about a brawl in a beer pub is quoted as saying that the Vietnamese sitting at a neighbouring table were loud, and that he [the Czech man] and his companions ‘were critical of them, and we were saying that they should return back to Vietnam; they don’t work anyway and money is paid to them unnecessarily’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306396813476171">44</xref></sup> There are similar formulations in the reports of undercover officers who were tasked with monitoring the reactions of Czech citizens to a police intervention against Vietnamese workers on strike for increased wages. The genuineness of the vernacular used in the reports suggests that the officers faithfully set down what they had heard, or overheard, thus making the statements in the reports into a sort of ‘anthropological notes from the field’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306396813476171">45</xref></sup> Thus, one such report said:<disp-quote>
<p>The intervention [against the strike] was positively evaluated by the [Czech] workers; their opinion is that our people would not dare do such a thing, and [the Vietnamese] instead of appreciating that they were given work, even refuse to work. [The source] said that people were saying that [the Vietnamese] should be driven back where they came from on foot (<italic>že by je bylo třeba hnát pěšky odkud přišli</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306396813476171">46</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another report noted that ‘the opinions out there are that Vietnamese citizens do not appreciate what our state has done for them, and if they do not want to work, then the time has come to show them that, although we are good, we are not simply going to sit and let people do whatever they please’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306396813476171">47</xref></sup> A third report echoes the previous two:<disp-quote>
<p>[Railway workers chatting about the event] stated that the police finally decided to put things in order, [which was justified since] they didn’t want to work, which affected other workers [in the company] … they stated that [the Vietnamese] are paid for work that they did not do, and so forth … In [a bistro], I overheard a conversation among four men on the topic. One of them was saying that at least now [the Vietnamese] would stop being a bother, and there would be no more trouble, and that [the Vietnamese] thought that they could do whatever they pleased in our country and now they see that that is not how it works, that they must behave themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306396813476171">48</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In all of these statements, the speakers expressed their hostility to the Vietnamese workers through criticism of the alleged shortcomings in their work ethic. The speakers anchored their arguments in the state’s official position on ‘honest socialist labour’ but reworked it in a particular way. The official stance imbued ‘honest socialist labour’ with the power to fundamentally change a person’s quasi-racial status, as we saw in the case of the Roma. In the case of the Vietnamese workers, this stance is reworked in popular discourse so as to be used in reverse: if ‘honest socialist labour’ is a mechanism that uplifts, then any alleged deficiency of it warrants – in this popular refraction of the official ideological discourse – degradation. And, in a further refraction, the degradation is applied not on an individual basis (the way the changes in the status of the Roma households were implemented according to state policy), but indiscriminately, to the entire group. To do that, the Czech speakers carved out for themselves the identity of model socialist citizens, who appreciate both the opportunity for, and the value of, ‘honest work’. Using this identity, they would then portray the foreign workers as wilfully violating socialist precepts, thus allowing themselves to express hostility against foreign workers without fearing official reprisals, since, technically, they were echoing the state’s ideology.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect of the reworking of official ideology is that, at first glance, it appears identical to the calls of native workers in capitalist economies directed against their foreign migrant worker counterparts. However, in the capitalist context, the defensive rationale behind the call is the fear of the foreigners being <italic>too good</italic> – too efficient, too cheap – as workers; whereas in the state-socialist context the defensive rationale rests on precisely the opposite: the foreigners are accused of <italic>not being good enough</italic> workers. This is directly related to the specific functioning of the state-socialist economy, in which the ability to find and keep a job was defined as a right (and an obligation), hence the fear of foreigners as ‘those who steal the jobs that rightfully belong to us’ was for the most part non-existent. Instead, the adage could be reformulated as: a fear of foreigners as ‘those who pre-empt us from acquiring the goods that should be rightfully ours’, as Zatlin also found.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306396813476171">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Allegations of a defective work ethic functioned as a discursive strategy used by the public at large, regardless of the actual situation. One of my informants, who became friends with a Czech foreman managing a group of Vietnamese workers, said: ‘The public used to say that they were lazy but that was not true at all, they were not lazy … the foreman said: “No, they are not lazy at all, I don’t know why people are saying that.”’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0306396813476171">50</xref></sup> The existence of this particular discursive strategy can be explained by the fact that partaking in the ideological discourse centred on labour and ‘honest work’ allowed people to express racially tinged hostility to foreign workers without incurring sanctions from the authorities, as, on the surface, such statements essentially endorsed the official stance.</p>
<p>One more dimension appears in the ways in which the official ideology of labour was refracted among the public at large: the theme of gratitude, or lack of it, for all that the Czechoslovak state had done for the foreign workers, not the least of which was giving them jobs. Their alleged failure to demonstrate such gratitude was used in tandem with the allegation that they failed to work properly, in racially tinged castigations of foreign workers.</p>

<title>Gratitude and the state-socialist <italic>mission civilisatrice</italic></title>
<p>While the public did not have access to internal ministerial documents or details of the treaties, the notion of the Czechoslovak state ‘spending money’ on foreign workers was firmly lodged in the collective consciousness. This notion persisted even throughout the 1980s, when the Czechoslovak economy largely benefited from the exchange. We can see this notion at work in a letter sent by an angry citizen to a Labour Ministry department responsible for the programme’s administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0306396813476171">51</xref></sup> In a long (almost eight handwritten pages) letter, written on 17 October 1988, a woman living in a house adjacent to a hostel housing Vietnamese and Cuban workers complained:<disp-quote>
<p>We are amazed at how much money our state spends on foreign ‘workers’. And why? If they behaved with at least a modicum of decency toward us, if they observed our laws, if they made up with their work at least a part of the resources that our state expands on them … they send home big boxes filled with goods for the purchases of which they could not have possibly earned enough money through honest work … And all the while, our women … are working their guts out in bad working conditions, and on top of that they must stand in lines for various goods, which should be routinely available [but are not], and in addition they raise children, who are for a large part of the day thrown back out on the street since only first- and second-graders are able to attend the after-school care programme as there is no money for expanding the space or for paying additional instructors. Would it not be better to send all these ineducable [<italic>nevychovatelné</italic>] immigrants home, and use the saved resources to create conditions for a better education of our children? … Our children suffer because of the insufficient time the family and school devote to them – if mothers were not overburdened with work and the need to chase after [scarce] goods, and if schools could have enough teachers [disjointed syntax in the original].<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0306396813476171">52</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the letter, the woman brings up once again the allegation that foreign workers fail to work honestly. But to this, she adds another supposition: that their participation in the Czechoslovak economy was purely a favour extended by the Czechoslovak government to its Vietnamese counterpart – rather than something that benefited Czechoslovakia economically (as well) – for which the foreign workers should be grateful. As my earlier brief sketch of the history of the programme makes clear, her supposition was factually wrong, but it was no less strongly present in popular consciousness for all that: we can find reports of it even in contemporary ethnographic accounts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0306396813476171">53</xref></sup> This supposition fed on the way the state-controlled media talked about Vietnam and about the workers’ and apprentices’ programme. Media coverage thematised dire economic conditions in Vietnam,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306396813476171">54</xref></sup> and steadfastly talked about the programme as an instance of ‘brotherly help’, even when referring to the guest worker-like phase. Moreover, many people were aware that the Vietnamese received a donation of clothing and personal items on arrival – in part because sometimes (though not always) companies purchased the garments in bulk. As a result of this, some groups of Vietnamese workers appeared to be wearing a sort of ‘uniform’. The donation dramatised for Czechs and Slovaks in a vivid and concrete way the hierarchical relationship between the two countries.</p>
<p>In the media, an important element of this hierarchical conceptualisation was a pronounced tendency to patronise, as illustrated by a short ‘human interest’ story that appeared in the <italic>Rudé právo</italic> daily in 1985. The journalist’s emotionally tinged language evokes an image of a clearly paternalistic relationship. In the story, a Czech female worker in charge of training Vietnamese apprentice-workers in a textile factory is described as interacting with one of the Vietnamese women (most of whom were 24 years old) in the following way: ‘Marie Šimánková runs her hand over a roll of cloth, looking for a mistake. There is none. She strokes the girl’s hair, smiles and praises her for work well done. Then she takes a closer look at the tender face of the Vietnamese girl and adjusts her hairdo a bit to make her even prettier.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0306396813476171">55</xref></sup> While the article intended to portray the Vietnamese workers in an unmistakably positive light, it was also exceedingly patronising. The reference to the woman in her mid-20s as a ‘girl’ might perhaps be explained by contemporary vernacular. Nonetheless, this practice – and other widespread linguistic strategies that portrayed the Vietnamese as young, even children<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0306396813476171">56</xref></sup> – both reflected existing condescending images of Vietnamese workers, and contributed to consolidating them even further. While many such condescending practices were subtle, the practice of using the word <italic>ty</italic> to address Vietnamese workers in public was not. <italic>Ty</italic>, which is one of the two Czech equivalents of the English ‘you’, is normally reserved only for children, friends or family, and never used in polite speech for addressing adults in public (for which the more polite <italic>vy</italic> form is used). Nonetheless, <italic>ty</italic> was the pronoun routinely used to address Vietnamese. Shockingly, the practice is still alive and well in the Czech Republic today, and as such can be seen building upon the patronising stances developed in the state-socialist era.</p>
<p>That this patronising stance was not lost on Czechoslovak citizens is evident also in cases when they went out of their way to show goodwill towards Vietnamese workers and treat them as well as possible (often in a conscious effort to countervail the animosity of their compatriots). One of my interviewees told me of her motivation to help the Vietnamese while everyone around her seemed to try to avoid any contact with them and trafficked in the coarsest of racist prejudices and rumours (such as that after a dentist pulled a tooth of a Vietnamese worker the hole was crawling with worms). She described it in the following way: ‘I felt terribly sorry for them, I kept telling myself: “It is not these people’s [Vietnamese] fault”, they came here so that they would become somehow … I don’t know how to put it … so that they would become civilised [<italic>zcivilizovali se</italic>] here.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0306396813476171">57</xref></sup> And again later in the interview: ‘… because I felt sorry for them, and I told myself that another country would get civilised if we … I don’t know, I simply felt that the whole world should be doing well’. This notion of the need to ‘civilise’ Vietnamese workers came up also in an interview with a man who was in charge of a group of Vietnamese workers in a mining company. He told me that the company decided to remove gas stoves from the apartments in which it planned to house the workers (and replace them with small electric plates) since ‘we did not know whether … how well they could operate gas stoves’. When I asked him whether he or anyone in the company had heard about any accident happening to Vietnamese workers in some other place, to do with gas stoves, he said that no, the measure was ‘preventative’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306396813476171">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>These examples show that in public discourse, the programme was to an important extent conceptualised as a socialist <italic>mission civilisatrice</italic>, for which, as the letter cited above and the invectives against foreign workers quoted in police reports show, foreign workers were expected to show gratitude through their honest work. Their perceived or alleged lack of gratitude served to rationalise hostility to them. Education, both in the narrow and the wider sense, was at the heart of this civilising mission so it is noteworthy that the writer of the angry letter labels foreign workers as ‘ineducable’. The root of the Czech word she used (<italic>nevychovatelný</italic>) is ‘<italic>výchova</italic>’, which connotes education in a wider sense: it can refer to the accumulation of knowledge, but it refers even more strongly to a holistic notion of ‘upbringing’ and conjures up associations with ‘good manners’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0306396813476171">59</xref></sup> By labelling the foreign workers <italic>nevychovatelný</italic>, the letter writer attacks not just the foreign workers themselves, but also assesses the entire ‘civilising mission’ as hopeless and thus she attacks the key ideological rationale for the programme, which was to produce workers who were both technically qualified and good socialist citizens.</p>
<p>Finally, just like the residents of the housing estate, from whom we heard earlier, this woman, too, used her complaint against the foreign workers to remind the authorities of the promises the state-socialist state made to its citizens in regard to their welfare. Thus, to the extent that the expressions of hostility against foreign workers were tactical, they were used by Czechoslovak citizens as a means of holding state officials accountable for their promise to deliver satisfactory living standards in exchange for citizens’ support (or at least abstention from subversion) of the regime.</p>

<title>Triangulation and ‘normalcy’: Vietnamese, Cubans, Roma</title>
<p>Interestingly, whereas Czechoslovak citizens who were not in close contact with foreign workers racialised them as ungrateful loafers, those who worked alongside them in factories, or were in charge of them, racialised them in precisely the opposite way: as almost fabulously diligent, docile, and disciplined factory workers. A former Labour Ministry clerk emphasised: ‘the Vietnamese, they are hardworking’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306396813476171">60</xref></sup> A former HR manager in one of the largest Czechoslovak industrial conglomerates of the period echoed the sentiment: ‘The Vietnamese, they had a more pronounced tendency to apply themselves at work … the first groups were absolutely ideal.’ And: ‘The Vietnamese, they work relentlessly, they are very diligent.’ And again later on in the interview: ‘The Vietnamese, more so than the Cubans, the Vietnamese were better liked [by Czechs], they were more industrious and kind of more disciplined and calmer.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0306396813476171">61</xref></sup> An official report from 1981 (written for the perusal of the head secretary of a Communist party regional branch) echoes these personal reminiscences:<disp-quote>
<p>Currently, there are 20 [female] Vietnamese nationals working in the plant 01 Horní Staré Město and plant 06 Poříčí. There are talks under way with the Vietnamese Embassy about the placement of another 40 workers once they complete the language course. The management of [the spinning mill company] notes that the Vietnamese workers’ work morale is incomparably better than the morale of the [female] workers from Cuba.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0306396813476171">62</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One striking aspect of these accounts is the strong relational component in the images of the Vietnamese presented by their Czech supervisors: the comparisons and contrasts with Cuban workers. These comparisons alert us to the fact that the mechanism was, in fact, not bilateral but rather triangular as it stemmed from two sets of comparisons, which were mutually embedded – Vietnamese-Cubans and Vietnamese-Czechs. Such triangulation has been documented as playing an important role in the racialisation of other foreign workers in other, non-state-socialist, settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0306396813476171">63</xref></sup> The Vietnamese were most frequently compared with Cubans, and only occasionally with other foreign workers, such as Poles. In this way, the supposed division of humankind into three distinct races, which Czechoslovak citizens were taught in biology classes throughout elementary and high school,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0306396813476171">64</xref></sup> was articulated in that both the Vietnamese and the Cubans were perceived as racially different from the Czechs and Slovaks, and hence comparable to each other, whereas the Poles were perceived as fundamentally similar to the local population and not so easily comparable with the overseas workers. Hence, racial criteria trumped mere foreignness, which suggests that the ‘othering’ of Vietnamese and Cubans was not ‘just’ xenophobia, but, in fact, had racist roots.</p>
<p>Additionally, comparisons were drawn at times between the Vietnamese and the only local minority identified by biology textbooks as a racial ‘other’ – the Roma. During a 1982 incident, for example, a Czechoslovak citizen ‘while intoxicated goaded Vietnamese citizens. He attacked them verbally, called them Gypsies, and said that he would throw them out of the pub.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0306396813476171">65</xref></sup> This suggests that, in the popular imagination and discourse, people took to heart the unambiguous assertion that distinct biological races existed, as posited in textbooks, but ignored anti-racist admonitions, and carved out a space for the Vietnamese in existing racial hierarchies.</p>
<p>Tellingly, the Vietnamese living in the Czech Republic today are routinely compared to, and contrasted with, the Roma, echoing the ‘model minority’ discourse familiar from the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0306396813476171">66</xref></sup> One of my informants showed me a high-rise apartment building in which the Vietnamese workers used to be housed, explaining that the workers did not occupy the entire building, but that in some apartments ‘normal [by which he meant Czech] people lived as well’ since the Vietnamese ‘are not like the Gypsies’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0306396813476171">67</xref></sup> By this he wanted to communicate that the Vietnamese, in contrast to the Roma, were relatively easy to live alongside. Both his use of the word ‘normal’ and the comparison with the Roma are significant as they are instrumental in creating a hierarchy. The word ‘normal’ is used as a synonym for ‘Czechs’, who are located at the apex. The Roma are located at the bottom, while the Vietnamese, who are explicitly described as ‘better’ than the Roma, but not subsumed under the ‘normal’ category, are assigned the middle position. Or again, the significance of ‘normal’ is demonstrated in a study of the Vietnamese community in the Czech Republic today, in which a teacher is quoted as describing a Vietnamese pupil first as ‘good, thoughtful, smart, cooperating’ only to conclude by saying that ‘if he did not have those slanted eyes, he would be quite a normal boy’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0306396813476171">68</xref></sup> Elsewhere in the same study, teachers are quoted as comparing Vietnamese and Roma children and saying with a sigh: ‘Why cannot the Gypsies be like [the Vietnamese]?’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0306396813476171">69</xref></sup> Sokolova’s work confirms the centrality of the ‘binary opposition of “normal”, meaning Czech or Slovak, and “deviant”, meaning “Gypsy”’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0306396813476171">70</xref></sup> to the articulation of difference in regard to the Roma, which was developed during the state-socialist period and remains to this day. With the end of the state-socialist regime, the Czechs (and Slovaks) discarded the ideology of state socialism and with it also the potentially equalising capacity of ‘honest work’, so finding themselves in a situation today where ‘slanted eyes’ are an obstacle to ‘normalcy’. The ‘savages’ are seen as potentially educable, but the date for the fulfilment of this potential never comes.</p>
