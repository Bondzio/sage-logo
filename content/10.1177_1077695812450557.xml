<p>When was the last time a white man in blackface cavorted down the sidelines (or foul lines) at a major league baseball or football game before tens of thousands of people, meanwhile telling everyone that such a performance enhances their appreciation of African American culture? Most people would find such a thing rather tacky. Native Americans, however, are subject to such degradation on a regular basis. Ask the perpetually shit-faced Chief Wahoo, Cleveland’s foremost “Indian,” and the inventors of the Atlanta Braves’ “tomahawk chop.”</p>
<p>The editors and contributors to this volume would like to address this situation, but cultural inertia has been getting in the way. In some media, ignorance vis-à-vis Native American history and culture can be so thick as to be ridiculous, as in references to several hundred distinct peoples as one, “the Indian.” This anthology is a rare and valuable collection of essays in which Native American scholars “talk back” to media depictions of Indian peoples. Coeditor John P. Sanchez provides a common theme for this collection when he asks, “Why do mass media in the twenty-first century seem to remain focused on American Indian imagery that is stuck in the eighteenth century?” (p. 9).</p>
<p>Even today, European American media cannot seem to get enough of such category-think, whether it be caricatures of Indian as noble ecologist, as savage, or as perennial victim. From the Indian maiden on Land O’Lakes milk cartons to the grimace of Chief Wahoo, our media brim with thousands of trademarked invented Indians, all part of what Victoria E. Sanchez, in her essay “Buying into Racism,” calls “symbolic annihilation” (p. 157), as advertising and public relations of the dominant culture define Native imagery for the mass market.</p>
<p>Sometimes a stereotype comes in handy to promote press coverage, as in the 1973 occupation of Wounded Knee, examined by Patty Loew in “Finding a New Voice.” Swarms of media couldn’t resist the “Indian on the warpath” image. However, on their way to the stereotypical warpath, reporters also “brought attention to the grim realities of every-day indigenous life [at Pine Ridge],” feeding another stereotype, “Indian as victim” (p. 5).</p>
<p>The occupation of Alcatraz Island in 1969 provoked the same response. Imagine, a year later, the irony implicit in Indians’ occupation of Fort Lawton, an Army base, in Seattle, which resulted in the creation of a cultural center of the type sought, but never realized, on Alcatraz. Is this payback, or what?</p>
<p>A lot of this debate concerns defining human images via the power of words. Consider the use of stereotypes as sports mascots. Or the 119,000 place names in the United States that use some variation of “squaw,” an anglicized Mohawk term for women’s genitalia that is dissected by Stacey J. T. Hurst and Debra Merskin in “The ‘S’-Word.” How many Anglo Americans don’t bat an eye at “Squaw Valley” but probably would have a problem with “Cunt Canyon”? Sanchez points out that these images can be psychologically dangerous as members of minority groups sometimes internalize their negative aspects, leading to “anxiety and feared inferiority” (p. 161).</p>
<p>People do challenge stereotypes, and in so doing alter the national conversation. The <italic>Omaha World-Herald</italic>, for example, sent Susette LaFlesche, an U’ma’ha (Omaha) Indian, to report the aftermath of Wounded Knee in 1891. Sending an American Indian woman to the massacre site was highly unusual, even if she was married to Thomas Tibbles, one of the newspaper’s editors.</p>
<p>In this volume, the conversation is altered, with some degree of humor, by the creation of the “Fighting Whites” (or “Whities”), an intramural basketball team at a Colorado college, under the slogan “Everythang’s gonna be all white.” Sherman Alexie is quoted as saying “Humor is self-defense on the reservation” (p. 99). Jennifer Meness contributes an incisive essay on the film “Smoke Signals,” as a Native-defined attempt (led by Alexie) to inject some street-level reality into mass-media imagery of reservation Indian life.</p>
<p>This book may be useful in several academic venues, from introductions to communication to Native American studies courses that discuss stereotyping. Sports writers could use it, too. It should ignite some conversations.</p>
