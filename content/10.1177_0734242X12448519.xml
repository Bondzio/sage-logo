<abstract>
<p>In Europe post-consumer beverage carton packages are treated in three ways: dumped in a landfill, incinerated for energy recovery, and recycled. In recent years new technologies for beverage carton recycling have been developed and tested. At the same time in Europe the collection of second-hand raw materials is becoming more efficient. In order to facilitate and justify the decision-making process, different possibilities of poly-aluminium handling were analysed. For this reason, the objective of this study was to compare carbon footprints in the whole life cycle of selected technologies and to provide decision-making with data for beverage carton recycling. The paper is based on some of the results of the project ‘Sustainable Production through Innovations in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SPIN)’. The SPIN project is providing small- and medium-sized enterprises with a whole set of instruments that put entrepreneurs in a position to innovate their production processes and products leading to improved business and public benefits.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aseptic packaging makes it possible to extend the food expiration period. The sterilized product packed in an aseptic beverage carton is shelf stable for over 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12448519">Marsh and Bugusu, 2007</xref>). The world market for aseptic package increases by 6 to 8% a year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12448519">Mrozinski, 2009</xref>). More and more liquid food is packed in such packages (in the European Union about 70 million litres of liquid food a day) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12448519">Mrozinski, 2009</xref>). All these packages turn into waste.</p>
<p>Aseptic packages are made of six layers of three different materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12448519">Figure 1</xref>): long fibre duplex paper (about 75% by weight), low density polyethylene (about 20% by weight), and aluminium (about 5% by weight) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12448519">Mourada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12448519">Mrozinski, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>In Europe (EU27, Norway and Switzerland), post-consumer beverage carton packages are treated in three ways: dumped in a landfill, incinerated for energy recovery, and recycled. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12448519">Figure 2</xref> shows that 36% of beverage cartons are disposed in a landfill, 30% serve as an energy source.

<p>The Alliance for Beverage Cartons and the Environment claims that there are about 20 recycling utilities in Europe and about 100 worldwide.</p>
<p>Although the composite nature of carton/polyethylene/ aluminium is essential for long-life protection of perishable products, the composite causes inconvenience in recycling of post-consumer packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12448519">ACE UK, 2011</xref>). On the other hand, the recovered long fibre paper is a beneficial second-hand raw material for the paper industry.</p>
<p>The first stage in beverage carton recycling is separation of the paper fibre. Residues of beverage cartons are processed in a hydrapulper where, while in contact with water, the cellulose fibre is separated from the aluminium and polyethylene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12448519">Abreu, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12448519">ACE UK, 2011</xref>). Water might be heated to 50–60 °C which facilitates the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12448519">Abreu, 2000</xref>). According to Abreu the pulping can be successfully performed in different kinds of hydrapulpers and is a relatively simple process. However, the challenge is the separation of aluminium and polyethylene or the appropriate handling of a polyethylene/aluminium mixture.</p>
<p>No successful cases of mechanical separation of polyethylene and aluminium could be found in the literature. The available ways to handle the aluminium/polyethylene mixture after pulping are listed here.</p>

<p>There have been some unsuccessful attempts to recycle beverage cartons in Lithuania. The two companies that tried to recycle beverage cartons a few years ago identify two main reasons for their failure: insufficient quantities of beverage cartons due to the inefficient collection system, and economic reasons due to an inappropriate solution for polyethylene/aluminium handling.</p>
<p>In recent years new technologies for beverage carton recycling have been developed and tested. At the same time the collection of second-hand raw materials is becoming more efficient. Within the framework of the SPIN project and in cooperation with paper production companies the initiative to restart beverage carton recycling in Lithuania began.</p>
<p>The paper is based on some of the results of the project ‘Sustainable Production through Innovations in SMEs – SPIN’. SPIN is providing small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with a whole set of instruments that put entrepreneurs in a position to innovate their production processes leading to improved business and public benefits. The project is supported by the Baltic Sea Region Programme 2007–2013 of the European Union. SPIN brings together some of the most important institutions for eco-innovations in the Baltic Sea Region and is supported by numerous national governments, sector associations, research bodies and transnational NGOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12448519">Arbačiauskas et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The composite structure of a beverage carton creates difficulties for the recycling of liquid packaging. One of the main issues for an economically and environmentally effective way to recycle beverage cartons is handling of the mixture of plastics and aluminium. By considering the potential to recycle beverage cartons in ‘Kauno popierius’ paper mill, this aspect should be taken into account.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate and justify the decision-making process, different method for handling polyaluminium were analysed. For this reason, the objective of this research was to compare the environmental impacts of selected technologies for beverage carton recycling and to support decision-makers with a model to identify the preferable aseptic packaging recycling options.</p>

<title>Research methodology</title>
<sec id="section3-0734242X12448519">
<title>Environmental assessment of aseptic packaging</title>
<p>The life cycle approach covers environmental impacts related to materials production, the technological processes of product manufacturing, transportation, usage, recycling and waste management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12448519">Staniškis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12448519">Staniškis and Varžinskas, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool for quantitative assessment of materials, energy flows and environmental impacts of products, services and technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12448519">Krozert, 1998</xref>). The LCA methodology consists of four stages: definition of objective and scope, inventory analysis, impact assessment, and evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12448519">Staniškis et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Waste management systems are a popular subject of LCA studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X12448519">Varžinskas et al., 2009b</xref>). This is evidently related to the increased necessity to find alternatives to landfilling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12448519">Heijungs and Guinee, 2007</xref>). LCA has been successfully utilized to compare the environmental performance of different scenarios for management of mixed solid waste as well as of specific waste fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12448519">Liamsanguan and Gheewala, 2008</xref>). LCA methodology is the internationally standardized method that is considered to be one of the most effective management tools for identifying and assessing the environmental impacts related to waste management options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12448519">Cherubini et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Life cycle assessment allows assessing all the system of the product life cycle. Moreover by applying different variables to certain components of the system, various scenarios can be compared in terms of environmental impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12448519">Azapagic, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12448519">Varžinskas et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>To evaluate the collected data CCaLC software is used. It takes a life cycle approach and enables estimation of the environmental impacts including a carbon footprint (or global warming potential). CCaLC currently contains two databases: CCaLC and Ecoinvent. The CCaLC database consists of publicly available data compiled by the CCaLC project and data generated during the course of the project. A number of databases and case studies have been included in CCaLC which can be modified to suit the specific needs of the user. Databases include: materials, energy, transport, packaging and waste. Overall, there are over 5000 data items included in the databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12448519">The University of Manchester, 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-0734242X12448519">
<title>Functional unit</title>
<p>The functional unit is usually determined in terms of the system output (the amount of product or service). Then the LCA methodology is used to assess different alternatives of waste management, functional unit is determined as the system input (the amount of waste) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12448519">Cherubini et al., 2009</xref>). The functional unit used in this study was 100 kg of sorted beverage carton waste.</p>

<sec id="section5-0734242X12448519">
<title>Boundaries of the study</title>
<p>The life cycle of a beverage carton begins with the extraction of raw materials. Then, the three components (paper, polyethylene and aluminium foil) are laminated to a board. After use for packaging purposes, beverage cartons become waste, which is collected, sorted and stored until further processing.</p>
<p>The present study concentrated on the post-consumer stage of beverage carton life cycle. Data from the CCaLC and Ecoinvent databases were taken to evaluate the stages up to recycling. The data concerning the recycling of paper were provided by the paper mill. In the selected paper mill the recovered paper fibre is used to produce fluting. Fluting is a type of paperboard that is specially manufactured for the production of corrugated board.</p>
<p>The study covers all the processes of beverage carton recycling appropriate to the analysed case: production of fluting in JSC ‘Kauno popierius’ paper mill and handling of polyaluminium waste. The stages of the production of fluting in the context of the entire life cycle of beverage carton are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X12448519">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Aseptic packaging recycling scenarios</title>
<p>The selection of appropriate technologies could make the recycling of beverage cartons more cost-efficient and environmentally reasonable in terms of environmental impact during the life cycle. The current equipment (with some improvements) owned by the investigated paper mill allows repulping of laminated cardboard and manufacturing of fluting. After the separation of paper fibre about 25% of aluminium/polyethylene mixture remains. The question about the handling of this composite material remains open.</p>
<p>On the basis of available technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12448519">Alcoa Aluminio, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12448519">Carfagna et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12448519">Green Roof Project, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12448519">Mäkipaja et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12448519">Orsato et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12448519">Pedroso and Bastos, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12448519">Project Clean, 2011</xref>; Wenzel et al., 1997) and relevant environmental impacts four scenarios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12448519">Figure 4</xref>) of beverage carton waste handling were analysed.

<title>Decision-making system</title>
<p>The increasing interlinkages between the psycho-ecological and socio-economic sectors of society has placed a variety of pressures upon decision-makers, who are generally representatives of government, administration and the economic sectors. When a human is incorporated into a system as a controller or decision-maker the need for a full mathematical description is complemented by the human characteristics of anticipation, learning, innovation, adaptation and thought.</p>
<p>The role of decision-making in the context of assessment of recycling scenarios is on the basis of the best available information and theory, to make a disposition of resources between research instruments and other system variables such that the effects of the objectives are achieved as closely as possible within cost, probability or other constraints. Hence, the decision-making system (based on the life cycle approach) is a resource allocation mechanism which attempts to rationalize and optimize the assessment of the system performance of the scenarios to achieve a given set of goals. As such, the decision-maker performs one essential link among the control targets, the control costs and the individuals, groups and components which make up the system being controlled.</p>
<p>The developed decision-making model enables the decision-maker (in a particular case study it is the waste management company) to calculate both the theoretical and the specific values in relation to the projected capacities of aseptic packaging recycling scenarios and technologies. The presentation delivers the results of the case study and provides a discussion related to the integration all of the above-mentioned technology-specific models into one decision-making system. In the case of evaluation of different aseptic packaging recycling options, the developed integrated model suggests performing both LCA and financial analysis (‘Evaluation Methodology’) prior to taking concrete decisions regarding the ‘Goals and Objectives’ of the evaluation research (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X12448519">Figure 5</xref>). Several scenarios including the current state were modelled in this study and compared. The primary function of an aseptic packaging recycling system is ‘treating a certain amount of waste’. However, recycling technologies may also deliver secondary functions, such as the production of heat and power (through incineration or digestion) and production of secondary materials (recycling) and compost (biological decomposition). The model was usefully applied (in the framework of current research) to identify the preferable aseptic packaging recycling options and their combinations, especially when there is an opportunity to combine seemingly competitive approaches such as landfilling, recycling and reuse.</p>

<title>Results of the study</title>
<p>The data of each of the above-mentioned scenarios were processed by using CCaLC V1.1 software. The total carbon footprint for four scenarios was investigated and summarized. According to a definition proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X12448519">Wiedmann and Minx (2008)</xref> a carbon footprint is a measure of the exclusive total amount of carbon dioxide emissions that are directly and indirectly caused by an activity or are accumulated over the life stages of a product.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X12448519">Figure 6</xref> shows the total carbon footprint for each of the examined scenarios compared to the scenario 0 which represents landfilling of beverage carton waste.</p>

</fig>
<p>The results obtained show that the environmental impact of post-consumer beverage cartons can be reduced by recycling. Even if only paper fibre is recovered (scenario 1) 11% of carbon dioxide emissions can be cut. Recycling of all components of beverage cartons yields a reduction in the carbon footprint of 37–47% (scenarios 2 and 3).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X12448519">Figure 7</xref> provides more detailed information about the carbon footprint related to each scenario. Results are divided into four categories: raw materials, production, waste and co-products. Raw materials in each scenario comprise mainly beverage carton itself with additional materials related to fluting production (in scenarios 1, 2 and 3) and roof shingle production (in scenario 3). Production stage covers the processes related to recycling and comprises also indirect carbon dioxide emissions caused by energy production. Waste is defined as the residues of beverage cartons which are dumped in a landfill. Co-products cover aluminium and polyethylene usage as raw materials for paraffin production and aluminium recycling (scenario 2) as well as production of roof shingles (scenario 3).</p>

</fig>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X12448519">Figure 7</xref>, allocation of co-products via system expansion gives negative values of carbon dioxide emissions which reduce the total carbon footprint. This positive impact of co-product allocation is explained as avoidance of carbon dioxide emission by using system outputs (waste) as raw materials and therefore saving resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12448519">Klopffer, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Parameters provided by JSC ‘Kauno popierius’ are measured and therefore are considered to have a high degree of accuracy. The data on plasma technology and roof shingles production are taken from available literature or estimated by theoretical calculations and thus are less reliable. This affects the uncertainty of the total carbon footprint results of scenarios 2 and 3. In order to obtain more accurate results tests under certain conditions should be carried out.</p>

<title>Results of the financial analysis</title>
<p>Two scenarios (scenarios 2 and 3) which had the smallest environmental impact in terms of carbon footprint were chosen for financial investigation.</p>
<p>There are various approaches that can be used for the financial evaluation of solid waste recycling systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12448519">Pickin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12448519">Senthil et al., 2003</xref>).

Annual economic value added is the difference between annual operational expenses, annual cost of additional materials, annual revenue and annual savings (avoided landfill gate taxes). The operational expenses consider the annual cost of energy, workforce, maintenance and depreciation. It is assumed that the sales of co-products (paraffin and aluminium in the case of scenario 2 and roof shingles in case of scenario 2) would generate income. The revenues together with savings would cover operational expenses and the cost of additional materials (polyethylene coating for roof shingles in the case of scenario 3). The interest rate in the calculations estimated at zero.</p>

<p>Financial analysis has shown that the difference between annual economic value added (EVA) of two scenarios would be only 6%. However, an investment that was about fourteen times smaller would be needed for scenario 3 to give the shortest payback time. The payback time of scenario 2 was 2.7 years whereas the payback time of scenario 3 was 0.2 years. It must be underlined that the financial results and at the same time the economic performance of the recycling operation both strongly depend on the market value of co-products (paraffin, aluminium and roof shingles).</p>

<title>Conclusions and considerations</title>
<p>Recycling reduces the consumption of virgin materials, energy and minimizes the disposal of residues in landfills. Although beverage cartons are a valuable source of second-hand raw materials, its composite structure makes the material recovery more difficult. The major issue is the handling of the polyaluminium mixture that remains after paper fibre recovery. In order to find the most environmentally appropriate decision for a paper mill three different aseptic packaging recycling scenarios were analysed in this study. For the environmental analysis of the scenarios the LCA methodology was used. By applying different variables to certain components of the system, selected aseptic packaging recycling scenarios can be compared in terms of the environmental impact. LCA methodology is the internationally standardized method which is considered one of the most effective management tools for identifying and assessing the environmental impacts related to waste management options.</p>
<p>Based on the results, the following conclusions are stated.</p>
<list id="list3-0734242X12448519" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The most appropriate way to recycle beverage cartons in a paper mill in terms of carbon footprint is scenario 3. It covers recovery of paper fibre for fluting production and manufacturing of roof shingles from the polyaluminium mixture. This scenario allows the carbon footprint of beverage cartons within their life cycle to be reduced by 47% in comparison with landfilling (scenario 0). The positive value of the environmental impact is achieved by allocation of co-products via system expansion. The second most desired technology from the environmental point of view is recycling of paper fibre and recovery of aluminium and paraffin (scenario 2). It allows the environmental impact of beverage cartons to be reduced by 37%. Scenario 1 which covers recycling of paper fibre with the polyaluminium mixture being dumped in a landfill allows carbon dioxide emissions to be reduced by 11%.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Financial analysis of the two scenarios to determine which has the least impact on the environment in terms of carbon footprint has shown that the payback time of scenario 2 is 2.7 years and that of scenario 3 is 0.3 years. It maybe stated that if there is a sufficient quantity of beverage cartons waste the recycling might be economically viable.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The developed integrated model for decision-making suggested performing a LCA and financial analysis prior to taking concrete decisions. The model allows the calculation of both the theoretical and the specific values in relation to the projected capacities of aseptic packaging recycling scenarios and technologies. The results of model application by decision-makers has proved capable of identifying the preferable aseptic packaging recycling options and their combinations, especially when there is an opportunity to combine seemingly competitive approaches such as landfilling, recycling and incineration.</p></list-item>
