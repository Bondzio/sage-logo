<abstract>
<p>A wide range of treatment processes have been applied to leachate treatment with varying success. The aim of this research was to examine the performance of two hybrid biological anaerobic reactors in a new full-scale leachate treatment plant in Rasht composting facility, north of Iran. The studied plant was operated for nearly 12 months and treated up to 50 m<sup>3</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> of fresh compost leachate with a relatively high BOD<sub>5</sub> to COD ratio of around 0.5. The average COD of the raw leachate was measured to be 81 000 mg L<sup>−1</sup>. 30% of effective volume of each reactor was filled with clay blocks with a specific area of 87 m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>−3</sup> as the fixed bed. The sequencing of reactors was down flow and up flow, respectively. The maximum COD removal efficiency of 91% was achieved with 4.5 kg COD m<sup>−3 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup> of organic loading rate and 7500 mg L<sup>−1</sup> of volatile suspended solids. There was no significant difference in COD removal efficiency when the reactors were operated with an organic load between 2 and 5 kg COD m<sup>−3 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup>. Increasing the volumetric organic loading rate to greater than 6 kg COD m<sup>−3 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup> caused a considerable reduction of COD removal efficiency. The COD removal efficiency decreased to less than 70% when the organic load rose to 10.8 kg COD m<sup>−3 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup>. Nevertheless, hybrid anaerobic reactors proved to be a feasible technique for the reduction of organic load from the composting leachate which was the subject of this study.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The environmental impact of improper solid waste management is becoming a global problem in less developed countries. In recent years, the international policy on management of organic wastes has been increasingly directed towards recycling and reuse. Recycling not only decreases the costs of disposal facilities for residual waste materials but also reduces the environmental impact of organic waste. There are different technologies to recycle organic wastes and composting is often presented as a low-investment process to convert organic waste to an organic fertilizer known as compost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11411014">Haug, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Recognizing the high percentage of biodegradable constituents in the municipal solid waste (MSW) in Iran and also due to the developing of a new standard by the Iran Environmental Protection Agency, it is predicted that the number of composting facilities will increase considerably in future years. One of the main problems associated with the treatment of organic waste in composting facilities is the management and treatment of leachates, which present a high organic load and cannot be stored in the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11411014">Trujillo et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Compost leachate is variable in terms of its chemistry and this variability is influenced by factors such as the nature of the feedstock; the maturity of the compost being the reason for the leachate; the composting technology employed; the degree of cover; and the weather (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11411014">Tyrrel et al., 2008</xref>). In most of the composting facilities in Iran, mechanically-turned open-air windrows are used to process the organic waste. In this process a great part of the leachate is generated by organic matter (such as fruit and vegetables). In addition to leachate derived from the windrows, polluted runoff from contaminated hard surfaces and machinery is also likely to be produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11411014">Tyrrel et al., 2008</xref>). In order to overcome this problem, it is recommended that the leachate is re-circulated on to dry windrows as a wetting agent. In some situations (e.g. humid areas) recirculation is not possible and other arrangements have to be made for its disposal. Because of the high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD), handling of leachates is also difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11411014">Jaafarzadeh et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of alternatives have been proposed to manage the composting leachate including: evaporation, discharge to municipal wastewater collection systems and on-site treatment. In some locations where sewers are not available and evaporation is not feasible, on-site treatment may be a good alternative (although to date there have only been a few published studies on compost leachate treatment).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11411014">Ghasimi et al. (2008)</xref> have reported the potential of a batch anaerobic system in the fresh leachate treatment to be 43% for COD and 80% for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD<sub>5</sub>) removal. The ability of waste-derived filter media to bioremediate composting leachate was investigated in a laboratory-scale study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X11411014">Savage and Tyrrel (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11411014">Tyrrel et al. (2008)</xref>. Leachates from composting of the organic fraction of MSW have been treated by means of Fenton’s reagent. Fenton’s reagent is a solution of hydrogen peroxide and an iron catalyst that is used to oxidize contaminants or waste waters. This process proved to be a feasible technique for the oxidation of the composting leachate. The use of Fenton’s reagent was proposed as a post-treatment after biological treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11411014">Trujillo et al., 2006</xref>). In another study, bench-scale packed zeolite columns were set up and operated to investigate the continuous removal of ammonium ions from compost leachate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11411014">Liu and Lo, 2001</xref>). The effects of different coagulants on the removal of organic load and also heavy metals from raw leachate were examined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11411014">Maleki et al. (2009)</xref>. They showed that the addition of aluminum sulfate resulted in removal of 18% of COD and 77–90% of heavy metals. The use of ferric chloride also yielded a reduction of 28% of COD and 62–86% of heavy metals.</p>
<p>Rasht composting facility with 500 tonnes day<sup>−1</sup> nominal capacity is in Gilan province in the north of Iran. The weather of this area is moderate and humid. The average annual rainfall of this city is 1360 mm. The average humidity of this area is above 85% and sometimes increases to more than 95% in October. Due to relatively high humidity neither leachate recirculation at the composting plant nor irrigation of adjacent landfill is possible. Furthermore, there is no sewage collection network near the site and so an on-site treatment unit with 18 000 m<sup>3</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> nominal capacity was considered as an alternative for this case.</p>
<p>The main objective of this study was to investigate the performance of two hybrid anaerobic reactors in series in a new full-scale leachate treatment plant in Rasht composting facility. The effect of some factors such as organic loading rate, volatile suspended solids (VSS) and pH on the process were investigated. To the authors’ knowledge, no other studies have been published on the use of the hybrid anaerobic reactors to treat leachate from composting processes and that is the main innovation of this paper.</p>

<p>The treatment unit consists of two hybrid anaerobic reactors (200 m<sup>3</sup> effective volume each) which contained both suspended and attached-growth biomass in a new full-scale leachate treatment plant in Rasht composting facility, north of Iran (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X11411014">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The sequencing of reactors was down flow and up flow, respectively. Thirty percent of the effective volume of each reactor was filled with clay blocks with a specific area of 87 (m<sup>2</sup> m<sup>−3</sup>) as the fixed bed. To facilitate visual control of biomass growth on the media, two clay blocks were suspended on a piece of rubber rope in each reactor. The produced biogas was collected from the head space of the reactors and was burned in the flare.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the presence of all groups of methanogenic micro-organisms, the reactors were inoculated using a mixture of two different types of anaerobic sludge. The first sludge was obtained from a slaughterhouse wastewater treatment plant in Rasht city, and the second was brought from an anaerobic lagoon used for the stabilization of cow manure. The sludge inoculated to the reactors was considered to be about 1000 mg L<sup>−1</sup> of total suspended solids (TSS) with an average VSS content of 78%.</p>
<p>The water fed to the process mainly consisted of leachate from an approximately 1.2 ha windrow composting area. The leachate was introduced to a balancing tank, from where it was pumped to the treatment process. Flow recirculation into anaerobic reactors was performed in order to establish a vertical velocity of 15–25 m day<sup>−1</sup> for mixing at the base of the filter and optimum growth of bio-film on the surface of the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11411014">Jomekhledi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11411014">Smith et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The studied plant was operated for nearly 12 months and treated up to 50 m<sup>3</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> of fresh compost leachate. The average COD and BOD<sub>5</sub> of raw leachate were 81 000 and 39 000 mg L<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The influent pH was adjusted to be in the range of 6.5–7.0 by lime for the first 2 months. Thereafter, during biological treatment the pH buffering capacity of the system increased and raw leachate was pumped directly into the reactors. The temperature of the reactors was in the range of 25–35 °C. (During the cold weather the temperature of the reactors was increased to above 25 °C, by using the biogas produced in the process as the main part of energy source.)</p>
<p>It is important to ensure that during the anaerobic treatment there are sufficient nutrients for biomass growth. If the ideal concentration of nutrient is not supplied, there should be some form of compensation, either by applying smaller nutrient loads to the treatment system, or by allowing a reduced efficiency of the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11411014">Sperling and Chernicharo, 2005</xref>). The COD : N : P ratio that is usually reported in the literature as the required ratio for anaerobic treatment is 250 : 5 : 1 to 500 : 5 : 1 depending on the extent of loading or COD influent concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11411014">Droste, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11411014">USEPA, 1995</xref>). In this study the average nutrient ratio of 350 : 5 : 1 was considered as a basis. Measured values of the nutrient ratio of the raw leachate showed a ratio of 350 : 4 : 0.4, and therefore in the beginning phosphorus (super phosphate triple) and nitrogen (urea) was added to the process to maintain the nutrient balance, but after biomass adaptation and after achieving an acceptable COD removal efficiency the nutrient addition was gradually prevented.</p>

<title>Analytical procedures</title>
<p>Analytical procedures for the determination of COD, BOD<sub>5</sub>, TSS and VSS were according to standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11411014">APHA, 1998</xref>). Measurement of ammonia nitrogen concentration was carried out with the Nessler method (2400 HACH DR/4000 spectrophotometer) and the phosphorus concentration with the React PV method (3025 HACH DR/4000 spectrophotometer). The methane content of produced gas was measured on site by using a GMI GT43 gas detector. Jenway 3510 pH meter with glass combination electrode (924 005) was supplied to measure pH. With the exception of super phosphate triple and urea which was purchased commercially, all other chemicals used for analysis were chemical grade and obtained from the Merck Company.</p>

<title>Leachate characterization</title>
<p>The characterizations of leachates from the organic fraction of MSW composting are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11411014">Table 1</xref>. As shown, the fresh leachate presented a very high level of COD and BOD<sub>5</sub> and relatively high BOD<sub>5</sub> to COD ratio (average &gt;0.49), which corresponded to a high level of biodegradability of the organic matter. These results were higher than those found in leachates from aged landfills, which usually are characterized by relatively low values of COD (less than 10 000 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) and low values of biodegradability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11411014">Loukidou and Zouboulis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11411014">Rivas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11411014">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). The reason for this fact is that composting leachates consist of organic matter from fresh waste instead of landfill leachate, which is a mixture of different aged materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11411014">Trujillo et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, these results are in accordance with those reported for compost leachate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11411014">Jianyong et al., 2010</xref>) and fresh leachate from the MSW transfer station (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11411014">Ghasimi et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Performance of the reactors</title>
<p>The variations of volumetric organic load of the effluent versus time are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X11411014">Figure 2</xref>. As shown, the loading rate of the process was steady during the first 2 months after the start up of the reactors to allow biomass adaptation. Thereafter it was increased stepwise to 6.5 kg COD m<sup>−3 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup>. On day 161the leachate flow-rate was increased considerably due to heavy rain. In order to prevent sludge wash out a significant portion of the feed was by-passed and the volumetric loading rate reduced to less than 3 kg COD m<sup>−3 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup> for a few days.</p>

</fig>
<p>Although the pH of raw leachate was adjusted near neutrality for the first 2 months after start up, during the addition of carbon sources (leachate) in each step, a small pH reduction due to volatile fatty acids (VFAs) production was observed. Thereafter consumption of VFAs by methanogenic micro-organisms recovered the pH to a value that was close to neutrality. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X11411014">Figure 3</xref>, the variation of pH in the effluent during the first 2 months was reasonable and subsequently, by increasing the VSS and also the methanogenic micro-organisms in the reactors a practically stable trend was attained for pH in spite of the variation of pH in the influent.</p>

</fig>
<p>Although pH measurement cannot form the sole means of control, and direct measurement of either VFA or carbonate alkalinity is necessary for start up and successful control of anaerobic treatment, other parameters were not measured because of the continuous methane production and stability of the flame in the flare during the process.</p>
<p>The changes of TSS and VSS content in the reactor are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X11411014">Figure 4</xref>. The variations in the solids content were due to the micro-organisms growing, losing the slime layer (sloughing) and sludge wasting. About 2 months after start up, the biomass growth on the media was clearly observed (visual observation of clay block in each reactor). On day 144, in spite of acceptable COD removal efficiency, recirculation of the treated leachate was performed to eliminate a fraction of sludge which presented destabilization of the reactors performance. The change in the microbial population due to the lack of sludge wasting was (probably) the main reason for the instant reduction of biogas production and increasing TSS in the effluent of the anaerobic system.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0734242X11411014-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>As a consequence, after a few days of recirculation of the treated leachate the sludge was washed out and VSS in the reactors reduced to 2600 mg L<sup>−1</sup>. Thereafter the volumetric loading rate increased gradually and the sludge characteristics and biogas production was recovered. After the adaptation, the methane content of biogas was around 40% and increased to more than 55% during the next 2 months due to the increase of the ambient temperature to above 35 °C.</p>
<p>The inlet and outlet COD variation during time are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X11411014">Figure 5</xref> and the variations of BOD<sub>5</sub> and biodegradability (BOD<sub>5</sub>-to-COD ratio) of raw leachate are also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X11411014">Figure 6</xref>. The start up was performed over 2 months to achieve over 50% COD removal efficiencies. The average removal of 89% for BOD<sub>5</sub> and about 85% for COD (after adaptation) indicate good degradation of biodegradable organic matter.</p>

<p>In order to investigate the effect of nutrient ratio on the performance of the reactors, after adaptation (from day 100) nutrient supplement of the influent was gradually decreased. It was observed that although nutrient concentrations in the raw leachate reported in this study were lower than reported in the literature they had no significant effect on the COD removal efficiency and performance of the reactors. In other words raw leachate had sufficient nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations for this process that the addition of such nutrients was not necessary.</p>
<p>After adaptation, the maximum COD removal efficiency of 91% was achieved with an organic loading rate of 4.5 kg COD m<sup>−3 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup> and 7500 mg L<sup>−1</sup> of VSS. In spite of this high removal efficiency, the residual COD of the effluent was too high for the effluent to be disposed of into the environment without further treatment.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X11411014">Figure 5</xref>, in spite of COD variation of the influent, a quite stable COD concentration of around 10 000 mg L<sup>−1</sup> was attained in the effluent. This trend was related (due) to control and adjustment of the volumetric organic load during the process. The volumetric loading rate and COD removal efficiencies of the reactors in the operational period are compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X11411014">Figure 7</xref>. As shown, a stepwise increase of organic load from 2 to 5 kg COD m<sup>−3 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup> hardly influenced the removal efficiency which oscillated around 90%.</p>

<p>The averages of COD removal at different volumetric organic load are compared in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734242X11411014">Figure 8</xref>. It can be seen that the increase of volumetric organic load to above 6 kg COD m<sup>−3 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup> reduced the COD removal efficiency significantly. The COD removal efficiency was reduced to less than 70% when the volumetric organic load was increased to 10.8 kg COD m<sup>−3 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup>. During the operational period, it was not possible to increase the volumetric organic load to greater than this amount due to limitations in leachate production.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The performance of two hybrid anaerobic reactors in series in a new full-scale leachate treatment plant was investigated over a period of nearly 12 months. In this study leachate from the composting process was characterized in terms of organic load. The values found for both COD and BOD<sub>5</sub> were extremely high in comparison with landfill leachate. The average ratio of BOD<sub>5</sub> to COD was around 0.5, which corresponded to a high level of biodegradability of the organic matter. The removal of COD was 85% on average and removal of BOD<sub>5</sub> was about 89%, indicating good degradation of biodegradable organic matter. In spite of this high removal efficiency, the COD content of the treated effluent remained too high to be acceptable for direct discharge to the environment. There was no significant difference in COD removal efficiency when the reactor was operated with an organic load between 2 and 5 kg COD m<sup>−3 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup>. Increasing the volumetric organic load above 6 kg COD m<sup>−3</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> reduced COD removal efficiency considerably. COD removal efficiency decreased to less than 70% when organic load increased to 10.8 kg COD m<sup>−3 </sup>day<sup>−1</sup>. Based on the results of this study, the biological anaerobic reactors proved to be a feasible technique for the reduction of COD from the composting leachate in full scale. This method can be considered to be a suitable treatment process for this type of wastewater, particularly in moderate to warm climatic conditions and in large composting plants where an adequate amount of leachate is being produced.</p>
<p>Further research on the use of the biological process to treat composting leachates should be focused on the improvement of the effectiveness of the removal of organic matter by changing the experimental conditions or by using auxiliary processes.</p>
