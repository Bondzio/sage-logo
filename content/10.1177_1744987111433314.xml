<p>Grounded theorists are well accustomed to the ongoing debate as to whether the incorporation of quantitative data dilutes, or negates naturalistic inquiry, by the overlay of logical positivism, so this paper is of great interest. Jørgensen et al. clearly explain and demonstrate how a multi-modal grounded theory study is conducted. It is made quite clear that irrespective of the fundamental nature of the data (quantitative or qualitative) collected, the analysis is done in accordance with Glaser and Strauss’ founding core tenet of grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111433314">Glaser and Strauss, 1967)</xref> in that the study’s emerging theory emanates from the research participants’ initial data on the lived experience of having breathlessness. The quantitative data collection is applied to the under- and over-pinning qualitative data in such a way as to jointly elicit further interpretation of the meaning of living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p>
<p>This inherent dovetail approach is distinguishable from that of mixed methods studies, these being to-date the more common usage of qualitative and quantitative data in a single study. In a mixed methods study, the respective analyses of quantitative and qualitative data are kept separate and key findings are amalgamated as conclusions, whereas in this grounded theory multi-modal study each distinctive phase of inquiry data is automatically related to the previous, and to the next stage of data collection.</p>
<p>In highlighting the importance of ethical considerations when research participants use video clips to portray their lived experience, Jørgensen et al. also raise important methodological issues relating to data interpretation and data saturation. How can a researcher be assured that his or her interpretation of the meaning of the video clip and hence the ensuing data categories are an accurate representation? Sharing the video clip with others as in a feeding-back and member-checking mode can incur invasions of privacy or even voyeurism. Unless the data is interpreted accurately how can you ensure data saturation, and from this sufficient data fit to render the subsequent theory substantiated? Jørgensen et al. postulate the use of computer software programs as an aid to data interpretation and saturation, but a note of caution is needed. Grounded theorists must continuously immerse themselves in the data and not lose touch with the data’s emerging form. Unless this principle is rigorously adhered to it is likely that logical positivism will be woven into the fabric of the study.</p>
<p>A grounded theory always has distinctive characteristics without which it cannot be a grounded theory. In summary these characteristics are a theory developed from a bottom-up and initially inductive approach, and transparent coding techniques for the opening up and reformulation of data so that data sensitivity, data saturation, and the fit of data to the subsequent theory can be clearly audit-trailed throughout the planning and conduct of the study.</p>
<p>This particular multi-modal study meets these essential characteristics and is thus a grounded theory study. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111433314">Kuhn (1962</xref>) demonstrated, science evolves to meet the changing needs of society, and the purposeful merging and blending of quantitative and qualitative data in future multi-modal studies such as this one could be the way to a happy and productive union of bio-medical research and naturalistic applied social science type studies yielding greater knowledge and understanding of complex conditions.</p>
