<p>The enduring social anxieties surrounding the illicit drug, methamphetamine (meth), offer a useful lens to view processes of criminalization and control as they unfold outside major population centers. Focusing on one year and an anti-meth legislative campaign, this paper maps the problematization of meth in the unique context of the rural Midwestern United States. Relying primarily on news media accounts, it illustrates various political and cultural currents constituting what is described as the “illicit methamphetamine industry.” The paper illustrates how, by overstating realities of use, politicizing official statistics and reframing key events, authorities discursively link meth control to the wars on drugs and terror and broader securitization projects. The paper concludes with a theoretical discussion of how control of one drug, in one state, fundamentally alters everyday life—even in small towns of the rural Midwest.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Writing on the late 1980s alarm over crystal methamphetamine (meth), historian Philip Jenkins warned that the political and cultural conditions permitting the panic had not changed substantially, nor were they likely to, leading him to predict meth “crises” to appear again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741659012454125">Jenkins, 1994</xref>: 28). Proving his prescience for more than 15 years, meth perennially blossoms in the public’s imagination as newsworthy case, political declamation, and documentary film. In once such instance, an edition of <italic>Newsweek</italic> dedicated to “The Meth Epidemic” boldly named it “America’s Most Dangerous Drug,” cautioning, “the once trailer-park high has gone upscale—and national—to become America’s fastest spreading and most dangerous drug” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741659012454125">Jefferson, 2005</xref>: 3). This of course should not be surprising to even the most casual followers of news media, as the alluring spectacle of drugs and crime seems always to draw a curious eye. Jenkins’ observations do however hint at another question perhaps left unanswered by political, media and even academic accounts of the drug—that is, why methamphetamine? These days, drug scares or panics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1741659012454125">Young, 1971</xref>) form with clock-like certainty. Meth certainly fits the episodic, drug panics frame and appears in the literature accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741659012454125">Goode and Ben-Yehuda, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>However, some argue, by virtue of trajectory or sheer volume, panics these days are not episodic as originally conceived, but rather layered and perpetual—an institutionalized and “permanent condition of personal insecurity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741659012454125">Feeley and Simon, 2007</xref>: 44). In terms of sheer volume, various campaigns against, for example, <italic>Salvia divinorum</italic>, synthetic marijuana, engineered stimulants or “bath salts” and flavored caffeinated alcohol or “alcopops,” have littered the news of the last few years. Still, much of this anxiety fell as quickly as it appeared, emphasizing episodic rhythms. Even the “great plague” of the 1980s, crack-cocaine, is in the “rearview mirror” according to prominent researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741659012454125">Reinarman and Levine, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, all the while, whispers of “meth epidemics” remain. Like other drugs, the rhetoric surrounding meth contradicts realities of use and its attendant harms. For instance, at the time of this writing, the estimated number of meth users in the US was just half the estimates for the year before. Though equal to a medium-sized city (350,000), these estimates still only represent one-tenth of one percent of the US population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741659012454125">SAMHSA, 2011</xref>). Even if grossly inaccurate, the number of estimated users could increase twenty-fold and still not equal prescription drug abusers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1741659012454125">SAMHSA, 2011</xref>). Despite this and other contradictions, government and private anti-meth groups like The Meth Project and the website “Methpedia” continue to claim that meth is “one of the greatest drug threats to the nation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1741659012454125">Strategic Associates International, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>While the disparity between harm and concern locates meth within the moral panics tradition, I argue that the drug’s utility to governance and securitization more aptly explains its longevity. “Security” is a very broad term “that both enables and conceals” a range of governing practices and “social and cultural values and habits” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1741659012454125">Valverde, 2001</xref>: 90) and is increasingly a catch-all analytic to explore the previously “clear-cut distinctions between crime and terrorism” and police and military activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1741659012454125">Zedner, 2009</xref>: 10).</p>
<p>However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741659012454125">Neocleous and Rigakos (2011)</xref> warn, the “greatest tyranny” of securitization is its utter dependence on constructions of the “other” and self-justifying perpetuation of fears, suspicions and divisions underpinning its entire reason for being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741659012454125">Neocleous and Rigakos, 2011</xref>: 19). Through this critical lens, we can view governmental provision of safety from risks of the “other”—in this case, meth users—as one of the subtle yet pervasive ways social institutions “know and act on their subjects” and thus as fundamental to fabricating, structuring and administering modern governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1741659012454125">Simon, 2007</xref>: 12).</p>
<p>With this in mind, the paper has several goals. First, focusing on one year and events surrounding an anti-meth legislative campaign, it maps problematization of meth risks in the unique context of Kansas and the Midwestern US. Following a state-level case study approach (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741659012454125">Lynch, 2010</xref>), the paper reveals various political and cultural currents constituting what authorities describe as the “illicit methamphetamine industry.”</p>
<p>By exaggerating risks, politicizing statistics and reframing key events, the paper shows how authorities refashion security logics to new social contexts. Focusing on connections between risk construction and local notions of space and identity, meth control in Kansas productively reveals processes of criminalization and securitization as they unfold outside major population centers and well-covered terrains of “high-crime ghettos.” Finally, and perhaps more theoretically, the paper leaves off with a discussion of how the drift towards securitization alters everyday life—even in small towns of the rural Midwest.</p>
<sec id="section2-1741659012454125">
<title>From policing the crisis to governing through risk</title>
<p>The empirical framework follows Hall et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741659012454125">1978</xref>) influential <italic>Policing the Crisi</italic>s (PTC) by seeking to demonstrate how actors seized upon key events to fit a particular ideological vantage, gather public support for a set of social control practices, secure funding and further political candidacy. In this way, the case detailed here may be easy to write off as an engineered moral panic, especially given the purposeful focus on one year and one state.</p>
<p>However, thinking beyond episode and catastrophe, we confront Michelle Brown’s “sad paradox” and question, “how living with the crisis came to be simply living” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741659012454125">Brown, 2008</xref>: 132). Thus, departing from PTC, the paper demonstrates how authorities access the insecurity linked to meth in a way to render it useful for governance and the securitization of everyday life. More importantly, it asks how the suspicion and anxiety inseparable from securitization settles in and remains long after the crisis recedes.</p>
<p>As powerfully illustrated by PTC, moral panics arise from and obscure widening fissures in institutions and challenges to the dominant social order. In this way, PTC broke ground, illustrating how law-and-order authoritarianism lent itself as the best, perhaps the only, means to order in times of crisis—thus “foreshadowing governmentality, actuarialism, and the new penology” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741659012454125">Brown, 2008</xref>: 132). So now, more than 30 years on, we assume, at least to an extent, arrival of the “law-and-order” society envisaged by PTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741659012454125">Hall et al., 1978</xref>: 306). Whether this reflects cultures of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741659012454125">Garland, 2001</xref>), fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741659012454125">Bauman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741659012454125">Glassner, 2010</xref>), insecurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741659012454125">Erickson, 2007</xref>), or the rise of an altogether new type of authoritarianism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741659012454125">Hallsworth and Lea, 2011</xref>) is yet to be seen.</p>
<p>It is said that governments these days—particularly in the US—govern through crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1741659012454125">Simon, 2007</xref>). “Zero tolerance” policing regimes and innovative regulations remake public space at the behest of private capital, pushing the poor and homeless further to the margins of social life and physical space (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741659012454125">Beckett and Herbert, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741659012454125">Ferrell, 2001</xref>). The remaining welfare programs display crime control logics proudly—imposing intrusive drug screens as “common sense” requirements of public assistance—and reveal blurring lines between support and outright coercion. Some argue that these fields form an “assistantial-carceral” mesh governing the dispossessed through coercive workfare and repressive criminal justice simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1741659012454125">Wacquant, 2009</xref>: 99).</p>
<p>Even if so, these sorts of governmental projects are not inescapable or self-justifying and require citizen input by means of tacit consent, if not open support. Consent is won through steady warnings of the enemy other. However, whereas the state once directed public attention towards symbolic dangers of delinquent youth and various crises, an increasingly vast inventory of behaviors, criminal or not, are framed as risk and thus an issue of security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1741659012454125">Zedner, 2009</xref>). Criminology has a complicated and blossoming relationship with risk. For devotees of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741659012454125">Beck’s (1992)</xref> risk society, loosening institutional structures shifting under forces of modernization and industrialization wrought fundamental changes in cultural conceptions of danger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741659012454125">Mythern and Walklate, 2006</xref>: 383). In such a risk society, pre-industrial concerns for natural disaster give way to manufactured risks brought on by technological advancements of modernity. Circulating in the economic, political and environmental ether, concern for risks reduce everyday social interactions to a reflexivity of avoidance, reduction and management.</p>
<p>Those writing from a governmentality vantage (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741659012454125">Rose et al., 2006</xref>) are also concerned with risk, but in patently different ways. From this perspective, risk definitions are expressions of power and methods formaintaining order and governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741659012454125">O’Malley, 2010</xref>). As such, this tradition is less concerned with eventualities of things like terrorism and crime and more with how governing them fabricates order and regulates populations and territories. On a number of key points, the case detailed here more aptly reflects the governmentality of meth control, what I term, <italic>“governing through meth</italic>” as opposed to a “realist” conception of risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1741659012454125">Zedner, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As will be described, the tactics employed to govern through meth are less concerned with apprehending, prosecuting or even punishing and more concerned with warning the public of meth’s risks and reducing the conditions said to contribute to them. Additionally, anti-meth projects do not rely solely on formal policing activities but also activate citizen responsibilization and suspicion. Second, the temporal or pre-crime shift links meth to broader risk management domains, some not directly related to crime. In this case, meth discursively links to a broad array of risks ranging from natural disaster and environmental hazards, to terrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1741659012454125">Zedner, 2007</xref>). Together, anti-meth projects form a regime drawing on a diversity of agencies and actors, while acting through a foreground of criminal justice. In addition, state agencies and various private entities and experts have vested personal interests in anti-meth projects. Thus, as vocation and an object of consumption, meth securitization relies on perpetual reimagination of risks in new forms and spaces to carry it forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741659012454125">Goold et al., 2010</xref>). Viewing the anti-meth regime as a singular entity usefully avoids unnecessary distinctions between public, private, foreign, and domestic policing projects and situates anti-meth activities within a continuum of state power.</p>

<sec id="section3-1741659012454125">
<title>Securing the rural</title>
<p>Problematizations of meth as “America’s most dangerous drug” are useful for governance only because they draw on localized notions of space and identity. As creative constructs, drug panics threaten some spaces and bodies more than others. Crack cocaine, for example, is so profoundly racialized it irrevocably links to inner-city ghettos and people of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741659012454125">Bogazianos, 2012</xref>). Meth is constructed in many of the same ways. Sometimes called “white man’s crack,” it is commonly associated with poor whites in rural areas and rural states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1741659012454125">Linnemann, 2010</xref>). Former Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating provides a tremendous example of this kind of reasoning:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s a white trash drug-methamphetamines largely are consumed by the lower socio-economic element of white people and I think we need to shame it. Just like crack cocaine was a black-trash drug and is a black trash drug. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1741659012454125">Senate Communications Division, 1999</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Governor’s depiction of meth as a “white trash” referent to crack cocaine reimagines bodies and spaces along a racial hiearchy of whiteness. It follows that a “crack epidemic” racialized and linked to inner-city ghettos is less conceivable in primarily white and rural states like Kansas, than are risks of a “white trash” “trailer-park high.” Confirming these binaries, surveys of Kansas police consistently name meth the greatest “drug threat” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741659012454125">NDIC, 2009</xref>) even though cocaine users outnumber meth users by a large margin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741659012454125">ONDCP, 2008</xref>). Disparity between law enforcement’s assessment of risk and “the real” of meth use indicated by the number of users and seized labs reveals its utility for governance.</p>
<p>However, meth’s rurality is less concrete, as is the notion of rurality itself. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741659012454125">Bell (2007)</xref> put it, “it is an annoying question, if not an alarming one, that…sociologists have never comfortably resolved for themselves: what is the rural?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741659012454125">Bell, 2007</xref>: 401). Quantitative definitions, what Bell calls “first rural,” are most common. These definitions typically derive meaning in binary relation to urban spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741659012454125">Bell, 2007</xref>). Unsurprisingly, the US government uses numerous definitions like this, confusing the concept, even between related agencies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1741659012454125">1</xref></sup> Given obvious shortcomings, Bell’s “second rural” informed by culture and “ghosts of place” is perhaps more useful here. Bell describes:<disp-quote>
<p>Second rural, then, is a rural of associations. It calls upon the connections we have long made between rural life and food, cultivation, community, nature, wild freedom, and masculine patriarchal power, and the many contradictions we have also so long associated with the rural, such as desolation, isolation, dirt and disease, wild danger, and the straw-hatted rube. It is the rural of what Williams called the “golden echo” of rural goodness, as well the “leaden echo” of the rural we fear and reject. It is romantic. It is terrifying. It is empowering. It is imprisoning. It is <italic>Never Cry Wolf</italic>. It is <italic>Deliveranc</italic>e. It is <italic>The Wizard of Oz</italic>. It is <italic>The Grapes of Wrath</italic>. Second rural, the rural of ideas, is by no means always ideal. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741659012454125">Bell, 2007</xref>: 409)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This “rural of ideas” is sensitive to “invisible othernesses interrogating intersections of power and culture in the rural” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741659012454125">Bell, 2007</xref>: 409). For most, various technical definitions of urban and rural imposed by government agencies are meaningless. Rather, the public draws on the rural of ideas to locate the other among unknown racial and cultural homogeneities and less-traveled spaces like Kansas. Likewise, some hold the idealized “golden echo of rural goodness” against indicators of change brought on by things like “meth epidemics.” With its small population and relatively low crime and incarceration rates, Kansas is usually absent from national policy debates, especially compared to bell-wether states like California and Texas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741659012454125">Page, 2011</xref>). As Thomas Frank’s <italic>What’s the matter with Kansas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741659012454125">2005</xref>) famously argues, morally charged wedge issues like abortion and gun control encourage working-class people to support policy regimes contrary to their economic interests. In states like Kansas with traditions of conservative populism, the politics of “backlash” and “reaction” maintain political stasis and stifle progressive social policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741659012454125">Garland, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Projected across a conservative populist “rural of ideas,” drug epidemics hold considerable purchase and proffer a shock of danger amid the wholesomeness of the rural. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741659012454125">Frank (2003)</xref> finds “big-city” newspapers characterize small towns as sleepy, close-knit places, where doors sit unlocked. The city, on the other hand, is characterized as noisy, dirty, exciting, diverse and inherently dangerous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1741659012454125">Weisheit et al., 2006</xref>: 15). As constructed, rural meth epidemics bring the crime, violence and “moral poverty” of the city to the final bastion of wholesomeness—rural America.</p>
<p>This storyline thrives, bolstered by accounts like <italic>New York Times</italic> bestseller <italic>Methland: The Death and Life of an American Small Town. Methland</italic>’s first pages provide the perfect antithesis to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741659012454125">Anderson’s (2000)</xref> famous trek down Germantown Avenue in <italic>Code of the Street</italic>. Sketching an idyllic rurality, <italic>Methland</italic>’s author, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741659012454125">Nick Redding (2009)</xref>, brings us through Iowa farmland and the tree-lined streets of small towns dotting its landscape—dread floating on the breeze. Redding writes:<disp-quote>
<p>Against the oppressive humidity, the night’s smell begins to take shape. Mixed with the moist organic scent of cut grass at dew point is the ether-stink of methamphetamine cooks at work in their kitchens. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741659012454125">Redding, 2009</xref>: 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Soberly, Reading warns in many small towns across the Midwest, you can quite literally smell meth in the air—an absurdity even for the most drug-plagued neighborhoods. Regardless, the sheer popularity of this book, and many others like it, suggests that the narrative of degraded, collapsing rurality, or as Redding describes, “the death and life of an American small town,” is marketable indeed. Together, nervous warnings of degrading rural life, a tradition of conservative populism and meth’s edifice as a “white trash” “trailer park” drug offer ideal conditions to examine the unfolding politics of populist backlash and criminalization driving the drift toward securitization.</p>

<title>On Data and Method</title>
<p>Since late 2003, the Kansas Methamphetamine Prevention Project (KMPP) has contracted with a private provider to collect and document each mention of methamphetamine made in Kansas newspapers. The provider clipped each article from the full paper, scanned and saved it in portable document format (PDF) and then organized and tallied the articles by month in a statistical summary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1741659012454125">2</xref></sup> The collection provided by the KMPP includes 8,902 individual articles published from July 2004 to August 2009 making some mention of methamphetamine and is superior to data gathered by LexisNexis and similar search engines as it includes small local papers that do not appear in electronic databases.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741659012454125">Altheide’s (1987)</xref> ethnographic content analysis (ECA), I explored the articles without predetermined methodological constraints and did not attempt to quantify certain key words, or “trap” the analysis with preset categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741659012454125">Altheide, 1996</xref>: 33). Rather, proceeding in several stages, I stressed grounded reflexivity and allowed discovery to guide the process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1741659012454125">3</xref></sup> To begin, I plotted the total of number of articles by month on a simple line graph.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1741659012454125">4</xref></sup> As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741659012454125">Figure 1</xref> shows, coverage of methamphetamine increased significantly beginning late in 2004.</p>

</fig>
<p>Given the spike in coverage and feasibility of including nearly 9,000<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1741659012454125">5</xref></sup> articles in a journal-length manuscript, I identified December 2004 to December 2005 as a logical point of investigation. Once established, this sampling frame included 3,181 articles pertaining to methamphetamine. Next, I drew a subsample of over 1,000 articles by printing every third article in the sample. Reading each article thoroughly, I grouped the articles in three broad analytic frames. The first group of articles (N = 710) includes announcements of meth awareness groups, treatment programs, funding sources and so on. The second group (N = 1,719) includes basic police blotter arrest reports and information about local court dockets. Neither of these two categories included commentary from local officials or substantial coverage of local events such as meth-related crimes, making them less useful to the analysis.</p>
<p>The final category of articles includes press releases, interviews with police and politicians and commentary about meth-related crimes and legislation. Focusing the analysis on this final group of 752 articles, I reread each closely, recording temporal order, specific actors, images, quotes and content. This process fashioned a nuanced timeline mapping several intertwined and shifting narratives throughout the year, illustrating the broad logics of meth governance. Importantly however, focusing on this particular year and increased media attention does not automatically assume a moral panic; indeed, as subsequent events show, the analysis could have picked up elsewhere and followed to similar ends.</p>

<title>From prison to prayer—citizen to risk</title>
<p>Late 2004, public debates on restricting pseudoephedrine (PSE), a crucial meth ingredient, began. Introducing the preferred technology of control, news reports urged Kansans to follow the lead of neighboring Oklahoma that passed PSE restrictions the year before. The articles warned that failure to pass similar legislation would bring a torrent of meth crimes to Kansas with the “meth heads” who moved north.</p>
<p>Front-page articles with fantastic headlines such as “Meth Makers Flock Here” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1741659012454125">Figure 2</xref>) conjured images of throngs of meth-addled Oklahomans amassed along the southern border of Kansas, and linked once-mundane cold medicine to the “meth heads” lurking in local communities. Worth noting, several articles carried this cautionary from Larry Welch, then director of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI):<disp-quote>
<p>We’ve tried about everything to fight this plague, from education, prevention, and prison to prayer. I’m pleased with the apparent success those efforts have shown. But in the last few months there have been alarming increases of the reports of Oklahomans coming to Kansas to obtain the precursor chemicals and make methamphetamine here.

<p>This warning is instructive because it demonstrates the urgency of early accounts. Dire warnings of a “plague” resistant to interventions “from prison to prayer” figure prominently, undergirding metaphorical problematizations of <italic>meth war</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1741659012454125">Simon, 2002</xref>). Other reports quipped, “It didn’t take a genius to anticipate the druggies would move operations into a more friendly state” (<italic>Augusta Daily Gazette</italic>, 2005) othering meth users as invading “druggies” crossing the permeable boundaries of a neighboring state—transforming citizens and neighbors to risk.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Kansas Governor Kathleen Sibelius delivered her state of the state address. Laying a particular governmentality bare, Sebelius named meth, natural disaster and terrorism the principal threats to the health, safety and security of Kansas. She warns:<disp-quote>
<p>Kansas cannot be a truly healthy state unless it is both safe and secure. All our citizens must feel safe from crime and secure from the threat of terrorism, and feel protected from the natural disasters that have demonstrated their power, both here and around the world, over the past year. Effective protection from terrorism and natural disasters requires the best possible communication among a wide range of government agencies. Using Homeland Security funds, we are well on our way to making sure that first responders—police, fire, and other emergency personnel—can talk directly with each other and can coordinate early warnings, searches, rescues, and relief efforts. As for crimes that affect all Kansans, nothing is more important than stopping the illicit methamphetamine industry in its tracks. Working with the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, the Kansas Highway Patrol, and the Attorney General, I have charged a task force with developing legislation…We simply must make it more difficult for meth producers to obtain the chemicals that they use to concoct their deadly drugs. Oklahoma has already enacted a law that does just this, and I feel confident that we will have strong, effective laws in place by mid-year. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1741659012454125">Sebelius, 2005</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Revealing a high degree of disproportionality, the “illicit methamphetamine industry” shown here as seized labs had dropped off substantially every year since a peak in 2001 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1741659012454125">Figure 3</xref>). What’s more, the labs found in Kansas in 2004 (191) ranked far behind neighboring Missouri (1,115), Iowa (478) and Oklahoma (427), drawing the veracity of the Governor’s claims into question.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1741659012454125">6</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>Despite apparent contradictions, the Governor clearly names meth the chief criminal concern—eschewing child predators, criminal street gangs and other dependable scapegoats. For certain, the “illicit meth industry” is framed as criminal and the domain of law enforcement. Unlike its analog crack, however, meth risks appear more malleable and mutable. For instance, around this time a Kansas Senator introduced federal legislation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1741659012454125">7</xref></sup> targeting meth’s environmental risks. So, along with usual “drug risks,” meth’s environmental risks draw in special police teams to clean up labs, medical and child welfare specialists and even realtors to deal with homes where labs are found (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1741659012454125">Tunnell and Donnermeyer, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>On another front, the widely discussed “Faces of Meth” programme warns of the bodily decay awaiting daring users. Following fear appeal logics, Faces of Meth attempts to deter teen meth use with grotesque before-and-after mugshots of hardcore meth users. Even though many are dismissed as myth, like no other drug, popular discourse elaborates meth’s attack on physical appearance and risks of corporeal decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741659012454125">Murakawa, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Most critically, the Governor insists the safety and security of all citizens is contingent on protection from crime, terrorism and natural disaster. Placing meth, 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina on equal footing, the address maps a singular logic. Thus, like anti-terror and disaster relief projects, meth control centers on pre-crime, risk reduction and securitization logics to restrict chemicals and eliminate meth crimes before they occur. With this, the address alludes to fusion of local “police, fire, and other emergency personnel” with the vast bureaucracy of Homeland Security charged with “early warnings, searches, rescues, and relief efforts”—ubiquitous securitization projects indeed.</p>
<p>Much of the coverage early on focused on Senate Bill 27 or the “Meth Crackdown Bill” introduced by Kansas Senate Majority Leader, Derek Schmidt. Despite the dubious efficacy of precursor restrictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1741659012454125">Reuter and Caulkins, 2003</xref>) and though authorities could have used a variety of strategies, “cracking down” was the primary goal.</p>
<p>For a brief time the media described the legislation as stalled, with Schmidt scolding, “these folks need to have the courage to say that the convenience of a chain pharmacy outweighs the safety of Kansans” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1741659012454125">Rothschild, 2005</xref>). Advancing all-too-familiar “with us or against us” rhetoric, Schmidt belittled opposition as a matter of simple convenience, preferred over the “safety of Kansans,” strengthening the link between precursor restrictions and questions of safety and security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741659012454125">Hanna, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Public debates took a turn, however, January 19, following the murder of Greenwood County Sheriff, Matt Samuels. Initially the media reported, “Samuels was shot around 10 a.m. Wednesday while he was serving a search warrant at a home and an arrest warrant for a man wanted on burglary and theft charges and for violating parole<italic>”</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1741659012454125"><italic>Wichita Eagle</italic>, 2005</xref>). This report is correct. Samuels was serving arrest warrants on 23-year-old Scott Cheever, his cousin, for stealing his parent’s vehicle and violating probation the previous week. A tip later led deputies to a farmhouse where he was hiding. By accounts, Samuels went into the home alone and without his bulletproof vest to try to convince Cheever to surrender. Cheever shot down a staircase at Samuels, killing him at the scene. Though meth was later implicated, it is very important to acknowledge that law enforcement had not sought Cheever, nor anyone else, for any crimes related to methamphetamine.</p>
<p>Despite these facts, a short time later the media consensus was that Samuels “was shot to death while <italic>serving warrants at a suspected methamphetamine lab</italic> in a rural home near Virgil” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1741659012454125">Toplikar, 2005</xref>). Though police later found meth-making materials in the home, it is dishonest to present it as a “suspected meth lab” after the fact. To be sure, had the home been “a suspected meth lab,” other warrants would have followed and Samuels would have most certainly had backup and worn protective equipment.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the murder of a respected sheriff at the hands of a meth user immediately untangled the complexities of the meth debate. Echoing lawlessness of the old west frontier, newspapers ran stories with headlines such as “Sheriff Gunned Down,” stirring the fears of an anxious public (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1741659012454125">Figure 4</xref>). Even though two weeks earlier politicians of both parties had voiced serious reservations about the “meth crackdown,” the discussion ceased and turned towards victims like Samuels—powerfully signifying the violent potentialities of the “meth epidemic”(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741659012454125">Hall et al., 1978</xref>: 225). For small-town folks bombarded by anti-meth campaigns, this death brought big-city crime stories home, along with the realization that criminals in their town murder police as well. Here, meth risks become emblematic of the state’s impotence and inability to protect citizens from the violence and insecurity of late-modern life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741659012454125">Garland, 1996</xref>). Later, articulating a “broad grammar for recognizing and rewarding,” Governor Sebelius valorizes Samuels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1741659012454125">Simon, 2007</xref>: 101):<disp-quote>
<p>We owe them a debt that cannot be repaid, but one of the best ways to keep Samuels’ memory alive is to recognize daily the sacrifices made by the men and women of the law enforcement community…We must support them and their families. We do that by giving them good training and good salaries and by passing laws that give them the tools to do their job. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1741659012454125">Puriton, 2005</xref>)</p>

<p>Clearly, for the Governor, “honoring” Samuels and other fallen officers means expansion of the criminal justice system en masse<italic>—</italic>as fortified budgets, intrusive legislation, military tactics and equipment. Lost in this sort of plea is any critical evaluation of drug war rationalities contributing to this and countless other deaths. Without critical reflection, such “honoring” begs the practices contributing Samuels’ murder and Cheever’s subsequent execution to carry on uncontested. Writing on roadside shrines to victims of high-speed police chases, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741659012454125">Ferrell (2004)</xref> makes similar critique of the unflinching willingness to incur any cost in blind furtherance of drug war rationalities. Indeed, as the remainder of the paper shows, Kansas’ war on meth continued unabated following Samuels’ murder.</p>

<title>Managing the terrain</title>
<p>At the same time, another stream of articles reported with dismay that Kansas had dropped from the “top 10 list” for seized meth labs—the first time in a decade. The odd current of disappointment met immediate ridicule from Kyle Smith and the KBI, citing poor record keeping as the explanation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1741659012454125">8</xref></sup> “We have to get better stats…The KBI is designed to assist local law enforcement. We don’t want to lean on them unless it begins to hurt funding” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741659012454125">Associated Press, 2005</xref>). Interestingly, the KBI offered only faulty record keeping as explanation for the drop, not actual changes in production or consumption. Later under the headline “Shame on us!” local writers offered a retraction, explaining they reran reports of the drop as the “lead story on page 1, because it was a very slow news week” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1741659012454125"><italic>Sterling Bulletin</italic>, 2005</xref>). The anonymous retraction documents that meth news is a likely placeholder for media, especially during a “<italic>very slow news week</italic>” and assumes the official explanations for the drop as fact, citing the lack of accurate record keeping and reporting between counties.</p>

<sec id="section7-1741659012454125">
<title>Honoring the fallen—widening the net</title>
<p>Less than a month after the murder of Sheriff Samuels, representatives of the people of Kansas unanimously passed the “Meth Crackdown Bill.” Again, following Oklahoma that named its law after fallen officers, Kansas renamed its bill the “Matt Samuels Chemical Control Act.” The act required that all medications containing PSE be sold by licensed pharmacists, limited how much a person could purchase, required customers to be 18 and to provide valid ID and signature to discourage “smurfing.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1741659012454125">9</xref></sup> Indeed, as the quote below shows, Samuels’ death made the bill “impossible to vote against.”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A few weeks ago the bill was limping along…now it’s zooming along, what happened?…Unfortunately the death of Matt Samuels is what happened and it’s the last straw for many people in Kansas who have watched the growth of the meth trade with fear and despair. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741659012454125"><italic>Emporia Gazette</italic>, 2005</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Acknowledging the significance of Samuels’ murder, the author attributes passage of the act to the “fear and despair” of the “meth trade.” This is likely the case; as the excerpt from the record on the vote shows, Schmidt and others moved quickly to capitalize:<disp-quote>
<p>I vote aye on SB 27…It is a necessary step to combat methamphetamine production—with all of its enormous social, health, and economic costs…The Senate also saw fit in this bill to rename the Chemical Control Act as the Sheriff Matt Samuels Chemical Control Act. This step honors the memory of the late Greenwood County Sheriff who was murdered while serving an arrest warrant at a suspected methamphetamine laboratory…My hope is that when historians someday record the story of the methamphetamine scourge Kansas faced during the early years of the 21st century, they will credit passage of the Samuels Act with helping consign that story to history. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1741659012454125">State of Kansas, 2005</xref>, Derek Schmidt)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Schmidt’s account is more heroic than true, emboldening the narrative of a “scourge” consigned to “history” through the diligence of law enforcement. Rife with war metaphors, the statements etched the distorted account on the official record of the Kansas legislature and nurtured Schmidt’s drug warrior bona fides as avenger of innocent victims and fallen heroes. A short time later, however, Schmidt is less certain, warning, “This isn’t a magic bullet that will make meth go away, but it should put a major dent in meth production in Kansas.” The push and pull narrative of marginal success against continuous risks keeps doors open for continued battles and perpetual war.</p>

<title>Governing through meth</title>
<p>Coverage of legislative activities ran statewide as the 2005 session ended. A long list of wedge issues—sex predators, health care, abortion, death penalty, gun rights, and child pornography—shared space with meth on the pages of Kansas newspapers. Yet despite the perennial importance of these issues, Schmidt named the Samuels Act “perhaps the single most important thing so far this session,” further underscoring the import of governing through meth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741659012454125"><italic>Montgomery County Chronicle</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Implemented July 1, “The “Matt Samuels Act” was deemed a success by early September. According to Smith of the KBI, “We are seeing a distinct drop as the law goes into effect…before you could go down to your smoke shop or truck stop and buy it by the case. There was no restriction on it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741659012454125">Manning, 2005</xref>). These assertions are somewhat misleading, given the federal statutes already controlling PSE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1741659012454125">Weisheit, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Of course, it is highly problematic to claim success for any law less than two months after implementation. Nonetheless, authorities offered “drops [of] 64 percent since new law took effect” as evidence, in context of nearly four years of declines. More importantly, however, recall that just a few months prior, the very same KBI officials disputed these data, citing their inherent flaws. Despite their previous and very public objections, Smith and others now used declining lab seizures as evidence of the legislation’s success and the legitimacy of their work.</p>

<sec id="section9-1741659012454125">
<title>Casualties of war</title>
<p>Throughout the year, media coverage of Cheever’s prosecution described him as both a meth-fueled killer and a victim of the “meth epidemic.” Headlines such as “Accused sheriff killer has checkered past” and “Meth addiction plagued accused killer” reflect this odd duality. Placing meth at the root of his downfall, Cheever’s mother pleaded, “Scott didn’t do this, Meth did, he’s not a murderer, if it wasn’t for Meth I know he wouldn’t have done it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741659012454125">Finger, 2005a</xref>). Drawing on personal biography, the articles build the narrative of a “typical” small-town boy, involved in sports and his community, until victimized by meth. From working-class upbringings to “using drugs, disobeying, lying and stealing” to prison, the story reaches its sad yet familiar conclusion.</p>
<p>Importantly, the villain and victim duality intertwines both a troubled small-town boy and his cousin, a respected Sheriff, reminding none are safe from a violent drug that does not discriminate. The narrative also exposes drug war rationalities that attribute all events, such as those leading to Samuels’ murder and the eventual execution of his cousin, to pathologies of drug use. This story begins and ends with meth, as his mother urged, “Scott didn’t do this, meth did.” As we’ll see, the problem with ending the story here is that it leads predictably to “stamping down hard” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741659012454125">Hall et al., 1978</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1741659012454125">
<title>Reimagining risk</title>
<p>Closing out the year, media declared crack cocaine the “drug of choice” in Kansas. One officer claimed “We were spending so much time on meth, we didn’t have as much time to devote to other cases…Now we’re beginning to devote more resources to crack” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741659012454125">Probst, 2005</xref>). Growing from a single article, “crack replacing meth” appeared in no less than 19 newspapers, recast under headlines such as “Crack more prominent in Kansas” and “Crack outpacing meth in Kansas,” generalizing questionable assertions to the entire state and holding remarkable implication for how the public comes to know about drugs, crime and risk. Another officer’s comments, “We’re just lucky we don’t have the heroin cycle in there, like some larger areas do,” perfectly illustrate the cyclical and resilient features of drug risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741659012454125">Probst, 2005</xref>). Because of the overemphasis on meth, crack rises to fill the void. For the uncritical public, drug control becomes a game of “whack-a-mole” where law enforcement barely keeps pace with new threats as they arise.</p>
<p>Finally, late in 2005, part of the controversial Patriot Act, fittingly named the “Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act,” imposed PSE restrictions as federal law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1741659012454125">Weisheit, 2008</xref>). This does not mean the anti-meth regime dissolved or even receded from view. On the contrary, governing through meth is taken up effortlessly from one administration to the next. Moving ahead to 2007, a new Attorney General reinvigorated meth’s specter with Janus-faced warnings of “much work to be done.” He warns:<disp-quote>
<p>Despite this great accomplishment, there is still much work to be done to stop the importation and manufacturing of meth and the damage it does to our communities. We cracked down on one source of meth, but we can’t ignore the other sources. For the sake of Kansas families and children, we must put a stop to the production, importation and addiction of meth. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1741659012454125">State of Kansas, 2007</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clearly, if “families” or “children” ever use meth or have opportunities to use meth then more “work” should “be done”—here is where the crisis maintains.</p>
<p>In 2010, the “meth epidemic” appeared in political campaigns, as this testimony from that year’s Attorney General race confirms: “In the Senate, Schmidt led the charge against meth labs, child pornography, human trafficking and Medicaid fraud. He also was the lead Senate sponsor of Jessica’s Law, which puts violent child molesters in prison for life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1741659012454125">Schmidt, 2010</xref>). Proving meth’s political expediency, Schmidt featured the supposed “charge against meth labs” throughout his successful bid for Attorney General.</p>
<p>Finally, in 2010, the anti-meth regime delivered on promises of funding, as Kansas was one of just a handful of states awarded a grant from the Rural Law Enforcement Meth Initiative (RLEMI) of the economic stimulus. As part of the RLEMI, leaders developed a strategic plan with several goals to reduce meth use and production. Of the goals, “to increase public awareness” is perfectly indicative of the contradictory rationalities of the anti-meth regime:<disp-quote>
<p>Over the last five years Kansas has experienced a dramatic reduction in meth lab seizures… If the public perceives the meth problem in Kansas to be “solved”, it will be difficult to solicit necessary support for funding requests, increased treatment resources, and prevention strategies. (Kansas Task Force Addressing Methamphetamine and Illegal Drugs, 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The goal goes on to describe plans to publicize risks “as new and dangerous meth manufacturing methods such as the ‘one-pot method’ become increasingly prevalent in rural areas of the state.” Clearly, according to the plan, it is necessary to keep meth risks alive in the public’s imagination—if only for funding.</p>
<p>The small swath of history detailed here maps an important period in the local politics of drug control and social imaginaries of methamphetamine. Though presented in linear fashion, it does not suggest the “story of meth” begins or ends here, nor does it suggest these events were plotted deliberately or orchestrated by unseen forces—cause and effect. To divorce the paper from this line of reasoning, we must view these events as the residue of ongoing securitization and governance projects. Thus, we return to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741659012454125">Brown’s (2008)</xref> “sad paradox” and question how governing through meth continues inaudibly and unrelentingly long after media-driven episodes of panic fade.</p>

<title>Drug War to Terror War—Street Corner to Battlefield</title>
<p>Crafting a “meth epidemic” and attendant “war on meth” incorporates new territories, populations and bodies, into a drug war that has always been “part and parcel of colonial warfare” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741659012454125">Neocleous, 2011</xref>: 45). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741659012454125">Neocleous (2011)</xref> writes, it is through the drug war and broader “politics of security that the constant revolutionizing of production and uninterrupted disturbance of capitalist order are fabricated, structured and administered” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741659012454125">Neocleous, 2011</xref>: 192). As part of the “politics of security,” the war on meth, like the war on terror, calls for increasingly invasive legislative, policing and surveillance strategies to rein in “meth cooks” and “meth heads” said to plague local communities. As such, the “constant disturbance of all social conditions, the unremitting uncertainty and agitation of all human ties” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741659012454125">Neocleous, 2011</xref>: 198), fashioning a “permanent state of insecurity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741659012454125">Feeley and Simon, 2007</xref>: 44), are fundamental dynamics to the provision of security, pacification of populations, fabrication of order—the state itself.</p>
<p>Similarly argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741659012454125">Hallsworth and Lea (2011)</xref>, state and non-state actors fashion laws and other technologies of power under the benevolent guise of security—structuring repressive governance in dogged pursuit of “global terrorists,” “international drug and human traffickers” and “local drug dealers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741659012454125">Hallsworth and Lea, 2011</xref>). In such a “security state,” heavily armed police and unmanned surveillance drones patrol fluid boundaries of foreign and domestic security-scapes simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1741659012454125">Wall and Monahan, 2011</xref>). Accordingly, “meth-epidemics” conveniently draw once ignored places, like small towns in rural Kansas, within the burgeoning security state.</p>
<p>Marking the drift toward securitization is a tendency for social policies to identify and criminalize, rather than support needy populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741659012454125">Hallsworth and Lea, 2011</xref>). Of course, the anti-meth regime is a site where this is visible. For instance, it is now a criminal offense in the city of Parsons, Kansas, to possess pseudoephedrine without a prescription. Insisting its necessity to combat the “local meth epidemic,” Parsons’ police chief admitted, “we know this ordinance won’t cure the problem…however it will send the message to smurfers and meth heads that they are not welcome in Parsons” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741659012454125">City of Parsons, 2011</xref>). Though penalties are the same as for marijuana possession, the city’s attorney downplayed the law, speculating offenders would “probably be fined anywhere from $125 to $200 and be given a 30-day suspended jail sentence with unsupervised probation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741659012454125">Albertini, 2011</xref>). In this case, “the message” of risk and insecurity reaches all, not just the “smurfers” and “meth heads” it supposedly targets. The law’s impotence, assumed by both police and prosecutor, reveals it as a deliberately ideological “reactionary gesture to assure a worried public” rather than a sincere effort to ameliorate suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741659012454125">Garland, 2001</xref>: 134).</p>
<p>The state also recently revised child abuse laws to include meth crimes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1741659012454125">10</xref></sup> However, the new “aggravated child endangerment” statute leaves “endangerment” from all other drugs including heroin and crack as misdemeanors and substantively less serious by definition. Echoing long after sentences expire, felony crimes against children like this one exclude the convicted from various types of employment and require compliance with child abuse registries, exposing impassioned desires to distinguish meth users from the community and even from other types of drug users. Reflecting what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741659012454125">Loader (1997)</xref> calls the “power of legitimate pronouncement,” such laws articulate the state’s power to diagnose, classify and represent individuals and the world. Set aside for special punishments, meth users sit outside the law, subject to the state’s full coercion—while unworthy of its protections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1741659012454125">Spencer, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>It’s worth restating that meth is a useful case because of its unique cultural construction as a “white trash” and “rural” problem, helping unearth manifold criminalizations and securitizations outside the city and in the rural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741659012454125">Bell, 1997</xref>). That said, securitization from “meth heads” is the same as from “global jihadists”: it is only the context that changes. Therefore, it is important to consider how lawbreakers of all kinds and even “enemy combatants” fall into a single ambiguity—”an entire enemy population” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741659012454125">Hallsworth and Lea, 2011</xref>: 152). Illustrating this, George Bush’s signing statements from the “Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act” below articulates an “enemy penology” taking aim at “international terrorists” and “local drug dealers” alike:<disp-quote>
<p>This bill also will help protect Americans from the growing threat of methamphetamine. Meth is easy to make. It is highly addictive. It is ruining too many lives across our country. The bill introduces common-sense safeguards that would make many of the ingredients used in manufacturing meth harder to obtain in bulk, and easier for law enforcement to track…The bill also increases penalties for smuggling and selling of meth. Our nation is committed to protecting our citizens and our young people from the scourge of methamphetamine…<italic>The law allows our intelligence and law enforcement officials to continue to share information. It allows them to continue to use tools against terrorists that they used against—that they use against drug dealers and other criminals. It will improve our nation’s security while we safeguard the civil liberties of our people. The legislation strengthens the Justice Department so it can better detect and disrupt terrorist threats. And the bill gives law enforcement new tools to combat threats to our citizens from international terrorists to local drug dealers.</italic> (The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1741659012454125">White House, 2006</xref>, George W. Bush)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like the “Patriot Act,” frightful yet undefined warnings of the “growing threat” from the “scourge of methamphetamine” frames the act’s intrusion as a simple “tool” of protection from “terrorists…drug dealers and other criminals” and a necessary measure to improve “security” and safeguard “civil liberties.” More importantly however, Bush’s comments provide clear links between the war on terror and war on meth.</p>
<p>As securitization flows from street corners to battlefields, it stands to reason that the technologies and actions of police, even those in rural small towns, will increasingly reflect the violent logics of war. Though once relegated to policing “dogs, drunks and disorder,” small-town police enlisted in a meth war claim new tactics, funding and legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741659012454125">Payne et al., 2005</xref>). This is not all the war on meth delivers, however. Since “all legal authority ultimately rests on the threat of lawful violence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1741659012454125">Simon, 2007</xref>: 14) we should view projects of governance, especially those “through” crime, terror and meth as bound to very real potentialities, if not the promise of state violence. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1741659012454125">Figure 5</xref> plainly shows, in police “armored to fight rural meth crimes” the promise of “lawful violence” emerges in small towns of the rural Midwest—or comes into full view.</p>

<title>Securing the Rural and the Everyday</title>
<p>As part of the drift toward securitization, the anti-meth regime helps normalize coercive governance and opens up new possibilities for state and non-state functionaries to market security for consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741659012454125">Goold et al., 2010</xref>). For instance, coverage of a public “Terror Spotting” seminar in Kansas quotes a “counter-terror” specialist instructing citizens to use the same methods to “terror spot” used to locate “the meth house or the drug dealer.” She warns:<disp-quote>
<p>Who’s going to notice these indicators out in the community? Law enforcement? They can’t be everywhere all the time. They can’t be expected to be. That’s just unrealistic. That’s why classes are being created for the public to learn what to watch for…It’s not unlike recognizing the signs of other threats—such as the meth house or the drug dealer. What you’ll see with meth labs is a funny smell, cellophane over the windows, traffic going in and out. Learning to recognize tip-offs of terrorist activity is the same idea as that. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741659012454125">Finger, 2005b</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1741659012454125">Zedner (2009)</xref> warns that this sort of conflation “permits expansive interpretation and wide application…allowing sellers to peddle their wares without specifying what is on offer” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1741659012454125">Zedner, 2009</xref>: 10). As securitization imperceptibly expands, a growing cadre of “experts” like this one summon citizen hyper-vigilance, responsibilization and suspicious eye trained on vague “signs of threat.” Redolent of the budding “gang talk” industry in the United Kingdom, the garrulous expert here offers the menacing reminder that law enforcement “can’t be everywhere all the time,” pressing citizen activation in street-level securitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741659012454125">Hallsworth and Young, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, innovated in Kansas and adopted by numerous states and Canada, “Meth Watch” follows “Neighborhood Watch” logics through a coalition of retailers, police and citizens trained to identify indicators of the “illicit meth industry.” Once again premised on vigilant suspicion, Meth Watch exemplifies neoliberal securitization strategies by shifting responsibilities and costs to the community and private contractors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741659012454125">O’Malley and Palmer, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The Meth Watch sign photographed against the backdrop of a small Kansas town (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1741659012454125">Figure 6</xref>) is a street-level articulation of governing through meth logics and part of a vast securitization project swirling from “inside to the outside and back again, folding the foreign and domestic, the international and the everyday, into one another” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741659012454125">Neocleous, 2011</xref>: 45).</p>

<p>Despite facts to the contrary, risk-heavy warnings of “meth epidemics” beg all to turn inward and look on with suspicion—making the fear and discord of moral panics into everyday pressures. As the “letter to the editor” below shows, meth’s specter hangs heavy in the air and commands all to “stay safe.”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Country rentals are prime locations. Meth labs are growing every day in Kansas. Little houses in rural areas, which can be rented, are prime locations for Meth makers to hide out in. We have lost one sheriff in Greenwood County, which points how dangerous these people can be. Screen your potential renters carefully. Stay safe. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741659012454125"><italic>Lindsborg News Record</italic>, 2005</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Springing to life in the minds of a worried public, these tiny moments of intrusion fabricate a sort of governance that is “beginning to look rather unpleasant” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741659012454125">Hallsworth and Lea, 2011</xref>: 142). Standing against such unpleasantness and the drift toward securitization requires that we see things like exaggerated “meth epidemics” for what they are, deliberate attempts to foster insecurity in such a way that no price for security is too great. Cultivating a transgressive politics of “anti-security” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741659012454125">Neocleous and Rigakos, 2011</xref>) begins with recognizing and challenging the tiny moments in the drift toward securitization, wherever and whenever they emerge. I hope this paper offers such a challenge.</p>

<p>US Census Bureau and the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provide the two most commonly cited definitions. The US Census asserts a “territory, population and housing units not classified urban constitute rural,” defining urban as settlement areas with more than 2,500 residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1741659012454125">US Census Bureau, 1995</xref>). On the other hand, the OMB defines “rural areas” as those not located in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) but in a county with less than 50,000 people. “Rural states” are those with a population density of 52 or fewer persons per square mile or those in which the largest county has fewer than 150,000 people. Kansas has two cities with over 150,000 population yet still qualifies as “rural” based on population density.</p>
