<abstract>
<p>This article will explore the current evolution in the practice of cohabitation. The intent of this literature- and web-based article is to acquaint counselors with three typologies of cohabitation. These categories can be utilized in the development of psychoeducational and remedial interventions and in the identification of areas of future research.</p>

<p>No, living together before you get married is a bad idea. It’s wrong, for religious reasons. Also, so many of my peers are jumping into cohabitation in their 20’s, but this is the time of life where you should be exploring who you are, what it’s like to be independent, how to pay your own bills and get by on your own, that sort of thing.—Avery, 25</p>
<p>Moving in with your spouse only once you’ve tied the knot is asking for disappointment and inviting unnecessary stress on what should be a time for two people to seal a permanent bond with each other. It seems irresponsible and almost naive for couples to expect that their vows will be strong enough to see them through the rough spots, especially if you have to experience them all at once. Before living together, we’re really only seeing two dimensions of our partner’s personality—the third dimension might just prove to be more than one can handle.—Stephanie, 29</p>
<p>I see no harm in couples living together before marriage or without ever marrying. Living together holds no less a commitment than marriage.—Pat, 25</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These three comments represent a random selection from those submitted to online message boards on the topic of cohabitation. A quick read of the three commentaries on the issue of cohabitation seem to cover the spectrum of opinions—“no,” “yes,” and “why not?” This variance in perception is part of the coloring of the understanding of cohabitation and serves to interfere with what seems from the outside view to be a clear relational decision to share living quarters in an intimate relationship, or not. What seem confounding are the motivations of those who choose to cohabit, as those expectations serve to distinguish typologies of cohabiting relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480712449603">Murrow &amp; Shi, 2010</xref>). “The rise of cohabitation is sometimes viewed as a threat to traditional marriage because it diminishes the symbolic significance of marriage and family life in America” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480712449603">Lichter &amp; Qian, 2008</xref>, p. 861). However, this article will explore the validity of that claim.</p>
<sec id="section1-1066480712449603">
<title>Prevalence of Cohabitation</title>
<p>It is of note that research on cohabitation was relatively rare prior to the late 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480712449603">Murrow &amp; Shi, 2010</xref>). While actual numbers may have warranted attention to cohabitation as a social phenomenon and a legitimate family constellation, its study was hampered by three factors. The first reason was the mistaken notion of the relatively few numbers of cohabiting households. Cohabitations were imagined as occurring only among select groups, such as the “social fringe” whose numbers were underestimated. The second reason was the idea that cohabitation was a phase only among college-age students. The third cause, perhaps predicated on the assumption of the validity of the other two reasons mentioned, was the lack of specificity on national census forms to identify these households. It was not until the 2000 Census that a change in the naming of household categories included identification of same and opposite-gender partner households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480712449603">Inhinger-Tallman &amp; Cooney, 2005</xref>). So, any systemic study of cohabiting households could not begin until their identification and accessing became sufficiently uniform to allow researchers to proceed.</p>
<p>Initial studies explored the numbers of cohabitations, its numbers of formations and dissolutions and only recently have the research agenda expanded to include attention to relationship quality and interactions within cohabiting unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712449603">Guzzo, 2009</xref>). The Census data from 2000 and beyond is beginning to suggest a transition in normative social expectations from dating to engagement to marriage to include cohabitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480712449603">King &amp; Scott, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480712449603">Lichter &amp; Qian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480712449603">Manning, Longmore, &amp; Giordano, 2007</xref>). It was claimed that by their early 30s, over half of the unmarried population had cohabited at some point in their lives, and two third of divorced persons had done so by age 35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480712449603">Goldenberg &amp; Goldenberg, 2002</xref>). In fact, while once viewed as an aberration, cohabitation has become the norm in the United States with 70% of couples doing so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480712449603">Rhoades et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066480712449603">U.S. Census Bureau, 2007</xref>). Most young adults will cohabit and the majority of current marriages are preceded by cohabitation. However, most cohabitating couples will not marry their initial cohabiting partner and will suffer the decrease in perceptions of life satisfaction and mental health of a nonmarital breakup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480712449603">Rhoades, Dush, Atkins, Stanley, &amp; Markman, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Given this reported data it becomes evident that cohabitation “has become a relatively permanent and recognizable family structure…” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480712449603">Goldenberg &amp; Goldenberg, 2002</xref>, p. 207). However, cohabiting relationships are “incompletely institutionalized” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480712449603">National Healthy Marriage Resource Center [NHMRC], 2007</xref>, p. 4). These two statements emphasize the growing trend of cohabitation but the relative absence of guidelines on how to make cohabiting relationships positive experiences for all members. Therefore, it is essential for mental health practitioners who wish to serve cohabiting couples to grasp their absence of role models, their struggles to define how to grow their relationships, and perhaps their uncertainties as to its future. However, whether the cohabitation results as an outgrowth of dating, provides a rehearsal for marriage, or substitutes for marriage is still unclear. Because of its incidence and occurrence, cohabitation is currently viewed as “a dramatic shift in the normative transition to adulthood” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480712449603">Amato et al., 2008</xref>, p. 1271). The shift in perception of cohabitation both in societal and individual opinions from “deviant” to “normative” means that this institution has gained in both regularity and coherence. There remains considerable ambiguity as to where cohabitation fits in the overarching development of life relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480712449603">Goldenberg &amp; Goldenberg, 2002</xref>) and how the individuals in such relationships view themselves.</p>
<p>Such data are needed to expand the knowledge of clinicians and social scientists as to what the experiences of these couples may actually be, how to support healthy cohabiting relationships, assess accurately unhealthy ones, and how to promote psychoeducational and clinical interventions toward more healthy cohabitations. Moreover, this study is critical as the numbers of adolescents contemplating possible cohabitation continue to rise. A related issue involves the position or role that cohabitation for these coming generations may hold in their plans to marry or not marry.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480712449603">Manning, Longmore, and Giordano (2007)</xref> discovered that over 75% of high school seniors expected to marry and believed that a good marriage and family life are important. However, even greater numbers (88%) endorsed the value of cohabitation to determine compatibility. This intent was not a rejection of the institution of marriage but rather a reconsideration of life events that may precede marriage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480712449603">Gassanov, Nicholson, and Koch-Turner (2008)</xref> found that cohabitation, viewed as an adult role transition, was positively related to the expectation to marry with 5 years as compared to noncohabiters. Their results suggested that shared expectations between cohabiters is a critical variable in predicting the eventual marriage of the couples, but that the process of arriving at those shared expectations requires further examination. A third study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480712449603">Amato et al., 2008</xref>) echoed the previous studies that confirmed both the growing practice of cohabitation and the need for greater understanding of its motivations, practices, and influencing social variables. A fourth study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480712449603">Abowitz, Knox, Zusman, &amp; McNeely, 2009</xref>) found that men, in a great proportion of their sample than women (69.5% as compared to 59.1%) agreed that cohabitation makes for a happier marriage. While the research findings to date seem inconclusive, that data does support the growing practice of cohabitation albeit for differing motivations.</p>
<p>The sheer numbers of cohabiting households evidence that this family constellation is “a prevalent family form that makes it important to study” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066480712449603">Teitler, Reichman, &amp; Koball, 2006</xref>, p. 469). However, that study becomes complicated by conceptual ambiguities, as researchers and couples themselves are not always sure when cohabiting starts, how cycling in and out of coresidence impacts the relationship, how part-time coresidence is perceived along with the individual and conjoint meaning of the cohabitation itself.</p>

<sec id="section2-1066480712449603">
<title>The Formation of Cohabitation</title>
<p>Given the concluding statements in the previous section, it is not surprising that the formation process for cohabiting couples is not a unitary progression. The initial exploration of this joining experience must begin with college-age cohabiters. Their reasons for doing so are characteristic of that age range and psychosocial stage resolution of both developing intimacy versus isolation and navigating through the “launching” process from their families-of-origin. From a postcollege perspective, the review of the professional literature allows for the grouping of these later formation processes into three categories: prenuptial cohabiters, “testers,” and “alternatives.” Each group will be discussed separately to explain differences in formation process. It may be important to consider that college-age cohabiters may then move into one of these other three categories, as their college careers end and decisions must be faced about the future of their cohabitation.</p>
<sec id="section3-1066480712449603">
<title>College-Age Cohabiters</title>
<p>One of the unique opportunities allowed by the initial move away from home to postsecondary education or employment opportunities is that of student-age cohabitation. While most colleges require the first and perhaps second year students to reside on campus, this choice becomes more relaxed for students in their following years. So by the junior year, at least and onward, students may choose a variety of living arrangements including cohabitation. Given that the majority of high school students support this choice, the numbers of cohabiting college students would seem to be heading toward increasing. In addition, students of this age range are attending to Erikson’s task of intimacy versus isolation where dating shifts its focus from social interaction to consideration of possible marriage partners. Further, as family development theory explained (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480712449603">Carter &amp; McGoldrick, 2005</xref>), these students and others in the workforce and their family units are experiencing and experimenting with the process of the launching of late-teen-age children. Part of the launching process deals with students being exposed to life-style options and values different from the family-of-origin and input from the older peer group of college students or work colleagues rather than the high school from which they had graduated. Physical distance from home and the development of new peer reference groups offers differing models of intimate relationships, options that may or may not have been supported in the home environment.</p>
<p>To assist in understanding the cohabitation practices among college students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480712449603">Goldenberg and Goldenberg (2002)</xref> developed four categories of students who develop intimate cohabiting relationships. Given the complexity of reasons that students choose to cohabit, it may be an oversimplification to try to create concise and exclusive categories. That disclaimer provider, these titles may offer clues as to the dominant motivations by each member. The <italic>Linus-blanket</italic> cohabiters seek these relationships to avoid romantic loneliness. Based on feelings of insecurity, these students badly want to be part of a relationship. Cohabitation seems to evidence some degree of commitment from the cohabiter and a public announcement of desirability. For some students, cohabitation speaks toward <italic>emancipation</italic>. This student seeks escape and freedom from parental restraint, and cohabiting with a boy/girlfriend represents a release from concern about parental values or approval. For these students, cohabitation serves as a statement of liberation and independence. It is of interest how many students go to great lengths to conceal their cohabitations from the family-of-origin, revealing that liberation is perhaps more easily voiced from a distance. For a third group of students, cohabitation equates to <italic>convenience</italic>. The living together arrangements allows for shared economic duties, sexual monogamy, friendship, and a shared experience of college. These cohabitations tend to be short-lived, if not over at term’s end then by the end of the attainment of the academic degree. Any of the prior three types of cohabiters could also transition into the fourth category, that of <italic>testing</italic> types. These individuals plan to marry and the cohabitation is a courtship phenomenon. Seen as a temporary prelude, these older, more mature students are ready to make commitment to marriage with the cohabiting partner. However, they still need to overcome roadblocks such as parental disapproval of partner, low income, or graduation. Graduate or professional school education complicates this timetable and may cause each member to reevaluate the relationship’s progress toward the anticipated marriage. These typologies are helpful when both members approach the cohabitation from similar perspectives. However, there is no known extrapolation on the blending of individuals with differing rationales within one cohabiting union.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1066480712449603">
<title>Prenuptial Cohabiters</title>
<p>As the labeling implies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480712449603">Goldenberg and Goldenberg (2002)</xref> described this group as those for whom marriage is definitely planned but the precise timing of the ceremony is uncertain. So, these relationships could also be described as “postengagement,” usually with a mutually agreed upon list of life accomplishments needing completion before the marriage. Sample accomplishments may include but not be limited to graduation from advanced study, securing a specific employment opportunity, the discharge of financial obligations such as student loans or repayments to parents, and so on. For this group, cohabiting is the first stage of marriage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480712449603">Inhinger-Tallman and Cooney (2005)</xref> described this relationship as a “trial marriage.” However, that term implies that should the trial end poorly, the marriage would be cancelled, and such an outcome seems rarer among cohabiters who have advertised their engagement and marriage plans. Fully 50% of cohabiting couples begin living together postengagement and see themselves as definitely marriage bound. Cohabiting roles may be less conventional than marital roles, but these dynamics may be a factor of the age of these persons rather than their living situation. It would be of interest to follow prenuptial collaborators through the initial years of marriage to see whether their views of self as partner change with the title to husband or wife.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1066480712449603">
<title>“Testers”</title>
<p>As compared to those couples described in the previous category, this group is less certain about marriage, particularly to the person with whom he or she may be cohabiting. Marriage remains a possibility, but preengagement cohabiting becomes a “test” of the couple’s compatibility. For those uncertain about marriage, then cohabiting may be the last stage in courtship. These couples may “slide into cohabitation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480712449603">Rhoades et al., 2009b</xref>) without discussing what cohabitation means for the future of the relationship. This process of “sliding” may consist of the majority of the couple’s time spent at one domicile over the over, with the accumulation of one’s person’s possessions in that space to make that shared time easier. At some point, a discussion may arise about the financial drain of maintaining two homes, given the amount of time spent in only one. This discussion may then lead over time to the relinquishing of one home and the sharing of the other. While the financial gain may be clear, the relational purpose of such a move remains less concise. This lack of conjoint clarity on the purpose of the cohabitation and the possibility of future marriage increases the chances for marriage based on financial, pregnancy, or social constraints among those who might not otherwise marry if not already living together. There seems an implicit tension within the testing process, as each member may be unclear what personality and relationship dynamics are under scrutiny and how he/she is being evaluated by his or her partner. There may be an uncertainty of when or how a decision to marry or to dissolve the relationship would occur.</p>
<p>Based on the possibility of marriage in general and perhaps within a specific relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712449603">Guzzo, 2009</xref>) this type of cohabitation could be event driven (such as a job loss) or relationship driven (as the final step in dating), so the role of intention, which is a strong predictor of future action, has yet to be studied. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480712449603">Brown (2000)</xref> found that most cohabiters expect to marry their current partners. And those who expect to marry are more likely to do so than those who do not voice such an expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066480712449603">McGinnis, 2003</xref>). However expectations are confounded by the quality of the relationship when those questions about the expectations were asked. Expectations become even more predictive when translated into intentions which represent concrete plans of action and are closer to actual behavior. While partners may differ on expectations, there must be a consensus on intentions for such plans to have been formulated. How equal the input from each cohabiting partner and how these plans were initiated or developed over time is as of yet undiscovered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1066480712449603">
<title>Alternatives</title>
<p>Another group of cohabiters are those with no interest in marriage, either to the specific partner or in marriage as a social institution. These persons prefer the sexual, domestic, and legal freedoms in cohabiting. Among those who do not plan to consider marriage, the reasons include marriage being seen as too confining, a practical matter to allow for the continuation of alimony payments from a prior marriage, a fearfulness of making mistakes from a first marriage over again, along with problems with value conflicts. Among this group, but distinctly different from those who choose this lifestyle in their early adult years are the cohabiting older adults. Postdivorce or widowhood, these individuals are wanting companionship and a romantic relationship but not wanting to merge finances or risk marital failure. Instead, they face the disapproval of adult children who are concerned about the new partner replacing that departed parent or are concerned about the safety of the parent or of one’s inheritance.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1066480712449603">
<title>Implications for Clinical Practice</title>
<p>The organization of the unique aspects of cohabitations can be grouped into three domains: those referring to intrapsychic or individual issues, interpersonal issues pertaining to the relationship, and intersystemic issues in relation to other social systems.</p>
<sec id="section8-1066480712449603">
<title>Implication for Individual Counseling</title>
<p>Among intrapsychic issues, cohabiters need to shed moral inhibitions ingrained in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480712449603">Fields, 2001</xref>), and, among older cohabiters, deal with the squeamishness of children and longtime friends. Part of the dynamic of the establishment of a cohabiting relationship is resolving any teachings about the need for marriage, or in the case of the prenuptial cohabiters, to wait until the marriage actually occurs. There is little research to support additional personal value conflicts among cohabiters but it may be hypothesized that concerns such as a need for independence over affiliation, the priority of career, the decision to delay parenting, until or if the union becomes legal, and so on may confront each individual. In addition, it may be supposed that cohabiters hold the notion that their relationship is based on love and commitment, not any legal constraint against leaving. So the question might then be posed, under what circumstances might one considers the cohabitation a sufficient enough “failure” or personal disappointment to evaluate its dissolution?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1066480712449603">
<title>Implications for Relational Counseling</title>
<p>Cohabiting couples also share unique relational opportunities. A generic opportunity to develop their relational guidelines apart from traditional marital roles is a major component. While most persons hold preconceived notions of husband and wife role, no such notions exist for the roles of live-in boy friend/girl friend. This idea does bring to mind the question of how to refer to each other, spouse would be illegal, perhaps partner? Significant other? However named, the cohabitation does allow the couple to practice role equality as cohabitation seems distinguished from marriage by more egalitarian role enactments. Cohabitations tend to allow individuals to share expenses without merging financial assets. For the purposes of student loans (care payments, credit card debt, etc.), each cohabiting individual is seen as single. This idea may be attractive to those on fixed incomes, or who worry about assuming the financial obligations of their partners. There also seem to be the peer support of other cohabiting couples as the establishment of such a union would seem to sacrifice single friends yet exclude the couple from connection with married couples. This sort of social connection and exclusion would need to be supported through study but the distinction between single-cohabiting-married might allow for the existence of three separate spheres of peer support but little overlap between the social systems. The cohabiting union may allow the couple to eliminate any illusions regarding marriage, if one is planned. By cohabiting the couple may reorder the stage of marriage to address initial day-to-day arrangements and lifestyles prior to, rather than after, the honeymoon. Additionally, among the divorced, cohabitation may ensure that the mistakes that doomed the previous marriage are not replicated. Finally it is easier, at least legally, to dissolve cohabitation than a marriage, but perhaps the emotional cost is similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480712449603">Rhoades et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1066480712449603">
<title>Implications for Social Issues Around Cohabitation</title>
<p>The cohabiting union also interacts with other social institutions. Those in cohabiting relationships lack formal recognition by the legal system, medical care, and health insurance companies. In the case of relational dissolution, there are no legal safeguards for either party or no legal recourse for how to divide assets, address any child care issues, and so on. In states or companies without negotiated “partner benefits,” the cohabiter may be barred from hospital visits, input into medical treatment, and so on in favor of the family-of-origin of his/her partner. From a financial perspective, cohabitation protects against the loss of military and pension benefits that would have been lost in a remarriage. In addition, for partners receiving alimony, the cohabitation status does not equate to a remarriage and thus allow the exspouse to petition the court for cessation of those payments. As stated previously, as financial institutions view each cohabiter as single, an individual’s credit rating is protected from any financial issues of one’s partner. Finally, the establishment of a cohabiting union may separate the couple from faith-based definitions of marriage and the benefits enjoyed by those unions within faith communities.</p>
<p>In summary, cohabiters are confronted with three categories of issues, each or all of which may surprise them. While the nature of cohabitation itself precludes ready-made answers, perhaps awareness of these issues, both by the individuals who are cohabiting and the mental health professionals who seek to serve them, will allow for meaningful discussions of how they can be resolved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1066480712449603">
<title>Suggestions for Psychoeducational Interventions</title>
<p>The very idea of preventive or psychoeducational intervention planning seems inconsistent with the practice of “sliding into cohabitation.” The principle underlying psychoeducational intervention assumes an anticipated transition for which one can prepare in advance. However, with the exception of those who cohabitate postengagement announcement, the remainder of this group seems ambiguous as to when the cohabitation begins. Given this uncertainty, perhaps the optimum venue for the developing of awareness around cohabitation might be on the college setting in residence hall, orientation, meetings, and so on. In such avenues, no one is being identified as cohabiting, nor is the idea being implanted in their minds that such a living arrangement is being advocated by the institution, but rather that cohabitation seems to be a normative and growing experience for upper-class students and insight into specific concerns may allow those who will consider this living arrangement in the future some clarity into its covert issues.</p>
<p>Given the provided categories of cohabiters, the initial agenda could explore the precise reasons for each partner’s choice of cohabiting and, if relevant, for cohabitation over marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480712449603">Murrow &amp; Shi, 2010</xref>). Such reasons may include fear of long-term commitment, fear of being formally tied to partner’s psychological problems, unwillingness to assume a partner’s debits, or unwillingness to share an inheritance with someone of more modest means. If marriage is an option then the question becomes what each member needs to experience from the relationship and as a partner to either decide to move toward the marriage or dissolve the cohabitation. There may exist underlying yet unexamined conflicts as to personal values around what is still seen as an unorthodox living arrangement between unmarried adults. The research to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480712449603">Abowitz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712449603">Guzzo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480712449603">Rhoades et al., 2009a</xref>) does allow the clinician to offer four clear messages during these educational sessions. The first message centers on the hazards of serial cohabitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480712449603">Lichter &amp; Qian, 2008</xref>). Each subsequent cohabitation becomes easier to dissolve or perhaps the scrutiny provided to the quality of the relationship and its possible future becomes more negative with each failed cohabitation. However, the years in one’s life are disappearing with each dissolved cohabitation. Second, the focus may be on each partner’s view of marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480712449603">Rhoades et al., 2009b</xref>), if a possibility at all, and under what circumstances. Third, those circumstances ought not to involve children of the cohabitation. Too often children are seen as a reason to marry and the strain of parenting further weakens an unsteady marital relationship to the point where divorce occurs. Fourth, those circumstances cannot include doubts about the future of the cohabitation, with the mistaken impression that marriage will correct all the problems in the relationship. The research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480712449603">Amato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480712449603">Brown, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480712449603">Hewitt &amp; DeVaus, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480712449603">Hseuh, Morrison, &amp; Doss, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066480712449603">Tach &amp; Halpern-Meeking, 2009</xref>) clearly indicated that poor quality cohabitations lead to even poorer quality marriages. While these messages may not be immediately relevant to all members of the audience, it can be hoped that their presentation will remain sufficiently present so that when issues of cohabitation may arise, those arrangements are given more thought than simply into whose home the couple ought to move.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480712449603">Goldenberg and Goldenberg (2002)</xref> reported that many couples may come for services with unresolved relationship-formation questions such as those detailed in the previous section.</p>
<p>In addition to the relationship-maintenance and enhancement issues common to couples, the cohabitation as a unique family constellation offers specific concerns. The partners may bring differing views of autonomy and connectedness. While a common concern in marriages, at least there are role models for how to try to balance these forces. In cohabiting relationships no such examples exist. Another issue may revolve around the acceptability of the union among family, friends, coworkers, and religious affiliation. Among perhaps more conservative groups in society, there is a negative social stigma attached to cohabiting, especially a union in which the eventuality of marriage seems vague. Partners may be uncertain how to refer to each other—girl/boyfriend, housemate, lover, significant other, or domestic partner, in introductions and as communication of the legitimacy of the relationship. Among cohabiting unions with children from a previous relationship comes the stress and questions around parenting of other’s children. The partners may hold vastly differing expectations regarding the future of the cohabitation, where it is headed, and how to get there and on what timetable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480712449603">Murrow &amp; Shi, 2010</xref>). Finally, the very act of terminating the relationship becomes confusing again for lack of legal guidance or role model; how might a relationship with no legal status be legally dissolved. If not legally ended, might partners have future recourse to claim monies, children, or inheritances, and so on. In addition, what claim does the biological parent have for a child with whom he is no longer residing, and what responsibility does that father still hold to financially support the child?</p>

<title>Suggestions for Supportive Interventions</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480712449603">Goldenberg and Goldenberg (2002)</xref> estimated that cohabiting couples represent 13% of all couples seeking help. Their clinical issues are similar to those found in any marriage plus the underlying uncertainty of a nonengagement cohabitation or even one in which the engagement was announced but the formation of the wedding plans seems to be unaddressed. Couples also need help with the maintenance and growth of individuality and of relationship. There is no husband or wife role to assume, hopefully a parent role remains in the future, so how does each member self-define, what can each provide and receive form the relationship. If the couple is not marriage focused, members may voice ambivalence around a wish for security, attachment, togetherness, commitment and dependence versus autonomy, freedom, independence and personal growth or experimentation. In addition, one or both members may need help in dealing with the added stress of using the relationship as a test for marriage.</p>
<p>Clinicians are advised to be sensitive to family histories in terms of previous cohabitations or whether this union represents a departure from the tradition of forming romantic unions. Given a lack of history on which to base an exploration of past cohabitation in families-of-origin, present narratives allow the couple to hear each other and identify common areas of agreement and dispute. By adapting a here-and-now orientation of focus on couple interactions, couples’ strengths and potential issues of division can be legitimized and perhaps resolved. The content of this particular section would greatly benefit from published outcome studies confirming the greater efficacy of specific models of couples/family intervention. However, as of the preparation of this section in December, 2011, no such studies are as of yet available. Therefore, just as the individuals who form a cohabitation have few guidelines on which to proceed, so too do family-focused clinicians.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The identified growth in their numbers and the emerging social acceptance of cohabiting couples corresponds with an increase in the differences between cohabiters, especially regarding their motivations and rationales. From a societal perspective, the expansion in the practice of cohabitation seems to represent a change in social choices which demands a sensitivity and responsiveness of mental health professionals to honor their similarities to marriage and their unique characteristics. As with the evolution of any new social institution, there is imprecision about its guidelines, purpose, and future. Advocating for both interpersonal and intrapersonal health of all persons involved in cohabiting unions ensures that the clinician will attend to both client needs and professional standards of conduct in supporting critical life choices and decisions.</p>
