<abstract>
<p>In France, discourse on communitarianism produces historical, cultural and political codes that influence how political actors behave. As such, it plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of the political activism of ‘visible minorities’. This article will explore the process by which communitarianism is deployed to re-present the demands for equality of ‘visible minorities’ as expression of disaffection, while simultaneously validating the democratic neutrality of French institutions. Thus, communitarianism has become an effective discourse to delegitimise discussion about race-based institutional inequality and minimise minority political agency.</p>

<p>When asked why he uses the term communitarianism so often, Ronald responds: ‘I say it so that people will better understand me. It is a word that was given to us. I don’t even know what the meaning would be in the dictionary. It’s a word they make me say’. (Lambert, interview, 2007)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In France, ‘communitarianism’ (<italic>communautarisme</italic>), or what is sometimes used as its English equivalent, ‘ethnic factionalism’, is a discursive tool that functions as a symbolic cultural formation. In the interview cited in the epigraph, a young man from Paris (Ronald Lambert) provides an example of the commonplace usage of the word <italic>communautarisme</italic> in France. He repeatedly uses the term to describe why one ethnic group dominates certain occupations or to describe how one group may be favoured over another. He also uses the term to differentiate the ways in which contemporary society has become more communitarian than when he was growing up in the 1970s and 1980s. For example, he describes his parents’ almost exclusive association with Antilleans since their arrival in the 1950s from Martinique as ‘living in communitarianism’. The term communitarianism produces cultural, historical and political codes that heavily influence discursive structure and impacts on how the demands of political actors are presented and understood. Emirbayer and Goodwin provide a critique of the theoretical limitation of network analysis in social movement literature by broadening how ‘historical processes of social change’ are understood and argue that symbolic cultural formations, defined as cultural narratives, idioms and discourses, ‘constrain actors by preventing certain arguments from being articulated in public discourse or once articulated, from being favorably interpreted by others or even understood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957155813477806">Emirbayer and Goodwin, 1994</xref>: 1440). Fundamental to their critique is the assertion that the network perspective is an inadequate means for conceptualising human agency and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957155813477806">1994</xref>: 1413) given that it neglects ‘the significance of cultural and political discourses in history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957155813477806">1994</xref>: 1425) and fails to ‘pay insufficient attention to the structuring influences of cultural and political discourses upon historical actors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957155813477806">1994</xref>: 1426). Their theory provides a framework for understanding how discursive obstacles ultimately determine limits to political activism among visible minorities in France.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the 2005 uprisings in France, associations such as the Conseil Représentatif des Associations Noires (CRAN) and the Indigènes de la République (along with many others) emerged. They were led by minorities and became vocal advocates for a Republican society that would permit equal access and equality for all. Yet within the French public sphere their approach to equality, which draws significant attention to institutional racism, is often associated with particularist intent and thus deemed anti-universalist. This linkage between awareness of how race operates as a social construct to marginalise visible minorities and accusations of particularist intent has been used to reinforce the image of French universal exceptionalism against the demands of minority activists by framing minority demands as communitarianist intent. Communitarianism has become an effective discourse to delegitimise public inquiry into race-based institutional inequality and effectively minimises minority political agency.</p>
<sec id="section1-0957155813477806">
<title>Communitarianism</title>
<p>France has a particular way of interpreting communitarianism that is tailored to its understanding of the democratic community as composed of one unified group guarding against the politicisation of separate communities. <italic>Le Petit Robert</italic> dictionary first defined communitarianism in 1993 as ‘a system that develops a formation of communities (ethnic, religious, cultural, social) that can divide the nation to the detriment of integration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957155813477806">Lévy, 2005</xref>: 21). Communitarianism has become a term used primarily to define, symbolise and warn against perceived intent by minority groups to create distinct and separate communities and specific racial/ethnic political demands in violation of Republican norms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0957155813477806">1</xref></sup> It operates as a discourse applied to immigrant communities, as well as Muslim, black, gay and Jewish communities, among others.</p>
<p>Anti-communitarian discourse challenges the operation of communitarianism in French society. Anti-communitarian discourse asserts that recognising group demands would fracture the Republican community and create discord within the nation itself. This idea is grounded in the notion that France lacks any institutional bias towards visible minorities. Anti-communitarianists claim that physical differences have no meaning in Republican society. Those who refute these claims are perceived as subverting the success of Republican colour-blind society. Anti-communitarian discourse upholds the image of a non-racial, colour-blind society and helps to distinguish French Republicanism as exceptional. France is presented as fundamentally distinct from other Western societies perceived as communitarianist, namely the US and the UK. Anti-communitarianists are therefore tasked with protecting unique universal French values from the encroaching ideas of the Anglo-Saxon world.</p>
<p>Anti-communitarianists declare that communitarianists exemplify what is unacceptable and what is at stake if Republican principles are not defended. This process has produced a binary in which the Republic is represented as the good in a Manichean struggle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957155813477806">Tevanian, 2008</xref>). Anti-communitarianists represent ‘incontestable principles’ of French Republicanism defended by ‘rational discourse’. Communitarianists become representations of ‘du côté du mal’ whose claims are irrational and undemocratic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957155813477806">Tevanian, 2008</xref>). As Lévy asserts, ‘Communitarianism is not a political philosophy, but is a “<italic>motif polémique</italic>”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957155813477806">2005</xref>: 10). No longer do monarchy or feudalism represent the opposite of Republicanism: that role has now been assigned to communitarianism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957155813477806">Lévy, 2005</xref>: 51). There is a close link between the representation of communitarianism as a threat <italic>and</italic> affirmation of a democratic Republican society.</p>

<title>Visible minority activism and communitarianism</title>
<p>The discursive sphere is a crucial location for contestation over democratic ideals through the language and symbolism evoked by communitarianism. Beyond the manner in which communitarianism serves as a marker determining approaches to democratic norms, it also acts as a means of determining what constitutes acceptable political discourse and action. The impact of anti-communitarian discourse on political discourse and action can be further understood through <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957155813477806">Stuart Hall’s (2001)</xref> summary of Foucault’s definition of discourse:
<disp-quote>
<p>[Discourse] governs the way that a topic can be meaningfully talked about and reasoned about. It also influences how ideas are put into practice and used to regulate the conduct of others, defining an acceptable and intelligible way to talk, write or conduct oneself, so also by definition, it ‘rules out’, limits and restricts other ways of talking, of conducting ourselves in relation to the topic or constructing knowledge about it. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957155813477806">Hall, 2001</xref>: 73)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The discourse of anti-communitarianism has produced knowledge and specific language that functions in a way that rules out, limits and restricts references to minority groups or demands perceived to be incapable of representing reasonable ideals in a Republican context.</p>
<p>After the 2005 uprisings, minority organisations such as the CRAN and the Indigènes de la République began asserting demands for eliminating systemic processes marginalising often fully integrated minorities from the national community as a crucial step towards fulfilling universal democratic ideals. These responses were met with accusations of anti-communitarianism and re-framed by critics as symbolic of a broader effort to create distinct racial communities within the Republican nation and therefore introduce ‘Anglo-Saxon’ forms of classification, or worse, a form of cultural and differentialist neo-racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957155813477806">Taguieff, 1988</xref>). The tension between minority demands and anti-communitarian discourse has given rise to a contentious discursive space in which powerful emotional reactions are evoked by the mere mention of communitarianism. This discursive context has in turn limited the effectiveness of the political demands of minority groups, which are immediately understood through the cultural narrative of communitarianism as threatening the unity of the Republic.</p>

<title><italic>Repli communautaire</italic>: distinguishing the ‘beur’ movement from SOS Racisme</title>
<p>Communitarianism began developing into a symbolic cultural formation during the 1980s in the guise of the ‘beur’ movement. This new type of movement, for the most part made up of the children of North African immigrants, called upon this second generation to demand recognition as equal French citizens, and developed into a genuine grassroots Republican movement demanding the application of Republican universalism vis-à-vis all citizens. The ‘beur’ identity was not used by activists to indicate distance from universal ideals of the nation – ideals which they basically embraced. Rather, the ‘beurs’ advocated an improved understanding of the ways in which they were victims of a growing racist environment that disrupted access to education and housing and that was especially prevalent in relations with the police. They constructed a broad-based participatory movement across ethnic and racial lines with African, Antillean, Portuguese and Asian French grassroots organisations, as well as immigrant organisations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957155813477806">Silverstein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957155813477806">Bouamama, 1994</xref>). Although the goals of the movement were equality and an end to racism, it came to be interpreted by the media as being ethnically based, thus obfuscating efforts to create an independent movement founded on broad inclusiveness. Their new approach to contentious politics came to be understood as both a threat and evidence of <italic>repli communautaire</italic>, namely a withdrawal from Republican society.</p>
<p>By the late 1980s the ‘beur’ movement had significantly weakened for a variety of reasons, including external political pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957155813477806">Bouamama, 1994</xref>). After the decline of the ‘beur’ movement, SOS Racisme became the predominant anti-racist association and was considered its Republican successor. SOS Racisme proved to be extraordinarily popular and excited a new generation of activists, uniting political actors, journalists and intellectuals while simultaneously defining a new approach to anti-racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957155813477806">Juhem, 2007</xref>). In comparison to groups that mobilised upon a ‘beur’, Franco-Maghrebi or <italic>banlieue</italic> youth identity, and that were perceived as representing the interests of a single community, SOS Racisme were self-consciously pluri-cultural and its message and political strategy therefore appealed to French youths of all origins and it was able to gain popular and elite support. Many ‘beurs’ denounced SOS Racisme’s anti-racist slogans as insufficient to address the structural mechanisms and historical antagonisms that oppressed and excluded postcolonial minority immigrant youth and rebuffed political overtures as cooption, but SOS Racisme limited itself to a simple resonant moral message that tended to equate racism with the extreme right and was willing to work closely with Socialist ministers and the President’s top advisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155813477806">Blatt, 1997</xref>: 45).</p>
<p>SOS Racisme was founded in part as a means to reaffirm the anti-racist values of the Left and make it possible for it alone to define ‘le terrain des libertés’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957155813477806">Juhem, 2007</xref>: 12). Its close relationship with the Parti Socialiste ensured the success of this strategy and the organisation soon became ‘ideologically omnipresent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957155813477806">Taguieff, 1988</xref>). When SOS Racisme assumed leadership of the anti-racist movement, it shifted the rhetoric on anti-racism towards two main platforms: firstly, a symbolic call for an end to racism, and, secondly towards legislative action on immigrant rights, particularly the right to vote. It also defended what it called <italic>droit à la différence</italic> – in other words that immigrant culture in general should be respected and immigrants should have the right to maintain the <italic>difference</italic> of their culture. At the time, these ideas were not considered to be a threat to Republicanism. However, SOS Racisme’s ‘mild form of multiculturalism, labelled <italic>droit à la différence</italic> … proved to be short lived’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957155813477806">Hargreaves and McKinney, 1997</xref>: 20). In an environment where the National Front was making significant political gains ‘even the soft form of multiculturalism promoted by SOS Racisme came to be seen as dangerous’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155813477806">Blatt, 1997</xref>: 46). There was growing consensus within the discursive space that the Republican model was breaking down, thus producing a more fragmented, Anglo-Saxon-style society.</p>

<title>Republican consensus as anti-communitarianist discourse</title>
<p>In the following section I will draw upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155813477806">David Blatt’s (1997)</xref> theory on Republican consensus to demonstrate how a backlash against the idea of the right to difference and the multiculturalism proposed by SOS Racisme helped develop a unique discourse of communitarianism. To do so, I will explain how the Republican consensus, assisted by the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957155813477806">Pierre-André Taguieff (1988)</xref> helped incite a backlash against SOS Racisme and the right to difference. The political climate at the time, hostile to perceived threats to republicanism, helped develop communitarianism into a cultural idiom with a distinct narrative and its own ‘autonomous inner logic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957155813477806">Emirbayer and Goodwin, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>By the mid 1980s there was growing discomfort around the applicability of SOS Racisme’s ideas. The Front National (FN) was now a political reality and in fact was gaining ground with anti-immigrant rhetoric that declared postcolonial immigrants and their children unable to assimilate and a threat to the Republic. Politicians and intellectuals, primarily from the Left, responded with what has been termed a ‘Republican consensus’ – an effort by the Left to regain control of discourse on immigration and difference so as to avoid ‘the fragmentation of the nation into separate and hostile ethnically based communities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155813477806">Blatt, 1997</xref>: 46). The Republican consensus or the ‘reassertion of the republican model’, simultaneously rejected the
<disp-quote>
<p>exclusionary conception of the nation associated with the far right, which saw immigrants as inassimilable and called for their expulsion; and a multicultural conception of the nation associated with factions of the left and immigrant rights activists, which encouraged the preservation of minorities’ cultural identities … By endorsing a middle ground between opposite poles, mainstream political elites sought to consensualize and depoliticize the explosive immigration debate, which boosted the Front National each time it erupted. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155813477806">Blatt, 1997</xref>: 48–9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This Republican consensus would have acute repercussions for minority activists:
<disp-quote>
<p>The consensus in favor of the republican model of integration has hindered and weakened subsequent efforts by minorities to develop an organized, collective presence in the French political arena. As resistance to ethnicity hardened, minority organisations that challenged the republican model wound up politically marginalized … With few exceptions, minority actors have been denied even a consultative role in the formulation of immigrant-related policy, for fear that this would encourage the emergence of ethnic politics. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155813477806">Blatt, 1997</xref>: 50)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The consensus helped solidify the idea that any measure of ethnic identity was threatening to the Republic. It allowed the Left to regain moral authority in the discursive space and attack the FN on immigration without being portrayed as supporting differentialist policies.</p>
<p>The Republican consensus was a crucial development, but, considered alone, fails to capture how the practice of re-emphasising Republican values contributed to a blurring of the lines between the distinct approaches to multiculturalism presented by SOS Racisme and by the ‘beur’ movement. The Republican consensus had the effect of ultimately establishing anti-racism (represented by SOS Racisme and the ‘beur’ movement) as a differentialist ideology. This failure to distinguish between approaches matters though, since characterising and equating the call for equality of the beur movement as expressions of difference and demands for specific community privileges fails to understand how multiculturalism as a right to difference presented by SOS Racisme is a quite distinct proposition. The Republican consensus exacerbated anti-communitarian sentiment, and transformed the claims of SOS Racisme and the ‘beur’ movement into discourse and ideology whereby calls for equality are reduced to demands for ethnic difference. This period produced a powerful lasting discourse which firmly established the notion within the collective consciousness of the nation that any political activity emerging from ethnic or racial groups constituted expressions of communitarianism and were therefore anti-Republican. Works such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957155813477806">Pierre-André Taguieff’s <italic>The Force of Prejudice: On Racism and its Doubles</italic> (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957155813477806"><italic>La Force du préjugé: essai sur le racisme et ses doubles</italic>, 1988)</xref> helped incite broader criticism of anti-racism. Prior to Taguieff’s publications, criticism of multiculturalism had generally come from the Right, but he helped transform fairly disconnected expressions of anti-communitarianism into a more active, refined and directed discourse targeting differentialism/multiculturalism and principles of anti-racism which the Left had embraced. Taguieff argued that anti-racism was an ideology that mirrored the ideology of racism and that both anti-racism and racism shared the same ‘differentialist problematic’ by essentialising differences and reinforcing hierarchy: ‘Antiracism and racism in some way form a system, feed each other with themes, arguments, metaphors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957155813477806">2001</xref>: 210). In the process of constructing his argument, minority demands became distorted by the conflation of the right to difference and equality, and in effect Taguieff positions firmly Republican demands for equality as anti-Republican differentialist ideology.</p>
<p>Taguieff does recognise ‘beur’ mobilisation as promoting equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957155813477806">Taguieff, 2001</xref>: 8), yet still considers their approach to be a form of ‘marginalist’ and ‘contestatory’ anti-racist ideology, while SOS Racisme is thought to promote a ‘consensual’ form of such ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957155813477806">Taguieff, 2001</xref>: 252). For Taguieff ideology corresponds to ‘a system of representing the world, even of explaining its being and becoming; and it is a system of norms and imperatives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957155813477806">2001</xref>: 14). Anti-racism is in part a process of self-racialisation or the essentialisation of individuals belonging to a group, and ‘Self-racialisation derives its energy from a specific passion: the unconditional fear of the Other, the anguish identifiable with the feeling of absolute insecurity … it reassures self-identity, achieving the function of self-assurance through overvalorisation of proper identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957155813477806">Taguieff, 2001</xref>: 123). Therefore, ‘the central political inadequacy of antiracism [is] the impasse in the <italic>communitarian fact</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957155813477806">2001</xref>: 209), whereby the interconnectivity of community, individualism and race form an ideology that is perceived as equally threatening to Republican ideals as racism would be. In fact, Taguieff collapses ‘beur’ demands for equality with racial ideology. ‘Beur’ activists represented a set of demands rather than an ideology which had the effect of producing a normative assumption that a set of race-aware demands – demands or arguments which demonstrate how skin colour and postcolonial status are crucial to producing socio-economic inequalities – correspond to a form of differentialist ideology.</p>
<p>Naturally, race-aware activists demand that policy measures are implemented to address racism and racial discrimination. Once race-aware demands become redefined as ideology they become a greater threat to Republicanism and a greater target for criticism. Demands for equality are thus fundamentally misunderstood as divisive and ‘Far from provoking any appeasement of the cultural and ideological wars, antiracism reanimates and stirs them up, hence giving the lie to its declarations of intention with its real effects’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957155813477806">Taguieff, 2001</xref>: 15). Race-aware demands for equality are understood to instigate and incite racial tensions and reinforce the essentialism and individualism of self-racialised communities. Taguieff’s arguments set off a wave of criticism aimed at SOS Racisme and turned public opinion against SOS Racisme’s interpretation of multiculturalism. Prior to Taguieff’s work, SOS Racisme’s position on multiculturalism and the right to difference had seemed virtually unassailable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957155813477806">Juhem, 2007</xref>), but by using Taguieff’s positions, ‘journalists could adopt a critical position against SOS Racisme by using the theme of differentialism which allowed them to consider SOS Racisme a communitarianist association’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957155813477806">Juhem, 2007</xref>: 163). By the early 1990s, multiculturalism was demonised in the discursive space, and SOS Racisme driven to redefine its thinking within the scope of more traditional anti-racist organisations. As Blatt observes ‘organisations, more concerned with gaining political respectability, couched their efforts in terms congruent with the republican model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957155813477806">1997</xref>: 50). The organisation reconstituted its demands and embraced Republican norms, particularly during the debate on ethnic statistics. At the same time, race-aware mobilisers have not avoided the label of communitarianism assigned to them despite attempts to demonstrate adherence to Republican norms.</p>
<p>In many ways, communitarianism has developed into a kind of cultural idiom and can be considered as a symbolic cultural formation which impacts organisational opportunities for political actors. The idea that race-aware demands were communitarianist, seeking specific demands for particular groups, and therefore unfit for the Republican space, were reified in the public sphere, thus ignoring or denying the fact that mobilised French minority citizens were demanding equality, not separation or special treatment within the Republic. These are important elements for explaining the nature of political marginalisation produced by anti-communitarian discourse that speaks to the consistent characterisation of race-aware demands as differentialist, while also underscoring the extraordinary difficulties of race-aware arguments from gaining legitimacy in France.</p>

<title>Anti-communitarianism and community: invalidation of political expression</title>
<p>In the period after the 2005 uprisings we have been able to witness a re-emergence of political activism among visible minorities. Anti-communitarianist discourse has continued to re-frame and re-define political activity within marginalised communities as symbols of irrationality and difference. Yet significant transition can be observed given that the expression of alienation and frustration in these spaces is today confused with the desire to separate from the national community rather than exclusively challenging the notion of representative democracy and inclusion in France. Interviews with prominent artists such as Samuel Légitimus (2009) and Simon Njami (2009) help illustrate the sustained misapplied linkage between perceptions of community and fear of communitarianism.</p>
<p>Samuel Légitimus is the founder of the James Baldwin Collective. His family, of Antillean origin, has been prominent in arts and politics in France since the nineteenth century. One of the James Baldwin Collective’s programmes involves working with youth in the <italic>banlieue</italic> to introduce them to African-American literature and to improve their understanding of social inequalities in France, the US and throughout the diaspora. Légitimus has argued for the creation of a black Arts Centre in Paris that would reflect the cultures of the Caribbean, Africa and North America. Such a centre would help francophone artists, writers and creators develop ‘a clear and coherent vision of our history. We must acquire a sharper consciousness of the great historic and cultural movements of the black world’ (Légitimus, interview, 2009) and ‘There is something wrong with a country that does not believe in the vitality of a community’ (Interview, 2009). Community expressed through culture provides a sanctuary for individuals who are alienated from the wider society, and rather than a separation there is actually a reinforcement of citizenship and an enhancement of the sentiment of belonging as a result of such activities. These activities need to be understood as dynamic processes in which the nation can evolve by challenging the traditional historical narrative that limits the recognition of slavery, colonialism and postcolonialism. Communities and individuals can learn about their contributions to the nation and claim visibility within art, culture and history. Légitimus explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>In France if you say ‘I am not black I am universal’ the French applaud, because you are not an enemy and you are not going to create problems. You are Republican. But as soon as you start to say I know my history they say stop it is finished. To prove that you are Republican you must show that you are not <italic>enfermé dans la race</italic>. Race translated into French does not have the same meaning as it does in English. In France it is taboo. Ethnicity or identity works but race is too harsh.

<p>Misunderstanding the purpose and nature of community, alongside the pervasive fear of race, helps mask racial inequalities behind the dominant and flawed image of universalism.</p>
<p>Simon Njami, the celebrated author, co-founder and editor of the journal <italic>Revue Noire</italic>, speaks to a lack of historical foundation for marginalised minorities which produces a sense of confusion among them about their place and their rights to claim a space within French society. In a context in which minorities are continually reminded of their foreignness while also being exposed to false and disingenuous notions of equality,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think that the nationality question mixed with identity can provoke the need to create a place where you can feel at home because if you don’t feel at home where you are supposed to belong, you look for brothers – people who are sharing the same experiences. And that is where you will start to build a community. (Njami, interview, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Community offers support and protection against daily humiliation and a sense of alienation, but its intention can be manipulated to represent and be portrayed as a threat. When asked to comment on communitarianism, Njami responded by saying:
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the first issues is the way that the language is always displaced. Communitarianism is a very strong political issue. It means that you are against the others. When the real sense of the word is a group of people who share something in common. (Njami, interview, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Visible minorities often share a sense of alienation and historical amnesia and are often not equipped with the tools and historical knowledge necessary to combat or even understand structural racism. As a result, communitarian discourse can be absorbed in such a way that its very utterance begins to evoke a sense of betrayal when it comes to the nation. The pervasiveness and depth of communitarian discourse makes the process of spurring activism and constructing demands from minority communities quite complicated. As Njami argues, ‘Some people might fear to meet each other because they don’t want to be influenced by communitarian thinkers’ (Njami, interview, 2009).</p>

<title>Anti-communitarianism and political activism</title>
<p>The period after the 2005 uprisings heralded the significant return to the French landscape of minority-led associations advocating equal recognition and representation. The CRAN and the Indigènes de la République, for example, structured their advocacy strategy in such a way as to include demands for the recognition as to how racial difference (as a <italic>social</italic> rather than <italic>biological</italic> construct) operates to marginalise visible minorities from the public sphere. This was considered a prerequisite for the successful application of universal Republicanism. They understood that significant empirical data existed demonstrating that minorities faced systemic discrimination sanctioned by state policy, including in housing, employment and policing, and that underrepresentation in the political elite persisted.</p>
<p>Even though both the CRAN and the Indigènes de la République have made equality their primary concern and repeatedly stated this goal, both organisations are consistently questioned about their communitarian intent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957155813477806">Laurent Lévy (2005)</xref> has described how communitarianism functions as an accusation – a discourse used to stigmatise minorities demanding equality. This compels those who are the object of this accusation to immediately assume a defensive posture, thereby weakening the impact of their critiques concerning ingrained institutional norms that marginalise minorities. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957155813477806">Lévy (2005)</xref>, if there is a phenomenon in France that resembles communitarianism, then it is ‘communautarisme majoritaire’ (also named ‘communautarisme blanc’ or ‘communautarisme Gaulois’), a system in which the majority white community is enclosed within itself and focused on protecting this privileged space while prohibiting visible minorities from entering. In response to anti-communitarian discourse, both organisations have adopted this terminology to expose the contradictions of communitarianist discourse, to describe how racial exclusivity operates in France, and to show how the majority population has appropriated the exclusive right to determine social norms, define the historical narrative, and accordingly assert exclusive ownership over universalism.</p>

<title>Les Indigènes de la République</title>
<p>Founded in January <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957155813477806">2005</xref> the Indigènes de la République explicitly attacks the legacy of colonialism, which its members believe anchors the contemporary postcolonial system of structured racial inequalities. The founding text of the movement, <italic>L’appel des indigènes de la République</italic>, declares that the descendants of colonialism and slavery are the new <italic>indigènes</italic> (natives) of the Republic, referencing the status of <italic>indigène</italic> written into <italic>Le Code de l’indigénat</italic> under colonialism whereby Africans were defined as second-class citizens. According to the organisation, these hierarchies and systems of discrimination employed during the colonial era continue to shape the lives of people of colour in France. Youssef Boussoumah, historian and representative of the Indigènes de la République, has declared that ‘The Republic of equality is a lie’, and that equality can only truly be established through a process of ‘unmasking the hypocrisy of the so-called republic of equality’. According to Boussoumah, ‘We are fighting against the organised system of state racism’, and ‘People are close to the point where they accept that there is racial discrimination. What we also want is for people to realise there is a <italic>communautarisme blanc</italic>’ (Boussoumah, interview, 2007). The Indigènes de la République thus seek to re-conceptualise the normative definition of communitarianism as threatening to a cohesive nation so that it is understood instead as a tool to discredit any call to re-evaluate the Republican myth. ‘Intellectuals have a lot of power to stop movements from beginning’, Boussoumah claims in his interview, yet ‘We are accused of being communitarianist. This is a word that creates fear in France … we are accused of being against the Republic … The way they react to us is a sign of their own communitarianism’. The Indigènes de la République consider ‘communautarisme blanc’ to be a structural and ideological project and a threat to the independent struggle for equality by the victims of racial discrimination, and their contentious politics exposes the persistence of hierarchical divisions in French society by offering a subaltern historical perspective in <italic>L’appel des indigènes de la République</italic>:
<disp-quote>
<p>We start with the word ‘we’ – this is what bothers them – how can they begin with a word like ‘we’. Anti-racist organisations never begin with we. Normally anti-racist groups externalize the problem. But for us it is ‘we’, we the victims of discrimination who speak. (Boussoumah, interview, 2007)</p>

<title>The Conseil Représentatif des Associations Noires (CRAN)</title>
<p>The CRAN was created on 26 November 2005 and seeks to raise the level of visibility and agency of blacks and to advocate institutional policies that eliminate the practice of racial discrimination. The CRAN has become the most significant black political organisation in France. Since its founding, it has had a tangible impact on the discursive space, and ‘appears to have benefitted from the largest and longest media coverage in the history of organisations of people of African decent’ over the last 40 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957155813477806">Gueye, 2010</xref>: 82). Patrick Lozès, founding member and former president of the CRAN describes the organisation as a pacifist, humanist and democratic mediator between the state and society, seeking to create visibility for blacks as well as bringing greater attention to the systemic discrimination affecting the daily live of blacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957155813477806">Lozès, 2007</xref>). In his first book, <italic>Nous, les Noirs de France</italic>, Lozès describes the rationale behind the creation of the CRAN and the purpose of drawing attention to the specific relationship between France and blackness: ‘The CRAN loves France. But we consider that France has a problem vis-à-vis its black population’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957155813477806">2007</xref>: 35). For Lozès, one of the main problems is the normalisation of discrimination, in part because of how blackness has been historically theorised and how notions of innate inequality have been applied. For the CRAN, communitarianism is understood as a threat to demands for equality and is described as a hindrance to collective action. Lozès has explained how communitarianism influences the reception of demands within the discursive:
<disp-quote>
<p>Communitarianism is an expression that carries with it public degradation. No one in France would accept being labelled as communitarian. This label is placed upon groups who rise up and demand equality. When they say you are communitarianist that is to say you have specific demands for your group and we oppose you in the name of the values of the Republic. This is why you will not find a group today who will make demands that would qualify as communitarianist because everyone is afraid of these accusations. (Lozès, interview, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In <italic>Nous, les Noirs de France</italic>, Lozès dedicates an entire chapter to the subject of ‘communautarisme blanc’, borrowing the definition from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957155813477806">Taguieff (1988)</xref> for whom communitarianism is a form of ‘autocentration’ and ‘fermeture sur soi’, and describing how it epitomises the very definition of communitarianism, namely a self-valorisation and a tendency to close in on oneself. Lozès warns of the dangers of ‘communautarisme blanc’, giving the example of the political elite which he calls a ‘hyper-minority’ made up of white middle-aged bourgeois males around which society is organised without ever subjecting them to any suspicion of communitarianism since they are considered the incarnation of universalism. Lozès thus argues that the label ‘communitarianism’ is used to create obstacles for advancement and to disqualify minorities who have the audacity to seek equal access to economic, political and social power.</p>

<title>The limits of discursive space</title>
<p>The term ‘communautarisme blanc’ has penetrated public discourse and is a device which allows for the naming of a system and the ensuing manifestations of racism these racial advocacy associations are attempting to dismantle. The term is therefore useful in raising awareness of the contradictions of anti-communitarianist discourse and the multiple ways in which their intent are mischaracterised, while also bringing attention to the rigid lines enclosing the majority community within its own space, a topic that is rarely broached in France. At the same time, the use of the term is a response that falls within the discursive paradigm constructed around the discourse of communitarianism and therefore engages with the broader discourse of communitarianism in which all incarnations of community are considered polemic or flawed. Despite its power in attacking the deficiencies of anti-communitarian discourse, ‘communautarisme blanc’ risks becoming locked into a paradigm that critiques community at the expense of validating the usefulness of communities, particularly minority communities, in ensuring that democratic ideals are honoured and respected. After all, communities can thrive without denigrating Republican norms, while providing sites of democratic activity firmly anchored within the tradition of republicanism. As Samuel Légitimus and Simon Njami demonstrate, identifying membership within a ‘racial’ community does not mean that one rejects the larger community; in fact the opposite could be true. The actions of communities are not enclosed within separate spaces but are engaged in the kind of active exchange that fosters rational critiques that can only be beneficial to the nation as a whole.</p>
<p>For more than three decades the discourse of communitarianism has been honed into a commanding symbolic cultural formation vis-à-vis visible minorities. Its codes have penetrated every facet of the French discursive space, yet it remains defined by largely stereotypical notions of what communities represent in French society: images of violent youth and perceptions of postcolonial migrants driven by narrow empirical and historical knowledge. Communitarianist discourse is omnipresent. As the interview with Ronald Lambert, the young Parisian demonstrates, communitarianism peppers everyday conversations. As a result, the discourse of communitarianism continues to determine how demands from minority associations are received and to restrict the reach of political activism. Likewise, false notions of community also undermine efforts to create political agency among minorities. Ultimately, communitarianism negates efforts to understand the inherent relationship between institutions and race and reinforces assumptions that these institutions are race-neutral even though sufficient empirical evidence unambiguously confirms the contrary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957155813477806">Body-Gendrot and Wihtol de Wenden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957155813477806">Hargreaves, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957155813477806">Wieviorka, 1992</xref>). The discourse of communitarianism also strongly influences how the French understand debates around racial equality. The relative dearth of critical discourse on how racism functions in contemporary French society means that notions such as communitarianism remain tainted, firmly linked to division and separation, and therefore hinder efforts to enact real reform or even discussions as to what reform could look like.</p>

<p>Communitarianism as a concept has differing definitions that engage concepts of democracy in various ways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957155813477806">Bouvet (2007)</xref> describes three approaches to communitarianism outside the French context: (1) a liberal critique of Rawls, claiming it is necessary to rehabilitate community against individualism in modern society; (2) a sociological and historical approach, which developed as a result of multicultural movements. This approach claims that individuals make independent choices within a particular cultural context. When individual culture is recognised and integrated into the larger culture, and the aspirations of different groups within society are known, society as a whole is enriched. If individual culture is ignored by the larger society, tension can develop between groups; (3) a political approach envisions a stake-holding society where individuals are convinced of the necessity and personal benefits of service to the community. This approach responds to a perception that individualism creates social crisis, mounting insecurity and exclusion.</p>
