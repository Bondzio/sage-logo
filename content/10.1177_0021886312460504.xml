<abstract>
<p>This article explores the relationship between the interpersonal skills required by professional actors and those required by organization development (OD) practitioners. The objective is not to turn OD practitioners into actors but rather to indicate what might be a useful source of skill development for OD professionals. Although the end uses for the skill sets diverge, the skills themselves seem similar if not the same, especially the foundational skills of self-awareness, listening, and observing. Traditional methods of learning interpersonal skills may only address traditional OD problems that require diagnostic, positivistic control of behavior change. However, acting training such as improvisational techniques may develop more advanced skills such as reciprocity and collaborating, which are needed to practice dialogic forms of OD grounded in postmodern premises of shared meaning making, multiple realities, and collaborative solutions as proposed by Bushe and Marshak.</p>

<p>The organization development (OD) consulting discipline explicitly demands the ability to perform with a high degree of self-awareness, interpersonal skills, and communication skills, or what are termed <italic>human behavior skills</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021886312460504">Sullivan, Rothwell, &amp; Worley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021886312460504">Varney et al., 1999</xref>). Actors face the same needs: developing interpersonal skills in a world where technologically mediated interpersonal interactions lack the richness of face-to-face communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021886312460504">Myers &amp; Sadaghiani, 2010</xref>). Debate is ongoing about an appropriate, current definition of OD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021886312460504">Bradford &amp; Burke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021886312460504">Greiner &amp; Cummings, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021886312460504">Worley &amp; Feyerherm, 2003</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021886312460504">Worren, Ruddle, &amp; Moore, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021886312460504">Cummings and Worley (2009)</xref> suggest that “organization development is a systemwide application and transfer of behavioral science knowledge to the planned development, improvement, and reinforcement of the strategies, structures, and processes that lead to organizational effectiveness” (pp. 1-2). This definition reflects the attempt to capture OD from several perspectives, such as behavioral, cultural, and organizational. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021886312460504">Bushe and Marshak (2009</xref>, p. 357) propose that a classic definition of OD such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021886312460504">Cummings and Worley’s (2009)</xref> is influenced by “positivism and modernist philosophy” and that it views organizations as “living systems”; “reality is objective fact”; “change can be created, planned, and managed”; and the focus of change is on “changing behavior and what people do.”</p>
<p>However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021886312460504">Bushe and Marshak (2009)</xref> also suggest that OD has morphed into two separate forms grounded in different theoretical and philosophical foundations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021886312460504">Bushe and Marshak (2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021886312460504">Marshak &amp; Bushe, 2009</xref>) identify a shift in OD to a more socially constructed meaning of change, or what they term “dialogic” in organizations, rather than a positivistic control of behavior change, or “diagnostic” approach as reflected in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021886312460504">Cummings and Worley (2009)</xref> definition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021886312460504">Bushe and Marshak (2009</xref>, p. 357) propose in part that a dialogic form of OD is influenced by “interpretive approaches, social constructionism, and postmodern philosophy.” They proceed to say that organizations are “meaning-making systems” (p. 357) and the focus of change is “on changing mindsets” (p. 357) rather than changing behavior. They argue that basic values and aspirations remain the same in both forms of OD theory; however, a philosophical shift has occurred away from the classic OD practice taught in mainstream textbooks and classes. Nevertheless, consensus exists about a foundational human behavior skill set needed to practice OD. Due to the evolving nature of various OD practices such as appreciative inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021886312460504">Cooperrider, Barrett, &amp; Srivastva, 1995</xref>) and narrative, conversational approaches to change, perhaps now more than ever before OD practitioners need a systematically acquired set of interpersonal skills to be able to cope with the more interpretivist and subjectivist perspectives currently surfacing in the discipline of OD.</p>
<p>Theatre has a long, well-established system of learning interpersonal skills. Not only do actors require human behavior skills in their work lives, but additionally actors have to understand how to enact basic interpersonal skills in the roles they portray to audiences. Professional actors, who are trained in well-respected institutions such as New York University, Copenhagen University, DePaul University, and Yale, systematically develop interpersonal skills in their training as collaborative team members and as they enact characters onstage.</p>
<p>The theatre has been present in OD consulting almost since its inception as a discipline. Richard Beckhard, a pioneer in OD, started his career as an actor and Broadway stage manager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021886312460504">Beckhard, 1997</xref>). Through personal connections from his work in the theatre, Ron Lippitt and Lee Bradford invited him to stage and organize the processes for the National Training Laboratories’ (NTL) training workshops. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021886312460504">Beckhard (1997)</xref> wrote that
<disp-quote>
<p>Lippitt and Bradford felt that the communication could be improved if the staging were more creative. Knowing of my theatre background, they asked me to do [a] study. As a quid pro quo, they offered me a scholarship to attend the session and join a T-group. (p. 16)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This participation in T-groups at NTL where “<italic>process</italic> became the <italic>content</italic> of the discussion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021886312460504">Beckhard, 1997</xref>, p. 16) nourished his interest between group functioning and management issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021886312460504">MIT News Office, 2000</xref>). Later, when he focused on facilitating large-scale change processes in organizations with Douglas McGregor, Beckhard’s early work in the theatre and its communication processes may have influenced the burgeoning OD discipline. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021886312460504">Edgar Schein (1999)</xref>, with whom Beckhard later collaborated, acknowledged that “managing human affairs is largely a matter of designing and managing processes” (p. xiii) and that Beckhard had come by his “design skills naturally from his days as a stage manager” (p. xiv).</p>
<p>This article’s objective is not to turn OD practitioners into actors but rather to indicate a potentially useful source of skills development for OD professionals. Because of the OD practitioners’ need to develop human behavior skills, and professional theatre schools’ systematic training of these skills, this article examines the relationship between the interpersonal skills that actors need to be successful in the theatre and the interpersonal skills OD professionals need to be successful practitioners.</p>
<p>First, I offer a brief review of OD practitioner skills over the past 30 years to illustrate their need to respond to increasingly complex organizational issues. Next, actors’ skills are presented and paralleled with OD practitioner competencies. Third, I discuss how the skills are taught by traditional methods in the classroom and how actors learn them in their discipline. Also included is how some management educators have already set precedents by incorporating some of the acting methods into the classroom.</p>

<title>OD Practitioners’ Interpersonal Skills</title>
<p>In the ongoing discussion about consulting skills, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021886312460504">Lippitt and Lippitt (1986)</xref> represent the 1980s decade, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021886312460504">Burke (1994)</xref> signifies the decade of the 1990s, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021886312460504">Eisen, Cherbeneau, and Worley (2005)</xref> characterize the first decade of the 21st century. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021886312460504">Lippitt and Lippitt (1986)</xref> cite multiple consultant competencies under topics such as “knowledge, skills, and attitudes” (pp. 170-172). In part, they include knowledge of oneself, communication skills, and relational skills such as forming relationships based on trust and being sensitive to the feelings of others. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021886312460504">Lippitt and Lippitt’s (1986)</xref> extensive competencies list, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021886312460504">Burke (1994</xref>, pp. 177-179) suggests “10 primary abilities” that relate to skills. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021886312460504">Burke (1994)</xref> recommends self-awareness skills, listening and communication skills, and skills that sustain healthy and ethical relations such as supporting, nurturing, and empathizing with others.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021886312460504">Eisen et al. (2005</xref>, p. 206) characterize OD skills in this first decade of the 21st century as “future-responsive awareness.” According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021886312460504">Eisen et al. (2005</xref>, p. 193), practitioners need to “modify and evolve our practice continually in response to anticipated changes in the needs of client systems.” Eisen et al. present a competency list for what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021886312460504">Bushe and Marshak (2009)</xref> term a dialogic form of OD. Their list comprises approximately 30 action verbs in the practitioner competency category. These 30 skills could be grouped under larger headings of self-awareness, listening, observing, and skills that support positive relations with others. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021886312460504">Table 1</xref> illustrates the parallels among <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021886312460504">Lippitt and Lippitt (1986)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021886312460504">Burke (1994)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021886312460504">Eisen et al.

All three monographs identify skills that continue to be relevant in the current context, even as OD may be morphing into a separate form from its classical roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021886312460504">Bushe &amp; Marshak, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Overall, an examination of the skills over three decades shows a deepening understanding of the activation of skills in complex contexts of human behavior, making a plausible argument for OD practitioners to be well grounded in the use of basic interpersonal skills. Since the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021886312460504">Lippitt and Lippitt (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021886312460504">Burke (1994)</xref> were published, the social sciences have recognized interpersonal skills from different discipline-based perspectives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021886312460504">Goleman (1995)</xref> takes the view that these skills constitute, at least in part, “emotional intelligence,” and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021886312460504">Fletcher (1999)</xref> discusses “relational skills.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021886312460504">Fletcher (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021886312460504">Goleman (1995)</xref> use different constructs; however, both acknowledge the importance of skills that facilitate social connection to attain mutual goals. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021886312460504">Goleman (1995</xref>, p. 96), “empathy builds on self-awareness; the more open we are to our own emotions, the more skilled we will be in reading feelings.” Self-awareness, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021886312460504">Goleman (1995</xref>, p. 46) defines it, is “the sense of an ongoing attention to one’s internal states. In this self-reflexive awareness mind [<italic>sic</italic>] observes and investigates experience itself, including the emotions.” Therefore, to have empathy for another’s feelings, one must first be aware of one’s own feelings—a notion inferred also from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021886312460504">Fletcher (1999)</xref>. Once a person is self-aware, then she or he has the ability to identify similar emotional cues in others, therefore recognizing the displayed emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021886312460504">Kemper, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021886312460504">Gardner and Hatch (1989</xref>, p. 6) discussed interpersonal intelligence as a cover term for the capability “to discern and respond appropriately to the moods, temperaments, motivations and desires of other people.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021886312460504">Goleman (1995</xref>, p. 118) suggests that to enter into an encounter or to recognize and respond fittingly to people’s feelings and concerns—the art of relationship—means being able to “detect and have insights about people’s feelings, motives, and concerns . . . lead[ing] to an easy intimacy or sense of rapport.” Actors and OD practitioners both must be skilled to recognize and promote appropriate emotional intelligence and relational skills in their work to achieve organizational goals. Actors cooperate to bring the play to performance and OD practitioners work with client systems to solve problems.</p>
<p>In sum, the requisite OD skills appear to be taking a more external or relationally based perspective as illustrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021886312460504">Eisen et al. (2005)</xref> rather than the internal or self-based perspective from the past as signified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021886312460504">Lippitt and Lippitt (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021886312460504">Burke (1994)</xref>. As OD continues as a discipline, its skill set is also becoming more specific in application to cope with interpersonal issues in demanding global strategic processes.</p>

<title>Actors’ Interpersonal Skills</title>
<p>Actors must be aware of and trained in the use of their bodies and voices to communicate the message of the playwright. The theories of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021886312460504">Stanislavski (1976)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021886312460504">Hagen (1973)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021886312460504">Meisner and Longwell (1987)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021886312460504">Adler (2000)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021886312460504">Grotowski (1968)</xref> form the conceptual framework for performance art in schools such as the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, The Theatre School at DePaul University in Chicago, Yale School of Drama, and the American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco. Actors also work to develop skills in listening and self-awareness, using Spolin-based improvisational work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021886312460504">Spolin, 1999</xref>) that encourages spontaneity and relationship-building (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021886312460504">Corsun, Young, McManus, &amp; Erdem, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021886312460504">Dominguez, Howell-DePew, &amp; Walters, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021886312460504">Huffaker, Robertson, Hirsch, &amp; Poynton, 2003</xref>). Actors also develop individual (vocal) expressiveness, trouble-shooting skills for application within the rehearsal process, emotional awareness, preparation and personalization, and instruction in the technique that “gives actors a step-by-step progression of structured improvisations designed to stimulate instincts and impulses, sharpen concentration and listening skills and strengthen the imagination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021886312460504">The Theatre School at DePaul University, 2009</xref>). This last technique is termed the Meisner Technique, after Sanford Meisner, a member of the Group Theatre and early teacher of “Method” acting (a theory that grew out of Stanislavski’s theoretical approach). The Meisner Technique focuses on the scene partner (“I want you to . . .”) and on changing him or her in some way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021886312460504">Pope, 2000</xref>, p. 152). The Stanislavski theory of acting instructs a more self-centered (“I want . . .”) and personal emotional perspective. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021886312460504">Pope (2000</xref>, p. 152) states, “[Meisner’s focus] also adds a sense of ensemble play, reinforcing the give-and-take (talking and listening) that results when actors are working as a part of a larger whole.”</p>
<p>It is impossible to find comprehensive and summative lists of skills for actors, because the process of learning acting is entirely constituted of skill building, and therefore each theorist addresses the above methods with his or her own terminology and manner of approach as a means of learning how to act. However, certain fundamental skills figure in nearly every skill-building exercise: listening, observing, and self-awareness. To illustrate the similarity of skills between actors and OD consultants, below is a brief view of skills from the explicitly stated OD competencies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021886312460504">Varney et al.

<p>Further consideration of the three basic skills of listening, observing, and self-awareness leads to another triad of skills that actors develop—reciprocity, collaboration, and internal group harmony—all skills that are necessary for achieving the actors’ organizational goal of bringing a script to performance. Without the basic abilities of listening, observing, and self-awareness, the relational skills of reciprocity, collaboration, and internal group harmony cannot develop. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021886312460504">Goleman (1995)</xref> implies a hierarchy of interpersonal skills, proposing the “rudiments of social intelligence” (p. 148) as “teamwork, open lines of communication, cooperation, listening, and speaking one’s mind” (p. 148). Unless actors can develop these foundational skills, they cannot graduate to the more complex skills of reciprocity, collaboration, and internal group harmony to achieve their particular organizational goals. The notions of reciprocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021886312460504">Fletcher, 1999</xref>), collaborating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021886312460504">Goleman, 1995</xref>), and internal group harmony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021886312460504">Goleman, 1995</xref>) are important to actors in the context of performance. I will take each of these factors in turn, beginning with reciprocity.</p>
<p>Less-experienced actors learn reciprocity from the more-experienced actors largely through collaboration. Ideally, give-and-take occurs in the performance of scenes. Often actors say, “She or he was so wonderful to work with. She or he <italic>gave</italic> me so much.” This refers to the giving actor who provides many rich, deep, and textured nuances to his or her performance, to which the other actor can respond. In that way, both actors appear to be performing their best and both are credited with fine acting skills. They are, in fact both acting well, but one is actually leading the way for the other. What makes this instance an example of reciprocity is that usually the giving actor does not take credit or even acknowledge that he or she is acting generously. It is merely the professional work ethic of a fine actor. This way of working also encourages a collaborative environment on the set or stage.</p>
<p>Collaborating to achieve positive effects demands internal group harmony. Working well together and trusting fellow actors is necessary, often because of the highly charged emotional states that are required for rehearsal and performances. Collaboration at this level requires an environment of psychological safety among the cast and crew. An actor who knows he or she can plumb emotional depths and come out safely on the other side is placing a high degree of trust in fellow actors and crewmembers. Collaboration is difficult to separate from internal group harmony. Those who are collaborating positively are also achieving internal group harmony, and this internal group harmony supports a working event that actors seek throughout their careers: It is basic to the notion of “flow” as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021886312460504">Csikszentmihalyi (1996)</xref>, which is an optimal group effect as a direct result of reciprocity, collaboration, and internal group harmony.</p>
<p>Frequently, the lead character is the actor on whom the largest responsibility rests in the play. This person, along with the director, often sets the tone for the rehearsal process. The leading actor models behavior for the other actors to follow. This person does most of the giving, but in receiving from other actors, the cycle repeats and builds on itself: give and take, then receive and give; give and take, then receive and give (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021886312460504">Pope, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In applying these examples from theatre to the business environment, the OD practitioner can be seen as the giving actor. He or she sets the tone for the project, gives unselfishly to the recipients, and encourages everyone to respond in authentic ways. This means of working is rooted in the preparation of the actor’s training in self-awareness exercises. An actor must know himself or herself to subjugate the ego enough to allow for another to meet him or her on the same level of performance. In doing so, the reflective practitioner, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021886312460504">Schön (1983)</xref> describes, encourages and engages collaboration in the most positive sense.</p>
<p>As stated previously, collaboration is difficult to separate from internal group harmony. Trust is a major factor in the OD consulting role, as it is in the actor’s rehearsal process. Actors must risk taking emotional chances, and they can only do this if there is a trusting environment with a rich give and take. Slowly, trust is developed, collaboration increases, and internal group harmony prevails in rehearsal and performance. Similarly, in an organization, all participants are involved in collaborative exchanges in a business group or team. This is not to say that all goes smoothly and there is no conflict. Indeed, conflict is often deliberately fostered in rehearsals so actors might further plumb emotional responses. Conflict is contained within the internal group harmony and is not allowed to threaten it. The group members must trust each other enough to be able to challenge one another constructively. In business groups, challenge to groupthink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021886312460504">Janis, 1982</xref>) is important. However, for all to achieve the best from each other, internal group harmony is maintained by all.</p>
<p>Self-awareness, listening, and observing are primary skills for both actors and OD professionals. As with actors, if developing OD practitioners are not skilled to be self-aware, to listen and observe, they do not graduate to the more complex notions of interpersonal skill applications, and they may miss important and possibly critical cues from clients that may negatively affect the outcome of the change event.</p>

<title>Methods for Learning Interpersonal Skills</title>
<p>Methods used for learning interpersonal skills in the classroom are cognitive analysis, interactive techniques, role-play, and case simulations. In acting, training methods also involve cognitive analysis and interactive techniques, but include Stanislavskian and Boalian exercises as well, which are now finding their way into the classroom.</p>
<sec id="section4-0021886312460504">
<title>Cognitive Analysis</title>
<p>Actors analyze play scripts to identify key interpersonal interactions in the script and discuss possible options and choices depending on the vision of the director. They also critically identify interpersonal interactions that are only indicated in the dialogue of the written drama. Part of the actors’ homework is to understand overall character motivations and situational motivations that help the character to achieve his or her goal in the play. This is accomplished through breaking the script into <italic>beats</italic>; broadly defined, a beat occurs every time a character changes a want or a need. These beats may range from a few lines to several pages of text.</p>
<p>Actors also observe other professional actors play out situations and discuss what was or was not authentic in a given situation. This provides an opportunity to develop an awareness of fundamental skills in situational contexts and to develop problem-solving skills by making suggestions for how the actors could have played the scene differently.</p>
<p>OD practitioners also use analytical means to become aware of interpersonal interactions. By having to discuss particular situations in case examples, OD students must become aware of interpersonal problems that lead to business operational dysfunctionality. Many OD textbooks offer rich examples of problems that have been encountered in OD projects. By analyzing how they would have handled the problem in the context of the project, emerging OD practitioners develop a sense of what sensitivities one needs when consulting to others. In this way, OD students mirror acting students and vice versa as both attempt to learn appropriate human behaviors in crisis situations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0021886312460504">
<title>Interactive Techniques</title>
<p>Actors use interactive drama to develop their skills in a scene study class through the stop/discuss/rework technique. Interactive drama in the classroom is a means of exploring complex issues by enacting self-reflection of the performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021886312460504">Boggs, Mickel, and Holtom (2007)</xref> describe interactive drama being used in the classroom as
<disp-quote>
<p>a style of live theatre wherein a scene is performed by trained actors and then stopped so the audience can interact . . . [by] (a) discussing the scene just witnessed . . . (b) suggesting changes to the scene and then actors replaying it, and (c) . . . joining the scene as performers to try out alternative solutions. (p. 835)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Being involved enables the audience to participate with the performers and to engage with the situation or concept experientially in real time. The benefit of this experience is that people can learn from the immediacy of live performance. Those students who are uncomfortable with role-play may engage more in this activity since they are not all expected to perform per se.</p>
<p>Watching films has also become a popular classroom teaching method. It offers an opportunity for spectators to stop the action and discuss interpersonal interactions and the skills involved, but film does not allow for interaction with the performers, only among audience members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0021886312460504">
<title>Role-Play</title>
<p>Traditional role-play in the classroom is a familiar technique for developing interpersonal and relational skills. It illustrates a problem and provides a setting for discussing conceptual changes according to the given script or scenario. Students can use role-play “to apply their knowledge in a risk free situation, stimulate . . . discussion, dramatize rhetorical principles and [allow] for reflection of their own behavior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021886312460504">Griggs, 2005</xref>, p. 60). Role-play is scripted to some extent; short explanations of character and/or situation are described and followed by the actors, who have only a little room for the discovery of deeper moral and ethical conflicts between the characters. They must “stick to the script,” as they would with any dramatic text, except that the lines are largely absent. Using this type of guided script addresses problem solving but only on a somewhat superficial level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021886312460504">Argyris (1980</xref>, p. 291) warns of “single-loop learning” or “learning that results in the detection and correction of error without changing the underlying policies, assumptions, and goals.”</p>

<sec id="section7-0021886312460504">
<title>Case Studies</title>
<p>Case studies, as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021886312460504">Ballantine and McCourt Larres (2003</xref>, p. 172, adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021886312460504">Easton, 1992</xref>), are “a means to provide practice in problem-solving and decision making of a semi- or unstructured nature in a simulated situation.” According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021886312460504">Ballantine and McCourt Larres (2003</xref>, p. 172), they are “used to develop generic skills [self-confidence, self-awareness, and the ability to learn] in addition to those that are delivered implicitly when teaching technical accounting skills and theoretical knowledge.” Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021886312460504">Ballantine and McCourt Larres (2003)</xref> are using case studies, in the accounting classroom in this instance, they credit case studies with encouraging students to examine wider business issues by additional generic skills such as “judgment, problem-solving and critical analysis” (p. 172). These generic skills, popularly termed <italic>soft skills</italic>, are “communication skills, written skills, interpersonal skills, critical, problem-solving, judgment and analytical skills . . . which are transferable across disciplines” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021886312460504">Ballantine &amp; McCourt Larres, 2003</xref>, p. 171).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021886312460504">Ballantine and McCourt Larres (2003)</xref> justify the use of case simulations as an appropriate means for teaching generic skills; however, their research reveals that verbal communication is among the lowest scoring factors of perceived worth of skill development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0021886312460504">
<title>Improvisation</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021886312460504">Vera and Crossan (2004)</xref> propose several skills from theatrical improvisation exercises as helpful for OD practitioners in organizations. Among them are agreement, which is defined as the ability to accept information without dispute; awareness, meaning being present in the moment with what develops and being responsive to it; and collaboration. All three are relevant for encouraging nimbleness and adaptability to change in organizations. These skills shift the focus of problem solving from outcomes to process. This shift of focus is extremely relevant for OD practitioners whose concern is to facilitate the <italic>process</italic> of change in organizations. Skills that increase the ability to focus on process lead to values highly rated by organizations—harmony, responsiveness, and collaboration.</p>
<p>The “Yes, and . . .” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021886312460504">Moshavi, 2001</xref>) improvisational exercise encourages complex interpersonal communication skills. In this exercise, actors are given a character, a situation, and a task or problem that is usually offered from the audience and that they must enact on the spot. The challenge for the actor is to accept all the terms given by the audience and companion actors as the scene develops. None of the actors involved can dispute, ignore, deny, or negate any piece of information, no matter how outrageous the information or behavior; hence the name of the exercise, “Yes, and . . . .” For example, when an actor receives a piece of information, she or he replies with “Yes” inferring the acceptance of the information, and then says “and” and adds to the information thus spurring the action of the scene. The information given by the receiving actor is then received by the first actor and is accepted (“Yes”) and built on (“and . . .”) and the process repeats itself back and forth always preceded by “Yes, and . . . .” The technique of “Yes, and . . .” encourages listening, creativity, and problem-solving skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021886312460504">Moshavi, 2001</xref>). Additionally, it forces actors to accept the unexpected and be creative, flexible, resourceful, and spontaneous—all desirable skills that correlate to OD skills in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021886312460504">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>OD practitioners can use “Yes, and . . . ”and other improvisational exercises to develop key skills such as being self-confident, listening, observing, collaborating, trusting, anticipating, and having a sense of humor. Improvisation demands acute listening skills to receive and process the information given by the other actor. Sharpened listening enhances a performer’s sense of self-confidence in being able to receive, react, and respond in a matter of seconds. The skill of observing develops in the same way. Communication not only depends on the spoken word but also—and perhaps to a greater degree—on the support of nonverbal communication. Freedom from a script as in the technique of improvisation allows for “double-loop” learning or “the detection and correction of error requir[ing] changes in the underlying policies, assumptions, and goals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021886312460504">Argyris, 1980</xref>, p. 291) as actors develop the scenario. They may replay it several times in different ways, to explore the dynamics of interpersonal interactions when various skills are implemented or withheld.</p>

<title>Boalian and Stanislavkian Techniques</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021886312460504">Boal’s (1992)</xref> Theatre of the Oppressed performance theory emphasizes the audience’s instrumentality in the creation of the drama so that “everyone acts” as “spect-actors” (pp. 17-21). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021886312460504">Monks, Barker, and Mhanacháin (2001)</xref> report how Boalian exercises encourage empowerment. They describe several ways the exercises are enacted in specific contexts and suggest that “the techniques are . . . suitable for the development of leadership skills, communications, confidence, team-building, listening skills and trust, and [exploring] unfamiliar feelings in a safe environment” (p. 415).</p>
<p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021886312460504">Ladkin and Taylor (2010)</xref> have articulated how the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021886312460504">Stanislavski (1976)</xref> method of acting training can be used to train leaders to be “authentic” (p. 65). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021886312460504">Stanislavski (1976)</xref> suggests that one must start with a playable action rather than with the aim to recreate an emotion. Very simply, he asks questions such as “What does the character want?” “What does the character do?” and “What is the obstacle that prevents the character from obtaining his/her goal?” In this way, the actor taps into the emotion through playing an action. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021886312460504">Stanislavski’s (1976)</xref> theory is a means of putting oneself in a situation and truthfully presenting how someone would behave in that situation, being what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021886312460504">Ladkin and Taylor (2010</xref>, p. 65) call “authentic.” Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021886312460504">Stanislavski’s (1976)</xref> method, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021886312460504">Ladkin and Taylor (2010</xref>, pp. 70-72) suggest a theory of “embodied authentic leadership” through “self-exposure, relating, and making leaderly choices.”</p>

<title>Implications for Change Theory and Practice</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021886312460504">Bushe and Marshak (2009)</xref> argue that OD is developing in a direction that is more meaning-centered and grounded in postmodern premises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021886312460504">Bushe &amp; Marshak, 2007</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021886312460504">Bushe &amp; Marshak, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021886312460504">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021886312460504">Marshak &amp; Bushe, 2009</xref>). These postmodern premises include that
<disp-quote>
<p>reality is a co-constructed social phenomenon . . . experience is mediated through language . . . multiple realities [exist] . . . intersubjective truth is negotiated . . . [and] ways of analyzing discourse, including the analysis of organizational stories, narratives, conversations, metaphors, rhetoric, texts, etc., provide insights into key organization issues, processes, and actions. (p. 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>They also suggest that OD is moving away from purely behavioral diagnoses and interventions toward more negotiated and flexible perspectives of thought, thereby leaving the behavior change to the people affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021886312460504">Bushe &amp; Marshak, 2007</xref>). Given <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021886312460504">Bushe and Marshak’s (2009)</xref> argument that OD is changing into a more dialogic form, OD consultants must also reconsider how they develop their skills to remain effective practitioners.</p>
<p>Improvisational exercises such as “Yes, and . . . ,” for example, encourage intense listening and observation so that conversations can develop into narratives. The communicative nature of theatre leads to a natural discursive analysis of issues as performers delve into their characters and the meanings of plays. Just as actors learn how to mine the meanings underlying the script that they must portray authentically to communicate the playwright’s message, OD practitioners also rely on various exercises and tools to be mentally acute with regard to organizational issues. Not only does improvisation help build individual foundational skills of listening, observing, and self-awareness, but also it develops the very skills that are needed to uncover discursive meanings in dialogs within organizations. In improvisation, reality is co-constructed, intersubjective truth is negotiated, and experience is mediated through language. This is a point where using the theatre and its training methods may enhance the advanced skill training of OD consultants.</p>
<p>Another contribution from acting exercises to the dialogic theory of OD suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021886312460504">Bushe and Marshak (2009)</xref> is the increased ability to think in a nonlinear fashion. The “Yes, and . . . ” exercise illustrates how improvisation techniques encourage open, nonjudgmental, responsive communication. The free flow of ideas that the exercise generates allows new options to surface by which to solve problems. New reactions and ideas come to the fore when communicators are open and responsive to what happens during the exercise without internal judgment. Nonlinear thinking can provide room for new perspectives that allow for multiple simultaneous realities. However, this is an area of considerable room for explanation and ongoing exploration. Employing improvisational, Stanislavskian, and Boalian forms of theatre training can help develop the required skills—foundational and advanced—demanded by the dialogic forms of OD currently being used.</p>
<p>It is simple enough to suggest to those who are currently in the classroom, both student and teacher, that there is a ready outlet to access these techniques. In fact, several institutions have adopted a cross-disciplinary approach using theatre methods to train students, for example, Case Western Reserve University, The Ashridge Business School, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Virginia. A trend toward this type of instruction appears to be gaining momentum in mainstream business education. However, for practicing OD professionals who have concluded their formal classroom education, access to reputable sources of this training may be more difficult. Additionally, finding venues that cater to using these techniques specifically for business may be even more challenging. That said, a growing number of organizations have successfully incorporated theatre techniques into their OD practices, and they may be called on for assistance. One such organization is the Ariel Group located in Massachusetts. The Banff Centre in Canada lists among its programs Leadership Development and incorporates theatre techniques into its Coaching for Performance course.</p>
<p>Additionally, the practitioner can use improvisational techniques as tools for gathering information or delving into problem options. For example, the “Yes, and . . . ” technique could be employed as a supplementary tool during brainstorming. The addition of “and” suggests a further push into deeper solutions. A suggestion is proffered and the facilitator responds with “Yes, and . . . ,” which is meant to encourage the speaker to go further and deeper into his or her solution. Likewise, when seeking organizational information from its members, by saying “Yes” the practitioner acknowledges the information offered by the client, and then may prompt him or her with other words implying “and” from the exercise such as “go on,” “can you explain this,” or “tell me more.” In this way, the practitioner is accepting the information without judgment and asking for more information on which meaning can be built. The purpose of engaging in any exercise is to gain skill with a necessary tool so when a situation presents itself, the practitioner is ready and able to grapple with the issue.</p>
<p>In sum, exercises from theatre training can enhance not only basic foundational skills for OD practitioners such as listening, observing, and self-awareness, but they may also build skills that are being demanded by developing forms of OD that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021886312460504">Bushe and Marshak (2009)</xref> term dialogic. The communicative nature of the theatre encourages discursive analysis of issues that is consistent with postmodern premises, and therefore, acting exercises may be a fruitful means to develop the specific skills required by OD practitioners today.</p>
<p>Future investigation into this area could focus on how acting exercises encourage nonlinear thinking skills as a way to open new avenues for solving organizational issues. Several educational institutions and organizations are already employing theatre techniques for just these purposes. However, OD practitioners can also use improvisational techniques in their practices to encourage clients to offer more information or encourage problem solving. Acting and improvisational exercises encourage shared meaning making, multiple realities, and collaborative solutions that are all asserted in postmodern premises.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Because of the OD practitioner’s need to develop human behavior skills, and professional theatre schools’ systematic training of these skills, this article considers the relationship between the interpersonal skills that actors need to be successful in the theatre and the interpersonal skills OD professionals need to be successful practitioners in the dialogic development of change management that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021886312460504">Bushe and Marshak (2009)</xref> suggest. OD practitioners, like actors, need a fundamental base of interpersonal skills grounded in the basics of self-awareness, listening, and observing. This foundational base supports more complex interpersonal interactions increasingly demanded by today’s multifaceted economic climate. Both disciplines require the same foundational skills, although their end applications diverge. Therefore, managing in the increasing complexity of organizational environments requires a solid foundation of interpersonal skills. As the number of appropriate skills expands to meet the needs of changing organizational structures and issues, a strong skill base from which to work is more important than ever. Culture, integration, conflict negotiation, and trust are issues the consultant must be prepared to manage in the global organization, and a solid foundation of basic skills leading to the more complex relational and emotional skills becomes imperative.</p>
<p>Borrowing from the theatre and its disciplined means of skill development, OD practitioners can tap into an early cognitive thread of Beckhard, one of the discipline’s founders, as well as engage in a systematic means of learning these skills from professional actor training. Additionally, instead of using single-loop learning methods such as case simulations and role-play, as the discipline of OD morphs into a more socially constructed meaning of change in organizations, double-loop learning methods, such as improvisation, interactive drama, or Boalian techniques, are called for to address complex organizational issues. Traditional methods of learning interpersonal skills may only address traditional OD problems that require diagnostic, positivistic control of behavior change. The future proposition of OD may require new methods of learning foundational interpersonal skills that can address Eisen’s et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021886312460504">2005</xref>, p. 206) “future-responsive awareness.”</p>
