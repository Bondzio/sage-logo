<body>
<p>I am looking forward to a 2-year opportunity to give back to the National Association of School Nurses (NASN) with the same intensity that NASN has given to me. Like most of you here, I am a practicing school nurse. I go to my elementary school every morning wondering what the day will bring. I may have plans for the day, but I know that my plans are always tentative, because I must respond to whatever illness, injury, or emergency that I am called to handle, and I will respond in my most professional, caring manner, using evidence-based protocols and procedures. Ask me how I can know that what I am doing is best practice, and I will tell you, the NASN.</p>
<p>School nurses are the reason that NASN exists, and NASN wants to enable you to be the best that you can be. Our professional organization is going through a fresh strategic planning process, and you are the center of attention. You are the point of care for our students from early childhood through adolescence. It is your presence in schools that makes parents and communities feel confident that when their kids are in school, they are safe and their health care needs are being met.</p>
<p>NASN seeks new ways to best support the work that you do. Our membership and partners include community and school physicians, school nurse educators, researchers, and administrators; and let us not forget the business community who develop products and tools that support our work, and government agencies that offer grants to expand the work that we do. What these individuals and organizations make available, the protocols and consultations, the publications, the courses, the research studies, and the programs they develop are all focused on you and how you lead the team that provides school health services to our most precious national resource, our children. School health services delivery models begin with you.</p>
<p>To honor you, I chose the theme for my presidency to describe what school nurses do, <italic>School Nurses: Supporting Education, Advancing Student Health</italic>. My logo places school nurses as the bridge between the two pillars of health and education.</p>
<p>Health and education are inseparable and interdependent, and school nurses work to create strong bonds between the two powerful disciplines, strengthening student supports for increasing graduation rates and adoption of healthy lifestyles. Because of a school nurse presence, health care providers are able to develop lasting partnerships with schools, and researchers are able to establish evidence needed to improve school health programs.</p>
<p>Over 100 years ago, the specialty practice of school nursing was born because of an experiment in New York City Schools; the hypothesis, public health nurses placed in schools to treat contagious diseases will improve school attendance. The result was significant. Attendance improved by 90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10b-1059840513495008"><italic>School Nurse News</italic>, 1999</xref>). We know that time students spend in class, “seat time,” is, indeed, a valid outcome measure for school nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840513495008">Bergren, 2012</xref>). School nurses are essential supports for education.</p>
<p>What better source of inspiration could there be than the knowledge that what you do everyday contributes to the future well-being of our nation and the world.</p>
<p>School nurses keep students in school and learning, enabling them to graduate and prepare to enter the workforce. Dr. Jocelyn Elders, former U.S. Surgeon General, said, “Health is more than the absence of disease. Health is about jobs and employment, education, the environment, and all of those things that go into making us healthy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840513495008">Elders &amp; Chanoff, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The Gallup organization, through their World Poll, tells us that the desire for a good job is the “will of the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840513495008">Clifton, 2011</xref>, p. 11). A good job is one that provides at least 30 steady hours of work each week and a good paycheck. Jim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840513495008">Clifton (2011</xref>), the CEO of Gallup, states that a good job is the currency of the future. To have jobs, our students must graduate with ability to compete in the job market, and when we are talking about <italic>good</italic> jobs, they must graduate from high school, ready for the workforce and ready for college.</p>
<p>The reality is that overall our students are struggling academically, and they could become the first generation to live shorter and less healthy lives than their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840513495008">Davis &amp; Levi, 2012</xref>). Six percent of children missed 11 or more days of school in the past 12 months due to illness or injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840513495008">Bloom, Cohen, &amp; Freeman, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>School absence affects performance and contributes to school dropout and has economic and social repercussions for individuals, families, and communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10a-1059840513495008">Pennington &amp; Delaney, 2008</xref>). Repeated studies identify that school nurses reduce absenteeism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840513495008">Maughan, 2003</xref>) and a higher nurse-to-student ratio is related to better attendance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10a-1059840513495008">Pennington &amp; Delaney, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>America’s Promise Alliance, an NASN partner, launched the Grad Nation Campaign in 2010 with the goal of 90% graduation rate nationally by 2020. The campaign reports that every 26 seconds, a student drops out of school. We, as a nation, cannot afford to lose one out of four young people to the drop-out crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840513495008">America’s Promise Alliance, Grad Nation, 2013</xref>). School nurses are critical to supporting student health and wellness and success in school.</p>
<p>School nurses advance the health of students in many ways. One of the objectives of <italic>Healthy People 2020</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840513495008">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010</xref>) is to have a full-time school nurse in each school at a ratio of 1 nurse to 750 students, and for good reason. Chronic disease prevalence has increased over the past 10 years from one in eight children to one in four, especially for manageable conditions like asthma, diabetes, obesity, and learning and behavioral disabilities (<italic>Health in Mind</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840513495008">Davis &amp; Levi, 2012</xref>). Despite this, more than half of public schools currently do not have a full-time school nurse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840513495008">NASN, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>School health programs and services are inequitably distributed. Fewer and lower quality resources are available in schools serving low-income minority youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1a-1059840513495008">Basch, 2010</xref>). Schools <italic>without</italic> professional school nurses lack essential supports for both student health and student achievement. So, when the nurse is missing, what else is missing and what is the impact?</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Chronic disease management is missing. The impacts are decrease in student attendance, increase in use of emergency departments for avoidable emergencies, poor quality of life, poor academic performance.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Early screening and intervention for barriers to learning are missing. The impact is delayed treatment for vision and hearing deficits that can easily be remedied by timely and appropriate referrals.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Prevention efforts focused on communicable diseases are missing. The impacts are lower immunization rates, increased absences for both students and staff, and a decrease in herd immunity that protects the greater population.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>School-based care for acute illness and emergency and first aid care are missing. The impacts are extended school absences for treatable injuries and illness and increased, and possibly inappropriate, use of community emergency services.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Health education and health promotion are missing. The impacts are missed opportunities to affect the health behavior choices of students and families and the increasing prevalence of preventable and expensive chronic health conditions.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>There are two other important services that school nurses provide that I did not mention in the section above. One is access to health care; the other is partnerships to support a coordinated and integrated approach to school health. School nurses work hard to connect eligible students to Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Programs (SCHIP), because we know that no insurance is equal to no access. For those students who fall through the cracks and do not qualify for federal assistance, school nurses work with community health centers and school-based health centers to connect students and families to affordable care.</p>
<p>School nurses create, manage, and participate in partnerships for provision of health services and health-focused activities in schools. Without school nurses, community health care providers have no one to partner with, and community and parent involvement in school health cannot flourish. A 2007 NASN study found that schools with full-time professional registered school nurses (RNs) were more likely than schools with part-time RNs, or no nurses at all, to have other health care services and providers in the school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840513495008">NASN, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>School nurses are ideally positioned to work toward the triple aim of the Affordable Care Act to improve access, to improve quality, and to reduce costs of health care. It is important that we maintain a student-centered, coordinated, and integrated care model. The National Prevention Strategy has set a goal to increase the numbers of Americans who are healthy at every stage of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840513495008">National Prevention Council, 2011</xref>). Given that 52 million students are in school 6–8 hr each day for at least 180 days per year makes schools the ideal place for health prevention strategies that reduce development of chronic health conditions and promote healthy lifestyles. You know that for many of your students, you are their only health care provider and only access to health care.</p>
<p>We have yet to create the evidence that will establish the dollar values of school health services in relationship to total health care costs or to the impact on graduation rates. NASN knows intuitively, however, that school health services programs led by professional school nurses offer a huge return on investment. NASN is working on the research to demonstrate that school health services reduce costs and improve quality. NASN is focused on you, and NASN knows that there are about 66,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840513495008">Fauteux, 2010</xref>) school nurses across the country, and just think how much NASN could do if all were members. NASN works for school nurses whether they are members or not, but definitely we are stronger together.</p>
<p>Over the next 2 years as president, I promise to work hard and to focus on several things:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>leading development of a strategic plan that will address the needs and concerns of members;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>engaging members in the work of NASN to strengthen our profession, to grow our membership, and to further secure our financial stability;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>supporting the school health advocacy you do at the local level where you know your communities and the unique health care needs there, where your families work and play; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>developing research priorities.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>I am eager to get to work, and I welcome your input and would like to hear from you along the way (nasn@nasn.org). I am excited and inspired to engage with all of you in <italic>Supporting Education, Advancing Student Health.</italic>
