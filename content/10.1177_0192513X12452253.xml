<abstract>
<p>In contemporary discourse, children are imagined with “surplus risk,” and parents often feel pressure to protect their children from danger. Drawing on interviews with 40 Latina, White, and Black mothers of teenagers, the authors examine the factors that shape these mothers’ concerns for their teens’ safety, how they articulate these concerns, and the strategies they employ to try to keep teens safe: individual responsibility, monitoring, and organized activities. Drawing on insights from Black feminism and critical race theory, the authors demonstrate how the intersections of race, class, and gender shape mothers’ perceptions of the dangers their children face and their efforts to help their children navigate these “hostile environments.” Findings reveal intersecting axes of inequality in mothers’ protective carework as well as how inequalities are resisted, but may also be reproduced, through mothers’ understandings and strategies. The benefits and challenges of an intersectional analysis are discussed in the conclusion.</p>

<p>Although the challenges modern children face—including alcohol/drugs, sexual victimization, and violence—are not new, these threats are perceived as more ubiquitous than in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192513X12452253">Glassner, 1999</xref>). In contemporary popular discourse, children are imagined with “surplus risk”—risk that exceeds what might be considered the typical trials and tribulations of childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192513X12452253">Davis, 1999</xref>, p. xiii; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X12452253">Nelson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X12452253">Scott, Jackson, &amp; Backett-Milburn, 1998</xref>)—and many parents feel pressure to be vigilant in protecting their children from such dangers. Dominant discourses emphasizing the dangers children face make concerns around children’s safety a major focus of contemporary parental carework—the work of parenting, including the provision of care, nurturance, guidance, and protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X12452253">DeVault, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X12452253">Kurz, 2002</xref>). What we term <italic>protective carework</italic> includes gauging potential threats to children’s well-being, determining how much autonomy to allow them, and employing strategies to monitor children’s activities, peers, and surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192513X12452253">Best, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X12452253">Kurz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X12452253">Nelson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although all parents may worry for their children, studies show that parents’ protective carework strategies are shaped by their social location, including social class and race. Neighborhood context, an important aspect of social class, has a significant impact on parenting practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192513X12452253">Furstenberg, Cook, Eccles, Elder, &amp; Sameroff, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192513X12452253">Harding, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192513X12452253">Roche, Ensminger, &amp; Cherlin, 2007</xref>). The availability of neighborhood resources, such as supervised activities for children, influences parent’s decisions regarding how much freedom to give their children, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X12452253">Edin &amp; Kefalas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X12452253">Kurz, 2002</xref>). Concerns about racism may also factor into parents’ protective carework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X12452253">Collins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X12452253">Few, 2007</xref>). For example, mothers of color strive to teach their children how to flourish in discriminatory, “hostile” environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X12452253">Collins, 2005</xref>). The term <italic>hostile environments</italic> captures the antagonistic social contexts in which individuals who are marginalized by race, class, gender, sexuality, and/or age, conduct their daily lives. Hostile environments encompass tangible limitations that make it difficult for people to thrive as well as social configurations that serve to reinforce marginality. Studies suggest that Black parents closely monitor their children, fearing the consequences of living in such environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192513X12452253">Jarrett, 1997</xref>). When signing their children up for extracurricular activities, for instance, middle-class Black parents may seek racially diverse programs, hoping these provide safer environments for their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X12452253">Lareau, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The concept of “controlling images” is useful in understanding the maintenance and perpetuation of hostile environments and social inequality. Controlling images are denigrating, stereotypical images that depict “faulty” aspects of an oppressed group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X12452253">Collins, 2000</xref>). Controlling images emphasize cultural inferiority or impropriety and are often used as symbolic justification for continuing economic or social marginality. For example, controlling images depict Black men as aggressive, hypersexual, and criminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192513X12452253">Collins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192513X12452253">Russell-Brown, 1998</xref>). Controlling images of Latinos emphasize cultural dissimilarity and portray Latinos as oppositional and potentially dangerous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192513X12452253">Chavez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X12452253">Morris, 2005</xref>). In their protective carework, parents of color may find themselves having to push against controlling images in order to carve out places for their children to thrive in hostile environments.</p>
<p>Although families can serve as sites where inequality is resisted, they also have the potential to reproduce persistent forms of social inequality. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X12452253">Espiritu (2001)</xref> finds that Filipino immigrant parents resist racism and claim moral superiority over dominant Western culture by constructing a controlling image of the “ideal” young Filipina as family oriented and chaste. This tactic reinforces the submissive position of Filipinas, who are expected to comply with notions of feminine virtue or risk being labeled “Americanized” and “untraditional.” Protective carework concerns and strategies may thus be deeply and complexly inflected with gender-, race-, and class-specific meanings, experiences, and inequities.</p>
<p>Protective carework is not simply based on parents’ social locations but also based on their perceptions of how others will view their children’s race, class, and gender. With respect to gender, prior research suggests that parents give sons more freedom than daughters because they perceive girls to be more vulnerable and less capable of defending themselves than boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192513X12452253">Espiritu, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X12452253">Lareau, 2003</xref>). Differences in parenting practices based on gender may become more pronounced as children age and are seen as sexual beings. Feminist researchers argue that as children transition into adolescence, “boys often receive more freedom as they look older, and girls often receive less because they look sexual” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192513X12452253">Martin, 1996</xref>, p. 32). However, existing studies often fail to consider how age, race, class, and gender intertwine to shape the complex determinations parents make about how safe the world is for their children and how best to keep them safe. Paradoxically, today’s children are both feared for <italic>and</italic> feared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X12452253">Altheide, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192513X12452253">Giroux, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X12452253">Scott et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192513X12452253">Valentine, 1996</xref>). Moreover, the risks children are believed to face and pose are shaped by social distinctions, including age, gender, class, race, and ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X12452253">Collins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X12452253">Ferguson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X12452253">Morris, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing on interviews with 40 Black, White, and Latina mothers of teenagers, this article uses insights from critical race theory and Black feminism to tease out the intersectional processes in mothers’ protective carework and their implications for social inequality. Several advantages can be gained from applying critical race and Black feminist theoretical lenses to considerations of protective carework. Feminist research is grounded in lived experience, seeking to understand women’s lives and “ways of knowing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192513X12452253">Reinharz, 1992</xref>, p. 4) within unequal and oppressive social structures. Black feminism similarly emphasizes standpoint, in this case, “the politics of location in the lives of Black women” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X12452253">Few, 2007</xref>, p. 454; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X12452253">Collins, 2000</xref>). Black feminism reminds us that not all women experience oppression in the same ways. Together, Black feminism and critical race feminism stress the sociohistorical construction of race, complexity and multiplicity in women’s social locations and identities, and the intersectionality of race, class, and gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X12452253">Few, 2007</xref>). These analytic lenses encourage scholars to examine individual subjectivities and behaviors as unique but also shaped by and in conversation with broader sociocultural and historical processes and inequalities. According to these perspectives, race, class, and gender do not simply intersect in people’s lives, they are sociopolitically constructed categories that work in complex ways so that privilege and oppression, belonging and difference inform people’s everyday perceptions and ways of navigating their social environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X12452253">Collins, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X12452253">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X12452253">Few, 2007</xref>). We draw on this principal to demonstrate the complex ways three important axes of inequality—race, class, and gender—shape the protective carework of a diverse group of mothers of teenagers.</p>
<sec id="section1-0192513X12452253" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>We examine through a race, class, and gender lens how a socioeconomically diverse group of White, Black, and Latina mothers make sense of the dangers facing their teen children. We ask the following questions: (a) What do these mothers perceive as hostile in their children’s environments and how do race, class, and gender shape these fears? (b) How do mothers instruct their children to navigate hostile environments and what are the implications of these lessons for challenging or reproducing social inequality? Our findings highlight the strength of an intersectional approach informed by Black and critical race feminist analyses. We show that race, class, and gender are not independent categories but rather overlap in complex ways and are shaped by other factors, such as age and neighborhood context. Moreover, we reveal how these considerations infuse mothers’ fears for their children as well as their protective strategies.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The mothers in this study were drawn from a larger project investigating how parents of teenagers (aged 13-19 years) understand and guide teen sexuality. Mothers were far more likely than fathers to respond to recruiting efforts for this larger project, and ultimately, the first author conducted interviews with 40 mothers, six fathers, and one grandmother. To build on and add to the body of literature on mothers’ carework and in acknowledgment of the central role mothers play in the work of parenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192513X12452253">Kurz, 2002</xref>), we focus on the 40 White, Latina, and Black mothers interviewed as part of the larger study, although we remain sensitive to the need to bring fathers into family scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X12452253">Few, 2007</xref>) and consider the lack of fathers’ voices a limitation of this article. Most (<italic>n</italic> = 34) of the mothers in this study responded to letters sent home through their children’s health classes in three high schools and one middle school in an urban public school district in the southwest. The remaining 6 mothers were recruited through advertisements placed in community newspapers and through referrals.</p>
<p>Nineteen mothers identified as White, 15 identified as Latina, and 6 identified as Black. In terms of social class, 10 of the mothers are classified as upper middle class, 18 are categorized as lower middle class, and 12 are in a working-class or low-income bracket.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0192513X12452253">1</xref></sup> Twenty-five of the mothers identified their relationship status as married or living with a partner. The remaining 15 mothers are either single or dating. All study participants identified as heterosexual. Thirteen of the mothers have at least one teenage son, 12 mothers have at least one teenage daughter, and 15 mothers have at least one of each. Our goal of this article is not to identify how each particular group—say middle-class Latina mothers or working-class White mothers—enact protective carework. Rather, our aim is to show how the intersecting axes of race, class, and gender shape the protective carework of a diverse group of mothers of teenagers. Our analyses thus focus a great deal on language and meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X12452253">Few, 2007</xref>)—how mothers described their children and how they expressed concerns about their children’s safety and well-being—and how these are shaped by their social locations. That is, we have selected these mothers not because we think they are reflective of all mothers but because they can tell us much about how the interplay of concerns around race, class, gender, and age shape parenting practices.</p>

<sec id="section3-0192513X12452253">
<title>Interviews</title>
<p>Interviews lasted from 1 to 2½ hours and were generally conducted in study participants’ homes, but occasionally mothers were interviewed at their workplace or a café. Although the first author conducted the interviews largely to understand how parents think about and deal with teen sexuality, she asked a wide array of questions to help contextualize parents’ responses about sexuality in relation to their broader experiences raising teenagers. These questions included the following: “How would you describe your [son/daughter]?” “Describe a typical day” “How important do you think it is to have rules for teenagers?” “What is something your teen has faced that has surprised you or that you weren’t expecting?” “What would you say is the most challenging thing about raising a teenager?” “What kind of support does your community give you to parent your child(ren)?” “When will you consider your child(ren) an adult?” and many others. Interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim. Pseudonyms are used to maintain confidentiality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0192513X12452253">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Interviews focused on mothers’ parenting beliefs and experiences and “processes of interpretation that give meaning to everyday lives” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192513X12452253">DeVault, 1991</xref>, p. 11). Consistent with such an orientation, we employed a grounded theory approach to data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192513X12452253">Charmaz, 2006</xref>). Grounded theorists focus on social processes, meanings, and action and stress the development of conceptual categories from an ongoing, careful examination and interpretation of the data. For this analysis, the first author initially used line-by-line coding, identifying instances where mothers mentioned fears for their children, perceptions of hostile environments, and strategies to navigate perceived dangers. Both authors then discussed and honed the coding categories through focused coding and developed the analysis. Our analyses underscore several important ways that gender, race, and class shape mothers’ protective carework. For instance, mothers’ concerns for sons coalesced around their criminal vulnerability, whereas mothers worried about their daughters’ sexual vulnerability. Race/ethnicity and class also emerged as categories that mattered to the mothers; however their concerns were rarely directly articulated in terms of race/ethnicity and class. Instead mothers employed veiled, coded language to speak about race and class indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192513X12452253">Bettie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X12452253">Bonilla-Silva, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X12452253">Myers, 2005</xref>). Mothers also frequently used individualistic language to talk about family life—asserting that parents are responsible for protecting their children and that teens are responsible for their own choices, for example—yet mothers’ fears for their teen children as well as their protective strategies reveal important ways that larger structural inequalities based on race, class, and gender inform their protective carework.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section6-0192513X12452253">
<title>Hostile Environments</title>
<p>We use the term <italic>hostile environments</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X12452253">Collins, 2005</xref>) to capture mothers’ subjective understandings of the landscapes of risk their children face based on the intersections of race, class, and gender. The mothers in this study make sense of the dangers facing their teen children in a number of ways. We focus, however, on two types of risks that emerged as significant preoccupations for mothers across our sample: boys’ criminality and girls’ sexuality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0192513X12452253">2</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section7-0192513X12452253">
<title>Boys and criminal vulnerability</title>
<p>Mothers’ discussions of the dangers their sons face were framed largely in terms of their criminal vulnerability. Working-class and poor mothers and mothers living in or near poor neighborhoods tended to focus on the fear that their sons might be enticed into criminal activity by criminally involved “others.” These mothers consistently described poor neighborhoods composed primarily of non-White residents as risky or dangerous. Denise (52, Black, lower middle class) and her children live in a low-income, historically Black neighborhood. Denise described criminal activity in her neighborhood—primarily in the form of prostitution and drug dealing—as widespread and largely unregulated. There is regular police presence in the neighborhood, yet Denise said they rarely intervene. Denise worries that her 14-year-old son might see criminal pursuits as not only viable but also enviable:
<disp-quote>
<p>Because he saw the bling bling and the fast money, the beautiful cars, and the da da da. And one of the guys down the street had all that. He had the fast money. He had the nice cars. He wore shoes—I bet you he didn’t have the same pair of shoes on in two months. My son looked at that and thought, “This is fine.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although some of Denise’s fear was alleviated when the man down the street was arrested, she remains concerned about her son being enticed into criminal activity and frequently reminds her children: “‘When I’m at work, you stay in the yard ‘til I come home.’”</p>
<p>Like Denise, Kate (43, White, lower middle class) worries about negative local influences; however, the area that causes her concern is not her immediate neighborhood but a nearby low-income area she perceives as dangerous:
<disp-quote>
<p>You only have to go a certain, you know, just a few blocks, half a mile [from our house], and you’re in a really bad neighborhood, the, um, projects . . . [T]here are some bad things that go on over there in that neighborhood.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Kate’s 14-year-old son goes to school and has become friends with the kids in this neighborhood, most of whom are Black or Hispanic. In discussing her son’s friends, Kate described them as looking “really rough” and pondered whether “they’re old enough to be in gangs yet,” suggesting she assumes gang involvement in this neighborhood is inevitable. Her description of the neighborhood, and of her son’s friends, is inflected with racialized and classed understandings of space. Her use of the term <italic>the projects</italic> and musings about her son’s friends’ involvement with gangs is consistent with modern forms of race talk—the use of words that invoke and rely on racialized images without making explicit reference to race or ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X12452253">Bonilla-Silva, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192513X12452253">Myers, 2005</xref>). Code words are used to mask concerns about young people of color. Research on racial composition and perceptions of neighborhood dangerousness suggest that Kate’s perceptions are not necessarily unusual: The more young Black men there are in a neighborhood, the higher the perception of neighborhood criminality, irrespective of official crime rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192513X12452253">Quillian &amp; Pager, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Mothers of Black and Latino sons in this study who reside in upper-income neighborhoods—typically characterized as “safe” or “advantaged” neighborhoods—framed the dangers their sons face differently, though still centered on criminal behavior. Rather than worry that their sons will be enticed into criminal behavior, their concern is that their sons will be misidentified as criminals within their affluent neighborhoods. In expressing their fears, these mothers drew on popular controlling images of Black and Latino male criminality. Although they often resisted the universal accuracy of such characterizations by insisting that their sons defy such images, they at times reified these images for “other” boys of color. Kim (45, Black, lower middle class), for example, said she worries that in her affluent, primarily White neighborhood, her 17-year-old Black son may suffer a case of “mistaken identity” and be “picked out for the wrong reasons”:
<disp-quote>
<p>The biggest thing [I worry about] is other people’s reactions . . . [My son] has hair down to [his shoulders] and it’s braided. He has to keep it braided because of his dance. And, um, he wears the baggy [clothing]. He wears big pants. He’s never liked wearing—even when he was young, he always liked his clothes big. And when you look at him— I told him, the way he looks and the way he acts is different. He’s real polite, “Yes ma’am, no ma’am, yes sir, no sir.” He’s real polite. Unfortunately, society’s—we don’t take a good look, we can’t get past what we see on the outside. So that’s what I worry about—that in itself.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Paula and Josephina, two Latina mothers who live in Kim’s neighborhood, echoed her concerns about Black and Latino boys being the targets of authority figures. Paula’s (43, Latina, upper middle class) 14-year-old biracial (White and Latino) son has told her that the administrators at his school “always pick on the Hispanic and Black kids. Like gang colors—they’re always sending them home because their shirt is supposed to be a gang color.” Josephina (31, Latina, lower middle class), who has a 14-year-old Latino son, confirms, “There’s a lot of stigma to being Hispanic at school. Most [of] the children that get in trouble are Hispanic or African American.” Mothers’ fears for their sons parallel research showing that school authority figures view Black boys’ misbehavior as intentional and malicious but characterize White boys’ similar conduct as “boys being boys” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192513X12452253">Ferguson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X12452253">Morris, 2005</xref>). Yet, even as Kim teaches her son to resist the controlling image of the Black male thug by allowing him to dress as he chooses, she simultaneously lends credence to it by stating, “the way he looks and the way he acts is different.” These mothers’ discussions illustrate the challenges that mothers of children of color face in trying to protecting their children from racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192513X12452253">Collins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192513X12452253">Joseph, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X12452253">Lareau, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192513X12452253">Suizzo, Robinson, &amp; Pahlke, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192513X12452253">Wade-Gayles, 1984</xref>) as well as how these challenges are shaped by social class location.</p>
<p>Some middle-class and upper middle-class White mothers living in upper-income neighborhoods, by contrast, discussed their sons’ and/or sons’ friends’ involvement in criminal activities, yet did not express concern that their sons might be lured into a criminal lifestyle or be identified as criminals by others. Beth (39, White, upper middle class), for example, found marijuana in her 16-year-old son’s bedroom. When she confronted him, he told her that
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s very easy for him to get pot at school. Very, very easy. My husband was on this path of trying to figure out who the main guy was, but after a while you just get tired of talking about it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Beth also said her son has drunk hard liquor with his friends and mentioned that a couple of his friends were in a car accident, and when the police arrived, they found marijuana in the car. Yet Beth relayed this information fairly nonchalantly, and when asked whether her son’s friendships concern her, she replied, “You know, they’re good kids . . . I make a point to know their mothers. I know all of his friends’ parents. I see all of his friends.” Thus, although these affluent mothers at times discussed their sons’ and/or their sons’ friends’ participation in illegal activities, a pressing concern that their sons would <italic>become</italic> criminals or be characterized as criminally inclined by others was notably absent from their narratives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0192513X12452253">
<title>Girls and sexual vulnerability</title>
<p>None of the mothers in this study expressed concern about their daughters and criminality. Instead, these mothers framed their daughters’ safety and well-being largely in terms of girls’ sexual vulnerability, a perception that transcended neighborhood context. Mothers typically described their daughters’ sexual vulnerability as inherent and inescapable. As one mother put it, “Being a female, she’s vulnerable.” However, although all mothers described the dangers facing their daughters as literally inscribed on their bodies and thus ever-present, upper and lower middle-class mothers tended to focus on abstract dangers, such as broadly framed worries about pedophiles, whereas working-class and poor mothers more often described sexual threats to their daughters as concrete and proximate, discussing specific areas and/or individuals they perceive as dangerous. Below, we examine these two articulations of girls’ sexual vulnerability, with particular attention to why mothers across these social class locations framed their fears for their daughters in similar, yet distinct, ways.</p>
<p>In speaking of the difference between her upbringing and her 16-year-old daughter’s, Beatrice (52, White, lower middle class) raised the issue of child sex predators:
<disp-quote>
<p>One of the major differences between my childhood and [my daughter’s], we didn’t have to worry about sexual predators or being snatched, kidnapped. We played outside all the time and there weren’t any mothers around watching and all that. And I just know that, for me, that was a major thing when she was little.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Yolanda (30, Latina, lower middle class) broadly worries about the safety of her 13-year-old daughter:
<disp-quote>
<p>[S]he can be hurt at any point, she just doesn’t realize. I mean, we watched a movie a while back and it showed these people that were kidnapping children and she was—she literally got sick and she was like, “Mom, how could somebody do that?!” And I said, “<italic>That’s</italic> what we try to tell you. Those people exist out there and you don’t where they’re at. They look like just the common person.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, despite characterizing the world in general as a dangerous place for their daughters, these middle-class mothers tended to perceive the immediate spaces their daughters occupy and people with whom they interact as safe. Gabriela (44, Latina, upper middle class), for example, described a primarily supportive network around her 13- and 16-year-old daughters but worries about “outside influences”:
<disp-quote>
<p>Our close group of friends in the families that we choose to associate with and socialize with, they’re supportive. They kind of have the same ideals that we have. The larger part of society is what scares us . . . especially with the stories in the news about the girls that have been abducted and raped.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sharon (51, White, upper middle class) echoed Gabriela’s perception that her 14- and 16-year-old daughters’ immediate social settings are safe because they are surrounded by positive influences: “I’m not seeing any kind of White trash influence on them.” Similar to the term <italic>projects</italic>, White trash is a racial and class code that implies cultural degeneration. “The term white trash helps solidify for the middle and upper classes a sense of cultural and intellectual superiority” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192513X12452253">Wray &amp; Newitz, 1997</xref>, p. 1). Sharon’s use of the term <italic>White trash</italic> implies that her middle-class friends and community effectively insulate her daughters from the cultural deficiencies of poor Whites.</p>
<p>In contrast to middle-class mothers’ more abstract fears, poor and working-class mothers tied their fears for their daughters to palpable characteristics of their neighborhoods as well as to specific individuals in their lives. For example, Charlene (37, Black, poor) focused on her 15- and 17-year-old Black daughters’ vulnerability on the streets of their low-income neighborhood:
<disp-quote>
<p>Like, where I stay, it’s like a lot of Hispanic guys and a lot of them look like, I don’t know, I ain’t going to even say, but them are mainly the ones that are chasing them little girls or they’re telling them something. They’ll be like, “Hey, say little momma.” And when I’m with [my daughters I tell these men], “Keep your eyes over there because you’re not going to go to jail ‘cause they’re underage, <italic>I’m</italic> going because I’m going to whoop your tail!” So I have to be the protector of my girls, you know what I’m saying?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Drawing on notions of threatening “Hispanic” men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192513X12452253">Morris, 2005</xref>) and her daughters’ experiences in their neighborhood, Charlene adamantly repeated the importance of protecting her daughters throughout her interview. In her efforts to do so, Charlene—who described her daughters as very attractive and curvaceous—carefully monitors their clothing, ensuring that nothing is too tight or too revealing:
<disp-quote>
<p>They hate for me to go [clothes] shopping with them, ‘cause I have to do the finger thing. Stand up, do the finger thing. You know, bend over. And they don’t like that. So they’ll go shopping without me. But when they come in and I say, “Let me see your clothes.” They’ll be like, “Oh, Momma, ugh.” [And I will say], “Let me see them or we’re going back and exchanging them.” So they know how to get clothes that are not revealing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Women of color face numerous “controlling images” focused on sexuality and are not only more likely to be hypersexualized in dominant discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X12452253">Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192513X12452253">Littlefield, 2008</xref>) but are less likely to illicit public sympathy or support when sexually victimized because of these controlling images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192513X12452253">Ardovini-Brooker &amp; Caringella-MacDonald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X12452253">Madriz, 1997</xref>). By restricting her daughters’ clothing choices, Charlene may thus hope to deflect these controlling images <italic>and</italic> minimize their vulnerability to sexual danger. Yet her efforts are consistent with dominant ideologies of crime that suggest women are ultimately responsible for preventing and controlling their own potential victimization by behaving and looking like “good girls” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192513X12452253">Benedict, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192513X12452253">Madriz, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Some low-income mothers view their homes as threatening places for their daughters, as Elena’s (41, Latina, working class) story reveals. Elena and her three children moved in with Elena’s boyfriend after Elena had trouble paying her rent. Elena described how she monitors her live-in boyfriend around her 16-year-old daughter, fearing that he might molest her: “Having to move in with my boyfriend, I have that problem, that constant supervision. Always, okay, making sure, okay, he’s here, he’s not over there. Of all the things I’ve seen and heard, it’s more of being more protective.” Elena worries that her daughter, who is shy and quiet, might not speak out if Elena’s boyfriend “tried something against her.” Charlene and Elena’s stories help illustrate why low-income mothers’ fear for their daughters may be immediate and specific: Their economic circumstances often mean they have limited options about where and with whom they live, and the individuals around them may more closely conform to their understandings of threatening “others.”</p>

<title>Mothers’ Strategies of Protective Carework</title>
<p>Fears and concerns about teenagers’ safety are clearly salient issues for the mothers in this study. Previously, we explored how these fears are shaped by race, class, and gender, that is, the social and physical worlds that teenagers inhabit. In this section, we discuss the three main strategies mothers adopt in their efforts to keep their children safe: (a) encouraging individual responsibility; (b) monitoring their teen children’s friendships, activities, and whereabouts; and (c) keeping teens busy with “positive,” organized activities. We explore each of these in turn with a focus on how these strategies are shaped by mothers’ social locations and, in particular, by the resources mothers have at their disposal.</p>
<sec id="section10-0192513X12452253">
<title>Individual responsibility</title>
<p>Mothers consistently said they teach their children to be responsible as a way to stay safe. In line with dominant discourses that emphasize personal responsibility, mothers generally framed responsibility in terms of making “good choices” or “responsible decisions” and focus their lessons to their children on the negative consequences of making bad decisions. As Melissa (43, White, upper middle class) put it: “I trust my kids enough to make their own decision. And they know if they break the rule, then they’re responsible.” Teresa (43, Latina, working class) emphasized the importance of allowing her 14-year-old son “to make his own choices, and try to learn from them . . . to know he has to be responsible. It’s up to him.” Similarly, Josephina (31, Latina, lower middle class) said she tells her 14-year-old son: “Life is much easier if you’re just responsible with some decisions.”</p>
<p>However, mothers framed the consequences of “bad” choices differently. Upper middle-class mothers such as Melissa typically said that the consequence their children face for making a bad choice is a consequence that mothers themselves dole out: such as grounding their teen children or taking away video games and other privileges. Indeed, some of these mothers said that well-off youth are cushioned from the consequences of their bad choices by their parents’ affluence. Portia (46, Latina, upper middle class) spoke disparagingly about the wealthy parents at her children’s school, who, Portia said, are litigious:
<disp-quote>
<p>There are always several lawsuits going on from parents and it’s always around, you know, their kid. It’s really just looking out for number one . . . We had a kid who stole the golf cart [and] broke into the school to change their academic records. As far as I know, that’s a felony, one of them, at least. And nothing ever happened. There were no consequences for that child.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Less affluent mothers (including poor, working class, and lower middle class) also use forms of sanctions, such as grounding, as a consequence, but these mothers said they focus much of their attention on trying to prevent their children from making bad choices in the first place. Many do so by stressing the dire lifelong consequences of bad decisions. Kim (45, Black, lower middle class) tells her children, “I want you to start thinking about how what you say, what you do, is gonna affect you today and later in your life . . . If you do something, there will be a consequence.” Similarly, when Beatrice (52, White, lower middle class) found out that a girl at her daughter’s school was pregnant, she told her 16-year-old daughter: “She made a choice and her life’s going to be harder because of that.” Like Beatrice, many of these mothers said that they tell their children that they, and they alone, will have to deal with the consequences of their choices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0192513X12452253">3</xref></sup> As Denise (52, Black, lower middle class) put it to her teen children:
<disp-quote>
<p>I tell them, “If anything happens and you come up pregnant, you take that responsibility. You watch that baby, you feed that baby, you clothe that baby, you get you a job. You still have to finish school. So if between now and the time you finish school, you make a stupid mistake, you deal with it. Life can be fun, but you can ruin it for yourself if you choose to.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some mothers said they use their own lives as negative examples. Nicole (32, White, working class), who grew up poor and was in the foster care system when she gave birth to her first child, now has a 16-year-old son who she fears is making some of the same bad decisions she did at that age:
<disp-quote>
<p>[I was] pregnant at 15 and had [my son] at 16. And, uh, I try to tell him . . . I’m like, “I’ve been there.” You know? I try to tell him about how life is, only because I’ve done it. Hanging out with the wrong kind of friends—I’ve done it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, although mothers typically discussed their teen children’s personal responsibility in very individualistic terms, they also offered insight into the larger structural factors that shape their concerns for their teen children as well as the lessons they provide based on those concerns. Less affluent mothers’ emphasis on preventing bad choices seems to stem from a fear that they cannot protect or “save” their children from their bad choices. Norma (36, Latina, lower middle class) expressed this:
<disp-quote>
<p>My challenging part with [my 15-year-old son] is making sure that he freaking stays out of jail because it seems like he’s the type that, with his luck, that he’s in the wrong place at the wrong time . . . You know these choices that he is making . . . But, you know, I will not go save him from that. And, you know, my fear is not being able to save them from a bad choice that they make.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Norma initially asserted that her son will be on his own if he gets into trouble with the law but then immediately expressed concern that she may not be able to save her teen children from “a bad choice that they make.” Some mothers explicitly said they do not have the resources they perceive other, more affluent parents have, to buffer their children from the consequences of their choices. Rebecca (49, White, working class), for example, purposely chose to live in a wealthy neighborhood while her now 19-year-old son was growing up, even though this strained their meager family resources “because it’s who you grow up around and the people you go to school with that, you know, have a huge impact on who you’re going to be.” Yet despite her belief that growing up around privileged people would be a good influence on her son, Rebecca revealed that most of her son’s wealthy friends have been arrested at one time or another, typically for drunk driving, petty theft, or vandalism: “They think it’s funny. Well, we don’t think it’s funny.” She stresses to her son that if he is arrested, she does not have the money or the social connections that his friends’ parents have: “I mean we’ve always really pressed upon him: ‘We don’t have as many good [connections]. We don’t have influence. And it’s not okay to get in trouble.’” Thus, even though Rebecca expressed the belief that she has protected and nurtured her son by surrounding him with affluence, she also consistently instructs him to be judicious and “make good choices” because she does not have the resources she perceives other parents in their neighborhood have to protect him from the consequences of his actions. These mothers’ warnings and life stories suggest that the consequences for missteps can be quite high when resources are scarce. In this way and others, mothers point to the structural forces that shape their protective carework, even as their lessons remain highly individualistic—centered on making choices and taking full responsibility for those choices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0192513X12452253">
<title>Monitoring</title>
<p>Another strategy mothers employ in their efforts to keep their teen children safe is to closely monitor their friendships, whereabouts, and activities. Mothers embraced protective monitoring as <italic>the</italic> critical component of “good” parenting and attributed many modern social ills to a lack of parental supervision. Corina (39, Black, working class) said, “The parents these days . . . they’re not parenting. They’re out worrying about themselves and doing their own thing. They’re worried about their life and not their kids.” Delores (33, Latina, lower middle class) was dismissive of her 13-year-old daughter’s friends’ parents “because a lot of them let their kids kind of like wander the streets. I mean, maybe not wander, but, you know, just kind of let them go.” Most mothers, however, said they try to balance monitoring their teen children’s behavior and choices with giving them some degree of autonomy. Melissa (43, White, upper middle class) tells her four children:
<disp-quote>
<p>“I trust you, but if you slip off in the sense that you say you’re somewhere where you’re not, then you will be checked on every 2 hours. So, I’ll trust you and then we’ll see. If you step off the track, then you can count on a lot of checking in and less trust.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This balancing act was particularly apparent when mothers talked about their teenagers’ friendships. Lower income mothers, especially those with sons, expressed concern about their children’s friends being bad influences. In referring to an incident when her son skipped school, Kelly (37, White, working class) referred to his friends as “his little bad buddies.” Similarly, Norma attributed her son’s “bad choices” to peer pressure: “You know, he’ll be good until the next time he’s tempted by peer pressure. I can’t understand why he’s making such bad choices.”</p>
<p>Because these mothers worry that their “good” kids might be led astray by their peers, some actively vet their children’s peers, vetoing those they think may be bad influences. For example, employing coded language, Penny (52, White, lower middle class) stated there is a “cultural difference” between her and her low-income, primarily Black and Latino neighbors: “Education is very important to us and I don’t think it is for most of the families around here. It’s just a cultural difference, I guess.” Stemming from her concerns, rather than allow her 16- and 17-year-old sons the freedom to choose friends, if one of her sons wants to bring someone to the house, she asks, “‘How are his grades?’ If he says, ‘Not so great,’ I say, ‘Then I don’t think that’s the type of person you should be spending time with.’” Generally, however, mothers said they allow their children to make their own choices around friendships but vocalize their concerns when they think they have made a poor choice. Teresa’s (43, Latina, working class) son chooses “his own friends,” but she warns him:
<disp-quote>
<p>“Be cautious of the friends that you have because there’s a lot of times that they may say, yeah, they’re your friends, but when it really comes down to it, they’re not gonna be there. You know, they’re gonna get you in trouble quickly, but they’re not gonna be there to help you out of it.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>More affluent mothers and mothers who reside in well-off neighborhoods also tell their children whether they like or dislike their friends; however, these mothers did not characterize their children’s peers as threatening in the same way lower income and mothers who reside in low-income neighborhoods did. Pamela (47, White, lower middle class), for example, is not crazy about her 15-year-old daughter’s friends: “But, you know, [I tell her] ‘It’s your choice. They’re your friends. I may not like ‘em, but you may not like some of my friends.’ You know?” Similarly, although Rebecca’s son’s affluent friends seem to routinely get into trouble with the law, Rebecca does not warn her son away from them but rather warns him to avoid participating in any law-breaking behavior because she cannot bail him out the way she perceives her son’s friends’ parents can.</p>
<p>In addition to monitoring their children’s friendships, mothers said they monitor their children’s whereabouts and activities, yet have different resources at their disposal to do so. The middle-class mothers in this study described providing their children with tools and technology to keep track of their whereabouts and thereby protect them. In particular, many upper and lower middle-class mothers discussed the importance of their children having their own cell phones to monitor their whereabouts. Beatrice (52, White, lower middle class) got her 16-year-old daughter a cell phone in sixth grade so that she could “keep up with her and stuff. And sometimes I get mad if I call it and it’s on voice mail or whatever. I’m like, ‘You should have this phone on!’” Because cell phones do not indicate the user’s location, Beth (39, White, upper middle class) has adopted other technologies to keep track of her 16-year-old son: “He has to call me from place to place. And then has to prove that he is there. Like calling me from a house or something so I can see it on caller ID.” In addition to paying for her son to have a cell phone, Beth has the financial wherewithal to pay the costs associated with caller ID in order to have visible proof of her son’s whereabouts.</p>
<p>Some affluent mothers are torn about how far to go to protect their children. Portia’s (46, Latina, upper middle class) husband wants their 16-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter to learn how to be resourceful and self-sufficient. They both have summer jobs and are supposed to save their money to pay for things throughout the year. To reinforce the message of self-sufficiency, Portia’s husband does not want her to help them out when they run low on money. Portia is not convinced:
<disp-quote>
<p>My view is that things are very different because when we grew up, you could spend a thousand dollars on a car and it—. I was in a small town, so if my car broke down, it wasn’t that big a deal. There really weren’t any bad parts of town and a relative could come help me. We don’t have relatives. We’re out here on our own . . . So I want him to have a reliable vehicle. I want him to have enough money for fuel so that he doesn’t run out of gas and enough money to make sure that he eats enough. That does take money!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Portia pointed to the social structural phenomenon that, she believes, makes the world a more dangerous place for her children than it was for her: They live in a big city that has “bad parts” and they do not have relatives nearby. As far as she is concerned, she and her husband are responsible for their children’s safety, so she uses her economic assets to buffer them from danger. She has insisted on buying her son a new vehicle on the basis that it will be more reliable and safer than a used one. She also pays for her children to each have a cell phone and reminds them to keep the phones charged. Furthermore, against her husband’s wishes, she secretly gives her son additional money to pay for gas, food, and other incidentals.</p>
<p>Low-income mothers also think that the best way to keep their children safe is to closely monitor their whereabouts, but they have different resources with which to do this. Rather than using and equipping their children with technology, working-class and poor mothers described using their own physical presence, whenever possible, to ensure their children’s safety. Corina (39, Black, working class), referring to her now adult daughters, stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>I guess you could say I was an overbearing mom, more than overprotective, because everything they did, I did with them. If it was going to the park, I was there. If it was going to Chuck E. Cheese, I was there. I just didn’t allow them to have too much space away from me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Lorena (32, Latina, working class) said,
<disp-quote>
<p>We do everything as a family. It’s just me and [my 9- and 16-year-old sons]. It’s not like I drop them off and they go to the movies by themselves. They never, never will do that. [They ask me], “Why do you do that? I want to go by myself!” And I’m like, “No. It’s better when I’m there.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Charlene (37, Black, poor)—a single mother who does not own a car—also uses her physical presence in her efforts to safeguard her 15- and 17-year-old daughters. Without a car, Charlene’s daughters must walk or take the bus. Whenever possible, Charlene said she walks with them, acting as a shield between them and the catcalling men on the street. Lack of access to safe transportation clearly puts an enormous strain on Charlene; it also has consequences for her daughters’ well-being. For example, Charlene’s 15-year-old daughter, who failed ninth grade, was unable to attend summer school because doing so would have required her to walk to the bus stop at a time when Charlene was at work. Charlene said she simply could not permit her daughter to be on the streets alone given the dangers of their neighborhood: “[So] I canceled summer school. So [my daughter] had to repeat [ninth grade]. She did. Yeah.” Charlene believes that a good mother is one who protects her children: “I have to be the protector of my girls, you know what I’m saying?” Yet as a single parent with no immediate family nearby, she is also her children’s sole economic support. The harsh realities of Charlene’s life mean that for her to maintain her status as her children’s protector <italic>and</italic> the family breadwinner, she must make difficult decisions in her efforts to keep her children safe.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0192513X12452253">
<title>Organized activities</title>
<p>A third strategy that mothers use in their efforts to keep their teen children safe is to involve them in organized activities. Unlike previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192513X12452253">Lareau, 2003</xref>), we did not find a class difference in mothers’ support of extracurricular activities: All mothers said they want their teen children to participate. This may be because mothers of teenagers view extracurricular activities less in terms of cultivation and more in terms of occupying their teenagers’ time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X12452253">Edin &amp; Kefalas, 2005</xref>). Mothers in our study expressed the belief that at this age, extracurricular activities function to keep teenagers safe by ensuring they are in controlled environments, have a “focus,” and are surrounded by “positive” peer groups. They also keep teens from being bored, something mothers believe encourages “experimentation,” sexual or otherwise. Paula (43, Latina, upper middle class) described how she and her husband respond when their 14-year-old son expresses a desire to drop out of his swimming program: “Well that’s fine, but what are you going to do instead? You pick the activity, but we want you to do something.” Mothers want their teen children to be involved in extracurricular activities: Nonparticipation is not an option. However, upper and lower middle-class mothers such as Paula have greater resources to draw on in occupying their children. Many casually described their children’s numerous organized activities. Kim (45, Black, lower middle class), whose 17-year-old son is heavily involved in dance, detailed her 12-year-old niece’s and 10-year-old daughter’s weekly schedule:
<disp-quote>
<p>On Mondays and Thursdays we go to tutoring. And that’s been happening for the last, say, 2 years. [My daughter] goes to dance Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. Acting on Wednesdays and Saturday mornings. Choir and voice lessons on Sunday. I mean, it’s just, everything is set.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Working-class and poor mothers also encourage their children’s participation in extracurricular activities, but they rely on activities that are tied to their children’s schools and even then struggle to meet the associated costs. Kelly’s (37, White, working class) 14- and 16-year-old sons ride the bus to and from school everyday and are expected to be home when they are not in school or in transit until Kelly gets home from work. The exception is when they have basketball practice or when one of their coaches calls: “[Their coach] will call up some of the kids sometimes, ‘Hey we’re getting together at the middle school and we’re going to have a scrimmage.’ Stuff like that, that keeps these guys in focus with having a social kind of atmosphere.” Kelly reflected on the importance of basketball in her sons’ lives: “I don’t know what all the other people do, if they go bowling or what they do, but my kids do basketball . . . When they go on the Internet, they look up shoes, basketball shoes.” However, Kelly’s tight budget makes it difficult for her to purchase the shoes her sons desire: “When they say, ‘Mom, why can’t we go out and buy me some new basketball shoes?’ I say, ‘Let me look at my bankbook. Let me see how much I have. Sorry dudes. It’s either food or shoes.’”</p>
<p>Similarly, Corina (39, Black, working class) firmly believes in the importance of extracurricular activities, but when she was a single mother, she often found it difficult to buy track shoes for her two older daughters, who are now in their early twenties. She recently told her daughters that she sometimes had sex with men for money in order to support their activities: “I’m not saying that I sold myself but hey, if I had to do it for my girls, yeah. And not putting them in any danger. I didn’t bring no men to my house.” When asked how her daughters’ responded to this piece of information, she replied,
<disp-quote>
<p>They didn’t believe me. It was like, “Mom, you’re kidding. You was always with us. You ain’t had time to do stuff like that.” I said, “Well you got those tennis shoes, didn’t you? Or you went to that track meet that I couldn’t afford to get you to. I got you there.” You know. Sacrifice.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like other mothers, Corina viewed her teen daughters’ participation in organized activities as an important part of their development and a way to keep them safe; however, she struggled to meet the costs for their participation—this required, as she put it, “sacrifice.” Sacrifice is a central narrative in poor women’s accounts of mothering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192513X12452253">Edin &amp; Kefalas, 2005</xref>). Thus, despite their shared belief in the need to protect their children, mothers’ social locations shape the resources they have to enact carework strategies. Middle-class mothers have access to a range of supervised extracurricular activities they hope will keep their children safe and busy. Poor and working-class mothers encourage extracurricular activities as well but may lack, or may have to go to great lengths to secure, the resources needed for their children to participate in them.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Drawing on interviews with 40 White, Latina, and Black mothers of teenagers, we demonstrate how larger systems of inequality are threaded through mothers’ interpretations of their children’s social worlds, as well as their protective carework aimed at buffering their children from these “hostile environments.” We argue that mothers’ protective carework is best understood through an intersectional lens that exposes the overlapping significance of race, class, gender, and age in both mothers’ interpretations of threat and the strategies they employ to help their teenagers avoid such threats. We find that for boys, mothers’ concerns center on criminality, and for girls, mothers worry about sexual vulnerability. The nature and degree of mothers’ preoccupation with criminality or sexual vulnerability, however, vary based on several factors, including the proximity of threatening “others” and the degree to which their child is subject to controlling images. Threatening others and controlling images were most often evoked in mothers’ assessments of neighborhood context. Mothers in or near poor neighborhoods described specific individuals or places that may tempt their sons into criminal lifestyle or that pose a threat to their daughters’ sexual safety. In contrast, mothers in more affluent neighborhoods tended to perceive such threats as less proximate, with the exception of middle-class Black and Latina mothers of sons. These mothers worried less about their sons’ enticement into criminal activities and more about the consequences of controlling images for their sons’ safety, fearing that their sons may be misidentified as criminals in their well-off neighborhoods because of their gender and the color of their skin. When expressing concerns about “threatening” neighborhoods, whether their own, those nearby, or those in “bad parts of town,” mothers’ attributed negative social characteristics to these neighborhoods. We argue that using neighborhoods as verbal shorthand to describe social threats became a way some mothers could articulate concerns about largely poor and/or non-White others without having to be explicit in their references to the social class or race of these threatening others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192513X12452253">Bettie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192513X12452253">Bonilla-Silva, 2003</xref>). Although some mothers worked to challenge racial stereotypes, these challenges were often limited to a defense of their own children’s character and did little to resist the foundations of controlling images. This illustrates one way that families may serve as both a site of resistance to inequality and a place where social inequality is reproduced.</p>
<p>Mothers’ protective carework <italic>strategies</italic> are also etched by social hierarchies of race, class, and gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X12452253">Few, 2007</xref>). Echoing the popular U.S. discourse that emphasizes personal responsibility, mothers teach their teenagers to make responsible choices in order to be safe. However, mothers in less secure economic positions were not optimistic that they could shield their children from the consequences of bad choices and focused their lessons on the long-term negative consequences of poor decision making, implying that the difficulties individuals face are purely a product of their own making. Though these lessons are based on mothers’ fears that they cannot buffer their children from the consequences of their choices, they justify the vast disparities in life chances in U.S. society.</p>
<p>The significance of mothers’ access to resources is also notable when considering the final two carework strategies: monitoring and organized activities. In terms of monitoring, wealthier mothers provide their children with cell phones, reliable transportation, and money. These resources give mothers consistent access to their teen children while also allowing their children some autonomy and independence. Providing their children with these resources allows mothers some peace of mind that their children are safe, even when not under their direct supervision. Mothers who lack access to such resources expressed similar concerns about their children’s safety but must negotiate alternative, less costly ways to monitor their children. Working-class and poor mothers, many of who were unpartnered, tended to be highly restrictive in the amount of autonomy they allow their children (e.g., requiring children to be in the house while mom is at work) and were more likely to describe using their physical presence as a means to protect their teenagers. Similarly, although all mothers viewed extracurricular activities as a way to help keep teens safe, working-class and poor mothers said they rely heavily on activities provided by their children’s schools and, even so, struggle to meet the costs associated with their children’s participation.</p>
<p>Academic attention to how parents perceive the dangers facing their teen children as well as the strategies they employ to try to keep them safe are important to understanding modern family life, especially given widespread discourses that construct contemporary adolescence as uniquely risky and fraught with danger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192513X12452253">Altheide, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192513X12452253">Nelson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192513X12452253">Scott et al., 1998</xref>). An intersectional approach, informed by Black feminism and critical race feminism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X12452253">Few, 2007</xref>), provides insight into the social processes of mothers’ protective carework. Our analyses demonstrate the benefits of examining how race, class, and gender inequalities are experienced, resisted, and reproduced through mothers’ concerns about their children’s safety and well-being. The challenge of employing an intersectional approach is balancing description of patterns across social positions with unique, lived experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X12452253">Collins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192513X12452253">Few, 2007</xref>). In this article, we have tried to demonstrate the commonalities and patterns in the mothers’ narratives without assuming that each mother’s experiences can “map” directly onto those of another and without losing sight of the unique factors that shape mothers’ protective carework. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192513X12452253">Collins (2000</xref>, p. 298) observes: “Each individual must find her own way, recognizing that her personal biography, while unique, is never as unique as she thinks.” Our data are limited by a focus on mothers of teenagers. Future research should examine fathers and teens themselves, as well as other groups of parents, for example, parents who are new immigrants and parents from racial/ethnic groups not discussed here. Additional research needs to further map out what parents in diverse social locations perceive as hostile environments and how these are shaped by and interact with race, class, and gender. There is still much work to be done in understanding how the carework parents do is linked to their perceptions of their children’s place within broader society as well as how parental carework may resist and/or reproduce social inequality.</p>

<p>Mothers’ social class locations were based on their self-reported household income as well as the type of job they held (and, if applicable, their partner’s occupation) and level of education.
