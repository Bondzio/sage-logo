<p>62.4623 ABBOTT, Anita; BARRETT, Patrick — <bold>The approaches to democracy and human rights [in Southeast Asia]: a note.</bold> <italic>Democracy and Security</italic> 8(1), Jan.–March 2012: 43–50.</p>
<p>This article [examines] the theoretical framework of the approach of Southeast Asian states to democracy and human rights and traces the contemporary developmental trajectory of liberal democracy and democracy in Southeast Asian states. It suggests that what is required is the eventual convergence of the positive values of liberal democracy (respect for rule of law and the protection of human rights) and positive Southeast Asian values (respect for authority, strong families, and reverence for education, hard work, frugality, and team work). That is, the positive values of liberal democracy are required for the assurance of human rights protection, and positive Southeast Asian values are required for the maintenance of cultural identity. Nonetheless, democracy does not necessarily lead to the assurance of human rights. [R]</p>
<p>62.4624 AHMAD, Rana Eijaz — <bold>Pakistan's internal security threats in the age of globalization.</bold> <italic>Pakistan Vision</italic> 10(2), Dec. 2009: 160–174.</p>
<p>Plurality and division in consociational Pakistan lead to many horizontal and vertical cleavages not only undermining the country's economic system, but also causing socio-political instability. Internal security threats include weak institutions, inefficient system capabilities, the overlapping of the political with the non-political elite, media fabrications, and the non-availability of honest leadership. All of the above factors contribute to the system's dysfunction. In an age of globalization, Pakistani media are working against national interest and have made the country more vulnerable through the dissemination of manipulated information. They present a gloomy image of Pakistan and hinder foreign investment. Nevertheless, the heavy sacrifices following 9/11 [2001] will lead Pakistan towards a brighter future if certain recommendations as to how to curb internal security threats are followed.</p>
<p>62.4625 AKAN, Taner — <bold>The political economy of Turkish conservative democracy as a governmental strategy of industrial relations between Islamism, neoliberalism and social democracy.</bold> <italic>Economic and Industrial Democracy</italic> 33(2), May 2012: 317–349.</p>
<p>Since 2002, the incumbent Justice and Development Party's (JDP) industrial relations (IR) policy has dichotomized Turkish public opinion. Positions have ranged from socialism to neoliberalism and include a reference to Islamism. This article argues that this ambiguity stems from the confrontation between the JDP's Islamist sociopolitical background and the confines of Turkish IR under the pressure of neoliberal restructuring. Thus, it aims to crystallize the party's Conservative Democratic identity in relation to IR by examining how the JDP's cosmopolitan nature embraces its Islamist, neoliberal and social democratic foundations. In its current form, Conservative Democracy as an IR governmental strategy has less to do with pure Islamism, neoliberalism or social democracy than with a “hard pragmatism”, located between the suppression of and support for organized labor under the shadow of the party's politico-economic agenda.

<p>62.4626 ALAM RIZVI, M. Mahtab — <bold><italic>Velayat-e-faqih</italic> (the Supreme Leader) and Iranian foreign policy: an historical analysis.</bold> <italic>Strategic Analysis</italic> 36(1), Jan. 2012: 112–127.</p>
<p>There has been an increasing assertion of the <italic>velayat-e-faqih</italic> in Iranian politics in recent years. This has led to tensions between them and the presidential office in Iran. Against this backdrop, this article analyzes the constitutional position of the <italic>velayat-e-faqih</italic> and how it has interacted with other institutions to shape Iranian foreign policy. The article critically analyzes the relationship between the <italic>velayat-e-faqih</italic> and different popularly elected presidents. This institution has been able to determine the course of Iranian foreign policy so far and will play an important role in its formulation in the future. [R]</p>
<p>62.4627 ANCKAR, Dag — <bold>Folksuveränitet och parlamentets suveränitet i tidigare brittiska kolonier. Kartläggning och reflexioner (Popular sovereignty and parliamentary sovereignty in the former British colonies).</bold> <italic>Statsvetenskaplig Tidskrift</italic> 114(1), 2012: 7–28.</p>
<p>The doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty is a center-piece of the Westminster system. However, the doctrine stands challenged by several institutional arrangements, among which are direct democracy applications. Taking a point of departure in this incompatibility of parliamentary and popular sovereignty, this study investigates to what extent former British colonies have really, by relinquishing the popular vote, internalized the metropolitan Westminster doctrine. Drawing on several pieces of research and data collections, the study shows that the referendum institute has indeed come to little use in the former colonies, the average number for a time-period running from independence through 2010 being one referendum per country, and New Zealand standing among 54 cases out as the only former colony that has repeatedly applied the institute.

<p>62.4628 APPIAH-ADU, Kwaku; ANING, Samuel — <bold>Enhancing government's policy management and decision-making system: the case of Ghana's central governance reforms project.</bold> <italic>Canadian Public Administration</italic> 55(1), March 2012: 125–147. [Résumé en français]</p>
<p>Countries around the world are investing in the improvement of policy capacity in their public services. Ghana has made similar investments during the last decade, in order to achieve the government's far-reaching policy agenda of transforming Ghana's economy. The Ghana Central Governance Project was initiated during the year 2000 in order to develop a skilled civil service, capable of moving coherently and effectively from policy and strategy to detailed policy options, budgeted programs and concrete results. This reform was deemed essential to the realization of the government's ambitious agenda. [R]</p>
<p>62.4629 ARMITAGE, Faith — <bold>From elite control to democratic competition: procedural reform and cultural change in UK House of Commons Speakership elections.</bold> <italic>British Politics</italic> 7(2), June 2012: 135–162.</p>
<p>This article reveals how and why Speakership elections, in the space of a few parliaments, moved from being largely under the control of a narrow Commons elite to unpredictable contests with multiple candidates. In doing so, it adds a new dimension to two important and widely discussed phenomena: the increasing independence shown by backbench MPs since the 1970s, and the rise of career MPs at Westminster. These developments laid the groundwork for the reform by contributing to changes in the prevailing norms around Speakership selection. In addition, this article reinforces existing arguments about the elusive and paradoxical nature of parliamentary reform at Westminster by considering the effects of Speakership selection reform on parliamentary strengthening.

<p>62.4630 AUCOIN, Peter — <bold>New political governance in Westminster systems: impartial public administration and management performance at risk.</bold> <italic>Governance</italic> 25(2), Apr. 2012: 177–199.</p>
<p>This article examines the phenomenon of increased political pressures on governments in four Westminster systems (Australia, Britain, Canada, and New Zealand) derived from changes in mass media and communications, increased transparency, expanded audit, increased competition in the political marketplace, and political polarization in the electorate. These pressures raise the risk to impartial public administration and management performance to the extent that governments integrate governance and campaigning, allow political staff to be a separate force in governance, politicize top public service posts, and expect public servants to be promiscuously partisan. New Zealand is best positioned to cope with these risks, in part because of its process for independently staffing its top public service posts. The article recommends this approach.

<p>62.4631 AUSTVIK, Ole Gunnar — <bold>Landlord and entrepreneur: the shifting roles of the state in Norwegian oil and gas policy.</bold> <italic>Governance</italic> 25(2), Apr. 2012: 315–334.</p>
<p>This article discusses the shifting roles of the Norwegian state as landlord and entrepreneur in developing and maintaining its national oil and gas industry. Drawing from endogenous-growth and small-state theories, the article discusses the roles of the Norwegian state as infant-industry developer, mature-industry controller, and national-company owner. The Norwegian petroleum experience shows how a nation-state expressed clear visions and goals for an industrial sector, and took the role as leader of industrial and economic developments itself. The case argues that for a strategic national industry to be competitively developed and retained and social goals reached, a strong, comprehensive, and dynamic interaction between the state and industry, led by the state, may be necessary.

<p>62.4632 BAER, Susanne — <bold>Braucht das Grundgesetz ein Update? Demokratie im Internetzeitalter (Does the [German] Basic Law [Constitution] need an update? Democracy in the internet era).</bold> <italic>Blätter für deutsche und internationale Politik</italic> 56(1), 2011: 90–100.</p>
<p>The Basic Law guarantees the rights of the citizens within democratic rule of law. But what is the situation for the Constitution in the age of the internet? Is it an effective bulwark against the misuse of liberties on the web? The Basic Law helps to combat discrimination and violence in the context of unequal resources. It especially ensures individuality and communication, social participation and mutual respect. The Constitution stands for equal opportunities, an equitable framework and forces government to protect diversity, creativity and discussion.</p>
<p>62.4633 BAMMAN, Nicholas — <bold>Campaign finance: public funding [in the US] after <italic>Bennett</italic> [2011 decision of the Supreme Court].</bold> <italic>Journal of Law and Politics</italic> 27(2), Winter 2012: 323–356.</p>
<p>This Article is the first to examine the effects of the [US] Supreme Court's recent decision <italic>Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett</italic> [2011] on campaign finance. To comply with <italic>Bennett</italic>, several states and localities will have to amend their campaign finance laws. This article proposes several public funding options that will survive current constitutional jurisprudence and the policy implications of each. [R]</p>
<p>62.4634 BASINGER, Scott J.; ROTTINGHAUS, Brandon — <bold>Stonewalling and suspicion during [US] presidential scandals.</bold> <italic>Political Research Quarterly</italic> 65(2), June 2012: 290–302.</p>
<p>Scholars possess little theoretical understanding of how presidents behave during scandals. Existing presidential scholarship has focused on “offensive” communication, aimed at achieving legislative or policy goals, whereas the authors' interest is in “defensive” communication. Using a game-theoretic signaling model of the [US] president-media relationship, the authors identify conditions affecting White House stonewalling and media feeding frenzies. The president's optimal behavior changes depending on circumstances, particularly the level of presidential involvement in the alleged misdeeds. The authors illustrate this with a case study of the Iran-Contra scandals and an empirical analysis of scandals from the R. Nixon through the G.W. Bush administrations. [R]</p>
<p>62.4635 BAUM, Michael; ESPÍRITO-SANTO, Ana — <bold>Portugal's quota-parity law: an analysis of its adoption.</bold> <italic>West European Politics</italic> 35(2), March 2012: 319–342.</p>
<p>In August 2006, Portugal approved a parity law: all candidate lists presented for local, parliamentary, and European elections must guarantee a minimum representation of 33 per cent for each sex. This article analyzes the proximate causes that led to the adoption of gender quotas by the Portuguese Parliament. The simple answer is that the law's passage was a direct consequence of draft legislation presented by the Socialist Party (PS), which enjoyed a majority. However, the reasons that led the PS to push through a quota law remain unclear. Using open-ended interviews with key women deputies from all the main Portuguese political parties, and national public opinion data, the role of four actors/factors that were involved in the law's adoption are critically examined.

<p>62.4636 BIELA, Jan; HENNL, Annika; KAISER, André — <bold>Combining federalism and decentralization: comparative case studies on regional development policies in Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, and Ireland.</bold> <italic>Comparative Political Studies</italic> 45(4), Apr. 2012: 447–476.</p>
<p>Studies evaluating the effects of territorial state organization on the performance of democratic political systems produce ambiguous results. The authors argue that research so far has suffered from insufficiently conceptualizing federalism and decentralization as two distinct dimensions. This article makes use of the advantages of a nested design and detects micro-level causal mechanisms underlying statistically confirmed effects. The authors conduct in-depth case studies comparing policy processes in four countries (Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, and Denmark) in the area of regional development policy, an area that exhibits typical effects in a macro-quantitative analysis, to back their hypothesized and corroborated macro-level relationships by micro level causal evidence.

<p>62.4637 BINDERKRANTZ, Anne Skorkjaer; HOLM, Mogens; KORSAGER, Kirstine — <bold>Performance contracts and goal attainment in [Danish] government agencies.</bold> <italic>International Public Management Journal</italic> 14(4), 2011: 445–463.</p>
<p>The article maps the set of goals contained in performance contracts for Danish government agencies in 2000, 2005, and 2008. Performance contracts are found to reflect the complex character of agency goals with performance goals ranging from project initiation to reducing case work time or increasing productivity. The article also analyzes factors affecting goal attainment. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.4638 BLACK, Ryan C.; OWENS, Ryan J. — <bold>Consider the source (and the message): [US] Supreme Court justices and strategic audits of lower court decisions.</bold> <italic>Political Research Quarterly</italic> 65(2), June 2012: 385–395.</p>
<p>Given scarce resources, [US] Supreme Court justices hear cases that maximize their auditing capacities. The authors argue that justices rely on the identity of lower court judges and the ideological disposition of lower court decisions to decide which cases to review. The authors find justices are most likely to audit disagreeable lower court decisions rendered by ideologically disagreeable panel judges and are least likely to review agreeable lower court decisions rendered by ideologically agreeable panel judges. Furthermore, when faced with the same ideologically disagreeable lower court decision, justices are less likely to review decisions made by ideological allies than those by ideological foes. [R]</p>
<p>62.4639 BLANC, Florent — <bold>La résistance des hystériques: bibliothécaires et avocats dans le champ de la sécurité nationale américaine (The resistance of “hysterics”: librarians and lawyers in the field of US national security).</bold> <italic>Cultures et Conflits</italic> 84, Winter 2011: 81–102. [Résumé en français]</p>
<p>Based on an analysis of public discourse about the terrorist threat immediately after the 9/11 [2001] attacks, this article shows how lawyers and librarians invested the field of security professionals. Because of their devotion as well as their professional ethics, they mobilized legal arguments to compel the government to engage in a public debate about security policies and their implementation. Two cases are treated: the impact of the [US] Patriot Act on library records and the treatment of Guantánamo detainees. The article explains how, during a security crisis, these professionals used a repertoire of contention which, through public actions and legal motions, restricted the ability of the Administration to rule by exception.

<p>62.4640 BONNEY, Norman — <bold>Some constitutional issues concerning the installation of the [UK] monarch.</bold> <italic>British Politics</italic> 7(2), June 2012: 163–182.</p>
<p>An investigation of the under-researched area of the installation procedures for a new monarch before the coronation demonstrates considerable uncertainty as to the future relevance and applicability of existing laws and precedents. It suggests that, in the absence of prior reform, considerable power is available to a new sovereign to acquiesce in, or challenge, traditional practices that seem out of accord with contemporary attitudes. This illustrates the continuing potential power of a sovereign, who can in such situations potentially pose fundamental challenges to the existing constitutional and political arrangements. [R]</p>
<p>62.4641 BONNEY, Norman; MORRIS, Bob — <bold>Tuvalu and you: the monarch, the United Kingdom and the realms.</bold> <italic>Political Quarterly</italic> 83(2), Apr.–June 2012: 368–373.</p>
<p>The government plans to amend the royal succession rules by making primogeniture gender-blind and ending marriage to a Roman Catholic spouse as a disqualification for succession. Achieving these goals means that the UK is dependent on the agreement of the fifteen Commonwealth countries—the “realms”—that also have the Queen as head of state. The article questions whether these proposals go far enough when leaving intact other religious discriminatory rules hostile to Catholics and all others who cannot be in communion with the Church of England. It is maintained that a political disinclination to address and, as necessary, challenge the real as opposed to the formal position of the Church of England vitiates the government's approach.

<p>62.4642 BORZUTZKY, Silvia — <bold>Reforming the reform: attempting social solidarity and equity in Chile's privatized social security system.</bold> <italic>Journal of Policy Practice</italic> 11(1–2), Jan.–June 2012: 77–91.</p>
<p>This article analyzes the pension reform carried out by Chile's Bachelet administration in 2008. The goal of the reform was to expand the privatized pension system introduced by the Pinochet military government in 1980 by universalizing benefits, augmenting the value of pension, and reducing old-age poverty over time. The most important accomplishment of the reform legislation is to guarantee a Basic Solidarity Pension to all Chileans over 65 years old who have never contributed to or benefited from the privatized system. The article assesses the impact of the Bachelet reform, as well as its limitations. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4695]</p>
<p>62.4643 BRASS, Jennifer N. — <bold>Blurring boundaries: the integration of NGOs into governance in Kenya.</bold> <italic>Governance</italic> 25(2), Apr. 2012: 209–235.</p>
<p>This article examines the impact of the proliferation of NGOs on governance in Kenya. Looking specifically at service-provision, it analyzes how the growth of NGOs has begun to change the way decisions are made and policy is formulated. The governance of service-provision has become a complex, intertwined affair in which NGOs sit on national policy-making committees, government integrates NGO plans and budgets into national policy, and government actors learn from and copy NGOs' participatory, accountable approach. Through (1) the integration of former NGO leaders in government, (2) increasing the variety of voices heard in government decision-making, (3) lobbying by NGOs, and (4) mimicry of NGOs by government, governance of Kenyan service-provision has begun to become more democratic. Through such changes, developing countries are witnessing a blurring of the line between public and private. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.4644 BREDIES, Ingmar — <bold>Die “Domestizierung” der Parlamente im postkommunistischen Osteuropa: Russland und die Ukraine im Vergleich (The “domestication” of parliaments in post-communist Eastern Europe: Russia and Ukraine—a comparative perspective).</bold> <italic>Zeitschrift für Parlamentsfragen</italic> 43(1), 2012: 153–169.</p>
<p>The institutional design of political systems has been discussed by political scientists as one of the most significant determinants in post-communist transitions. Parliamentary systems are generally supposed to exhibit a higher compliance with democratization. Correspondingly, powerful legislatures seem to indicate a successful transition to democracy whereas less powerful ones are associated with failed democratization. These findings are tested with regard to the national legislatures in Russia and Ukraine. Why did neither the Russian State Duma nor the <italic>Verkhovna Rada</italic> of Ukraine decisively contribute to the democratization of these countries? Currently one can find clear evidence for the institutional subversion—or “domestication”—of parliamentary structures and decision-making processes by authoritarian government practices. However, there are substantial differences in both scope and shape of authoritarianism in the respective countries. [R]</p>
<p>62.4646 BROOK, Douglas A. — <bold>Budgeting for [US] national security: a whole of government perspective.</bold> <italic>Journal of Public Budgeting, Accounting and Financial Management</italic> 24(1), Spring 2012: 32–57.</p>
<p>There is a current argument that “national security” and “national defense” are no longer synonymous terms—that there is a new and broader definition for the activities that contribute to “the common defense”. A whole of government approach is suggested as a means for integrating and coordinating national security policies and programs. To support this approach, recommendations have been made for an integrated national security budget. Focusing on the executive budget process, three approaches to an integrated national security budget are examined: organization-based, program-based and function-based. [Despite] questions about the importance of budget structure and the effectiveness of program budgeting, a whole of government integrated unified national security budget could facilitate the fiscal trade-offs required between alternative means of pursuing national security objectives in the executive budget.

<p>62.4647 BROOKS, Deborah Jordan; MUROV, Michael — <bold>Assessing US accountability in a post-<italic>Citizens United</italic> era: the effects of attack ad sponsorship by unknown independent groups.</bold> <italic>American Politics Research</italic> 40(3), May 2012: 383–418.</p>
<p>Greatly increased advertising spending by independent groups represents one of the most dramatic recent changes in US elections. This article [advances] our theoretical and empirical understanding of how the public responds to ads sponsored by candidates as compared to ads sponsored by unknown Super PACs and similar independent groups. We [first] establish why it is necessary to measure both backlash and ad persuasiveness to understand overall ad effectiveness and then we develop a series of hypotheses about the likely influence of ad sponsorship. [Then] we undertake the first analysis to date of how the public responds to attack television ads sponsored by unknown independent groups. Using a large-<italic>N</italic>, geographically representative sample of US adults, we conduct an experiment to assess how sponsorship influences ad effectiveness. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.4648 BUCERIUS, Sandra — <bold>“What do you expect? That we all dance and be happy?” Second-generation immigrants and Germany's 1999 citizenship reform.</bold> <italic>German Politics and Society</italic> 30(1), Spring 2012: 71–85.</p>
<p>Based on a five-year ethnography, this article looks at Germany's citizenship reform of 1999 from the perspective of second-generation immigrant drug-dealers. While the reform had the potential to make a significant difference for this group, with respect to both their legal status in the country and perception of Germany, it did not have such an impact. On the contrary, the reform seems to have had the opposite effect, alienating the young men even more from Germany by keeping citizenship out of reach for them. While some have argued that in the light of supranational citizenship norms and the discourse of citizenship rights as human rights, national citizenship becomes increasingly unimportant as new forms of post-national citizenship gradually emerge, this does not seem to hold true for these young men.

<p>62.4649 CARBONE, Giovanni — <bold>Do new democracies deliver social welfare? Political regimes and health policy in Ghana and Cameroon.</bold> <italic>Democratization</italic> 19(2), Apr. 2012: 157–183.</p>
<p>Democratic reform processes often go hand in hand with expectations of social welfare improvements. However, there is a scant empirical literature on the effects of recent democratization processes on welfare policies in developing countries, particularly in Africa. In a dramatically poor environment, Africans often anticipated that the democratic reforms many sub-Saharan states undertook during the early 1990s would deliver welfare dividends. This article investigates whether and how the advent of democracy affected social policies—focusing, in particular, on health policy—by examining one of the continent's most successful cases of recent democratization (Ghana) and comparing it with developments in a country of enduring authoritarian rule (Cameroon). [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.4650 CARRUBBA, Cliff, <italic>et al.</italic> — <bold>Who controls the content of [US] Supreme Court opinions?</bold> <italic>American Journal of Political Science</italic> 56(2), Apr. 2012: 400–412.</p>
<p>Conventional arguments identify either the median Justice or the opinion-author as the most influential Justices in shaping the content of [US] Supreme Court opinions. We develop a model of judicial decision-making that suggests that opinions are likely to reflect the views of the median Justice in the majority coalition. This result derives from two features of judicial decision-making that have received little attention in previous models: (1) in deciding a case, Justices must resolve a concrete dispute, and they may have preferences over which party wins the specific case confronting them; (2) Justices who are dissatisfied with an opinion are free to write concurrences (and dissents). We demonstrate that both features undermine the bargaining power of the Court's median and shift influence towards the coalition median. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.4651 ÇELIKPALA, Mitat; ÖZTÜRK, Duygu — <bold>The only thing we have to fear: post 9/11 [2001] [US] institutionalization of in-security.</bold> <italic>Uluslararasi Ilişkiler (International Relations)</italic> 32, 2012: 49–65.</p>
<p>During the last decade, billions of dollars have been spent to increase security measures in the US. New institutions, including a department for homeland security, have been established, new security tools have been developed, and surveillance of Americans has been increased. However, despite the creation of “safety zones”, neither the level of the Americans' feeling of security from further terrorist attacks, nor their confidence in the ability of US governments to prevent attacks, has seen an increase. According to Ulrich Beck, who introduced the concepts of “world risk society”, and “reflexive modernity”, terrorism is one of the products of reflexive modernity which cannot be addressed by traditional security measures. Within this framework, this paper analyzes the case of the Americans since the 9/11 attacks. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4381]</p>

<p>This article presents the Indian electricity sector as a case-study of the evasion of responsibility in public policy. India's electricity policy repeatedly fails to meet its own targets and is universally lambasted as inadequate. The state appears aware of many of the reasons for these failures, yet policies have consistently failed to make effective corrections. Part of the explanation for this institutional and policy stasis lies in the pervasive shirking of responsibility by actors throughout the electricity sector. The sector is analyzed to explore the mechanisms through which responsibility is displaced, deflected or dissipated. These mechanisms include “agency”, “presentational” and “policy” strategies, which are both pre-emptively and reactively deployed. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.4653 CHOI, Susanne Y. P.; DAVID, Roman — <bold>Lustration systems and trust: evidence from survey experiments in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland.</bold> <italic>American Journal of Sociology</italic> 117(4), Jan. 2012: 1172–1201.</p>
<p>Dealing with personnel inherited from prior regimes in the administration of transitional states is critical for democratic consolidation, a problem traditionally addressed by the dichotomy of continuation or dismissal. However, major organizational innovations to deal with tainted officials appear in post-communist Central Europe. Using the concept of lustration systems, this study differentiates three archetypes: dismissal, exposure, and confession. The authors propose that each system carries different symbolic meanings, which produce different outcomes for citizens' trust in government and in tainted officials. The hypothesized effects of different lustration systems on trust are tested by an experiment embedded in nationwide representative surveys conducted in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland.

<p>62.4654 CHRISTMANN, Anna; DANACI, Deniz — <bold>Direct democracy and minority rights: direct and indirect effects on religious minorities in Switzerland.</bold> <italic>Politics and Religion</italic> 5(1), Apr. 2012: 133–160.</p>
<p>Most of the research on the effects of direct democracy on minority rights is empirically limited to the direct effects of direct democracy. This article takes the issue a step further and examines both direct and indirect effects by investigating the rights of religious minorities in Switzerland. The analysis provides two main insights: all direct effects are negative and can be observed when the rights of out-groups like Islamic minorities are at stake. Second, indirect effects on the parliamentary process can be observed, too: parliaments make laws more restrictive toward Islamic minorities if they fear a popular vote. However, they develop strategies to enforce their liberal interests, as shown by the fact that extensions of the rights of religious minorities are passed in total revisions. [R]</p>

<p>The modernization of the Italian public administration is analyzed within the broader political and institutional transition in contemporary democracies from the transition of authoritative government to a network pattern. The legislative, organizational and cultural changes that the public system has sought to apply in order to conform to the quality and competitive standards of the global market revolve around the founding principles of public governance: cooperation, communication and integration. The article activation and supervision by the administration of internal and external communication flows constitute, as a tool and a process, the functional and strategic prerequisite for the achievement of the deliberative and participatory democracy practices.

<p>Lawmaking studies and evaluations of competing accounts of policy-change cannot easily assess the nature of policy-change due to the difficulty of locating the status quo and proposals relative to the preferences of critical political actors. Focusing on activity involving the Fair Labor Standards Act, I investigate how the attempted and successful policy-change between the 92nd [US] Congress (1971–1972) and the 106th Congress (1999–2000) compares to the predicted lawmaking activity according to dominant lawmaking models. Characterizing the incidence and magnitude of policy-change over nearly 30 years reveals that policy-change is rarer and smaller than current theories predict. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Government agencies service interest groups, advocate policies, provide advice to elected officials, and create and implement public policy. Scholars have advanced theories to explain the role of agencies in American politics, but efforts to test these theories are hampered by the inability to measure agency preferences systematically. We present a method for measuring agency ideology that yields ideal-point estimates of individual bureaucrats and agencies that are directly comparable with those of other political actors. We discuss what these estimates reveal about the political environment of bureaucracy and their potential for testing theories of political institutions. We demonstrate their utility by testing key propositions from S. Gailmard and J. W. Patty's influential model of political control and endogenous expertise development [“Slackers and zealots: civil service, policy discretion, and bureaucratic expertise”, <italic>ibid.</italic> 51(4), Oct. 2007; <italic>Abstr.</italic> 58.1665].

<p>Judicial behavior is contingent on case-salience. Unfortunately, existing measures of case-salience have met with some skepticism. After discussing the characteristics of an ideal measure of salience, the authors construct a new measure of case-salience. This new measure expands on prior studies by examining coverage in four diverse newspapers and includes coverage anywhere in the paper, instead of concentrating on front-page coverage only. By developing this new measure, the authors uncover patterns about national media coverage of the Court and provide a potentially more useful measure of case-salience. [R]</p>

<p>This article analyzes the impact of electoral rules on legislators' rate of vote defection from their party position in legislatures while accounting for how party-leadership strength mediates this impact. It looks at the effect of the 2008 Romanian electoral reform. The reform shifted the electoral system from a closed-list proportional representation to one in which all candidates run in single-member districts. Because party leaders have maintained their leverage intact, the impact of the reform was minimal, with legislators being more likely to defect in less important votes only, in which party leaders allow defection. Also, after the reform legislators are more likely to use other means to impress their voters, such as legislative initiation and cabinet questioning. These forms of behavior are more accepted by party leaders. [R]</p>

<p>India has been grappling with the problem of devising an efficient border-management strategy that would prevent the entry of dangerous elements while at the same time allowing the legitimate flow of goods, services and people. Given that it has always been vulnerable to cross-border threats and challenges such as illegal migration, drug and human trafficking, gunrunning, smuggling of commodities and cross-border terrorism, India has taken a largely unilateral approach towards border management whereby security of the borders is accorded primacy over the free movement of people and goods. However, as the Indian economy is growing and fast integrating itself with the economies of the region, there is a consequent increase in trade and cross-border flow of people. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper analyzes whether the different powers and resources at the disposal of local and regional governments across Europe deliver greater satisfaction with political institutions and lead to greater life satisfaction. The analysis uses microdata from the four available waves of the European Social Survey (2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008), including more than 160,000 observations of individuals living in 29 European countries. Our results reveal that fiscal and some forms of political decentralization have a positive and significant effect on the overall subjective well-being of individuals. However, fiscal decentralization has a different effect on the perception of institutions depending on whether we consider subnational expenditure or revenues. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Why is there so much discontent about the current plans to reform the NHS in England? This paper traces the genesis of the current proposals in the Health and Social Care Bill, and why the Government has had to water down significant parts of it to appease the critics. The paper argues that the case for change has not been made to public or the 1.3 million staff in the NHS, the extent and timing of the reform is far from ideal given the need to make unprecedented efficiencies in the NHS, and that the political process to gain support has been weak. Yet many elements of the Bill push the NHS in the right direction, and without effective reform the original settlement—to provide equal access to care on the basis of need—is at risk. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In the countries of the former Eastern bloc (and the USSR), abortion politics followed a different historical path [from that of] Western Europe. In Czechoslovakia, abortion was made legal relatively early on, almost as soon as the social and political turmoil that followed World War II and the Communist coup in 1948 had settled. Unlike in Western Europe, however, it was a bureaucratic decision made in relation to specific macro-social and political circumstances. The Czechoslovak Act on Artificial Termination of Pregnancy in 1957 made abortion legal on certain conditions. Special commissions were established and endowed with the authority to decide whether to grant women permission for abortion on demand. The decision to terminate an unwanted pregnancy was thus not placed directly in the hands of women. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>How best to govern reproduction is the subject of heated controversies, and policies on abortion and reproductive technologies present strong variations. Through fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, the article explores the interplay of institutional settings, Christian Democratic politics, women's movement, and Christian opposition in France and Switzerland since the 1970s. If little evidence is found for any institutional impact on policies regarding abortion and reproductive technologies, the analysis confirms the growing influence of the medical profession over reproductive issues and shows that the success of the women's movement has been fluctuating while prolife opposition seems to have gradually lost influence.

<p>For years, studies of state-formation in early and medieval Europe have argued that the modern, representative state emerged as the result of negotiations between autocratic governments in need of tax revenues and citizens who were willing to consent to taxation only in exchange for greater government accountability. This article presents evidence that similar dynamics shaped the formation of Somaliland's democratic government. In particular, it shows that government dependency on local tax revenues—which resulted from its ineligibility for foreign assistance—provided those outside the government with the leverage needed to force the development of inclusive, representative and accountable political institutions.

Shifts in policy-making power are highlighted, away from increasingly marginalized traditional corporatist partners, towards “denocracy” [A.

Blair was accompanied by fast-growing policy networks, lending legitimacy to centralized policy ideas while intensifying connections and blurring lines between state and non-state.

<p>The article contends that the significance attributed to the 1999 citizenship reform in Germany is closely linked to a particular reading of the history of German citizenship policies. This reading, dominant until the 1990s, assigned a crucial role for Germany's exclusionary citizenship policies to the law of descent, which seemed to be deeply ingrained in successive German states policies and practices from the 19th c. on. Arguing that recent historiography on citizenship has called attention to the significant degree of variation between periods of openness and closure, as well as highlighting restrictive naturalization policies as a key ingredient of ethnic closure, the author contends that this focus was misplaced.

<p>In recent decades, the number of national-level ombudsmen has more than quintupled. The institution now exists in about 120 states, many of which are new democracies, hybrid regimes, or states undergoing regime transition. Some ombudsmen are powerful and influential; others are weak and marginalized. This variation can be explained by three factors: (1) the type of regime under which the institution was created; (2) whether the ombudsman challenges the government; and (3) the ombudsman's ability to build coalitions with other actors. Though counterintuitive, more powerful ombudsmen are those created before the transition to democracy. The implication of this argument is that the creation of ombudsmen should precede rather than follow the formal transition to democracy. [R]</p>

<p>South Africa's concern over Islamic radical groups began during the first Gulf War and escalated in the mid-1990s with the People against Gangsterism and Drugs (PAGAD), a small terrorist cell located in their Western Cape province. Both al-Qaeda's 1998 US embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and the 9/11 [2001] terror attacks forced the US to re-examine security on the African continent. America hoped, at a minimum, that most African countries would assist in this new US-led fight against extremists that threatened not only US national security, but international security as well. This article assesses South Africa's involvement with the US in the fight against Islamic extremism. For the most part, South Africa has played a beneficial role in helping to reduce the presence and activity of Islamic terrorists in their region. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article reviews debates surrounding the Military Covenant and explores its salience for contemporary British civil-military relations. Locating the Covenant in debates concerned with the changing nature of the military profession, this article argues that the Covenant was created in 2000 as a response to a challenge to the Army's right to be different and thus its jurisdiction. However, tensions caused by new missions in Iraq and Afghanistan subsequently transformed the Covenant's use and meaning. Senior commanders extended the use of the Covenant to establish the boundaries of their expertise and legitimacy, whilst external actors with a variety of competing interests used the Covenant to contest “authoritative discretion” of the military within a clearly delineated professional space.

Responsibility for the country's debt should be placed squarely on Greece's two main parties ruling the country since 1974 (New Democracy and PASOK) in conjunction with the Euro-Atlantic political elites, the intersection of which is straddled by a comprador-cum-financial oligarchy Greek-style.

<p>We reassess the role of ethnic favoritism in sub-Saharan Africa. Using data from 18 African countries, we study how the primary education and infant mortality of ethnic groups were affected by changes in the ethnicity of the countries' leaders during the last 50 years. Our results indicate that the effects of ethnic favoritism are large and widespread, thus providing support for ethnicity-based explanations of Africa's underdevelopment. We also find that ethnic favoritism is less prevalent in countries with one dominant religion. In addition, our evidence suggests that stronger fiscal capacity may have enabled African leaders to provide more ethnic favors in education but not in infant mortality. Finally, political factors, linguistic differences, and patterns of ethnic segregation are found to be poor predictors of ethnic favoritism. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>What is the source of the widely spread critique of the Karlsruhe Constitutional Court in France? Such a critique has caused frequent misunderstandings between Germany and France in the past and still continues today. The first reason is the representations of German history that have long dominated in France and that attribute to Germans a particular propensity towards bad judicial practices, barely hiding their contempt for law. Law in fact occupies a central position in German history and culture, as a closer look at the late 18th and early 19th c. shows. A comparison with the counter-example of the French Constitutional Court further helps understand the Karlsruhe Court.</p>

The article uses the Advocacy Coalition Framework to explain the different outcomes. In the UK, an advocacy coalition of actors convinced of the effectiveness of a graduated response was formed early on and successfully influenced a government already close to its beliefs. In Germany, the successful campaign of an advocacy coalition of internet activists and internet service-providers against the blocking of websites containing child pornography triggered an external shock.

Elite power has worked politically to frustrate post-crisis reform in the British case through mystification, as constitutional and economic storytelling has narrowed debate and participation in ways that promote regulatory closure and safeguard the status quo. While the White Paper eventually resulted in the timid and limited reforms of the Banking Act of 2010, it opened a new phase of struggle for reform initially led by dissenting elite technocrats.

<p>Latin America's military dictatorships in the 1970s produced some of the worst human rights abuses in the Americas in the 20th c. The Catholic Church was positioned to denounce the repression, yet the episcopacy's reaction varied by country. Why? In critiquing a prominent claim that competition from Protestant sects was the primary source of this variation, the article argues instead that the history of Church-state relations in a given country represents a path-dependent process presenting different incentives to Church episcopacies when they are faced with state violations of human rights. This argument is illustrated with a comparison of Church-state relations in Argentina, Chile, Brazil, and Uruguay and re-assessed using a broader regional sample. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Constitutional pluralism seems to be one of the most inspiring theories of European constitutionalism. It can account for the multilayered institutional framework of the [European] Union. Therefore, it is a natural candidate for explaining how to track the European public interest. Pluralism may serve as the best methodology for keeping into account and for respecting the multiple perspectives on the common good represented by every institutional layer of the Union. After having examined the theories of two of the most influential authors of constitutional pluralism, M. Kumm and M. Maduro, this essay shows how pluralism might improve its highly potential explanatory and normative force, that is, by including in the institutional picture not only courts but also political institutions.

<p>This article examines a particular type of central mandate in China, the mandate for nationwide across-the-board salary increases in the public sector. The making and implementation of this mandate epitomizes the changes and challenges in intergovernmental relations of a transition economy. Our findings show that although the central pay mandates were issued under a number of conditions that favored, or should have even guaranteed, their smooth implementation, local reactions to the mandates have deviated from central expectations. The mandated pay raises have not only failed to win local compliance but also given rise to widespread pay arrears. Based on empirical data from two Chinese counties, this article analyzes the causes of local noncompliance and its implications for intergovernmental management. [R]</p>

<p>The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) government of Prime Minister R.T. Erdogan, promised that, following its tremendous victory in the national elections held on 12 June 2011, it would renew its efforts to draft such a constitution with the broadest possible participation of all other political parties and civil society. Earlier efforts to draft a new constitution following the AKP's 2007 electoral victory were dropped in 2008, as will be discussed below. This article not only illustrates this situation, but also shows how the continuing political and social divisions among the AKP, opposition Kemalists, and military and Kurdish elements probably preclude agreement on a new constitution at this time.

<p>Taking its cue from M.

The growing influence of Korea's Constitutional Court has attracted the charge that it is acting too politically, as well as judicializing politics. One symptom of this was the recent political row over the appointment of the Court's president. The Korean debate thus has much in common with the global discussions on judicialization and politicization triggered by the recent trend toward “court-centered” constitutionalism—a phenomenon with which our vocabulary and framework for discussing constitutionalism have yet to catch up.

<p>Early evidence suggests that Brazil's <italic>Bolsa Família</italic> (Family Stipend) program, which currently benefits over 12 million poor families, has alleviated absolute poverty. Although hailed by many as an unqualified success, its political dimensions have been largely ignored or underplayed. These include, for example, the unashamed use of <italic>Bolsa Família</italic> for electoral purposes, the spread of clientelism and patronage, and the growing dependence of Brazil's poor on income transfers rather than productive employment. Furthermore, there are indications that the popularity of <italic>Bolsa Família</italic> is encouraging short-termism in social policy. Many Brazilian policy-makers now seem to view the program as mainstream social policy rather than as a temporary measure—a perspective that could undermine longer-term investments in key areas such as health and basic education.

<p>The decision of Bangladesh's Supreme Court to ban religion based politics reflects the ideology of the country's founding fathers. It ensures secularism as the cornerstone of the Constitution. Thus, carrying out activities of any political party based on religion is a punishable offence. The Election Commission of Bangladesh demanded the religion-based parties in the country to amend their charters, as they were in conflict with the supreme law of the land. Unlike Pakistan, Bangladesh's constitution is based on secularism, nationalism, socialism and democracy. Hard secularism rejecting all kinds of religious activities encourages reaction, to eradicate the menace of religious extremism, soft secular approach of protecting and enforcing the equal rights of all religious beliefs and traditions can help instead of preferring one religion over others.

<p>We provide estimates of the risk-sharing and redistributive properties of the German federal fiscal system based on data from 1970 to 2006, with special attention to the effects of German unification. Tax revenue-sharing between the states and the federal government and the fiscal equalization mechanism (<italic>Länderfinanzausgleich</italic>) together reduce differences in per-capita state incomes by almost 40 percent. The federal fiscal system offsets 47 percent of an asymmetric shock to state per-capita incomes. This effect has significantly decreased after the inclusion of the East German states in 1995. Furthermore, we find that the German fiscal system provides almost perfect insurance for state government budgets against asymmetric revenue shocks; also, its redistributive effect with regard to the tax resources available to state governments is very strong.

This article first, at the conceptual level, identifies the singular characteristics of capital expenditures and capital financing sources that would allow quantifying capital expenditure needs and financing capacity across sub national jurisdictions; and second, it uses those measures to a capital-equalization transfer formula applied at the Spanish regional level.

<p>62.4704 HOWARD, Marc Morjé — <bold>Germany's citizenship policy in comparative perspective.</bold> <italic>German Politics and Society</italic> 30(1), Spring 2012: 39–51.</p>
<p>This article puts the 1999 German Nationality Act into a comparative European perspective. By applying a common measure of the relative restrictiveness or inclusiveness of a country's citizenship policy to the countries of the EU-15 at two different time periods, it provides an analysis of change both within and across countries. From this perspective, Germany has clearly moved “up” from having the single most restrictive law before the 1999 reform to a more moderate policy today. Yet Germany's major “liberalizing change” was also tempered by a significant “restrictive backlash”. The German case therefore provides support for a broader theoretical argument about the potential for mobilized anti-immigrant public opinion to nullify the liberalization that often occurs within the realm of elite politics.

<p>The actual work of policy analysts in government is little investigated and little known, especially at the sub-national level, where substantial powers rest. In order to address this gap, this article presents evidence from the first, large-scale set of surveys of Canadian federal, provincial and territorial policy analysts, examining the similarities and differences in their policy work. While many similarities exist in areas related to overall governance trends, such as consultation and participation work overtaking more technical policy evaluations, there are significant differences in the nature of policy work and attitudes, which are linked to the lesser autonomy from political masters experienced by sub-national analysts. The results suggest that sub-national policy work must be studied carefully in its own right. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The dramatic rise in life expectancy and longer retirement has created serious concerns about the long-term affordability of public sector pensions. Drawing on insights from a recent inquiry into public sector pension reform, commissioned by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition and led by the author, this article outlines the challenge faced by policy makers and sets out how it should be addressed. It argues that, with 12 million people active in this part of the pensions system, and estimates that the gap between contributions and payments will grow from £3bn to £10bn in the next decade, the government has no choice but to enter the ‘lions’ den' of pensions' policy. It contends that any long-term solution is to be crafted cannot be based solely on economics, but must also answer fundamental questions of ethics and equity.

<p>The advocacy coalition framework (ACF) pays special attention to “so-called” policy-brokers when explaining policy-change. However, this prominent policy approach neither clearly defines who the policy-brokers are nor identifies under which institutional rules they have an influence on policy processes and outputs. This article thus formulates two theoretical hypotheses that complement the ACF and then undertakes the first empirical testing of these hypotheses within the Swiss climate policy (1990–2008). The empirical results show that, in the case under investigation, the strategic interest-based behavior of two policy-brokers (i.e., one public administration and one political party), as well as two institutionalized veto-points (i.e., optional referendum and parliamentary committee), are crucial factors explaining policy-brokers' influence on policy process and change.

Albanian politicians tend to exploit personnel stability in order to direct administrative activity, control bureaucratic performance and achieve electoral success. Economic and organizational reasons for instability seem to be less important.

<p>There is an increased focus in comparative politics and IR on how choices of governments are dependent on choices made by other governments. The authors argue that although the relationship between policy choices across countries is often labeled as either diffusion or competition, in many cases the theoretical mechanisms underpinning these labels are unclear. We build a model of social learning with a specific application to the diffusion of corporate tax-reductions. The model yields predictions that are differentiable from existing models of tax competition. Specifically, we argue that social learning is most likely in the wake of tax policy cuts by left governments. We test the model using an existing data-set of corporate tax-rate changes and an author-created data-set of changes in tax legislation, covering 20 OECD countries. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The fight against corruption came on the international agenda in the 1990s. The core of the recommendations from international organizations and scholars is to establish anti-corruption agencies [to] increase the risk of detection and punishment to individuals who engage in corrupt affairs. However, despite condemnation by all cultures, individuals and societies can be socialized into a culture of corruption where the benefits of partaking in corruption will exceed those of being honest. It is thus not sufficient to change individual incentives without also seeking to change behavioral norms. Through a comparison of Estonia, Poland and Bulgaria, it is shown that there is no “miracle cure”. Anti-corruption agencies are important but effectiveness presumes economic reform, a well-functioning system of justice and a credible public condemnation of corruption. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>One of the first Bills introduced to the UK Parliament by the coalition government formed in May 2010, enacted in February 2011, very substantially changed the procedures for redistributing constituencies for election to the House of Commons, as well as reducing the number of MPs. For the preceding six decades, organic criteria dominated over arithmetic considerations in the redistribution process: MPs were to be elected to represent distinct communities, and electoral equality was secondary to that goal. The 2011 Act reversed that situation: the redistribution that commenced in March 2011 has electoral equality as its predominant criterion—all constituencies must have an electorate within 5 percentage points of the national quota (76,641 registered electors). This article reviews that change and the issues—such as continuity of representation—which arise from it. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Intergovernmental relations serve several purposes: to resolve conflicts of competence; to deal with overlaps and externalities; to harmonies policies; and to respond to new policy challenges. The UK is not a federation but an asymmetrically devolved system where the central government doubles up as the government of the largest part. This makes the application of federal intergovernmental theory problematic. At the same time, federations are tending to move from co-operative to competitive federalism. There is no case for greater policy harmonization. On the contrary, the increased divergence between the dominant English legislative majority and majorities in the devolved territories points to increased autonomy and less harmonization. There is scope for policy learning within competitive devolution, particularly on new policy challenges. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.5013]</p>

<p>In recent decades, the US national government has been less active in fighting economic inequality, but increasing devolution means that states wanting to address this problem have had a greater incentive and perhaps means by which to do so. Applying power-resources theory, we argue that in states where left parties are stronger and more liberal politics are enacted, the government will reduce inequality and that this state effect becomes more pronounced as middle-and lower-class power wanes nationally. We find that both federal and state governments influence inequality, and since the Republican takeover of Congress in 1995, the states have played a more important role in shaping the income distribution.

<p>In his landmark work <italic>The Politics Presidents Make</italic> [<italic>Leadership from John Adam to Bill Clinton</italic>, Cambridge, Mass., 1997], S. Skowronek concludes that an earlier cycle of presidential politics in America is fading.

Applying hypotheses recently advanced by C. Nichols and A. Myers, this article considers some additional challenges to presidential authority that complement Skowronek's original thesis. Through a comparison of the presidencies of B. Obama and R. Reagan, the article also illustrates the relevance of the waning-of-political-time thesis to politics today.

This dangerous situation is the result of several factors: the magistracy consists of a powerful, privileged super-elite, which displays a strong “corporatist” ethos; magistrates act under a blanket of legal authority, which they readily exploit; historical events have both contributed to these developments and continue to make needed reforms of the magistracy difficult to achieve.</p>

<p>The <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> recently featured an article entitled “Welcome to Debtors' Prison, 2011 Edition”. The <italic>Journal</italic> was documenting a recent spike in the use of arrest warrants by debt collectors to prosecute borrowers who cannot or will not repay small amounts of money. Indeed, over the past several years, and particularly following the most recent economic crisis from which the US and the global economy have still not fully recovered, debt-buying firms have increasingly relied upon the state's legal system as a means of compelling individuals behind on their credit-card payments, auto loans, and other bills to meet their obligations. In the past year alone, judges have signed off on more than 5,000 arrest warrants, incarcerating Americans for debts as small as $250. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article examines Germany as a crucial case study where demographic and economic differentiation across the federal territory is especially pronounced.

<p>An overwhelming consensus exists regarding the relationship between treaties and the [US] Constitution: that the substantive limitations which apply to any action by the federal government, such as those enumerated in the Bill of Rights or those imposed on Congress in Article I, Section 9, apply to the treaty power; and that the Constitution is, consequently, absolutely supreme to treaties. Although this consensus view has elicited little debate in the last half-century, we believe it is flawed, both conceptually as well as based on the historical record. We defend this assertion and also propose a different model for understanding the Constitution-treaty relationship, one we believe is more accurate: that of “mutual adjustment” between treaties and the Constitution.

<p>The EU enjoys significant leverage over “members-in-waiting”. Candidate states tend to accept the EU's political conditionality as a prerequisite for accession. In other words, states tend to be acculturated to the EU before becoming EU members. However, the process of Europeanization does not produce exactly the same results in all candidate countries. This comparative study of the progress made on human rights protections in Romania and Bulgaria before their accession to the EU suggests that the differing scope and extent of Europeanization in candidate countries is reflective of the interplay of the comparative strength of domestic politics in the candidate states and leverage that can be exerted with the promise of EU membership.

<p>State reform has been one of the issues most present in the political and public agendas since 2009. The Romania's President is a leading figure in this field. An in-depth analysis of his speeches might give a good idea of what and how the Romanian state is imagined by the political elite. A new design of checks and balances, a limited state and fair treatment of citizens, through education, public health and social security are promoted. The public policies needed to put these ideas into practice however, lack efficiency and long term vision, both essential in the case of state reform.

<p>There is a broad literature that suggests that neoliberalism is the predominant force structuring climate change policy. However, analyses that focus only on the creation of carbon markets as neoliberalism's effect on climate policy are too restricted. Focusing on the US, as the paradigmatic neoliberal state, it is demonstrated that, because neoliberal states must nevertheless intervene to promote accumulation, and because system-wide regulation of greenhouse gases has been impossible to achieve, the US has developed a range of alternative means by which to pursue emissions-reductions. These means derive from the “strategic selectivities” (or historical path-dependencies) inherent in federal policy development in the US. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.5238]</p>

<p>We investigate bill-passage by party factions in Uruguay and show that those joining cabinet coalitions earn policy influence. The policy advantage of coalition is therefore not collected by the president alone, as often implied: partners acquire clout in law-making and use it to pass bills of their own and to strike deals with outside factions. Analysis of all bills initiated between 1985 and 2005 reveals that the odds of passing a bill sponsored alone by a majority cabinet faction was about 0.5, up from about 0.15 otherwise. Contingent upon the cabinet status of factions involved, the odds of co-sponsored bills conform well to patterns expected by a view that policy rewards are a fundamental part of the politics of coalition in presidentialism.

<p>While all members of a polity are supposed to be protected by the right to religious liberty, religious minorities are its greatest beneficiaries and their ability to practice their traditions without fear of discrimination is a critical marker of a tolerant and civilized polity. This right marks an important distinction between liberal secularism and the kind practiced in authoritarian states: while the latter abide by the separation of religion and state, they also regularly abrogate religious freedoms of their minority and majority populations. Despite claims to religious neutrality, liberal secular states frequently regulate religious affairs but they do so in accord with a strong concern for protecting the individual's right to practice his or her religion freely, without coercion or state intervention.

<p>Scholars often identify gerrymanders by examining changes to districts' partisan composition. However, advantages can also be gained by systematically varying the extent to which incumbents' constituencies remain the same. I examine the post-2000 redistricting in 22 [US] state legislatures. I find that parties, particularly in legislatures with low turnover levels, gain advantages from constituency manipulation, but that these advantages are counteracted by geographic redistricting regulations. Last, I find that ostensibly bipartisan outcomes nonetheless feature partisan constituency manipulation. These findings echo a growing literature that analyzes the geographic aspects of gerrymandering and highlight how turnover patterns motivate redistricting strategies. [R]</p>

<p>How do property rights become secure? How does rule of law take hold in an economy? The author uses an original survey of 516 firms in Russia and Ukraine, as well as interview-based case-studies, to re-examine these fundamental issues of political economy. Most states in the developing world lack the requisite time horizons and institutional capacity to make the credible commitments emphasized in the literature. In this context, firms can enforce their property rights without resort to mafias by forming alliances with stakeholders such as foreign actors, community residents, and labor. These stakeholders can impose costs on the potential aggressors through diverse political strategies, allowing firms to defend their property rights not only from private predators but also from the state. The article evaluates this “bottom-up” theory of secure property rights against existing state-based theorizing. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper examines the evolution of debates about territorial reforms in Romania in the first two decades after the fall of communism. It suggests that the debates were shaped mainly by the choices made by political elites in positioning their parties in relation to “post-communism” and the “Hungarian problem”. Critically, territorial reform rapidly ceased to be a tradable political asset in coalition-building for the Democratic Union of Hungarians. In recent years the debate about territorial reform has been influenced more heavily by exogenous factors, notably the desire to gain accession to the EU.

<p>Party political incongruence in the UK after 2007 has had a moderate effect on both the machinery of intergovernmental relations and the dominant modes of intergovernmental interaction. In assessing changes in intergovernmental structures, we find more frequent meetings and more formalized interactions. A preference for informal bilateral exchange, however, still prevails. In assessing changes in the nature of intergovernmental relations, we find some intensification of conflict, but amid continued co-operation. The limited effect observed can be traced to: (1) formal-legal features of the UK multi-level polity; (2) the nature of the policy sectors requiring intergovernmental co-ordination (3); the specific political dynamics within the constituent governments; and (4) the mitigating role and structure of non-elected institutions such as the civil service and the judiciary.

<p>Explanations of different patterns of preferences for redistribution either highlight the role of the institutional framework in a country or highlight the importance of self-interest and rational expectations. The study introduces a unified approach to explain differences in preferences for redistributive measures for the case of intergenerational monetary transfers for families and children. Both explanatory approaches are integrated into the action-based Model of Frame Selection that incorporates normative motives and economic self-interest into the process of decision making. Using a large sample that deals with questions on the approval of public policies for families and accounts for the normative importance of children and family life in Germany, evidence is provided that both approaches are valid in explaining preferences for government transfers.

The analysis reveals that the jump in party size coincides with (1) a decrease in party voting among individual continuing members, (2) a strengthening association between some constituency factors and party voting, and (3) patterns of decline in individual party voting that are explained in part by constituency measures.

<p>As the world's first country to adopt a “parity” quota, France could be considered an example of the growing phenomenon of quotas as a “fast-track” solution to the problem of women's under-representation. French universalism had impeded a more “incremental track” to gender equality while placing a constitutional ban on quotas. The design of “parity” as a means of overcoming these hurdles was both normative and pragmatic. Parity could be considered an example of a symbolic policy, where grand claims were made early on but the corresponding legislation became effective only over time. While the practical constraints on parity have delayed its impact, the recognition of the need to “legislate equality” has had a more profound impact, leading to the creep of parity into other areas such as ethnic minority representation and parity in the workplace.

<p>This article examines the effectiveness of Ghana's democratic decentralization policy since its inception in the 1980s.

<p>In November 2009, the Slovenian government implemented a new participatory tool called “Predlagam vladi” (“I propose to the government”) in order to include citizens in the governmental policy process, which aimed to increase active citizen participation and connect citizens and civil society with the government. Although the web portal received almost no publicity in the mass media, citizens largely grasped the new opportunity for broader access to the policy process. This study focuses mainly on the deliberative character of the governmental portal on three specific levels: structure and architecture, openness to citizens, and concrete proposals and comments. By critically evaluating deliberative communication and the role of new media in such practical projects, the authors explain how these new opportunities are limited. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Elected officials have difficulty controlling politically insulated institutions, leaving the appointment process as perhaps their most effective means of influence. Yet, history shows that actors on these institutions-especially the Supreme Court-often behave unpredictably. Our goal is to determine whether variation in two components of cognitive style, prior to a justice's nomination to the Court, predicts ideological drift once on the Court. Using linguistic software created by cognitive psychologists, we examined over 1000 speeches, articles, and separate opinions written by Supreme Court justices before they were nominated to the Court. Our results show that justices whose pre-nomination words revealed cognitive inconsistency drift more than those with stable world views. [R]</p>

<p>In 1995, two years after the adoption of gender quota laws, the Italian Constitutional Court declared these laws to be unconstitutional. The Constitution was subsequently reformed in order to make way for new quota legislation. Such reforms came in late and in a contradictory way. The Constitution was first modified in 2001 to allow regions to adopt quota measures to enhance women's political representation at the regional level and then in 2003 to allow similar measures to enhance women's political representation at the national and European levels. Thus far, quotas have been introduced only in some regions and for European elections. Consequently, the 2001 and 2003 constitutional reforms have had a limited impact on legislative implementation measures and thus on the percentage of women in elected assemblies.

This dynamic lies on the combination of five social processes: a consensus for the promotion of a strong and watchful America (ontological process), a transformation of strategic practices towards the reduction of vulnerabilities (strategic process), the creation of a bureaucratic setting outside the military and police (bureaucratic process), the advent of new actors in the security field who specialize in risk-management (sociological process), and the continuous vision of technological innovation as source of the threat and only solution to it (technological process).

<p>Given its change-resistant nature, how does federalism evolve to reflect the changing social and political context? This article compares the trajectories of Canadian and American federalism in response to the self-determination claims of indigenous peoples. Building on the literature on institutional change, I first suggest that both federations have followed similar patterns of institutional adaptation to indigenous claims through the development of multilevel governance (MLG) regimes that are layered over the existing federal structure without altering its foundations.

<p>This article reflects on the politics of EU citizenship—and the ethical possibilities and limitations of a cosmopolitan or “normative power” EU—via an analysis of the situation of the Roma in France, which was widely mediatized in summer 2010. [When] the French government “securitized” the Roma, “extra-ordinarily” casting them as a collective threat and thereby justifying their deportation, the European Commission demanded that the French authorities refrain from discriminating against EU citizens on grounds of ethnicity, acting as protector of minorities in accordance with its <italic>raison d'être</italic> as liberal peace project. The article [then argues] that conditionality within the law pertaining to EU citizenship allowed for the securitization of the Roma. Thus, the invocation of citizenship may be a useful but limited strategy of political resistance by and with excluded groups such as Europe's Roma. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The civil service, as an “apolitical” actor, may supply a significant facilitating role in intergovernmental relations. This is especially the case in the UK, where even the most senior civil servants are not politically appointed and remain in office when their political masters change party colors. Furthermore, civil servants who work for the Scottish or Welsh governments are part of a unified (British) Home Civil Service. As such they have been socialized in and respect similar operating procedures, which also encompass Northern Ireland despite its independent civil service. These factors have contributed to oil (lubricate) and glue (hold together) intergovernmental relations. Experience since 1999 is of a civil service accommodating well to various kinds of party incongruity and of working successfully with nationalists in government.

<p>Drawing upon the framework of “fragmented authoritarianism”, this article formalizes existing bureaucratic behaviors in the Chinese political apparatus through the inclusion of the logic of “collusive behavior” among the various bureaucratic levels. Policy-crafting, a more comprehensive notion to describe Chinese energy policy-making, addresses center-local internal dynamics from a new angle to better grasp the domestic conditions under which energy policy is “crafted” and implemented throughout China's bureaucratic apparatus. This article defines policy-crafting and notes the explicative limits of the existing approaches to China's “informal” bureaucratic politics. It then develops a theoretical reappraisal of the fragmented authoritarian model in order to push it forward and supplement it with “collusive behavior” to form a new analytical tool. It describes the policy elaboration process, which encompasses the translation, drafting, and formulation of China's energy policy. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The diffusion of digital media does not always have democratic consequences. This mixed-methods study examines how the government of Azerbaijan dissuaded internet users from political activism. We examine how digital media were used for networked authoritarianism, a form of internet control common in former Soviet states where manipulation over digitally mediated social networks is used more than outright censorship. Through a content-analysis of three years of Azerbaijani media, a two-year structural equation model of the relationship between internet use and attitudes toward protest, and interviews with Azerbaijani online activists, we find that the government has successfully dissuaded frequent internet users from supporting protest and average internet users from using social media for political purposes.

<p>This paper explores how the notion of distance works in the practice of interpretation by studying the philosophical underpinnings of the originalism debate in American constitutionalism. Focusing on some of its most important spokespeople, the paper shows that they start from the historicist presupposition that distance can in principle be overcome by a reconstruction of the original intentions of the framers of the Constitution. With the help of H.–G. Gadamer, who explicitly based his philosophical hermeneutics on the notion of distance, this presupposition is criticized. The paper concludes that the originalist and hermeneuticist positions do not mutually exclude each other, but can be synthesized if they are seen as different questions about the same text. The meaning of the Constitution is therefore dependent on the direction of the questions asked by the interpreter.

<p>The goal of abolishing child poverty within a generation in Britain was set out by the New Labour government in 1999. It was pursued by means of promoting paid work, increasing selective benefits to make work pay and promoting prevention of some of the causes of poverty. Some progress was made but it fell far short of the target. The Coalition government formed in 2010 has maintained the broad goal and maintained parts of the previous strategy but it has modified policy in important respects.

<p>Previous work on the [US] Federal Convention of 1787 hypothesized multiple dimensions of conflict.

Finally, we examine how the agenda unfolds by mapping changes to the status quo throughout the convention. We conclude that, despite the lack of parties, the nature of the conflict is quite organized with a low number of dimensions. [R]</p>

The article uses an original dataset on parliamentary representation in Bulgaria to analyze candidate-selection practices of electorally successful political parties.

The authors report the failures of demographically large ethnic groups to secure close-to-proportional representation under Bulgaria's choice of PR electoral system.

<p>This article explores the way that politicians and legislators have responded to concerns over the link between videogames and violence in the UK, particularly in terms of ensuring that inappropriate content remains inaccessible to minors. It explores the recent changes to the regulatory framework centered on videogames, arguing that the move to a universal statutory framework has implications that are more symbolic than real-policy is still underpinned by the “precautionary principle” and the framework remains equally likely to be undermined by the actions of parents who ignore ratings and purchase age-inappropriate games for their children. Perhaps predictably, the political establishment has been unwilling to engage with this parental neglect. Such responses are essentially a smokescreen used by governments which are understandably unwilling to take prosecutions into the home and retail space. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>As many other European countries, Belgium implements policies related to birth, to death, and to the in-between events that challenge individual pace. Biomedical knowledge is one of the resources to define such policies. As pointed by Foucault, biopolicy emerges when the state aims at controlling the risks that threatens public health. In Belgium, public regulation among three sectors, i.e. the agro-food GMOs, the mobile phones and biomedecine (assisted reproductive technologies, stem cells and cloning) is so different that it is useful to talk about biopolicies rather than about one sole biopolocy. The paper focuses on explaining this variation. Three explanatory factors can help in highlighting this intriguing risk management: agenda setting and thus social construction of the biopolitical objects to be regulated, mobilization of social actors regarding these objects, and the types of expertise supporting the public decisions.

We maintain that the law's principled rejection of dual citizenship and related stipulation that children born into German nationality via the law's revolutionary <italic>jus soli</italic> provision choose between their German citizenship or that of their non-German parents between the ages of eighteen and twenty-three is unfair, potentially unconstitutional, and likely unworkable in administrative terms. We also argue that the decline in naturalization rates in Germany since 2000 is due to a combination of legal, administrative, and symbolic barriers in the law, as well as a lack of incentives for naturalization for immigrants from EU member states and other rich industrialized countries.

The use of ethnographic methods to examine the recent and rapid process of state-formation in Georgia is a departure from much of the extant literature on state-formation: the approach taken here uses the Deleuzian concept of assemblage to examine how the state is a process of continuous formation.

The second “rollout” phase was oriented towards compensating for the many failures of the market, the state and governance persistently generated within a neoliberal political framework. The ECE is now embarked on a third wave of neo-liberalization best understood as the restoring of stable patterns of accumulation to promote competitiveness within a multiplicity of regional, national and sub-national spaces. International institutions (the EBRD, the IMF, the World Bank, the OECD and the EU) are seeking to build a culture of neoliberal competitiveness, regionally and globally.

Congress successfully eliminated the CAB, ICC, and OTA; the NEA, however, survived. The article argues that a vibrant policy network surrounding an agency Congress has targeted for elimination provides resiliency to resist congressional termination efforts by weaving together the relevant institutions and organizations into a resilient policy network and generating critical political support during dire times. A model of policy network resiliency is presented and applied to congressional efforts to terminate the CAB, ICC, OTA, and NEA. [R]</p>

<p>In order to meet its water and energy requirements in the northern plains, China is successively making interventions in the Tibetan rivers in the southern part through dams and diversions. While China is well within its riparian rights to do so, a set of externalities involving the principles of water-sharing and lower riparian needs—stretching from Afghanistan to Vietnam—raise concerns. Politically controlling Tibet and thereby having control over the mighty rivers that originate there allows Beijing to overcome its uneven water distribution but also importantly gives its leaders strategic width and diplomatic clout for dealing with its neighbors. Based on the theoretical framework of power and hydro-hegemony, this article examines how China's hydro-behavior on the Brahmaputra (Yarlung Ysangpo) could impact power relations with India and what India's counter-hydro-hegemony strategy should be.

<p>As anti-choice adherents have transitioned from a scattered movement in the early 20th c. to an organized political interest group in recent decades, American abortion politics has moved to medical rather than political ground. Accordingly, advocates of safe, legal abortion have become mired in interpretative debates over abortion's medical necessity rather than its political value. To be sure, this turn was not the product of a strategic plan hatched by pro-choice feminists, but was foisted upon them by judicial and legislative developments that created political contexts to which they were forced to react. Nonetheless, these medical necessity debates have obscured—and sometimes eclipsed—more forceful political arguments, replacing self-authorizing political claims—such as political and human rights, choice, reproductive freedom, and bodily autonomy—with arguments for abortion's medical necessity.

Besides analyzing specific gender policy developments that can be attributed to the EU, particular focus is put on the women's movement activists' perceptions of the impact that accession may have on women and gender equality. The study demonstrates that while the Croatian and Macedonian EU accession processes have been beneficial to the introduction of new gender legislation and institutional mechanisms for the advancement of gender equality, the EU gender strategy has also shown serious limitations. Among these—and perhaps the most fundamental—is the strong contrast between stated goals and their actual implementation. [R, abr.]</p>

While macro-institutions are important when examining good governance and legislative effectiveness, meso-level institutions (such as oversight tools) are more important than previously acknowledged. We also detect a positive relationship between an increase in legislative oversight facilities and the reputation of parliament and its members, the legitimacy of democracy and political institutions, and the success in curbing corruption. And finally, we confirm that the successful functioning of institutions depends on the presence or absence of specific contextual factors. In the case of Ghana, these factors are a relatively low level of partisanship at the committee level, parliament's ability to find alternative sources of information, and the demand for good governance.

<p>This article describes the challenges facing a federal government-funded initiative to promote online deliberation to improve the public comment process by federal and state government agencies in the US. The three-year project met several difficulties. Some have been technical, but our primary obstacle has been in securing partnerships with government agencies. Due to institutional, legal, and organizational challenges, many government agencies are resistant to opening up the public comment process to a deliberative structure, although some change occurred following the B. Obama administration's Open Government Initiative. This article describes the objectives of the original research project and details the challenges faced with the hope of guiding future deliberation research projects that aim to work with federal agencies in the US.

<p>During the spring of 2011, there were a number of significant developments in North Africa and the Middle East [MENA]. Egypt, Libya, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen all experienced levels of civil unrest not seen in more than a generation. Clearly there are cries for democracy and freedom, but what will this mean to groups that have historically been discriminated against or disenfranchised regardless of the type of regime in power? For example, will women fare any better as a result of a new government in Tunisia? Will gays in Cairo find a more tolerant government? Can ethnic or religious minorities in Tripoli endure or flourish? The answers to these questions get to the heart of meaningful transformations in governance structures in MENA states.

<p>The scope of the present global financial crisis is comparable to that of the 1930s. Public policies responding to each have been very different, however. The large macroeconomic response of the past three years has averted a new Great Depression, but regulation of the financial sector has been much softer than in the 1930s. This is partly due to financial globalization that extends beyond the capacities of national regulators. Macroeconomic anti-depression measures have created new realities: the rise of indebted states. The sovereign crisis imposes market discipline on states while, conversely, states are too weak to impose regulatory discipline on markets. New modes of supranational regulation and a new ethics of the public interest are necessary for a new era of balanced prosperity. [R]</p>

<p>In <italic>Kitzmiller v.

Although the plaintiffs won, this strategy is unwise because it is based on problematic definitions of religion and science, leads to multiple truths in society, and is unlikely to succeed before the present right-leaning Supreme Court. I suggest discarding past approaches in favor of arguing solely from the evidence for evolution. [R]</p>

<p>The courts have hitherto played a remarkably limited role in the working of devolution in the UK, an exception to practice in most federal or decentralized systems. This article examines whether political congruence contributed to this minimal role for the courts in IGR [intergovernmental relations]. It argues that additional factors are also at play: the limited role accorded to lawyers and legal issues in the UK's system of government, the flexibility of the devolution settlements, and the political nature of the UK's constitution, which make it both possible and desirable to resolve intergovernmental disputes by different means. While the courts are likely to become more prominent as a result of third-party litigation, particularly as devolved legislatures become more active, the limited role of the courts in most intergovernmental matters appears unlikely to change.

<p>America has always been a wonderfully diverse place, a country where billions of stories spanning centuries and continents converge under the rubric of a Constitution that unites them in an ongoing narrative of national self-creation. Rather than rehearse familiar debates over what our Constitution means, this essay explores what the Constitution does. It treats the Constitution as a verb—a creative and contested practice that yields a trans-generational conversation about the meaning of our past, the imperatives of our present, and the values and aspirations that should point us toward our future. And it meditates on how this practice, drawing deeply on the capacious wellsprings of text and history, simultaneously reinforces the political order and provides a language for challenging its legitimacy, thereby constituting us as “We, the People”, joined in a single project framed centuries ago that nevertheless remains inevitably our own.

<p>Which factors account for successful policy reform and what role does discourse play in the process? This article examines this empirical puzzle with reference to the issue of Greek reform failure. A matched comparison with Italy in the area of pensions reveals the salience of path-shaping and the use of political discourse in narrowing down reform options and facilitating change. The Greek case of limited public information, incoherent preparation of the problem, and inner-circle decision-making, is contrasted with the Italian government's information-sharing and consensus-building campaign for the establishment of a pro-reformist discourse. Findings confirm the salience of institutional conditions but suggest that pure institutionalist accounts premised on rational choice thinking and the power of veto-players should be complemented with more agency-driven accounts of public policy.

<p>Turkey is focusing on environment and energy policies in its relations with its neighbors.

This paper demonstrates the dichotomy between energy and environment policies in the Black Sea region and Turkey, with references to international and regional needs. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article investigates what might cause punctuations in the agenda of a country's executive branch by examining the annual prime minister's speeches to the Belgian Parliament (1993–2008). After having established that the Belgian executive agenda is punctuated, meaning it has long periods of stability that are offset by major shifts in attention, the article closely examines to what extent focusing events, leadership changes, and elections can explain these shifts. Focusing events that were specifically mentioned in the speech can explain seven of the 18 punctuations. They cannot shed light on what occurred in the other 11 cases. Changes in leadership also do not systematically cause punctuations. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The Moldovan Ministry of Justice has proposed a new law to prevent discrimination and fight it. The purpose is to create an instrument that allows the prevention of all kinds of discrimination. However, because of confusion at the Ministry of Justice about the goal of the proposed legislation, the bill has became very controversial and it raises serious concerns about freedom of faith and conscience. Active pro-EU lobbyists and diplomats have stated that this was the only way to obtain lifting of the EU visa barriers. Unjustified pressure from some EU diplomats combined with a confused Ministry of Justice seem to have formed the basis for a controversial bill that brings fundamental freedoms in serious danger.

<p>The illusion of the free market that is based upon neoliberal ideology has had detrimental effects on the Danish Social Welfare State. Neoliberalism was successful in replacing the social ideology with the help of the promulgation of xenophobic fear. This fear helped obtain public acquiescence for Denmark to join the “Coalition of the Willing” which invaded Afghanistan and Iraq. Conversely, there is substantial evidence that the real reasons for the invasions, which were primarily to benefit the corporate sector, have been purposely clouded. Danish corporations did, in fact, receive a significant share of the spoils. As a result, xenophobia, particularly directed at Muslims, is being perpetuated in order to divert attention away from these reasons leading the Danish Social Welfare State in a downward spiral.

<p>The article investigates whether democratization has improved Congressional oversight of bureaucrats. It analyzes the investigation commissions created by the Chamber of Deputies between 1997 and 2006. Since the PRI lost its absolute majority in the lower chamber the political conditions and climate have allowed legislators to exercise greater control over public policies. However, effectiveness of Congress in really holding the government to account is still limited. Investigation commissions have been multiplied since 1997, but their effectiveness at highlighting bureaucratic misdemeanors has remained poor. A “most likely case” is studied to illustrate the factors that hinder the accomplishment of effective supervision. [R]</p>

<p>This article accounts for the particular steps Spain took to institutionalize gender equality in political representation. While some West European countries, where the “incremental track” was considered too slow or too ineffective, recently shifted to the “fast track” (notably, Belgium, France, Italy and Portugal), Spain adopted a legislative quota in 2007, when women's representation had already reached very high levels. Indeed, 10 years earlier, the quotas adopted by left-wing Spanish parties in the late 1980s had already reached parity and triggered a contagion effect within the party system. Comparatively speaking, Spain has followed the incremental track in a narrow time-frame since democracy was restored in 1978. Finally, although the legal quota reform encountered political and juridical opposition, Spain managed to introduce it without the need for constitutional reform.

<p>This study employs an experimental approach to isolate and directly test the extent to which [US] presidents can affect public perceptions of issue importance and support for policy action, taking into consideration key factors that condition such effects. Our findings provide new empirical evidence that presidents can, in fact, positively influence public opinion through agenda-setting, particularly by increasing the perceptual importance of low-salience foreign policy issues. However, the results also indicate that such positive effects do not translate into public support for policy action; instead, presidential appeals actually decrease support. Last, our study offers new evidence that employing bipartisan cues can help presidents further increase public perceptions of issue importance, though such cues are unlikely to spur increased support.

Time has come to lay down the respective responsibilities of the Union and the States for effective security-management. If such agreements cannot be secured, then it is necessary to bring about the required constitutional amendments to ensure that the country can be protected from terrorist and other attacks which may arise from within or beyond Indian frontiers.

<p>Since the 1990s, China has pushed forward the province-managing-county (PMC) reform in some provinces as an experiment of fiscal decentralization. The reform provides a good opportunity to examine the impact of fiscal decentralization on fiscal behaviors of local governments in China. Using a data set of 108 counties in Henan Province during 1999–2008, we employ a difference-in-differences approach to investigate how the PMC reform affects local public education spending. The results show that counties given additional fiscal autonomy tend to spend a lower share of their annual expenditures on public education than other counties do. The findings suggest that fiscal decentralization does not necessarily make local governments more responsive to long-term benefits for local residents. [R]</p>

<p>This article deals with the judicialization of politics in Pakistan under the Supreme Court Chief Justice Choudhry (2009–). Confrontation between the executive and judiciary led to speculation about the imminent collapse of the democratic system, given the history of military take-over in Pakistan. The use of judicial review was widely criticized as an attempt to encroach on the territory of the legislature through case-law. The Court sought to exercise veto-power over the appointment of judges and to deny the right of oversight to any government agency. Its pursuit of public interest litigation actions taken in a populist mode led to brinkmanship on the part of the executive and judiciary. Despite this power play, the Court's operations fell into the category of <italic>modus operandi</italic>, instead of being a fight to the finish. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper contributes to the understanding of the role of think tanks in the governance of regional policy.

Policy-transfer and the role of ideas in regional policy provide the framework for analysis. The interpretation of the findings suggests that the think tanks considered are largely products of national policy debate and party politics in the UK, despite efforts to devolve power. This is surprising given debates about the influence of EU regional funding on UK regional policy, seen as a prime example of multi-level governance. [R]</p>

First of all, it shows how the implication of specific professions and their history account for the constitution of a sanitary—or, on the contrary, pedagogic—public problem. then, it studies the constitution of a biological norm of reading through the use of measurement tools coming from psychology and the legitimization of constitutional forms of knowledge in the area.

<p>Scholars generally agree that interest groups are active and at times influential during the notice and comment period of regulatory policy-making (or “rule-making”). But current research often ignores the agenda-setting that may take place during the pre-proposal stage of rule-making.

This article focuses on <italic>ex parte</italic> lobbying—“off the public record” conversations in which lobbyists share policy and political information with regulators—during the pre-proposal stage of rule-making.

<p>Two main weaknesses of the new institutionalism literature, one associated with veto-player theories and the other with path-dependency theories, help account for the framework's inadequacy in theorizing change, especially radical change. A comparison of the divergent development of public aid to private schools in three countries—Australia, New Zealand, and the US—demonstrates the importance of two factors that potentially mitigate the status quo-preserving effect of veto points and path-dependency: the multifaceted nature of veto points and the political clout of status quo challengers. Even in what initially appear to be highly constrained institutional systems, significant reform can occur, at either a rapid or slow pace. [R]</p>

<p>This article investigates party coalitions in local legislatures in South Dakota [USA] and Slovenia using a most-dissimilar design. The data presented include my own interviews with informants in five municipalities in Slovenia and party-coalition data on county commissions in a US state. Both data sources demonstrate a similar propensity among local legislators to engage in broad-spectrum party cooperation. In particular, among South Dakota counties with non-single-party commissions, a clear majority had bipartisan coalitions using a stringent measure, even when controlling for the presence of non-aligned legislators, population size, which party was in the majority, and the electoral system. Some evidence suggests that political culture affects bipartisan cooperation; fiscally conservative Republican counties are more likely to include a Democrat in their governing coalition than morally conservative counties.

<p>How have Mexico's community-based democratic institutions, known as <italic>Usos y Costumbres</italic> (UyC) or Uses and Customs systems, affected local and national politics? Although informal UyC practices exist throughout Mexico, the state of Oaxaca formally changed its electoral codes in 1995 to legalize UyC. Statistical analysis of national election results shows that Oaxacan municipalities that formally adopted UyC systems thereafter experienced higher first-place party margins and higher levels of abstention compared to non-UyC systems. That these systems helped local leaders engineer election outcomes while reducing participation, even in national elections, undermines arguments about their democratic benefits. UyC rules appear to help preserve local authoritarian enclaves, with negative consequences for national democracy. [R]</p>

<p>Intergovernmental relations (IGR) as a political principle and a mechanism of governance have played a major and distinctive role in Northern Ireland's political and constitutional development.

This article analyzes the development and nature of IGR since the restoration of devolved government in 1999 but particularly since 2007, in light of this distinctiveness. It sets out the wide range and nature of the processes and institutions of IGR involving the Northern Ireland government and its form of consociational representation.

<p>While steps are taken to increase women's representation in politics, it can often prove difficult to change patterns of recruitment and nomination to political positions.

The article compares recruitment policies in rural municipalities in Norway. Case studies were conducted to identify factors affecting women's willingness to stand as candidates, the factors local political parties take into account when nominating candidates, and voting behavior. The study suggests that local issues, such as religious traditions, distributional conflicts and desire for community representation, affect women representation. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>We conducted a field experiment involving roughly 1,000 letters sent by actual individuals to nearly 500 different [US] legislative offices in order to test whether legislative offices prioritize service over policy in their home style. We find strong evidence that both state and federal legislative offices are more responsive to service requests than they are to policy requests. This pattern is consistent with the desire of legislators to gain leeway with their constituents in order to pursue their own policy goals. We also find that at the federal level Democrats prioritize service over policy more than Republicans and at the state level legislators who won by larger margins are more likely to prioritize service over policy. Finally, our results suggest that the decision to prioritize service occurs in how the office is structured. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In Scotland, the formation of a minority government in 2007 by the Scottish National Party (SNP) provided the potential for profound changes in intergovernmental relations. This followed eight years of a Scottish Labour-led coalition government characterized by a low-key and informal relationship with the UK Labour government. From 1999 to 2007, discussions were conducted informally and almost entirely through political parties and executives (ministers and civil servants). Although formal mechanisms for negotiation and dispute-resolution existed, they were used rarely. The Scottish Executive also played a minimal role in EU policy-making. Yet, an “explosive” new era of relations between the Scottish and UK governments did not arrive in tandem with the new era of party incongruence. This article explores these issues.

<p>The meaningful transformations in the postmodern age have caused a crisis of the legitimacy mechanism of healthcare systems. If health is the result of interaction of biological, physiological, economic, cultural and social factors, it is necessary to rethink the traditional structure of government, based on expertise and bureaucratic hierarchies. New forms of shared governance structures are emerging to intervene on the different variables through cooperation processes between public and private actors (network governance). Starting from the different power structures that a network system can describe, the article explores the changes on the regulatory powers in the healthcare system to identify the guiding principles of the governance model defined by the Tuscany region through the “company of health”.

<p>This paper compares the different ways that health is presented as a legitimate issue of local politics and policy in France and Denmark. It focuses on the discursive uses of the biopolicy at the local level. Local politicians often claim that making policy to improve the health of populations is legitimate in itself and, thus choose not to justify their policies beyond the “imperative of health”. However, the comparison suggests that this choice of argument primarily stems from characteristics of local politics and policy.

<p>The literature that explores relationships between lay and professional stakeholders in community participation generally suggests that professionals perceive five main difficulties in working with lay people: it is unnecessary within democracies; lay people lack expertise; they are not representative; there is commonly a lack of trust, and decision-making is made more complex. In respect of spatial planning in South West England, from survey evidence these difficulties are not so apparent except in respect of complex decision-making. It is likely that the variation between the literature and the survey is influenced by the longer heritage of community participation in the spatial planning process in England, than in most other local authority services.

<p>Since 2011, gay couples in Germany are given the possibility to legalize their relationship by registration as a same-sex union.

<p>After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1992, Bratislava regained its status of a European capital. This city—also known as Pressburg or Pozsony—passed through different empires and regimes until it became the center of the emancipation effort of the Slovak nation. As many capitals and agglomerations in general, it has grown gradually integrating the surrounding municipalities. The tendency to grant broad autonomy to local governments during the democratic transition also had an impact on the organization and competences of the districts of Bratislava. Its organization is rather decentralized and each district is a legal entity with a wide autonomy. A number of reforms have been adopted to modernize the status of Bratislava. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The impact of personality traits on people's attitudes and behaviors is widely recognized, yet systematic attention to personality in large-<italic>N</italic> research on elected officials has been rare. Among psychologists, five-factor frameworks that focus on openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional stability, have gained tremendous prominence in the past two decades. In an effort to assess the utility of a Big Five approach in the study of legislative politics, this article addresses three questions: whether elected officials will be willing to provide personality self-assessments, whether any data they do provide will exhibit meaningful variance, and whether the Big Five trait dimensions will correspond with patterns in respondents' attitudes and behaviors. These questions are addressed using data from members of the state legislatures in Arizona, Connecticut, and Maine [US]. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The £29 billion formula grant stands at the heart of the English local government finance system. This transfer of resource from central to local government has, since 2006–2007, been distributed using the so-called “four block model”. This extraordinarily complex formula-based funding mechanism aims to ensure that all local authorities are able to provide individuals with a broadly comparable level of public service, offering greatest support to local authorities with high service needs and/or low capacity to raise revenue. This paper outlines the structure and workings of the four block model and, drawing attention to key methodological shortcomings, explains why the resulting distribution of the formula grant is both arbitrary and inequitable: key model parameters—i.e., the need and resource equalization proportions—are set in order to fulfill a particular funding outcome.

<p>This article reviews dependency postulates and examines whether they are applicable to explain the political economy of China's contemporary relations with Peru. It argues that the dichotomy between Peru as a commodity-providing periphery and China as a core manufacturing center is insufficient to explain the ways in which power is embedded in the international economic system, and particularly inadequate to identify winners and losers in the international division of labor. Thereby, in line with some recent international political economy discussions of power, the article proposes that China should not be understood as a self-contained economic entity, but as a hub where natural resources are mobilized for transnational production.

From a modern perspective, mostly inspired by the school of the New Public Management, the merger of <italic>communes</italic> should save money and improve local public management. Legal and institutional analysis shows certain advantages and some critical points in that regard. The maintenance of “delegated or associated” <italic>communes</italic> is not a measure of the efficiency of French administrative organization. The absence of any financial incentive for merger does not add much to the attractiveness of territorial mergers. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Legitimacy theory suggests that judges are uniquely capable of increasing public support for government policies. However, this capacity may not be universal but conditional, depending on the institutional design of courts. In the US, institutional differences between federal and state courts may make state judiciaries less capable of increasing public support for government policies. I investigate this possibility using an original survey experiment. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of three treatments, attributing the legalization of same-sex marriage to a state court, a governor, or a state legislature. I find, generally, that state courts are no more effective than other state institutions at building public support, but that this capacity of courts is variable, depending on levels of judicial independence.

<p>The contemporary policy environment makes persistent demands on agency officials to use the best information available when making decisions about policies, programs, and practices. State and federal legislation calls on agencies to incorporate evidence-based practices (EBP) in their programs. Using data from a 2008 survey of state agency directors, we examine the extent to which state government agencies draw upon various sources of information to guide their decisions about programmatic operations. Our findings reveal the extent to which agencies rely on, or weigh, sources of scientific studies and formal evaluations compared to other sources. Factor-analysis identifies patterns of agency information-use, providing a basis for further exploring agency differences in information-consultation that underlie development of new policies and programs in the vein of EBP.

<p>Studies of policy-making by courts need to examine the actual policy adopted in the majority opinion rather than studying votes. The authors examine the responsiveness of state supreme courts to precedents announced by the US Supreme Court by examining their treatment of the precedents in their opinions, testing the utility of precedent vitality versus the impact of ideological preferences. They find that the vitality of Supreme Court precedent is a strong predictor of the way in which the precedent is treated by state courts, even after controlling for ideological distance and institutional features of state court systems.

<p>In Northeast Asia, the main obstacle to regional integration is that the initiative has been limited to intergovernmental agreements.

I have selected South Korea and China for this case study, with particular reference to Gyeonggi Province (<italic>do</italic>) and Shandong Province (<italic>sheng</italic>), due to their intensive inter-regional exchanges. The examination of various interactions observed at the trans-regional level provides a perspective on the roles of local governments and leads to an invaluable rediscovery of the merits of a bottom-up approach.

<p>Though the demographic characteristics of American voters still differ from the characteristics of the electorate as a whole, participation in the 2008 election represented real progress in closing the gap. Unfortunately, a wave of new regulations in 2011 threatens to reverse course. Worse, the burdens imposed by these new laws are not only real and inequitable, but also unnecessary—and in some cases, directly counterproductive. Through a hard look at the available data, this article reviews the demonstrated costs and benefits of three types of new election regulation: restrictions on voter registration, restrictions on early voting, and restrictions on how voters prove their identity at the polls. While regulation of these aspects of the election process is undeniably necessary, the approaches of 2011's new laws appear unwarranted. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4853]</p>

In the second section, I compare the different cantonal policies. Based on these results, the third part describes three models of biopolicies that are discussed in the next section as to their participative dimensions. In the conclusion, I underline the most important lessons of these comparative results, regarding the Foucauldian critic of the new public health. [R] [See <italic>Abstr.</italic> 62.4825b]</p>

<p>Democracy and the environment occupy increasingly more space and time in political studies. The environmental crisis, whose existence nobody denies, tends to be intertwined with the crisis of democracy and environmental conflicts. These conflicts are not only evidence of the change from the sacredness to the reification of nature, but also promoters of a “culture of emergency”, the “culture of disaster” or “culture of crisis”. This culture may give rise both to proposals for democratization and to an expansion of the classical conceptions of citizenship. These range from ecological democratization to Florestania, from “ecological citizenship” to “ecocitizenship”. This article aims to answer on “the classic architectural features which define the citizenship”. How can “the culture of catastrophe” move towards ecological citizenship? To answer those questions, we first make up a map of the definitions of ecological citizenship. We then present an analysis of the changes that have occuried in some of the elements of ecological citizenship by a study of four socio-environmental conflicts that took place between 2000 and 2007 in the Basque Country and Catalonia.

<p>The democratic impulse that spurred a wave of political and economic reform policies in Cameroon in the 1990s appears to have witnessed a reversal. This is the case with urban governance policies. The imposition of state-appointed city administrators on locally elected mayors and councilors in contradiction to the aspirations of citizens has not augured well for local democratic practices. This interventionist drive by the state in the process of local democratization effectively excludes a considerable segment of urban residents from local governance proceedings. To understand the effects of these politically motivated policies on city politics in Cameroon, this paper draws from broad historical data, local press reports, and close observation of on-going development initiatives in the city of Kumba.

<p>This article investigates the involvement of sub-national authorities and national parliaments in policy coordination in the area of welfare policy in the EU. Their involvement is analyzed in terms of influence in policy input, ex-post evaluation and monitoring of the executive. The findings are set against the four typologies of constitutional arrangements prevalent in Europe. The article concludes that the involvement of sub-national authorities is uneven, depending on their constitutional structures, as federal and regionalized states in general have more elaborate mechanisms, but some centralized states have sophisticated systems, too, which point to existing governance practices also playing a role.

<p>Using data on the adoption of e-government, reinventing government, and strategic practices, and the Nelson and Svara typology [“Adaptation of models versus variations in form: classifying structures of city government”, <italic>Urban Affairs Review</italic>, 45, 2010: 544–562] of municipal government form, the authors investigate the characteristics of municipal governments that are related to the implementation of innovative practices. The authors find that higher innovation rates are associated with council-manager governments—both with and without an elected mayor, higher population, greater growth, lower unemployment, sunbelt location, and higher population density. Controlling for all other variables, form of government (and variations within form) account for the greatest explanation of the adoption of innovative practices in municipalities. The authors conclude that form of government remains an important variable to consider when investigating local government management and performance. [R]</p>

<p>An extensive literature explores the correlates of bureaucratic influence in the implementation of public policy. Considerably less work, however, has investigated the conditions under which bureaucratic actors influence legislative outcomes. We develop the argument that effectiveness should be a key determinant of bureaucratic influence in the legislative process and identify a set of institutional characteristics that may facilitate or constrain this relationship. We test these expectations in an analysis of legislator perceptions of bureaucratic influence over legislative outcomes in the 50 US states. The results suggest that the impact of bureaucratic effectiveness on the influence of the bureaucracy over legislative outcomes is greater in states with legislative term-limits, united governments, and fragmented executive branches.

<p>Analysis of the development and implementation of local government performance-improvement regimes in England, Scotland and Wales over the last decade reveals congruence in policy goals but divergence in policy implementation and outcomes. The governments in all three countries had a common aim of improving local government performance. However, differences in ideology, the nature of central-local government relations, the numbers of councils and a political imperative for newly devolved administrations to be seen to pursue “home-grown” solutions limited policy learning between different parts of the UK and in the case of Wales fuelled determined policy avoidance by policy-makers.

<p>This paper examines how political institutions and local power structures interact with and influence local public resource allocation in the Indian state of Karnataka. We use data from 80 village councils and 225 villages to examine how this local political economy influences the allocation of public resources. Our empirical strategy exploits certain features of a policy that mandates representation for historically disadvantaged groups, including the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST), in village councils. These features imply that representation is a nonlinear function of the demographic shares of these groups. Controlling for the latter allows us to identify the role of local power structures through the effect of social identities and the associated relative bargaining powers of different caste groups.

<p>In addition to a radical modification of the pre-existing economic model, Vietnam's <italic>Doi Moi</italic> (renovation) has also entailed a gradual process of institutional adaptation without altering the core components of the country's political system. The introduction of liberal market economy principles since the late 1980s has co-existed with both a Marxist single-party institutional architecture and an ideological corpus envisioning socialist democracy. Against this background, some conclusions suggest that the recently introduced pro-grassroots democracy regulations are institutional innovations partially consistent with A. Gramsci's theories on hegemony and civil society which, however, are not yet bringing about processes of true popular political participation in the rural context. It ultimately reflects the absence of a theory-based and comprehensive strategy to mainstream citizen participation into the local political institutions. [A, abr.]</p>

<p>Since the 1960s, a policy has undertaken to promote balanced metropolises in order to foster the emergence of regional metropolises. The law of 2010 created metropolises to enable the most important urban areas to enter into worldwide city competition. They have been given a number of competences transferred to them from the local authorities (communes, departments and regions) on the territory of which the metropolis is located. This questions the organization of the whole French local system. However, neither the status of metropolises nor their legal regime (competences and financial regime) guarantee success. [R]</p>

We also examined the moderating role that population size can play in the model's behavior. User trust not only improved the model's fit, but also showed a significant effect on intention of use for all the population sizes that we analyzed. The other significant relationship for all the samples linked ease of use to perceived usefulness. For the other relationships between variables, we observed the moderating role of size for the populations we considered. [R]</p>

The article also distinguishes between resilience as “recovery” and resilience as “transformation”, with the latter's focus on “bouncing forward” from external shocks seen as offering a more radical framework within which the opportunities for local innovation and creativity can be assessed and explained. While also acknowledging some of the weaknesses of the resilience debate, the dangers of conceptual “stretching”, and the extent of local vulnerabilities, the article highlights a range of examples where local authorities—and crucially, local communities—have enhanced their adaptive capacity, within existing powers and responsibilities.

<p>Does fiscal decentralization empower sub-national governments to raise sufficient revenue from local sources thereby reducing their dependence on the national government? This paper focuses on Indonesia's most recent decentralization policy and assesses and analyzes the role of local governments in this regard. Based on data collected from two different locations in Eastern Indonesia, the paper shows that the dependency of local authorities on central government is excessive and that the share of local revenue in regional budget has remained rather small. It also shows that while the fiscal power granted to local governments is limited, a combination of politico-economic and contextual factors has further undermined the prospect of revenue mobilization at the local level.

<p>It is critically important that [US] states implement measures that help improve the security and integrity of elections. Ensuring fair elections requires that individuals authenticate their citizenship when they register and their identity when they vote. Such measures also increase public confidence in our election process. These measures prevent impersonation fraud, voting under fictitious voter registrations, double voting by individuals registered in more that one state or locality, and voting by illegal aliens or even legal aliens. Contrary to the claims of critics, such minimal requirements do not depress the turnout or have a disparate impact on minority, poor, or elderly voters: the overwhelming majority of Americans have photo ID or can easily obtain one.

Several issues are analyzed: legal regulation of this particular type of local self-government, the history of towns with county status, their formation and organization, the relationship between the counties and towns with county status, and legal regulation of the counties. The most important problems and several proposals for improvement in connection to the TCS are identified.

Special rules on functions, internal structure and decision-making, elections, and certain other issues are analyzed to confirm the basic hypothesis about this special status. The two-tier self-government undermines the potentially strong position of the capital city within the Hungarian political system: just as the capital city serves as potential political counterweight to the central government, city districts serve as real counterweights to the city government.

<p>This paper discusses and explains the paradoxical observation that a local government reform aimed at reducing or even removing bureaucracy actually leads to more formalization, not less. During the last 10–15 years more than 40 per cent of Norwegian municipalities have adopted an organizational model that makes the administration more disaggregated, decentralized and flat. The reform has been promoted by strong post- or even anti-bureaucratic rhetoric, arguing for increased managerial autonomy at the operational level. The basic idea is that greater autonomy will create better performance. The paradox of increased formalization is discussed on the basis of rhetoric, unintended consequences, diagnostic problems and linguistic problems. The paper points out the need for a more nuanced conception of bureaucracy than the dichotomous approach of post-bureaucracy can offer. [R, abr.]</p>

(Shifting majorities in the North Rhine-Westphalia diet [Germany]. How are democratically legitimized majorities ensured by parliamentary votes?).</bold> <italic>Zeitschrift für Parlamentsfragen</italic> 43(1), 2012: 54–64.</p>
<p>In the current diet of North Rhine-Westphalia (2010–2012), shifting majorities are part of the daily reality, but in an ambiguous way. On the one hand, the minority government of the SPD and the Greens needed partners from the opposition to achieve parliamentary majority decisions. On the other hand, a majority decision can change within 13 minutes into a refusal through the influence of the Speaker of the House presiding the plenary meeting and his assistants. Such a situation occurred and is analyzed to show how many factors influence the parliamentary voting process. This includes parliamentary participants, techniques and methods of voting as well as everyday parliamentary practices. [R]</p>

<p>This article explores the recent regionalization of Swedish governance—both policy and structure—in order to explore some of the aspects of research on Europeanization that scholars in the field have recently signaled as especially problematic. We pay particular attention to the role of political cleavages, conflict and contestation, and to the construction and use of policy discourses surrounding European integration as a means of affecting domestic political change. Using the concept of “usages of Europe” from French political sociology, we trace the development of a network of actors which eventually succeeded in constructing EU membership as a tipping point in what had long been intractable domestic debates around regionalization in Sweden.

<p>62.4860 WELCH, Eric W. — <bold>The relationship between transparent and participative government: a study of local governments in the United States.</bold> <italic>International Review of Administrative Sciences</italic> 78(1), March 2012: 93–115.</p>
<p>The relationship between transparency and participation of government is not well articulated in the literature. Transparency provides stakeholders with knowledge about the processes, structures and products of government. Participation refers to the quantity, quality and diversity of input of stakeholders into government decision-making. Greater transparency and participation are often considered to operate side by side. However, in the internet age the change in the magnitude of information disclosure may outweigh the change in the level of participative government. This article uses data from a 2010 national survey of five US local government agencies to test hypotheses about the relationship between transparency and participation and the factors that affect them.

<p>62.4861 ZHU Xufeng; JIAO Qiyuan — <bold>“New public management” in China at the local level: competition-driven local public service reform in Tianjin.</bold> <italic>Lex Localis (Journal of Local Self Government)</italic> 10(2), Apr. 2012: 153–170.</p>
<p>New public management (NPM) paradigm plays an increasingly important role in contemporary public management practices throughout the democratic world. This article argues that the driving force behind NPM reform in China at the local level is the competitive pressure to improve administrative performance. In China, where there is no electoral democratic regime, local governments face pressure in competition with counterparts over economic performance and consequent promotion opportunities for their leadership. The introduction of NPM can make local governments more effective and efficient in providing public services, which can result in local governments attracting more investments and enhancing competitiveness. The administrative licensing reform with public service outsourcing in Heping District, Tianjin City, China, is an example of NPM reform driven by competition among local governments. [R]</p>
