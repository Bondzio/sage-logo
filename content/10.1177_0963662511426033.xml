<abstract>
<p>This study investigates how media frame a global trend that is complex in nature, emergent in terms of scientific understanding, and has public policy implications: the rapid disappearance of languages. It analyzes how English-language media from 15 western, industrialized countries frame the causes and implications of endangered languages over 35 years (1971–2006) – a time period notable for growing, interdisciplinary concerns over the potential negative impacts of losing the world’s linguistic diversity. The results reveal a media discourse characterized by three complementary frames that are sympathetic to the plight of endangered languages, but that present the problem, its cause, and societal implications in a logical structure that would promote public complacency.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>With each passing decade, scientists gain new understandings of the intricate ecologies within which we live: the interconnectedness of financial markets, the pathways of pandemics, or the causes and implications of climate change. For better or worse, people rely heavily on media to understand how these global phenomena touch their lives.</p>
<p>Complex topics do not translate well as news stories. When covering issues that have multiple causes, a variety of types of risks or implications, as well as a range of possible solutions – media must translate not just words of experts or officials, but challenging ideas with uncertain outcomes. As a result, journalists constrained by a lack of time, space, and technical expertise can prematurely frame a scientifically complex issue in a biased or limited way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662511426033">Radford, 2007</xref>: 96).</p>
<p>This study looks at media framing of a complex global trend: the radical disappearance of world languages. The term “radical” is important here. While world languages have since their inception moved through cycles of birth, transformation, and sometimes death, linguists point to the past 500 years as exceptional, documenting the “radicalization and acceleration of a centuries-long trend” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662511426033">Hjarvard, 2004</xref>: 77). A language now disappears every two weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662511426033">McWhorter, 2002</xref>). What makes this a “complex” issue is emerging science suggesting that the impacts of language loss reverberate well beyond the confines of an indigenous culture. Increasingly, scientists from a range of disciplines contend that the loss of linguistic diversity has broader implications for environmental sustainability and resource management, health and medicine, as well as other arenas of science. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511426033">Maffi (2001)</xref> offers an excellent description of a nascent, interdisciplinary field of study that investigates the roles linguistic diversity plays within a larger ecological and knowledge system.</p>
<p>The results presented here offer a characterization of western media discourse surrounding the issue of endangered languages. They document how English-language media from 15 western, industrialized nations framed the issue over 35 years (1971 through 2006) – a period that corresponds with rising scientific concerns over the loss of global linguistic diversity. The intent is to enhance our knowledge about news reporting of global trends that are complex in nature, emergent in terms of scientific understanding, and have potential public policy implications. The issue of language loss was selected because it is at a similar stage of scientific understanding as global warming a quarter century ago; we know that it’s happening at accelerating rates, but we don’t know the long term consequences of losing human linguistic diversity. How do media report a trend that <italic>might</italic> be detrimental to global health?</p>

<title>2. Background</title>
<sec id="section3-0963662511426033">
<title>Media framing of complex issues</title>
<p>The idea of media frames links back to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662511426033">Goffman’s (1974)</xref> assertion that framing is a natural, cognitive process through which people make sense of their world by organizing it into “strips” of experience. Frames facilitate our need to simplify the world. Media scholars have successfully shown that this cognitive process translates into news frames that privilege particular interpretations through processes of selection, highlighting, and the setting of “boundaries of discourse surrounding an issue” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662511426033">Kosicki, 2003</xref>: 66; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662511426033">Gamson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511426033">Gitlin, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0963662511426033">Tuchman, 1978</xref>). Relevant to the present study are the following key findings related to media frames and coverage of complex issues.</p>
<sec id="section4-0963662511426033">
<title>Frames are cohesive and logical in structure</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511426033">Creed, Langstraat, and Scully (2002)</xref>, drawing on Gamson’s notion of frame packages, describe frames as logical structures that link, connect, or “hold” idea elements together. A key goal of frame analysis, they argue, is to sort out the underlying logics of frames. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0963662511426033">Snow and Benford (1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0963662511426033">1998)</xref> offer that frames punctuate (define), elaborate (attribute cause and responsibility), and motivate action around an issue. This study relies on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511426033">Entman’s (2004</xref>: 77) definition that both emphasizes a media frame’s logical structure, as well as identifies its four key elements, making it useful for empirical analysis as demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662511426033">Kohring and Matthes (2002)</xref> in their study of German press coverage of biotechnology. Entman states that, “A frame operates to select and highlight some features of reality and obscure others in a way that tells a consistent story, about <italic>problems</italic>, their <italic>causes</italic>, moral <italic>implications</italic>, and <italic>remedies</italic>” (italics added). It is through their structural logic that media frames function to “promote a particular interpretation, evaluation, and/or solution” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511426033">Entman, 2004</xref>: 5). This study asks if western media have presented scientific concerns over the rapid loss of languages and, if so, how the issue has been framed for public consumption.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0963662511426033">
<title>The logic of frames can influence public interest in and acceptance of particular solutions</title>
<p>Research has demonstrated the ability of media frames to guide audience perception of an issue – particularly one in which they have no personal experience (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662511426033">Cappella and Jamieson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662511426033">Iyengar, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662511426033">Lee et al. (2008</xref>: 698) summarize the “growing body of research [that] situates framing effects as part of the reasoning process” by which citizens evaluate particular actions or remedies to problems. “Media frames work by connecting the dots for the public” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662511426033">Nisbet, 2010</xref>: 47). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662511426033">Iyengar and Reeves’ (1997)</xref> study on poverty demonstrated that the type of frame influenced participants’ attributions of responsibility for poverty, and by extension, the range of acceptable solutions. An experimental study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0963662511426033">Schaefer (2006)</xref> showed that the media framing of a conflict influenced readers’ acceptance, or not, of military intervention regardless of the parties in conflict. Using focus groups, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0963662511426033">Philo (2004)</xref> found that the quality of media explanation regarding international affairs influenced both attitudes and interest of audience members in “getting involved.” This study asks whether the implications of language loss are framed in a logical structure that would promote public support of policies to save minority languages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0963662511426033">
<title>Cultural resonance gives media frames persuasive and ideological power</title>
<p>Several scholars note the importance of the cultural resonance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662511426033">Gamson and Modigliani, 1989</xref>) or cultural congruence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511426033">Entman, 2004</xref>) of a media frame. Media frames that reflect cultural common sense, values, or ideology are both instinctually employed by journalists and easily accepted by the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662511426033">Carragee and Roefs, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511426033">Van Gorp, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0963662511426033">Williams, 2000</xref>). Related to science reporting, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0963662511426033">Radford (2007</xref>: 95) asserts that “Humans may be novelty seekers, but many of them are not at all comfortable with the new, the untested, and the unknown. Editors, publishers, and readers, on the whole, prefer the familiar.” This can have implications for public understanding. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511426033">Olausson (2009</xref>: 423) argues that frames with cultural resonance are “not subject to any kind of questioning, and are therefore invisible in everyday practice” and supportive of the status quo. Through her study of Swedish news coverage of global warming, Olausson showed how the comfort of familiar, national frames obstructed efforts to instigate climate policy change. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662511426033">Nisbet (2010)</xref> found that ideologically friendly frames – rather than scientific reality – influenced public perceptions of climate change in the United States. The present study asks how western values and perspectives might influence media coverage of endangered languages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0963662511426033">
<title>Complex issues – or issues that involve multiple causes, effects, and interdependencies – often suffer from oversimplification and limited depth as journalists seek efficient and “audience friendly” ways to cover them</title>
<p>While political officials engage in strategic frame building in order to promote preferred policy outcomes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662511426033">Nacos et al. (2000)</xref> point out that science-based issues such as climate change tend to be framed – at least in the early stages – by experts or interest groups that range in the degree and sophistication of their efforts. Scientists, in particular, are not known for their media savvy. Even if they were more attuned to journalistic imperatives, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662511426033">Fjæstad (2007</xref>: 123) points out that the roles, and goals, of scientists and journalists are too distinct to result in productive cooperation. Thus, news from emerging fields of inquiry or concern, in particular, is heavily filtered through the daily routines and pressures of media production. As a result, the coverage of science by non-specialized mass media is often criticized by scientists for a range of perceived faults from invisibility to inaccuracies to exaggeration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511426033">Bucchi and Mazzolini, 2007</xref>: 53).</p>
<p>Media, in any kind of competitive environment, strive to present news that is timely, relevant, and attractive to audiences through a news “event” orientation that highlights drama, human interest, and familiarity – yet at the same time is cost effective to produce. This orientation is particularly problematic for the reporting of science or economic trends which by their very nature are complicated and unfolding over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662511426033">Fjæstad, 2007</xref>). Global warming and the recent economic crisis are both examples of this challenge. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662511426033">Nissani (1999)</xref> demonstrated how time and space constraints contributed to shallowness in US media coverage of the greenhouse effect. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0963662511426033">Yang (2004)</xref> found that the lack of scientific background on the part of most journalists compromised the quality of environmental reporting. Part of the problem is that journalists attempt to adapt these topics to familiar and formulaic news structures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511426033">Bendix and Liebler’s (1991)</xref> study of US media coverage of environmental degradation in the 1980s found that it took events (e.g., a natural disaster, UN summit) to garner media attention to the issue in those early years. In lieu of an event, journalists often attempt to simplify and symbolically represent a complex issue through the experience of an individual or promotion of a news icon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662511426033">Bennett and Lawrence, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662511426033">Livingston and Eachus, 1996</xref>). Again, there are implications to this practice. For example, research has shown that journalistic preference for simplified imagery such as a “hole in the ozone” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0963662511426033">Ungar, 1998</xref>) or “dying forests” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0963662511426033">Zierhofer, 1999</xref>) in fact detracted from public understanding of the complexity of global warming. This study looks at the prevalence of common journalistic formulas and techniques in the framing of endangered languages, asking how they might obscure or enhance public understanding.</p>

<title>Endangered languages</title>
<p>For most of the history of language the world has been in a state of linguistic equilibrium where the number of languages was generally constant and naturally transforming with each generation. When languages did die, through various forms of gradual or sudden death, others were created. As described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662511426033">McWhorter (2002</xref>: 261), “old diversity was replaced with new diversity.”</p>
<p>Over the past 500 years, however, about one half of the historically known languages of the world have disappeared. Linguistic equilibrium has been upset as dominant, “metropolitan” languages rapidly expand at the expense of “peripheral” languages – now without replacement (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511426033">Nettle and Romaine, 2000</xref>: 79; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662511426033">Hjarvard, 2004</xref>). At present, linguists estimate there are around 6,800 languages in the world with 90% of the world’s population speaking the 100-most-used languages. They predict that 50–90% of world languages will disappear by the end of this century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662511426033">McWhorter, 2002</xref>: 257; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662511426033">UNESCO, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Root causes for language shift or death range from dramatic events (e.g., disease, war), nation building policies (e.g., single language policies), economic pressures (e.g., urbanization), the industrialization and globalization of mass media, intergroup discrimination, to outright oppression or genocide. Whatever combination of causes might underlie the loss of a particular language, the process is similar: the community and socioeconomic system that supported the language disintegrates and the minority group loses control of its local environment. This is accompanied by the decreased economic viability of traditional ways of life, as well as a diminished sense of cultural identity, self esteem, and group prestige. In other words, when a minority language becomes less useful in arenas of daily life, the dominant language, or lingua franca, becomes more powerful and desirable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511426033">Dixon (1997</xref>: 145) writes, “Once the lingua franca is used more than 50% of the time, it will soon (within one generation or less) jump to 100%.”</p>
<p>Linguists argue that, to outside observers, this process often seems voluntary when it is really the result of underlying pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511426033">“Babel runs,” 2004</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511426033">Nettle and Romaine (2000</xref>: 79) state,
<disp-quote>
<p>The first causes in language loss … are not themselves linguistic …. Where language use changes, there is an underlying social upheaval that may have environmental, economic, or political causes. This litmus-test property of language is immensely significant. It means that the loss of a language – like the death of a miner’s canary – is a good indicator of less visible stresses which might need investigating.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When a language becomes extinct a unique way of viewing the world is lost. Linguists and cognitive scientists lose valuable variation in data samples from which to pursue their theories of language and how the mind works. In the realm of cultural and human rights, when languages falter their speakers suffer a loss of cultural continuity and social cohesion necessary to maintain meaningful cultural identity. Unique forms of art and aesthetic vision also die with their purveyors.</p>
<p>An increasing number of scientists also suggest that the environment suffers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662511426033">Maffi (2002</xref>: 388; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662511426033">2008</xref>) argues that the two-way links between environmental (biodiversity) and cultural diversity are not just metaphorical (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0963662511426033">Skutnabb-Kangas et al., 2003</xref>). Indigenous speakers can possess a rich source of information about local plant and animal species and their biological habits – much not yet documented by scientists.</p>
<p>In response, over the past fifteen years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of organizations, cooperative agreements and declarations, and funding initiatives devoted to archiving failed languages, supporting the rescue of endangered ones, promoting bilingualism, and tackling the root causes of language loss such as environmental, economic, and political sustainability for indigenous cultures. In 2001 UNESCO adopted the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity which specifically addresses linguistic diversity. The MacArthur Foundation, Ford Foundation, and National Science Foundation (NSF) all have started funding initiatives for work related to endangered languages. Despite these activities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511426033">Nettle and Romaine (2000</xref>: 153) claim that media coverage of endangered languages remains one of “benign neglect” with generally low visibility or import.</p>

<title>Media sample and time frame</title>
<p>This study examined English-language articles referencing endangered languages available through two suppliers of media/news texts: ProQuest and LexisNexis Academic. At the time of data collection close to 200 national, regional and local publications were available in English offered by these two suppliers. A search using the key words “Language <italic>and</italic> Extinct/Extinction <italic>or</italic> Endangered <italic>or</italic> Disappearing” and selection criteria of hard news, features, opinion pieces, or reviews of books resulted in 664 articles from 25 countries over a 35-year period (January 1971 through December 2006). From this population of media texts, non-western or non-industrialized countries were dropped (e.g., Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji) – as were duplicate articles across the two databases – resulting in a media sample of 595 articles across 15 western, industrialized countries: United States (278), Australia (77), United Kingdom (99), Canada (61), France (11), Germany (10), Ireland (9), Poland (1), Hungary (1), Russia (8), Bosnia (7), Italy (10), Czech Republic (2), New Zealand (19), and Israel (2). National and metro publications in the sample included the <italic>New York Times, Christian Science Monitor, The Times of London, Toronto Star, The Australian, The Seattle Times, The New Zealand Herald, The Guardian</italic>, and <italic>International Herald Tribune</italic> among others. English-speaking media from western, developed nations were selected because their large readership increases their potential to influence the understanding of the issue of endangered languages worldwide.</p>
<p>While both databases included publications earlier than 1971, the start date of January 1971 represented the first year in which any article referencing endangered languages appeared. The finish date selected (December 2006) was five years after the 2001 UNESCO declaration promoting linguistic diversity (referenced above). This decision allowed enough time to gauge any significant changes in article frequency or focus in the aftermath of the declaration.</p>
<p>There are well known drawbacks to the database news retrieval approach. First, not all publications or countries are represented and, as is the case here, article frequency counts can skew toward the database company’s home nation. Second, while articles do appear in their entirety, the researcher cannot be confident that all articles on a topic are made available. Still, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662511426033">Kolmer (2008)</xref> describes, such media text suppliers are commonly used in content analysis and best used in situations where the researcher is: 1) confident in the reliability and reach of the search terms; 2) not documenting the chronological unfolding of a specific news event; and 3) more interested in characterizing a generalized discourse versus analyzing results by region, publication type, or other media demographic variable. All three conditions apply in this case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0963662511426033">
<title>Coding protocols<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662511426033">1</xref></sup></title>
<p>A hybrid form of content analysis was employed that involved both pre-defined category coding and an inductive process of frame identification. The process involved four primary steps. First, the 595 documents were imported into Atlas.ti, a software program commonly used for qualitative text analysis. Guided by detailed codebook instructions, a trained research assistant and the author read each article, recording General Information and Journalistic Features onto a separate code sheet. General Information included: date, type of media outlet, article type (feature, hard news, opinion, review, other), word length, headline, degree of focus (endangered language(s) as primary topic or brief mention), and country or region of language(s) mentioned. For Journalistic Features, coders answered a series of close-ended (yes/no, presence/absence, or category option) questions: Was the article triggered by a news event? If so, what type of event (1. completion of book, report, research; 2. annual or one-time event such as an exhibit, celebration, conference; or 3. start or announcement of something new such as a policy, program, project)? Who was the event’s primary sponsor (e.g., university, non-profit organization, business, UNESCO)? If the article was not event-oriented, what was its nature (e.g., travel article, general issue article)? Does the article link endangered languages to environmental change? Does the article include statistics regarding languages or language loss trends? Does the article mention UNESCO or the United Nations related to language/culture loss or diversity? Does the article start with a personal story? Direct and indirect-quoted sources (up to five, in order of appearance) were also coded. Source categories clustered under nine general types: individuals with a research orientation; teaching orientation; service orientation; citizens; government officials; media sources; business; religious; or other.</p>
<p>The second step of the coding process focused on identification of frame elements guided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662511426033">Entman’s (1993)</xref> definition of the logical structure of a frame described above (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662511426033">Matthes and Kohring, 2008</xref> for an in-depth discussion of this approach). The “problem” was not coded per se; it was assumed to be disappearing language(s) because of the text search criteria. During this second reading of the data set, any manifest statement that expressed the following frame elements was highlighted in Atlas.ti and electronically labeled. These are hereafter referred to as Frame Statements: <italic>Cause</italic>. What does the article state has caused, encouraged or facilitated the language(s) becoming extinct historically and/or at present? <italic>Implications</italic>. What are the stated implications of language loss? Or, what reasons are given to protect or preserve the endangered language(s) – or not? <italic>Remedies</italic>. What actions are or should occur, if any, in regard to the endangered language(s)? <italic>Evaluation</italic>. This overall article attribute was based on a combination of explicit cues (adjectives used, quotes and facts selected by the journalist, overall themes or positions advocated) that answered the question: What was the sentiment expressed toward endangered languages as a problem? This frame element was recorded using a five-point scale similar to that advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662511426033">Kolmer (2008)</xref> (one – very sympathetic to five – not sympathetic). A three was considered neutral/balanced/ambivalent.</p>
<p>The third step focused on frame identification. Atlas.ti allows documents to be generated that list all Frame Statements coded as Cause, Implications, and Remedies. Based on a close reading of these three summary documents, and with close attention to repeated combinations of Frame Statements within articles, a coherent set of frames was identified, named, and is described below. To document the prominence of each frame, an exhaustive list of categories was developed that represent the Frame Statements identified. A third reading of each article took place to attach these category codes, which allowed for subsequent frequency analysis. For <italic>Cause</italic> this process resulted in 37 categories options ranging from causes emanating from the group or community itself (e.g., “Youth not interested in the old ways”) to causes located in unequal group relationships – historical and present (e.g., “Loss of land” or “Official assimilation laws or policies”) to causes linked to broader changes or forces (e.g., “globalization” or “diffusion of English”). For <italic>Implications</italic> a category list of 23 items included personal, social, political, economic, cultural, aesthetic, environmental reasons or implications. <italic>Remedies</italic> resulted in a list of 30 categories, ranging from concrete actions such as “give legal recognition to the language” or “promote the language through mass media” to more abstract recommendations such as “change majority public attitudes” or “encourage people to be proud of their language and culture.”</p>
<p>The fourth and final step was to enter all code sheet data for General Information, Journalistic Features, Framing Statements (Cause, Implication, Remedy) and Evaluation into SPSS to generate frequencies.</p>

<title>Intercoder reliability</title>
<p>Intercoder reliability tests were conducted to assess the reliability of coder identification of General Information, Journalistic Features, and Frame Statements based on guidelines set forth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0963662511426033">Riffe, Lacy, and Fico (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662511426033">Lombard et al. (2002)</xref>. During training, a pilot intercoder reliability test using three coders including the author was conducted on 5% of the article population, randomly selected. Discussions resulted in a number of refinements and revisions to the coding document primarily in terms of adding categories to be more exhaustive and rewording others to create more mutually exclusive category distinctions. Final reliability was tested using the two coders who would divide coding responsibilities; each coded the same 50 articles, randomly selected from the article population. Two different intercoder tests were conducted each producing strong results. Percentage agreements were at levels above 90% for all code sheet elements except <italic>Cause</italic> (87%). To consider chance agreement Cohen’s Kappa was also calculated at κ = .86–.88 for General Information categories, κ = .82–.86 for Journalistic Features, and κ = .77–.82 for Frame Statement identification.</p>
<p>Reliability in terms of frame identification (the elements put together) is always a concern in framing research because “the linkage between explicit elements of the news text and the central framing idea … requires some interpretation by the person who is doing the analysis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0963662511426033">Van Gorp, 2010</xref>: 90). To boost confidence in this interpretative step of the analysis the author relied solely on manifest content as evidence.</p>

<title>4. Results</title>
<p>The western media discourse surrounding the issue of endangered languages produced three identifiable frames. Each frame emerged from categories of Frame Statements, expressing Cause, Implications, and Remedies, that combined repeatedly to construct the frame’s logical structure. Beyond some isolated statements, no other coherent perspectives regarding endangered languages were found. The frames identified were complementary, not competing, in their characterizations of the conditions surrounding language loss. While an article might contain all the elements of a particular frame this was not always the case. As such, the analysis was based on an assessment of the full sample (<italic>N</italic> = 595 articles) of western media discourse. Further, an article might contribute to the construction of more than one frame – for example, by stating multiple types of Causes for language loss. The presentation of findings below first characterizes general patterns of coverage across the articles over time then describes each distinct frame.</p>

<title>General patterns of coverage of endangered languages</title>
<sec id="section15-0963662511426033">
<title>Low visibility</title>
<p>Between January 1971 and December 2006 the issue of endangered languages appeared in 595 English-language articles across 15 western, industrialized countries available through ProQuest and LexisNexis Academic. The articles had an average word count of 783. Understanding that there are limitations to the availability of older articles in database searches, there is still a notable increase in coverage after 1995 with a “peak” during 2000–2002. This corresponds in part to United Nations and UNESCO efforts to create awareness of the issue, although only 8.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 53) of all articles associate the issue with the UN or UNESCO. More specifically, prior to UNESCO’s 2001 Declaration on Cultural Diversity only 14 articles (2.3%) associated the UN agency with the issue of endangered languages. After the Declaration, that figure rose to 39 (6.6%) of all articles.</p>
<p>The majority of articles were hard news (53.6%, <italic>n</italic> = 319) or features (32.8%, <italic>n</italic> = 195). Beyond this 9.7% were editorials or op-ed pieces (<italic>n</italic> = 58), 2.4% book reviews (<italic>n</italic> = 14) and 1.5% other formats (<italic>n</italic> = 9). Across all formats, a single or regional languages were the primary focus of the article 41.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 248) of the time. Another 24.2% (<italic>n</italic> = 144) discussed multiple languages without a particular geographic focus. In 30.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 182) articles, the issue of endangered languages was not the primary focus, but rather a single mention in the context of, for example, a travel feature. The primary examples given were endangered languages in North America (32.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 196), worldwide (25.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 154), Western Europe (12.1%, <italic>n</italic> = 72), Australia (6.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 41), Africa (4.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 25), and South East Asia (1.3%, <italic>n</italic> = 8). Proportionally, this distribution does not reflect the actual distribution of endangered languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0963662511426033">UNESCO, 2002</xref>). It more accurately reflects the geographic homes of the 15 nations included in the study.</p>
<p>Without question, the overall visibility of this issue in English-language media is low considering both the frequency of articles over a 35-year period spread across multiple publications and the fact that endangered languages were not the primary focus of a third of the articles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0963662511426033">
<title>Formulaic presentations</title>
<p>Journalistic routines of personalization, using statistics as the primary facts, and reliance on public relations outputs were common. In particular, leads in a “nut graph” style were employed. Over a third of the articles (39.5%, <italic>n</italic> = 235) start with a personal story such as: “Jose Ochurte Espinoza nervously rubs his dark, callused hands as his eyes begin to fill with tears at the memory of his departed loved ones. Espinoza is a Msig Ouuum koleew kuil matom, ‘one of the last of the Kiliwas.’ One of the oldest people who know the culture, one of the last five who speak the mother tongue” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0963662511426033">Sanchez, 2002</xref>: E-1). A similar number of articles (36.6%, <italic>n</italic> = 218) cite commonly circulated statistics regarding language loss trends. Close to 40% (<italic>n</italic> = 233) of the articles were event-oriented and clearly generated through university, non-profit, publishers, or other institutional public relations efforts. Of the remaining 362 articles, 39.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 216) addressed endangered languages directly as an issue. The topic of endangered languages was a peripheral element in the articles 34.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 203) of the time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0963662511426033">
<title>Sympathetic, but limited presentation</title>
<p>The loss of world languages was viewed sympathetically in nearly half the articles (47.5%, <italic>n</italic> = 283, mean 2.5 on a scale of 1 to 5) or through a neutral, balanced, or ambivalent portrayal (47.2%, <italic>n</italic> = 281). However, the presentation of context or relevant conditions surrounding this issue was very limited. Only 56%, <italic>n</italic> = 333, of the articles identified any causes of language loss. Only 47% (<italic>n</italic> = 280) of the articles stated any reason to save a language.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0963662511426033">
<title>Media framing of endangered languages</title>
<p>As noted above, the three frames that emerged in this study were complementary versus competing. While each frame is distinct, their logical structures would all encourage a reader to reach a similar conclusion. Each frame supports a view – contrary to expert opinion – that the increasing rate of language extinction is not a problem that affects the public at large, or can be reversed, so no remedy is needed. The frames are described below in order of their prevalence across the media sample as determined by both the number of articles and frequency of manifest Frame Statements that contributed to each.</p>
<sec id="section19-0963662511426033">
<title>Indigenous Problem Frame. The problem rests with members of the language community. What can you do? It’s their choice</title>
<p>This first frame offers a good example of setting boundaries of discourse. It places the cause – and implications – of the problem solely within the confines of the endangered language community itself (versus to external pressures). It was the most dominant frame with close to 52% of the articles contributing to this perspective. This frame portrays language shift, and ultimately extinction, as a choice. It suggests that, for the most part, the language is no longer valued and people are simply not interested in its protection. As a result, there are only a few people left in the community who know it. In this frame, reasons given to save the language, or implications of its loss, emphasize the psychological or personal – such as the need to boost self esteem and pride, revitalize local traditions, or strengthen community or generational bonds. There was no mention of a need for change or support at a regional or national level nor were the implications of language loss connected, in any way, to a broader public. Furthermore, according to the Indigenous Problem Frame’s logical structure, if the cause and effects are both directly linked to the local language community then the remedy rests within that community as well. Accordingly, articles supporting this frame reported or proposed actions contained within the bounds of the indigenous community: e.g., elders offering language classes, establishing a cultural center, or staging events to encourage locals to be “proud” of their culture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0963662511426033">
<title>Globalization Frame. The problem stems from global forces. What can you do? You can’t stop the inevitable</title>
<p>The second most dominant frame, with 48% of the articles contributing to its construction, links the cause of minority language loss to a broad brush of global trends: globalization, modernization, and the diffusion of western products and media programming. As a representative quote, one article states, “Sadly, many of these cultures and their indigenous knowledge are being lost, partly as a result of the globalization of trade and the rising dominance of western or northern-style values and traditions.” Many articles mention the prevalence of English, but also Spanish and Chinese as increasingly dominant languages associated with the global business economy. Because the Globalization Frame presents language extinction as inevitable in the face of these global forces it does not offer reasons to prevent language loss. Rather, Frame Statements emphasize the futility of preserving a culture or language. For example, a minister of education in China is quoted: “Mainstream society today is a free market society and you need competitive knowledge to survive. Minority languages and cultures are of no use in a market society” and that minority parents must be “pragmatic” in raising their children. Another journalist writes that it is impossible to get youth interested in their traditional culture when they are “bombarded” with English media “everywhere they turn.” An article about an endangered language in Chile states that the only, and unrealistic, way to protect that language is by regulating migration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0963662511426033">
<title>Unfortunate History Frame. The problem rests with the injustices of history. What can you do? History is past</title>
<p>The third most prevalent frame, with 34% of the articles contributing to this view, points to the policies of prior governments, or historical events, as the primary causes of language extinction. This frame causally links current language extinction trends to specific injustices of the past: colonization, forced assimilation laws, monolingual education policies, the ravages of disease or war, and displacement from traditional lands. It does not mention or evaluate present-day policies or structural barriers that might perpetuate inequalities between cultural groups. In one representative example, an article states, “In Australia, hundreds of Aboriginal languages are now extinct as a result of harsh assimilation policies in place until the 1970s.” Another article states, “The Hawaiian language is almost extinct. Diseases killed off many of her ancestors, and generations have been pushed off their land.” The central message of the Unfortunate History Frame is that the actions of “others” in the past were unfortunate, but it is too late to reverse the catalysts for today’s dying languages. While the media statements regarding historical catalysts for language loss are true, only 3% of all articles in the media sample referenced current conditions – such as education, language, or land use policies – that may weaken the vitality of “living” minority languages going forward. The logical structure of the Unfortunate History Frame suggests that languages will continue to disappear at a rapid rate because one can’t rewrite history. Accordingly, the primary actions suggested in this frame are for linguists to archive dying languages in databases and for the few remaining speakers to create written texts in order to preserve remnants of their languages for posterity.</p>

<sec id="section22-0963662511426033" sec-type="discussion">
<title>5. Discussion</title>
<p>The goal of this study was to investigate the nature of media frame logic when presenting an emerging and complex issue with potential public policy implications. The results here indicate that growing concerns over the loss of linguistic diversity echoed across many scientific fields have not captured the interest of western media. More specifically, English-language media across 15 nations treat the radical disappearance of languages in a way that would promote public complacency, as evidenced by low visibility and the logical structures of the frames that present this issue. The Indigenous Problem Frame accomplishes this by suggesting that the problem only affects the language community and that those communities have chosen to abandon their language. The Globalization Frame treats the loss of minority languages as an inevitable outcome of a globalizing world. The Unfortunate History Frame accomplishes this by suggesting “What’s done is done”; it is too late to reverse the wrongs of the past.</p>
<p>Also missing from the western media discourse is any sense that the knowledge and variability embedded in diverse languages could benefit a broader public. Even the more recent research documenting the links between linguistic diversity and biodiversity has failed to capture media attention – despite a marked increase in environmental reporting over the past several decades. Only 14.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 85) of the articles link endangered languages to the environments they supported.</p>
<p>The low visibility of this issue can be explained in part by journalistic definitions of news. First, the trend of language loss does not fit well with the event-orientation of news. The 500-year time period that signals a “rapid” disappearance of world languages to scientists is an eternity to journalists. Second, despite UNESCO efforts, the loss of languages is not an issue on national government policy agendas. Only 11% of sources were government officials, a figure in stark contrast to typical news reporting. Given that government tends to drive the news agenda, the issue receives little media attention. Third, the limited scientific calls to preserve linguistic diversity come from diverse disciplines – from cognitive to environmental science to ethnic studies – offering equally diverse reasons to act. As such, there is no coherent message or group voice for journalists to follow.</p>
<p>The content of the three frames is also explained by well-documented journalistic constraints and professional norms that favor efficiency, simplification, personalization, and formula reporting. For example, the narrative instinct of most journalists is to write a story about a language when only a few speakers are left; it is more personal, poignant, and dramatic. Consider this representative “nut graph” found in the media sample:
<disp-quote>
<p>Only a handful of elderly men still speak Mapoyo, the language of an ethnic group with just 200 surviving members that has lived along the Orinoco river in Venezuela for centuries. The last female Mapoyo-speaker, Petra Reyes died …. Her two surviving brothers and two or three other men are the only ones who still actually use their native language. The rest of the community has switched over to the dominant language, Spanish …. [In Venezuela] several languages are vanishing due to the tiny number of surviving members of the ethnic groups that speak those tongues. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662511426033">Marquez, 2003</xref>: no page)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even if this story format provoked a concerned public response, Mapoyo is already gone. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662511426033">McWhorter (2002</xref>: 262) languages are effectively dead long before media choose to report on the last handful of speakers. In fact, linguists suggest that at least 100,000 speakers are necessary to successfully pass a language from one generation to the next (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511426033">“Institute says,” 2003</xref>). None of the articles analyzed labeled languages with that level of speaker population as endangered.</p>
<p>Also evident is the influence of cultural and ideological resonance in frame development. Enduring western beliefs in individualism, linear development, and social order – along with a dose of ethnocentrism – underpin all three frames. Individualism plays a significant role in the Indigenous Problem Frame where, rather than identify the systemic causes and effects scientists say define this issue, the cause, effects, and any solution for the problem of endangered languages are placed squarely on the shoulders of the indigenous community itself.</p>
<p>The Globalization and Unfortunate History Frames support a belief in linear development and the notion that the only viable path to modernization is that defined by western nations. These two frames make reversing the language loss trend, through government policy making, appear futile in the face of a globalizing world. However, according to logician <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511426033">Kahane (1992</xref>: 50), this line of reasoning is misleading because the truth of the conclusion is assumed by the premise. In other words, it assumes that modernization and globalization can only destroy language diversity – when there is no proof that this needs to be the case. An increase in global interdependence, while certainly reliant on the standardization of transportation, financial, and communication systems, does not require cultural homogenization to be productive.</p>
<p>Along these same lines, embedded in these two frames is an assumption that homogeneity (e.g., monolingual education) – not diversity – contributes to social order, prosperity, and even peace although there is no historical evidence that this is true as a rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511426033">“Babel runs,” 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511426033">Nettle and Romaine, 2000</xref>: 18). In fact, the harnessing of diversity within the context of a globalizing world is increasingly seen as an asset to business, health, and environmental problem solving. In a detailed review of research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662511426033">Page (2007</xref>: xx) demonstrates how “diverse perspectives, heuristics, interpretations, and mental models” (readily expressed through linguistic diversity) improve our collective ability to solve problems.</p>
<p>As with global warming, if a scientific consensus emerges that protecting linguistic diversity is vital to global health it would still face challenges of gaining public understanding through media. Protecting languages requires changing the systems that contribute to language loss. Remedies would require giving more political legitimacy and access to economic power to minority groups. It would also require a change in perspective for western nations. For example, one remedy unreported in western media is the idea, heavily promoted by a range of groups involved with this issue, that bi- or multi-lingualism should be the status quo <italic>for everyone</italic>: a condition that linguists say has been the norm for humanity through most of history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662511426033">Fishman, 1991</xref>: 17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662511426033">Crystal, 1997</xref>: 19). In other words, it comes as little surprise that the cultural “common sense” of media representing the western, industrialized world would be to frame this complex global trend sympathetically, but in a way that discourages fundamental societal or ideological change.</p>
<p>In the end, the results confirm the anecdotal observation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511426033">Nettle and Romaine (2000)</xref> who characterized media coverage of endangered languages as one of “benign neglect.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0963662511426033">Wolfsfeld (2004)</xref> would explain western media framing of endangered languages documented here as a result of the “principle of unintended consequences,” in that journalists do not intentionally ignore the emerging science surrounding a complex issue, but rely on news presentation practices that might limit public understanding of its societal implications.</p>
