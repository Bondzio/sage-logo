<p>The impetus to review end-of-life (EOL) education in the pre-registration is timely given the current review and consultation on the standards for pre-registration nursing education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987110379533">Nursing and Midwifery Council, 2010</xref>) and the changing context for palliative and EOL care. Palliative and end-of-life care is facing a period of unprecedented change influenced by policy frameworks, government reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987110379533">Department of Health, 2008</xref>), changing patterns of care and new knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987110379533">National Institute of Clinical Excellence, 2004</xref>). Having a knowledgeable, skilled, compassionate and competent workforce is an important requirement to help deliver this agenda.</p>
<p>This paper describes a literature review to explore the effectiveness of EOL education from the perspectives of students, newly qualified nurses, patients and carers. Whilst it is recognised that patient and carers’ perspectives views can be an important indicator to assess service quality, how these views are linked with education for EOL care is less explicit. This tenuous link is acknowledged by the authors who note that other factors, such as cultural and organisational constraints, can have an impact on the patient/carer perspective. Therefore, caution needs to be exercised when considering the impact of this perspective on the effectiveness of EOL education.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a key finding from the patient’ and carers’ perspectives was the importance of communication for quality care. This recognition of the importance of communication has been noted in recent EOL care strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987110379533">Department of Health, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987110379533">Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, 2010</xref>). It is vital, however, that this focus is not merely focused on communication skills and competence training. Rather the complexity of education is recognised to include an affective learning domain that moves towards a more self-reflective model for communication, acknowledging the various multifaceted processes and dimensions of communication. This indicates the need for more innovative approaches to teaching and learning.</p>
<p>The review also provides evidence that despite an increase in EOL education in nursing programmes, students and newly qualified nurses still feel unprepared to provide EOL care. Coupled with this is the suggestion that there is insufficient support for both students and newly qualified nurses to help them cope with the practical and emotional experiences related to death and dying. This finding is worrying with the increase in the numbers of people who will continue to need EOL care.</p>
<p>This paper offers some new insights into EOL care education in pre-registration nursing curriculum, but sadly, despite various developments, deficits still exist. Therefore as stated by the authors, it is imperative that nurse education curriculum is continually reviewed to include both a stronger focus on EOL care and some radical solutions to address this important issue.</p>
