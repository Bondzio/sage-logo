<p>This edited volume brings ethnomusicologists, sociologists, anthropologists, cultural studies specialists, and geographers into conversation with practising artists and dedicated island studies scholars to examine songs and singing on selected islands around the world. Geographies range from the English, French and Spanish Caribbean, to Cape Breton and Newfoundland, the Hebrides and Jersey, Fiji, Chiloé, Sicily, Papua New Guinea, Ibiza and Gotland, with other islands mentioned along the way. This volume is ambitious in its broad approach to both the study of songs and singing, as well as its engagement with the theory of Island Studies in itself. Baldacchino highlights the potential complications of such a gathering of scholars and ideas in the introduction by writing that the ‘text is a modest attempt to illuminate, read, and enjoy songs with the intent of better understanding the inherent contradictions and paradoxical modalities of island life’ (p. xxii).</p>
<p>The contributors emphasize the perceived peripherality of islands in relation to often distant centres of power, with the insular locations viewed as either quaint refuges from the modern world or backward hinterlands. This ‘othering’ of islands shapes both outsider and insider perceptions of musical life on those island spaces. Heather Sparling’s discussion of Cape Breton Island provides a thoughtful critique of such thinking and stands out in this collection for its theoretical underpinnings. She examines how the perception of Cape Breton as a repository for Scottish Gaelic culture and heritage plays out in local competitions. Sparling’s chapter, along with Ronström’s chapter on Gotland, provide a valuable counter narrative to the more common trope of ‘warm’ islands as tropical paradises. Oli Wilson’s chapter on Papua New Guinea offers an insightful conversation of island songs in a location not commonly thought of as an island by its inhabitants.</p>
<p>Due to its expansive perspective, this volume sometimes struggles with the burden of serving as a broad introduction not only to Island Studies, but also to the featured geographic regions and the study of song as well. The reader at times might ask whether the arguments being made about islandness are not actually pertinent to more general conversations about senses of place in music. Does the perceived isolation of islands inherently differ from the perceived isolation of mountainous areas on the mainland? Is the interplay of song with questions of tradition, revival, language preservation, tourism, and transnationalism unique to island locations? This volume does not always seek to answer such questions, but rather offers coherent case studies, which each grapple with the array of ‘island songs’. The diversity of approaches and geographic regions is at the same time a great strength of this collection.</p>
<p>Musical notation is nowhere to be found in the volume, which might disappoint some musicologists and music theorists. There are, however, discussions of song form, instrumentation, and performance practice throughout the text. Cultural geographers, anthropologists, folklorists, and area studies specialists will all find valuable material within this volume. These writings also contribute to further understanding of tourism studies, postcolonialism, hegemony, landscape, exoticism, and the relationships between place and artistic production.</p>
