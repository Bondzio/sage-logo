<attrib>Lewis Carroll, The Hunting of the Snark</attrib>
</verse-group>
<p>Like Lewis Carroll’s snark-hunters, palliative care researchers are pursuing a creature that we know exists, but are not quite sure what it is or how to find it. We recognize good palliative care when we experience it. We know that reducing suffering and improving quality of life and health care, including communication and coordination, for patients with serious illness are worthy and achievable goals, desired by patients, families and providers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312444796">1</xref></sup> But how, exactly, to measure and promote ‘good’ in palliative care remains an elusive goal.</p>
<p>Measuring the quality of hospice and palliative care is necessary to decide where to focus efforts in improving quality and for measuring the effectiveness of quality improvement initiatives. Quality measurement in palliative care usually involves health care utilization indicators, such as number of hospitalizations at the end of life; medical record review for issues such as pain management; or survey data, such as after-death surveys for families of hospice patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216312444796">2</xref></sup> However, although many tools have recently been developed, quality measurement in this area is limited by challenges of assessment in vulnerable populations and lack of consistent documentation of many key aspects (such as pain management or end-of-life decision-making) in medical records. Many palliative care indicators have not been well evaluated; in particular, there is little good evidence for correlation between indicators (particularly for utilization) and patient outcomes. In addition, most indicators only address processes of care that are a small part of the complex and varied issues necessary for high-quality end-of-life care, and none collect data directly from patients.</p>
<p>Four articles in this issue of <italic>Palliative Medicine</italic> provide some insights into how to continue developing this field. Some of the studies evaluate in greater depth how these indicators reflect actual quality of care; others describe innovative approaches, expanding boundaries of measuring quality and implementing indicators to improve patient care.</p>
<p>Two articles address how information on quality can be collected and used to impact care and policy both regionally and nationally. Sussman and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216312444796">3</xref></sup> used population-level utilization quality indicators (such as emergency department use at the end of life) to compare regional health systems in Ontario, Canada, and develop a framework to identify potentially modifiable health system organization factors associated with quality of care. Specifically, the framework identified six key structural features of regional health systems, such as 24/7 palliative care team access, that were associated with higher palliative care indicator performance. This study advances how indicators have previously been used by examining how differences in performance are associated with differences in key characteristics of regional health systems. These types of methods may be useful for comparisons and prioritization of program features in systems that have the capability to compare indicator performance and structural issues across health care providers.</p>
<p>On a larger scale, Lundström and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312444796">4</xref></sup> described a multi-year effort to establish a national quality registry for end-of-life care in Sweden. The registry began with data on 5% of Swedish deaths and within a few years advanced to 34% of deaths – nearly 60% of all cancer deaths. The registry collects standardized data on various structural, process and clinical outcomes to measure quality. The data has helped identify areas for improvement, such as end-of-life care in residential care facilities. The power of the registry is clearly in its national scope, but also that Sweden can modify the indicators collected as the field of quality measurement advances. Unlike most quality measurement projects, where reports are generated long after care occurs, internet-entered data allows real-time, actionable reporting for providers and policymakers. This project also demonstrates that providers and managers are willing to enter relatively straightforward data, solving the ubiquitous problems of not having meaningful data sources or research staff to enter data.</p>
<p>In contrast to the broad regional and national scale of these two articles, the other two articles in this issue are more focused and examine a single quality dimension – place of death or preferred place of death. Place of death is commonly used as a quality indicator, because many people express a preference for dying at home. Despite this preference, most people in developed countries currently die in institutional settings, suggesting that this is a complex issue. Achieving death at home can be challenging due to lack of supporting resources and systems, shifts in preferences as people experience the realities of illness, differences between family and patient preferences or ethnic or cultural preferences.</p>
<p>In a study of patients admitted to one New Zealand hospice, Taylor and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312444796">5</xref></sup> examined factors associated with place of death. All patients in the study had equal access to services that could adequately support death at home if desired, since all had been admitted to a hospice, yet only 28% of deaths were at home. Nearly half died in the hospice specialized inpatient unit, while a few (16%) died in an aged/residential care facility (which could be considered a residence if they were there prior to beginning hospice care). In multivariate analysis, the only significant predictor for dying at home was being from a Pacific Island. This raises the question whether ethnicity signals different cultural preferences (valuing home death and caregiving more than other cultural groups) or indicates access to better social support and resources to make home death more feasible.</p>
<p>Ideally, a patient/family-centered quality indicator for place of death would assess the match between preferences and whether they were met, which would require documentation of preferences. In a study evaluating the feasibility of such an indicator for the United Kingdom Quality and Outcomes Framework, Hannon and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312444796">6</xref></sup> interviewed members of general practice staffs. Respondents were asked about their experience using the palliative care indicator, ‘the percentage of patients on the palliative care register who have a preferred place to receive end-of-life care documented in the records.’</p>
<p>Respondents voiced significant concerns about the indicator. They noted difficulty determining a ‘right’ time or person to ask about preferred place of end-of-life care. In fact, practitioners were concerned enough to raise the issue of whether the indicator harmed patients by exposing them to insensitive or inappropriate queries about this complex, emotional topic. The authors note ‘a need to balance the advice given in guidelines to elicit preferred place of end-of-life care with assessment of the appropriateness of discussing the issue with patients.’ This study demonstrates how quality indicators that seem reasonable still require extensive evaluation with patients/families, providers and organizations before wide implementation, and that this evaluation must go beyond validity and reliability of measurement and address issues of acceptability, feasibility and potential unintended consequences.</p>
<p>In summary, these four studies from four different countries demonstrate both progress and continuing challenges in palliative care quality measurement. On the policy level, this research demonstrates the potential for currently available quality measures to inform policy and practice, and for the development of innovative methods to collect data and provide feedback. On the individual patient and provider levels, these studies also show how much research is still needed on how best to measure quality, potential unintended consequences and critical issues of patient preferences and cultural differences. Together, they illustrate how the field of palliative care quality indicator development and implementation is advancing, and how continuing caution is needed to ensure that we have carefully evaluated issues of what these indicators are actually measuring and what their use will mean for clinical care and policy before implementation.</p>
<p>Although the field of palliative care quality measurement is rapidly advancing in many countries, measuring good end-of-life care is still a continuing hunt for the best methods and systems. To capture the elusive ‘snark’ of quality palliative care, further developmental work is still needed on issues such as feasibility, potential unintended consequences and association with patient outcomes to achieve evidence-based agreement on a core set of structure, process and outcome measures. In addition, rigorous evaluation is needed on how best to integrate these measures into care and customize measures for different settings and populations.</p>
<p>Besides registries, another promising option is integration of these measures into point-of-care systems for data collection that are easy for clinicians to use, or into electronic medical record systems. Real-time quality data can help guide more timely feedback and help systems monitor ongoing quality and address problems when they occur. Processes to ‘roll up’ the data from many providers into regional databanks can provide meaningful benchmarking and actionable reports to providers. Investment in the infrastructure of quality improvement is also needed to enable and motivate providers and systems to use benchmarking and evidence on what program elements are associated with best outcomes to customize improvement to local settings. Continued rigorous quality research and innovative programs on all aspects of quality measurement, such as in the articles in this issue, will help us reach these goals.</p>
