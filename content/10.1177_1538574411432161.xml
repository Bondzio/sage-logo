<abstract>
<p>We aimed to determine the long-term results after infrapopliteal PTA (primary patency, limb salvage, survival) and examine for association with risk factors (e.g. diabetes, infection, etc). We studied 268 patients with 282 critically ischemic limbs treated with PTA of at least one crural artery during a six-year period. Data included TASC II morphological classification of lesions and risk factors. Technical success rate was 97.2%, and overall mortality 0.7%. Patients with milder TASC lesions preserved primary patency longer than patients with more severe lesions. Similar results were obtained for limb salvage and survival. Fontaine stage, TASC class and postoperative infection of operated limb increased the risk for loss of primary patency and major amputation. Concomitant carotid stenosis was associated with loss of primary patency. Diabetes mellitus, preoperative ulcer or gangrene were associated with need of major amputation. PTA was a safe and effective treatment for CLI due to lesions of infrapopliteal vessels.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Peripheral arterial occlusive disease causing critical limb ischemia (CLI) represents a growing problem in developed countries. For lesions occurring in iliac, femoral and popliteal arteries percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is the treatment of choice. However, for lesions occurring in infrapopliteal arteries, infrainguinal bypass remains the established treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574411432161">1</xref></sup> PTA for infrapopliteal occlusive disease has been regarded with caution because of the small caliber of the tibial arteries, their tendency to develop vasospasm, and mainly because of the relatively poor results previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574411432161">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574411432161"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574411432161"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574411432161">5</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Technical advances such as improvement of digital subtraction angiography with road mapping capabilities, development of small, low-profile balloons, hydrophilic and steerable guide wires, and the use of vasodilators have made infrapopliteal PTA a feasible and promising method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574411432161">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574411432161"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574411432161">8</xref></sup> With growing experience with this technique, favorable outcomes and low complications rates have been achieved; thus this technique is suggested as the treatment of choice in high-risk patients suffering from critical limb ischemia due to infrapopliteal lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574411432161">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574411432161"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574411432161">11</xref></sup> However, there are few studies attempting to associate the outcomes of infrapopliteal PTA with the severity of the atherosclerotic lesions and known risk factors for CLI, such as diabetes mellitus or renal disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574411432161">12</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>For that reason we investigated the long-term outcome after infrapopliteal PTA, stratified by the severity of the atherosclerotic lesions. We also examined possible associations of risk factors for CLI --such as diabetes mellitus, renal disease, carotid stenosis-- with the preservation of primary patency, limb salvage and survival in patients with critical limb ischemia due to infrapopliteal occlusive disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1538574411432161">
<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<p>This retrospective observational study was conducted in the Department of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery of St. Josef Hospital, Haan, Germany, during a 6-year period and included all patients primarily treated with PTA of at least one infrapopliteal artery causing symptoms of CLI. In total, 268 patients (85 female, 183 male) of mean age 67.3 years (range 57 to 88 years) with 282 critically ischemic limbs were included. Critical limb ischemia was defined as tissue loss (ulcer or gangrene) or foot pain at rest. All included patients were Fontaine stage 3 or 4, and category 4, 5, or 6 according to the Society for Vascular Surgery - International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery (SVS-ISCVS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574411432161">13</xref></sup> In our institution there is a “PTA-first” policy, so that all patients with CLI and severe co-morbidities first undergo an endovascular attempt. An exception to this policy is patients with severe lesions of infrapopliteal arteries, i.e. TASC D, who had no severe co-morbidities and had not been subjected previously to a saphenectomy. Those patients underwent a bypass surgery without having been subjected to an angioplasty. Moreover, some patients included in our study had concomitant atherosclerotic lesions of the femoral/and or popliteal arteries. The inclusion criterion for these patients was that lesions should cause less than 50% stenosis of the vessel lumen.</p>
<p>Risk factors such as diabetes mellitus or coronary disease, other diseases in medical history, clinical symptoms and preoperative resting ankle-brachial index were recorded for each patient. Morphological classification of infrapopliteal lesions was performed using the preoperative diagnostic angiography, according to the guidelines provided by TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574411432161">14</xref></sup> At the end of the study care was taken so that the patients were reclassified according to the TASC II guidelines published in 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574411432161">15</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>PTA was performed with an antegrade puncture and insertion of 6 French introducer sheath into the ipsilateral superficial femoral artery. Heparin (5000 units) was injected into the artery prior to crossing the lesion. Hydrophilic, angled guide wires ranging in diameter from 0.014 to 0.018 inches (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) were used for crossing the lesions. Single or multiple dilatations were performed with a balloon catheter 2-4 cm long and 2.5-4.0 mm in diameter (Tangowire, Fa Boston Scientific, Fa Orion, Cordis) inflated at 8-10 atmospheres. Stents were not used in any patient. Unless contraindicated, in all patients heparin (15,000 units) was administered subcutaneously for the first 3 days; aspirin 300 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg for the first 3 weeks; and then aspirin 100 mg after successful recanalization of the vessel. Vascular surgeons performed all procedures.</p>
<p>Technical success of infrapopliteal PTA was defined as recanalization with 30% or less residual stenosis of the crural artery and antegrade flow at the completion of PTA. Primary patency after infrapopliteal PTA was defined as the intraoperative angiographic depiction of a non-occluded treated tibial artery without any additional re-intervention or major amputation. Limb salvage was defined as avoidance of a major amputation (below or above knee) during the follow-up period. Toe or transmetatarsal amputations were considered minor amputations not interfering with limb salvage.</p>
<p>Patients with initial technical success were followed-up. Ankle-brachial index measurements were performed in all patients on the first postoperative day. The patients were evaluated clinically with duplex ultrasound and, if indicated, with angiography after 3, 6, and 12 months, and thereafter every 6 months. Indications for reintervention during the follow-up included: reccurrence of symptoms, i.e. resting pain, or new lesions of the foot, i.e. ulcer or gangrene. Patients suffering from severe lesions of the crural arteries, i.e. TASC class C or D as determined by angiography during the follow-up, were submitted to bypass operation --if feasible-- or amputation.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>The association between categorical variables was examined by Pearson chi square. In order to examine differences on time-to-event settings (e.g. duration of survival or primary patency), we used Kaplan-Meier models, and comparisons were made with the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test, as more robust to censored cases. Censored cases are defined as cases that did not experience the event of interest, i.e. death for a survival analysis, during the study period. In order to examine the effect of risk factors on the likelihood of loss of primary patency or major amputation, we performed a multiple Cox-regression analysis. With Cox-regression analysis, one can calculate the proportional hazard of the occurrence of an event of interest at any given time for a risk factor, i.e. the chance of a diabetic patient to need a major amputation in comparison with a non-diabetic patient. Statistical significance was defined as <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 16.0 for Windows.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574411432161">16</xref></sup>

 lists the arteries on which PTA was performed. In 201 limbs out of 282 studied (71.3%), a concomitant femoropopliteal PTA was performed. However, the stenosis of the femoral and/or popliteal arteries varied between 40% and 50% of the vessel lumen, according to the preoperative angiography. Thus these lesions were not causing any symptoms and did not require any treatment. All femoropopliteal PTAs were successful and none of the patients included in our study required re-intervention on the femoral or popliteal arteries during the follow-up. The average duration of follow-up of our patients was 17.5 months, ranging from 1 to 48 months.</p>

<p>The technical success rate of infrapopliteal PTA was 97.2% (274/282). In the eight unsuccessful cases, three were TASC class C lesions and five were class D lesions. Failure occurred due to either vessel perforation or failure to advance the guide wire through the lesion. In five of these eight unsuccessful cases, we proceeded to femorodistal bypass. In the remaining three patients we performed an amputation due to either a wet gangrene or absence of the saphenous vein: in 2 we performed a major amputation; in one, we initially performed a minor amputation and two months later we proceeded to a major amputation because of wound infection.</p>
<p>The overall complication rate of PTA was 1.1%. In 3 patients out of 274 successful PTAs, groin hematomas occurred; one was surgically evacuated. During the first month after PTA 2 patients died, one on the second postoperative day due to a cardiac arrest, and the other one on the 20th postoperative day because of a septic complication; thus, the 30-day mortality was 0.7%.</p>

<title>Primary Patency</title>
<p>In 85 of the 274 cases with an initially successful PTA, a bypass operation or repetition of PTA was required at some time during follow-up. Therefore, the duration of primary patency was examined in the remaining 189 cases. Cumulative probability loss of primary patency after successful PTA, stratified by TASC class, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574411432161">Figure 1</xref>
. As can be seen, patients with TASC class D lesions lost primary patency of the operated artery sooner than TASC class C patients, who, in turn lost patency sooner than patients with TASC class lesions A and B. Specifically, patients with TASC class D lesions lost primary patency significantly earlier compared to the other TASC classes [A and D log-rank (Mantel-Cox): chi square = 19.940, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0005, B and D log-rank (Mantel-Cox): chi square = 26.881, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0005, C and D log-rank (Mantel-Cox): chi square = 7.079, <italic>P</italic> = .008]. Similarly, patients with lesions TASC class C lost primary patency of the operated artery significantly earlier than patients with TASC class A and B lesions [C and B log-rank (Mantel-Cox): chi square = 12.461, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0005 and C and A log-rank (Mantel-Cox): chi square = 12.564, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0005].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of our study showed that the TASC class of lesions affected primary patency, limb salvage and survival of patients with critical limb ischemia undergoing infrapopliteal PTA. Diabetes mellitus affected limb salvage and survival of patients after infrapopliteal PTA, but it did not affect primary patency. More severe preoperative Fontaine stage and TASC class of lesions and the occurrence of a postoperative infection increased the risk of both loss of primary patency and the need for a major amputation. Also, concomitant carotid stenosis increased the risk of loss of primary patency. Diabetes mellitus, preoperative ulcer and preoperative gangrene increased the risk of a major amputation.</p>
<p>In our study, infrapopliteal PTA was a safe procedure with a high technical success rate (97.2%) and a low incidence of complications (only 3 hematomas.) A recently published meta-analysis reported an overall technical success of 89% for infrapopliteal PTA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574411432161">17</xref></sup> It is evident that with increased experience with endovascular surgery and the incorporation of novel technology, surgeons can reach the lesions in crural arteries, then cross and dilate them successfully and safely.</p>
<p>The majority of patients with critical limb ischemia are elderly and of high operative risk due to severe co-morbidities, e.g. coronary artery disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574411432161">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574411432161">19</xref></sup> However, the 30-day mortality rate in our study was only 0.7%, suggesting that infrapopliteal PTA even in high-risk patients is a safe procedure. In contrast, in patients with bypass the reported perioperative mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538574411432161">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538574411432161">21</xref></sup> (2.4-6-9%) and morbidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1538574411432161">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538574411432161">23</xref></sup> (9.3-31%) are high. The low mortality of PTA might be attributable to the fact that it is a minimally invasive procedure without long-lasting general anesthesia. Thus it causes less surgical stress than a bypass procedure, and it results in improved postoperative recovery.</p>
<p>In our study, the primary patency one and three years after infrapopliteal PTA was 82.49% and 57% respectively; Giles at al. reported lower percentages, 53% and 51% at 1 and 2 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574411432161">11</xref></sup> The difference in percentages is probably because the study by Giles et al. included patients mostly from TASC categories C and D; our patients were mostly TASC A and B. As expected, patients who present with more severe CLI, i.e. Fontaine stage 4 or more severe TASC class lesions, or with both, have increased chances of losing primary patency after infrapopliteal angioplasty. Surprisingly, we detected no effect of diabetes mellitus on the preservation of primary patency; however, concomitant carotid stenosis does represent a risk factor for loss of primary patency. Peripheral arterial occlusive disease is associated with varying degrees of arteriosclerotic involvement elsewhere in the body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574411432161">1</xref></sup> The association of carotid stenosis and loss of primary patency represents a group of patients who have more generalized arteriosclerotic lesions, thus are more prone to early re-occlusion.</p>
<p>The association of a postoperative infection on the operated limb and loss of primary patency was also expected. It is generally accepted that it takes more blood flow to heal a lesion than it does to maintain tissue integrity of an ischemic leg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1538574411432161">24</xref></sup> Thus the occurrence of a postoperative infection may represent loss of primary patency, i.e. decrease of the amount of blood flow that reaches the limb. However, these patients may avoid undergoing a major amputation or even return of ischemic symptoms, since there is enough blood flow from collaterals to maintain tissue integrity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1538574411432161">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538574411432161">26</xref></sup> Toward this end, this major advantage of PTA over a bypass surgery, i.e. the preservation of collaterals, favors PTA to be considered the first treatment option in this group of patients.</p>
<p>In our study, limb salvage percentages (91% at 12 months and 84.67% at 36 months) were comparable to previous reports for the effectiveness of PTA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574411432161">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574411432161">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574411432161">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1538574411432161">27</xref></sup> In high-risk patients, the PTA salvage rate obtained in this study is similar to bypass surgery (86% and 78% respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574411432161">1</xref></sup> Diabetes mellitus was found to increase the risk of a major amputation, despite the fact that it had no affect on primary patency. Diabetic patients usually have severe calcifications of the crural arteries extending to the pedal arches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1538574411432161">28</xref></sup> Thus, dilatation of a proximal lesion, i.e. on the peroneal artery, may not be sufficient in salvaging the ischemic limb when the distal arteries, i.e. pedal arches, are severely diseased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574411432161">3</xref></sup> Preservation of primary patency following infrapopliteal PTA is not necessarily associated with limb salvage in diabetic patients.</p>
<p>Moreover, patients who presented preoperatively with ulcer and/or gangrene of the ischemic limb or presented an infection of the operated limb postoperatively, had increased risk of needing a major amputation. Also, the need for a major amputation was found to be associated with the severity of preoperative limb ischemia (Fontaine stage) and the severity of atherosclerotic lesions (TASC class). PTA or any other surgical intervention does not always restore normal circulation to an ischemic limb.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574411432161">1</xref></sup> Thus it is highly probable that the restored blood flow to an ischemic limb will not be sufficient to allow healing of a preoperative ulcer or a postoperative infection, especially in patients with extensive atherosclerotic lesions who suffer from severe limb ischemia. However this statement does not negate the advantages of PTA, i.e. that it is a minimally invasive procedure with a decreased perioperative risk for elderly patients with severe co-morbidities. The goal in this group of patients is to attempt an intervention that palliates their symptoms and possibly prevents a major functional impairment, i.e. a major amputation, with minimal surgical risk, rather than to restore normal circulation with high surgical risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574411432161">1</xref></sup> Toward this end, PTA may represent a better treatment option than bypass surgery, since it may achieve limb salvage with less surgical risk.</p>
<p>Finally, some authors have advocated the use of stents in infrapopliteal angioplasty, in order to improve its outcomes. In our study we did not use stenting. The use of bare stents in infrapopliteal PTA is associated with a high re-stenosis and occlusion rate in 6 months. In a small series of patients, the newer drug-eluting stents have shown a promising re-stenosis rate of zero percent in 6 months compared to standard stents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1538574411432161">29</xref></sup> The newer stents, however, are expensive and their clinical benefit should first be evaluated in comparison with standard PTA.</p>
<p>A point of criticism in this study could be that 71.3% of the patients included were subjected to a concomitant PTA of femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal arteries, resulting in a bias of mixed effects. We did not detect, however, any significant difference in primary patency preservation or limb salvage preservation between patients undergoing only infrapopliteal PTA and patients undergoing both femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal PTA. We attribute this to the minor femoropopliteal lesions of these patients, which caused less than 50% stenosis of the lumen, and could not be responsible for their symptoms. Our choice was to treat the lesions of the femoral or/and popliteal arteries solely with PTA, without using any stent, because --given the progressive nature of peripheral arterial occlusive disease—these lesions would cause symptoms later on. Further study, in a larger population, is needed to determine the net effect of infrapopliteal PTA in patients with CLI.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Infrapopliteal PTA is a safe, successful and effective technique for lesions causing critical limb ischemia. PTA has favorable long-term results for primary patency preservation and limb salvage, and a high survival rate. Preoperative Fontaine stage, TASC class and occurrence of a postoperative infection of the operated limb are independent risk factors of loss of primary patency and need for major amputation. Concomitant carotid stenosis is associated with increased risk of primary patency loss. Preoperative ulcer, gangrene and diabetes mellitus represent risk factors for major amputation.</p>
