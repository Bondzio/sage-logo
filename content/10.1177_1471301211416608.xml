<abstract>
<p>A literature review highlighted the importance of understanding the subjective experience of spirituality and dementia. Two research aims were identified: to build an understanding of how older people's experience of spirituality, religion or faith is affected by having dementia and to understand how the spiritual aspects of their lives affect the experience of dementia. Six older people with mild to moderate dementia were interviewed about their experience of spirituality and dementia. Interview transcripts were analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. Five superordinate themes were identified: experience of faith; searching for meaning in dementia; ‘I'm not as I was’ – changes and losses in experience of the self; staying intact; and current pathways to spiritual connection and expression. The results offered a unique perspective on the experience of spirituality and dementia, uniting themes from both research and theory concerning the experience of the self and the experience of spirituality in dementia.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1471301211416608"><title>The context of person-centred care</title>
<p>There is now common acceptance that the experience of dementia arises out of the interaction between neurological, psychological and social factors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211416608">Bender &amp; Cheston, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211416608">Department of Health, 2009</xref>) and that helping people to live well with dementia involves attending to all these elements. A central theme in the care of people with dementia is the importance of preserving their personhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211416608">Kitwood, 1997</xref>). In practical terms, this means supporting people to live in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, such that they remain in connection with their own lives and resources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211416608">O'Connor et al. (2007)</xref> conceptualize the research on personhood as being covered by three intersecting domains: subjective experience, the interactional environment and the socio-cultural context.</p>
<p>Research into the subjective experience of dementia points to a tension between the person with dementia's attempts to preserve their experiences of themselves, and their efforts to adapt to, and assimilate, the effects of dementia (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211416608">Menne, Kinney, &amp; Morhardt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211416608">Beard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211416608">Clare, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211416608">Langdon, Eagle, &amp; Warner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211416608">Pearce, Clare and Pistrang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211416608">Phinney, 2002</xref>). People with dementia and their loved ones are faced with profound losses and it is evident that people with the illness, carers and professionals alike struggle to manage the pain of these losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211416608">O'Connor et al., 2007</xref>). It seems inevitable that, for some, these issues will pertain to questions of spirituality, faith and religion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211416608"><title>Spirituality and dementia</title>
<p>The Mental Health Foundation has developed key recommendations to promote the recognition of the role spirituality in mental health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211416608">Lindridge, 2007</xref>). In this context, ‘spirituality’ is understood as being concerned with what has meaning and value in life, that transcends or expands the boundaries of self, that promotes connection (with one's self, God/higher power, others and the environment) and that promotes reflection on the unfolding of one's life.</p>
<p>There is a small body of literature that considers the spiritual experience and needs of people with dementia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211416608">Stuckey, Post, Ollerton, Fallcreek and Whitehouse (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211416608">Tomkins and Sorrell (2008)</xref> sought views of people with dementia, their carers, clergy and clinicians and found a common thread of concern in helping people with dementia to stay spiritually connected. But what does this mean to people living with dementia? There are few papers that consider the lived experience of religion and spirituality from the perspective of people with dementia themselves. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211416608">Trevitt and MacKinlay (2004</xref>) asked whether people with more advanced memory problems could still engage with, and talk about, spirituality. Their participants talked fully about their early religious activities and how these changed across their lives. There was evidence of continuity in a strong reliance upon religious rituals, religious community and social connection. Many had an ongoing faith in God which gave them strength and a source of meaning in their lives.</p>
<p>Two studies stand out as seeking to identify spiritual or religious themes for people with dementia. In a pilot study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211416608">Snyder (2003</xref>) analysed a diverse range of written and verbal accounts of Alzheimer's disease (AD) sufferers, to identify issues and themes in relation to spirituality and dementia. The four main themes that she identified were: finding meaning in Alzheimer's, the relationship between spirituality and coping with Alzheimer's, the effect of Alzheimer's on faith and the effect of Alzheimer's on spiritual or religious behaviour. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211416608">Katsuno (2003)</xref>, in the USA, sampled 23 older people with dementia. The focus of the study was to determine whether people with dementia turned to religion in the face of cognitive loss and whether this supported quality of life. The results showed that participants had a strong faith in God and that they valued this faith, which sustained them in their everyday lives.</p>
<p>In a recent literature review of spirituality in coping with early-stage AD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211416608">Beuscher and Beck (2008)</xref> reviewed six studies in which spirituality was examined as an aspect of coping with AD. They used the spiritual framework of coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211416608">Gall et al., 2005</xref>) to structure their analysis of the studies. The reviewers identified that the most common stressors within AD were an experience of disconnection from self or from others. These were associated with loss of independence and role/identity, feelings of vulnerability and a loss of an ability to communicate. They found this led to spiritual appraisals such as doubt, the sense of having faith tested and being given an opportunity to rely more fully on God. Coping styles revealed in the reviewed studies were: surrender to God, hope in an afterlife, hope in each moment day-by-day and using spiritual connections such as nature, relationships and God. Coping behaviours highlighted were: prayer, church attendance and, in one case, meditation. The literature reviewed, however, was sparse and relatively diverse and highlights the limited availability of studies available that look at spirituality and coping with AD.</p>
<p>The limited current literature points to a need for a systematic qualitative study into the subjective experience of spirituality and religion in people who have dementia. Two aims were identified for this research. One was to understand the experience of spirituality in the context of living with dementia. The second was to understand the experience of dementia in the context of spiritual belief.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1471301211416608" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<sec id="sec5-1471301211416608"><title>Research design</title>
<p>This was an exploratory study using qualitative data that was analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211416608">Smith &amp; Osborn, 2003</xref>). IPA adopts a phenomenological approach, in that the method is concerned with understanding the meaning of the research topic for individuals. There is the assumption that meaning is derived through the process of a social interaction between the participant and the researcher, in which both are engaged in a process of reflection on the subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211416608">Smith, 1997</xref>). The person's lived experience is thought to be not necessarily transparent within the data, but is sought through an analytical process on the part of the researcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211416608">Smith, Jarman, &amp; Osborn, 1999</xref>). The researcher therefore plays an active role in the research process, first through co-creating the social interaction within which the data are gathered, and then through interpreting the data to arrive at a set of themes and reasoned conclusions.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1471301211416608"><title>Recruitment and participants</title>
<p>Inclusion criteria for participants:
<list id="list1-1471301211416608" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>To be aged 60 years old or over.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To have received a diagnosis of dementia, of which they were aware.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To identify themselves as having a religious or spiritual life that predated the onset of dementia.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To consider themselves able to have an in-depth conversation about what their religious or spiritual life meant to them, in the context of having dementia. It was anticipated that this would lead to recruiting participants in the mild to moderate stages of dementia but no standardized cognitive test was carried out to confirm this.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To be able to give informed consent to take part in the research.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>A poster advertising the research was distributed widely in an area of southern England and was followed up with an information sheet, which was given to interested parties. Recruitment was attempted through the Alzheimer's Society, a very wide range of religious communities and institutions and an NHS mental health Trust. Six participants were recruited; Given that IPA focuses on an in-depth analysis of all data to interpret the meanings of the research topic to individuals, this relatively small sample size was considered sufficient to gain a rich picture of the experience of spirituality and dementia.</p>
<p>The personal details of the participants have been disguised here to protect their identities. Five of the group were aged in their seventies and one was in her nineties. Five were female and one was male. Four of the people were Christian and two had belief systems linked to eastern philosophies. In terms of dementia, three had Alzheimer's Disease and three had vascular dementia or a mixed diagnosis. Two of the people with AD were taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The length of time living with cognitive problems ranged from six months to three years and the length of time since diagnosis ranged from three months to two years. Four of the people lived in their own homes (three alone and one with her husband); one person lived semi-independently in warden-assisted accommodation and one lived in a care home because of physical needs. All the participants came from professional backgrounds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211416608"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>Demographic data were collected within a preliminary structured interview with the participant and a relative or carer. This preliminary interview also allowed for the development of rapport and a careful examination of the consent form, ensuring that the participant understood the research and was able to give informed consent to participate.</p>
<p>Qualitative data were collected in a semi-structured interview with the participant. This interview took the form of a guided conversation on the subjects of their spiritual/religious life and experience of dementia. The interviewer attempted to take the position of a curious and empathic enquirer, seeking to understand the person's experiences. One participant elected for his wife to be included in the main research interview.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1471301211416608"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The analysis of the data was primarily carried out by the first author (PD), and closely followed the guidance of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211416608">Smith, Jarman and Osborn (1999)</xref> on conducting IPA. The analysis was also influenced by the ideas of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211416608">Mauthner and Doucet (1998</xref>) on how to keep respondents’ voices and perspectives alive in the process of qualitative analysis. The steps taken in data analysis are described below:
<list id="list2-1471301211416608" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Reading and re-reading the transcript, noting down thoughts, associations and potential theme ideas.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pulling out themes, which were noted down. Any reflections or explanatory notes in relation to the themes were also recorded.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The themes were then gathered and those that seemed to have something in common were clustered together.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Using the clustered themes either a case study or a shorter personal summary was written for each participant. The pieces of writing later supported the process of keeping the individual voices of participants alive within the presentation of group results.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>After analysing the data for four participants, themes that were common across the group were identified. Earlier analyses influenced the detection of themes in analysis of the subsequent transcripts.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1471301211416608"><title>Quality issues</title>
<p>The validity of interpretations was monitored by a number of means. The researcher discussed the analysis with one of the other authors (DS), in particular discussing the analysis of the first transcript in depth. A credibility check was carried out on the analysis of the second transcript by a psychologist who was also conducting research in the field of experience of dementia. The psychologist was given the annotated transcript, table of themes and case study for the second participant. She found that there was a clear audit trail through the materials given and she found the resulting themes plausible.</p>
<p>The researcher endeavoured to check that her empathic understanding of the participants was accurate within the interviews and, after the interview, tried to stay close to the participant and that empathic understanding through the use of reflective notes, repeated re-reading of the interview transcript and ‘telling the story’ of the participant through the case studies or summaries. For ethical reasons, it was considered to be inappropriate to ask the participants to comment directly on the analyses.</p>
<p>It was important that the principle researcher's personal perspective on the research topic was owned and transparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211416608">Elliot, Fischer &amp; Rennie, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211416608">Stiles, 1993</xref>). The researcher acknowledged a spiritual perspective on life based in Buddhist philosophy and practice. She had an interest in the way spiritual experience and connection may change through life and, in particular, how painful life experiences can inhibit or thwart a person's capacity to feel connected spiritually. The researcher works as a clinical psychologist in older people's mental health services and is particularly concerned with the importance of listening to the views and stories of people living with dementia.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1471301211416608"><title>1. Experience of faith</title>
<p>The first superordinate theme describes participants’ relationship to spirituality and to God or the divine. All the participants described an experience of faith that was a living and active part of their lives. This seemed to contribute to their sense of themselves as a person.</p>
<p><italic>Continuity.</italic> This subordinate theme highlights the sense of continuity felt by participants in their experience of faith, or their relationship with God, over time.</p>
<p>Two people communicated the way in which their faith had been consistent through the spiritual activity of their lives, and that it continued into the present.
<disp-quote>
<p>I know that my work is finished, my practical work is finished but my spiritual work is certainly not stopped. (Gwen)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Four people spoke of there being continuity of their experience of faith, despite memory problems. Although there were other parts of the interviews that indicated discontinuities and changes due to memory problems, it seemed that there was something in their relationship with God that was essential and dependable:
<disp-quote>
<p>Researcher: What about your experience of your meditation, and your relationship with God, has that changed as you've got Alzheimers […]?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1471301210416608">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Alma: No. I don't think it's changed because we've always been close.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Relationship with God or Divine Force.</italic> All the participants spoke about their relationship and communication with God or the Divine Force This was a central element of their experience of faith:
<disp-quote>
<p>I get a kind of knowing and I know it's not me […] So it's sheer joy! (Breda)</p>
<p>I always believe and I pray ‘please. Lord, help me’. (Jeannie)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For two people, the experience of conversion to Christianity, and the personal contact with God or Jesus Christ that this implied, was central to their faith:
<disp-quote>
<p>I felt that God, it's difficult to explain but God spoke to me and that […] I should be a Christian […] it did react to me, then, and it's been like that ever since. (Gwen)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Greater meaning.</italic> A key element of faith described by four of the participants was a belief in a greater meaning to life, which, for three of these people, also had an element of the unknown or inexpressible:
<disp-quote>
<p>I saw […] if you had a strong faith and a strong feeling there was something more after this life, though you can't describe and you have no idea what it is, you've got something to hang on to… and that was quite important to me as I grew up […] Although sometimes you faltered quite a bit when you saw the suffering that some people went through. (Christine)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Four people spoke about believing there was some purpose or reason for their own life and their continued existence. Alma's statement ‘If I'm still here, there must be a purpose’ was virtually echoed by Christine and Breda. Alma and Breda both believed that the purpose of life was to learn particular lessons and ‘develop the soul’ (Breda), so that all that happened in life presented opportunities for development. Breda called this ‘the spiritual plan’. Gwen believed that God revealed to people ‘what He wants them to be’ and that she had lived her life doing what God had asked of her.</p>
<p><italic>Thoughts about dying.</italic> Belief in a greater meaning led Alma and Gwen to thoughts about dying. Of all the participants, these two had lived with dementia for the longest. They were both striking to the researcher for being positive, ‘upbeat’ individuals with a lot of humour and love of life, so it was clear that thoughts of dying did not stem from depression. Yet they were both waiting for ‘the next level’ (Alma) or to ‘be with the Lord’’ (Gwen):
<disp-quote>
<p>Alma: […] I can't wait, I can't wait to get there. (Laughs) It's not a nice thing to say, especially when someone is looking after you, but did I tell you about my grandma?</p>
<p>Researcher: Yes, that she thought heaven would be a beautiful place.</p>
<p>Alma: Yes, so I'm waiting, I've had a good life.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Not separate from life.</italic> Four of the participants communicated that their spiritual life was not separate from life. In this way, their experience of spirituality seemed to be woven into the fabric of their life, part of them, and therefore dependable and sure. For some people, this emerged when the researcher asked about the supports that they might need to live their spiritual life:
<disp-quote>
<p>Researcher: Do you need support or help to have the spiritual parts of your life?</p>
<p>Alma: Erm, no, it's sort of my natural inheritance.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Gwen and Peter communicated how their spiritual life was not separate from their lives because they had devoted themselves to living out and sharing their Christian values.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1471301211416608"><title>2. Searching for meaning in dementia</title>
<p>This theme is concerned with individuals trying to make sense of having dementia in the light of their spiritual beliefs and experience. For two participants, the belief that everything had a ‘greater meaning’ seemed to lead to a process of questioning concerning the meaning of having dementia. There were two subordinate themes.</p>
<p><italic>Spiritual challenge.</italic> Christine and Breda seemed to experience having dementia as a spiritual challenge. They were struggling to answer spiritual questions in relation to having dementia. These were questions such as ‘why me?’, ‘will I cope?’ and ‘what do I have to learn or develop at this point in my life?’ The questions were considered ‘spiritual’ because they were asked in the light of the participants’ beliefs and relationship with God/ the Divine. The questions were difficult to answer and seemed to present the participants with a spiritual challenge, which sometimes left them uncertain and distressed:
<disp-quote>
<p>[…] sometimes I think to myself, ‘but my faith should be that whatever happens, God will look after me’ and then sometimes my faith wavers, thinking ‘who is looking after me?’ you know. (Christine)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Christine and Breda had both become aware of cognitive problems about a year ago and had been diagnosed with dementia within the year. They also had in common good physical health and the continuing endeavour to live independently.</p>
<p><italic>Developing compassion.</italic> Both participants spoke of the way in which having dementia led them to a greater understanding of others with problems, and to development of compassion. This was a particularly strong theme for Breda. In the context of Breda's spiritual belief, asking ‘why have I got this?’ represented a search for understanding about what lesson she needed to learn from the experience of dementia. She felt that she had a lack of compassion through experiences of having to be tough and get on with life during the war years. Experiencing the need for compassion was now her opportunity to develop the quality:
<disp-quote>
<p>And I've had to go through this, I think so that I have a better understanding and develop compassion, I haven't got much. […] so what's happened very recently is seeing why I had to have this in the life plan so I could develop more. (Breda)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In summary, these two participants seemed to be describing their ‘spiritual work in progress’.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1471301211416608"><title>3. ‘I'm not as I was’: Changes and losses in experience of the self</title>
<p>This superordinate theme describes the way in which the cognitive impairments of dementia impacted upon participants’ experiences of themselves and on their relationships with others. The participants communicated a sense of discontinuity or change in the self and in their relationships with others. These discontinuities were communicated through narrative and metaphor and carried emotional tones ranging from poignancy to much stronger expressions of sadness, loss and frustration. As this theme is strongly concerned with experience of the self, it inevitably incorporated discontinuities in aspects of the participants’ spiritual experience, particularly in how they were able to live out or express their spirituality. This theme was evidenced by five of the six participants.</p>
<p><italic>Changed experience of self.</italic> This subordinate theme describes the way in which participants felt themselves to be limited and impeded by their cognitive impairments and how this affected their experience of themselves. The theme was named with the words that seemed to lie behind much of what Christine spoke of during her interview: ‘I'm not as I was’. As analysis continued, it became apparent that there was a similar such phrase that described each person's own perspective on their changed experience of themselves. With a changed experience of self came a sense of loss and, to varying degrees, an effect upon the way people experienced, practised or expressed their spirituality.</p>
<p>Christine described how she experienced constant frustrations due to forgetting, which together added up to be a problem that made her lose confidence:
<disp-quote>
<p>I'm not suggesting I was super-duper, but I could, you know, and now I've lost a lot of confidence because of this problem. (Christine)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Alma described her loss with the intriguing metaphor of being ‘like a parcel’:
<disp-quote>
<p>[…] sometimes now, I feel like a parcel, being passed to one another and I haven't got any control over it, in a way. I mean it's voting time, isn't it? […] And I can't understand, I can't go out and do that. And when my post comes and it tells me certain things, […] I read them and I put them on the table for B [daughter] to read. (Alma)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>With the image of the parcel, Alma communicated her loss of agency and independence as a person: she was unable to act for herself in some things but felt passed around between the people who could help her. A parcel is something that is wrapped-up – what is inside is hidden, unseen and unexpressed. It communicated that Alma experienced herself as the same person ‘inside’, as it were, but she was no longer able to act or express herself in the same way because of the restraining, limiting nature of Alzheimer's Disease. At the same time, a parcel is an inanimate object, so Alma also seemed to be communicating a sense in which she felt less of a person in the social world. Alma also spoke of ‘feeling like a parcel’ in relation to her spiritual life:
<disp-quote>
<p>Alma: You look out there and you think, well […] what's behind the clouds?</p>
<p>Researcher: I can see that you are still excited by life, even at this stage in your life.</p>
<p>Alma: To a certain amount, although as I said, now I feel a bit more like a parcel.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For Breda and Gwen, this theme focused on what they were not able to do, particularly in relation to their spiritual life. Loss of cognitive function had fundamentally changed Breda's experience of spirituality as she found that she was no longer able to focus in the way that was needed for spiritual healing work. She also stopped experiencing knowledge coming into her from the Divine. No longer able to rely on her memory, which had always been reliable, she felt that everything was taken from her:
<disp-quote>
<p>Breda: […] so that I couldn't answer things that I knew I knew! I couldn't bring them in! It sounds strange, but I, but they would not come in. And I knew I knew.</p>
<p>Researcher: And how did that affect you?</p>
<p>Breda: It took me by surprise. Then I realised I couldn't do the work anymore and […] that I was spiralling downwards.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Gwen found that her forgetfulness affected her ability to read the Bible and pray, which were essential daily practices to her as a Christian:
<disp-quote>
<p>Researcher: So you […] read your Bible?</p>
<p>Gwen: Now that's, I'm having trouble with that because I keep forgetting.</p>
<p>Researcher: Is it that you forget to read it or you forget what you've read?</p>
<p>Gwen: A bit of both, really, a bit of both. […] I can't keep up with myself.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Changed relationships with others and social isolation.</italic> This subordinate theme summarizes the way in which participants experienced themselves as having a changed position in the social world. These changes included increased dependence, a decreased capacity to help others and, for one person, increasing conflict with others and a sense of being under threat.</p>
<p>Alma and Gwen talked about their increased dependence. Both had close relationships with their daughters, upon whom they relied implicitly:
<disp-quote>
<p>She keeps an eye on me and she wonders about things. Because she's been very good to me and if I need anything or ask her anything she'll tell me. (Gwen)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Five people spoke of their reduced ability to help others, either practically, through spiritual healing, or through sharing their faith:
<disp-quote>
<p>I hate to think that people think I am no longer reliable, but they could be forgiven for thinking that, because, […] if there's something someone's asked me to do and I might forget to do it. (Christine)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Cutting down on social contact and a degree of social isolation was mentioned by three people. For Christine, there was also a strong element of feeling socially inhibited:
<disp-quote>
<p>I used to go to classes and that sort of thing. I wouldn't go now, but if I did I wouldn't take part in the discussion because I'd be worried that I would be saying something that somebody had already said, so that socially […] is inhibiting. (Christine)</p>
<p>I've even let the friends go. It was all too much. (Breda)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1471301211416608"><title>4. Staying intact</title>
<p>The fourth theme describes the means by which the participants both consciously and subconsciously sought to maintain their sense of self or integrity, in the face of the challenges and changes described above. It seemed that, by a range of means, the participants and their families were engaged in a process of trying hold onto the person they knew and keep them intact, in the face of dementia. All of the participants evidenced at least some of the four subordinate themes within this superordinate theme.</p>
<p><italic>Coping strategies.</italic> This subordinate theme covers the strategies for coping with dementia mentioned by the participants. As this was not really a focus of the interview, it may be that other strategies were being used that were not mentioned. Four people talked about coping strategies. Some of these were practical, such as Alma's use of routines and visual cues, Christine's efforts to organize her belongings and Gwen's engagement in activities:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think it's the best thing to do to try and keep it [i.e. memory] as much as possible and to get into activities, Christian activities, like, today, they're going to, downstairs in the open area, of the flats, they're going to have a small Christian service, which I'm hoping to go to. (Gwen)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Christine talked about ways in which she tried to cope emotionally, by managing how she thought about her problems (‘I keep telling myself none of this is important’) and the way she tried to hide her problems from others. These strategies seemed to reflect her early stage of trying to come to terms with her diagnosis.</p>
<p>Gwen seemed to cope by having an ‘outward-looking’ and spiritual focus on life, concerning herself more for others than for her own troubles or discomforts:
<disp-quote>
<p>[After talking about persecution of Christians around the world] And then I come back to my situation here and I think well, look at people like that, things like terrible goings-on there and here I am, sitting here, nothing to worry about, it's all quiet. (Gwen)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Four participants showed a degree of acceptance, which seemed to help them:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well if I've got Alzheimers there's nothing I can do about it, is there? Just make the best of it. I just go along with it, you know, whatever it is. (Alma)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Keeping hopeful.</italic> For some people, it seemed important to find hope in relation to the dementia and its progression. Three people spoke of what gave them hope specifically in relation to their memory problems. For Gwen and Christine, this was taking the prescribed medication and for Breda, it was becoming aware of the ‘Divine Plan’ and the greater meaning behind having memory problems:
<disp-quote>
<p>Gwen: […] I think I showed you the pills I take. I still, well I think it's the best thing to do to try and keep it as much as possible.</p>
<p>I think I'm lucky in that, you know, the big plan, I can't help but see every now and again. And it gives reinforcement and hope. (Breda)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Recollecting self.</italic> This theme describes the way in which four participants remembered themselves and their lives, were remembered by others and had reminders of themselves and people close to them in their environment. The theme name emerged during analysis of Alma's transcript as it seemed as if she was collecting herself together as a human being through the act of remembering and reminding herself of who she was, her strengths and characteristics. It is interesting to note that the people who did not contribute evidence for this theme were Christine and Breda, who seemed very concerned with a search for meaning in their current circumstances and less inclined to reminisce. The remaining four participants all reminisced and told stories about themselves in a way that seemed to help them preserve the persons they felt themselves to be. Sometimes these stories followed discussions about the difficulties and challenges of having dementia, as if in compensation. In the following example, Peter had been talking about his travels in the Far East:
<disp-quote>
<p>Peter: Thailand had a very small church and […] on Easter Sunday there was twenty-five (voice breaks) baptised. We were there for that. It was quite exciting to see churches developing.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Researcher: So it gave you a lot of pleasure to see the churches grow.</p>
<p>Peter: Yeah the people going into the water to be baptised.</p>
<p>Researcher: Yeah. And when you think back on those times now, what do you think about?</p>
<p>Peter: I think I'm just amazed that these people, you know, came to Christianity through the missionaries.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It was moving to note how Peter's lucidity and eloquence seemed to increase when he was talking about his past. It was also noticeable that his wife encouraged him in the act of remembering.</p>
<p>Alma and Gwen both had physical reminders of themselves and their family in their home.
<disp-quote>
<p>[…] if I didn't see a thing I wouldn't know I had it. So it's kind of company for me, somehow. (Alma)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Family relationships and context.</italic> This subordinate theme describes the way in which participants lived out their experience of dementia in the context of their families. It is as if the person is held intact and held in place partly through their place in their families and through those relationships. The shifting balance of these relationships was evident as participants were becoming dependent upon their loved ones, and the love and support that was part of the participants’ lives was moving to witness.</p>
<p>Five of the six participants spoke of, or showed, the support that they received currently and, in some cases, the support they anticipated. One person spoke of her fear of being left alone. Some also spoke of the generations that had gone before them, as if recalling the thread of connection running through the family generations and holding them in place within the family. In all this, they communicated how their family relationships, past, present and future, helped them to hold themselves together as a person:
<disp-quote>
<p>Alma: We've just had a new baby in the family, that's nice. And I'm very close to one of my grandsons. Next to the lamp, that's him.</p>
<p>Researcher: Oh yes.</p>
<p>Alma: He's very like his father. I'll tell you this. I don't think B minds. [Tells the story of how her son-in-law died]. We've always looked after each other.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The way in which Alma and Gwen relied on their daughters has already been mentioned. In the extract below, Christine communicates how her symptoms were lived in the context of her relationship with her husband:
<disp-quote>
<p>My husband bears the worst of my frustrations, because I can get quite bad tempered with it […]. He is quite understanding about that, but not everyone is. (Christine)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Peter also showed the importance of his wife's support through his inclusion of her in the interview. It was striking to see how she spoke for him at times and how they communicated their shared stories of their life together.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1471301211416608"><title>5. Current pathways to spiritual connection and expression</title>
<p>This theme describes the ways in which the participants lived their spiritual lives and maintained spiritual connections within their current circumstances. Participants were clearly making adaptations in how they lived out and expressed their spirituality, so this theme covers the spiritual pathways that they were still able to maintain. The importance of this is that they were continuing to live out such central aspects of themselves and their lives, whilst having dementia. Sometimes they needed the support of others to do this (e.g. Jeannie needed someone to take her to church) or they struggled to meet their own standards (e.g. Gwen and her Bible reading).</p>
<p><italic>Spiritual values.</italic> All six people communicated their spiritual values, which were sustained through the experience of dementia, even if the practical ways in which they were lived out were changing. These could broadly be summed up as love, service or giving and, for some, sharing one's faith:
<disp-quote>
<p>What I've learned through this life? (…). Whatever you give out, you get back somehow. But it's got to be genuine. (Alma)</p>
<p>Researcher: So you tried to share your Christianity?</p>
<p>Gwen: Yes I did, I did […]. It was something really strong in me and that I felt I should share, like I'm sharing to you.</p>
<p>Researcher: So what about these days, Gwen, how do you live out your Christianity now?</p>
<p>Gwen: mm. I still try to do it the same way.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These spiritual values seemed to contribute to the person's sense of identity and continuity over time. There was an emphasis on wanting to help others.</p>
<p><italic>Positive attitudes.</italic> Throughout the interviews, the participants communicated a number of positive attitudes that lay behind the way they lived their lives and seemed to emerge from faith and spiritual values. Sometimes they mentioned these, but more often they simply exemplified or expressed them. These were counting blessings, humour, curiosity, hope, receptivity, gratitude, appreciation of beauty and appreciation of the present:
<disp-quote>
<p>But then I've had so many blessings you see. I've got a nice home and lovely family and you can't help getting old. (Alma)</p>
<p>[…] and when you see the sunshine it's lovely to see it and say thank you for the sun, thank you for the rain also, without the rain the flowers wouldn't grow. (Jeannie)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Spiritual community.</italic> Four people talked about their engagement with spiritual communities and the support they gained from this. This included actual contact with communities through attendance at church, but also connections through networks of prayer and being kept informed of activities within the wider spiritual community of which the person was part. It could be said that this subordinate theme also played a strong role in keeping the person intact, as in the fourth superordinate theme. It seemed as if the spiritual communities were supporting and helping to sustain the individuals.
<disp-quote>
<p>Researcher: What's important to you about going to church?</p>
<p>Peter: Er, the fellowship with the other members.</p>
<p>Peter's wife: In fact, […] was telling me they put you on the prayer list at his church. So they're praying for you, so that's good.</p>
<p>Researcher: So there's a whole network of prayer going on.</p>
<p>Peter: Yes.</p>
<p>Researcher: Does that give you strength, do you think?</p>
<p>Peter: Yes I think so, that, you know, going up day by day.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Gwen spoke of the monthly newsletter and requests for prayer that she received from her Christian Mission:
<disp-quote>
<p>Gwen: […] It's a nice warm, what I would call, spirituality, you know, we know each other.</p>
<p>Researcher: Yeah, a community.</p>
<p>Gwen: Yeah, a community, we know each other. We have people in, all over the place. […] So you can read this and you can pray for the people they talk in here. It works it works! [both laugh] Yes! Yes! It's great!</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Having temporarily lost contact with her spiritual peers, Breda had come across a local church from which she gained practical and spiritual support:
<disp-quote>
<p>Breda: […] One or two churches might be alive, and I've found one that is absolutely full up to the brim! Stunning, a church, full! I was so overjoyed.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Jeannie liked to hear Christian teachings at church:
<disp-quote>
<p>Jeannie: Sometimes you think ‘oh dear it is a bit of a struggle’, but you feel very elated when you go, I do, I feel very elated.</p>
<p>Researcher: What is it about going to church that uplifts you?</p>
<p>Jeannie: Well you know that you've been listening to God's word, God's message and some of the Pastors […] are extremely good, and teach you, well you learn a lot.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Spiritual practices.</italic> Four people spoke of the more personal spiritual practices they engaged in. These included meditation, prayer, reading the Bible or other spiritual materials and listening to religious stories or teachings.</p>
<p>Alma spoke of meditation, which stood in contrast to Breda's experience of no longer being able to focus her mind for spiritual healing.
<disp-quote>
<p>I do a meditation in bed every morning. […] You shut your eyes and you see the light. You hold it between your two eyebrows and then it travels down and every bit of your body, it sort of clears and nourishes you. You get this sort of peaceful feeling. (Alma)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Jeannie, Gwen and Peter spoke of reading the Bible and prayer:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have quite a few Bibles, nice Bibles, and it is easy to read those so I read those and I pray, so it's not as though I'm not, you know, believing. (Jeannie)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Peter and Peter's wife described a daily practice of Bible readings and prayer for others that they carried out together. Reading spiritual material was also a daily practice for Alma. In addition, all participants except Breda mentioned talking to God in a personal and informal way. Some of the quotes already given in the sections above illustrate this.</p>
<p><italic>Connections with people.</italic> All of the participants spoke of ways in which their connections with others helped them to express their spirituality or to feel connected spiritually. Alma and Gwen spoke of helping others, thinking of them and praying for them as means of spiritual expression. Christine also implied that helping people was a strong part of her lived spirituality. For Alma, this took the form of charitable giving:
<disp-quote>
<p>I used to do yoga and now I've got a couple of charities I support, teaching yoga, to keep a teacher going in prisons for younger people, teenagers (…). They're at a time in their life that they're shut up in prison for doing bad things and it's the only time they've had, quite, to think about themselves. (Alma)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For Gwen, her connection to others was through her Christian Mission and monthly newsletter, which asked her to think of, and pray for, people in different parts of the world. Both Alma and Gwen seemed to think about the generations that would come after them, which Gwen articulated:
<disp-quote>
<p>Gwen: And what's lovely, it's the people like me are retiring and getting Alzheimer's and all the rest, at home. All these other people are queuing up waiting to go. So it's a big cycle.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Three people talked about how the understanding and support of others helped them to be spiritually connected. Christine and Breda particularly mentioned the value of being understood. For Christine this allowed her to be more at peace with herself and for Breda, it gave her hope:
<disp-quote>
<p>Breda: I mean, thank goodness this girl actually listens! They don't all listen. Researcher: and that made a difference? Breda: Oh! Yes. Because […] she just listened, […] I was so lucky to get her. Because she gave me hope, without knowing it.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Jeannie talked about the practical and emotional help she gained from friends at church.
<disp-quote>
<p>[…] and if I was stuck for anything, you know, I would ask him, or I would ask [my friend] or you know the pastor, somebody who knew and somebody who was open and clean in their heart. (Jeannie)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Gwen and Peter spoke of the value of simply being in touch with people and meeting people. Interestingly, these two lived in more communal settings than the other participants, and as a result perhaps suffered less from social isolation.</p>

<sec id="sec16-1471301211416608" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="sec17-1471301211416608"><title>The lived experience of spirituality and dementia</title>
<p>At the outset of this research, two main aims were identified: to understand the experience of spirituality in the context of living with dementia and to understand the experience of dementia in the context of spiritual belief. The research identified five superordinate themes. These are ‘experience of faith’, ‘searching for meaning in dementia’, ‘I'm not as I was: Changes and losses in experience of the self’, ‘staying intact’ and ‘current pathways to spiritual connection and expression’. The relationship between the themes is illustrated visually in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1471301211416608">Figure 1</xref>. These findings resonate with previous research findings in emphasizing the ongoing importance of faith and spirituality for people living with dementia, as well as the need to modify or adapt spiritual behaviours and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211416608">Katsuno, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211416608">Snyder, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211416608">Trevitt and MacKinlay, 2004</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-1471301211416608" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>A diagrammatic illustration of the relationship between the superordinate themes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1471301211416608-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The first theme – experience of faith – describes the spiritual beliefs and relationship to the sacred that people brought through their lives to their current life stage. It can be understood as an introduction to these older people and their spiritual lives. Their faith stood at the centre of their experience and reached into many aspects of their lives. In the diagram, the experience of faith is shown as being at the heart of the experience of dementia. It is as if the experience of faith were a lens through which the experience of dementia was viewed. There were central aspects to the experience of faith that had stability and continuity over time for the participants, sustained even in the face of dementia.</p>
<p>Three superordinate themes describe the experience of dementia in the context of faith or spiritual belief. These are illustrated as elements of the experience of dementia, encircling the experience of faith. Some people were searching to make sense of having dementia in the light of their spiritual belief. In the diagram, a two-way relationship between ‘experience of faith’ and ‘searching for meaning in dementia’ is depicted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211416608">Snyder (2003</xref>) also found evidence for a search for meaning in dementia in a third of her participants. She also found that some people felt spiritually disillusioned by having AD and others felt that having dementia made their faith stronger. Neither of these polarities was found in the current research. However, less extreme versions of these sentiments were evident, as people were seen to be in an ongoing process of living their faith in the context of having dementia.</p>
<p>Another powerful aspect of the experience of dementia was that of the losses and changes in the experience of self, described by the sentiment ‘I'm not as I was’. In response to these losses and changes arose the activity described in the theme ‘staying intact’, whereby the person and their loved ones worked on enabling the person with dementia to maintain their integrity as a person. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1471301211416608">Figure 1</xref> depicts a two-way relationship between these two themes, as the losses felt in relation to the self prompted activity around ‘staying intact’ and, in turn, such activity influenced the experience of losses and changes in the self.</p>
<p>A number of qualitative studies have also identified subjective experience of loss or change in relation to the self in people with mild to moderate dementia. (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211416608">Beard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211416608">Clare, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211416608">Clare, Rowlands, Bruce, Surr, &amp; Downs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211416608">Menne et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211416608">Pearce et al., 2002</xref>). These studies also identified strategies for maintaining continuity in the sense of self, such as emotional coping strategies, practical strategies, reliance on spouses, reliance on medication and services, helping others or being of use and appreciating the good things in life. In particular, the emphasis upon helping others as a means of preserving continuity of the self in the context of dementia is striking. In the current study, helping others was seen as an important part of people's spirituality.</p>
<p>Turning to the experience of spirituality in the context of living with dementia, changing cognitive capacities and a changing sense of self influenced the ways in which the participants could live out their spirituality. In most cases, the participants continued to find ways to connect spiritually and express their spirituality. Similar ways of connecting spiritually have been identified by other researchers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211416608">Snyder (2003</xref>) found that people had to modify their religious behaviours as a result of AD but that prayer was a strong practice for many. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211416608">Trevitt and MacKinlay (2004)</xref> found that family relationships were an important source of meaning and spiritual connection for their participants.</p>
<p>In the diagram, the theme of ‘continued pathways to spiritual connection and expression’ is shown as an interface between the experience of faith and the experience of dementia. This illustrates the way in which the spiritual pathways were an expression of the experience of faith but were also influenced by the experience of dementia. Some of the spiritual pathways also contributed to the activity of ‘staying intact’, influenced the experience of self and contributed to the search for meaning in relation to dementia; hence the relationships are once again two-way, illustrated by unfilled block arrows.</p>
<p>Viewed as a whole, the set of themes shows that people living with mild to moderate dementia continued to actively live out their pre-existing spirituality and faith. In some respects, having a faith was a source of comfort, strength and coping strategies as individuals faced the difficulties of having dementia. In particular, the belief in a greater meaning to life and a relationship with God/ the Divine supported acceptance, positive emotions and, in some cases, a positive perspective on the end of life. For some, however, having a faith and believing in a greater meaning brought the challenge of reconciling their beliefs with having dementia. Having a dementia had an impact on the participants’ experience of self, relationships with others and the ways in which they lived out their spirituality.</p>
<p>Within the group studied, it was possible to see individual differences, some of which may have been related to the length of time living with memory problems or diagnosis, to the presence or absence of other health problems and how close to the end of life the person felt themselves to be.</p>

<sec id="sec19-1471301211416608"><title>Recruitment and participant issues</title>
<p>In a qualitative study such as this, one does not seek to find a ‘representative’ group, as the focus of the research is to deepen understanding of phenomena through intensive ideographic study, rather than the development of general laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211416608">de Visser &amp; Smith, 2006</xref>). At the same time, it is important to note the characteristics of the participants and to reflect upon what this may suggest about the contribution of the research to building up a picture of the experience of dementia. It was striking that all the participants came from professional and ‘helping’ backgrounds. It seemed that their having been drawn to helping others within their work was an expression of their spiritual feeling. It may be that their educational background made it easier for the participants to be reflective even in the context of having dementia. The participants were also predominantly white British, although one was Indian British.</p>
<p>It was of interest that nearly all the participants seemed to have a particularly strong spiritual belief, to the extent that two had even worked as missionaries. It may be that, when asked to think about which people might meet the criteria for the research, colleagues thought of their most religious or spiritually-inclined clients. This may give some explanation as to why the current participants did not express extreme feelings of spiritual doubt or disillusionment, in contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211416608">Snyder's (2003</xref>) findings. Given the links with previous research, it seems likely that the themes will have relevance to people of differing levels of spiritual commitment, although emphases in individual meanings and strength of feeling around particular issues may vary.</p>

<sec id="sec20-1471301211416608"><title>Implications for dementia care services and pastoral care</title>
<p>The results show that people living with dementia seek to retain continuity in their spiritual lives and in their sense of self, whilst also adapting as they can to having dementia. It was apparent that a range of strategies for coping with dementia contributed towards participants staying intact as persons. The results also highlighted the spiritual importance of contact with people, being listened to and being understood. In contrast to this, participants spoke of the deleterious effect of losing social contacts and feeling socially isolated. This suggests that people in the early to mid stages of dementia will benefit from the simple opportunity to talk and be listened to in an open, reflective and non-judgemental context and, for those who wish it, within the context of their spiritual tradition.</p>
<p>The results support the value of helping people with dementia to stay involved and part of their existing communities – both spiritual and secular. To achieve this, local communities will need guidance in how to receive and help people with dementia. Support and education could be aimed at spiritual communities to guide them in how to continue to minister to people with dementia. The results suggest that appropriate activities may include prayer groups, Bible or scripture readings, religious story telling and general participation in the life of the spiritual community.</p>
<p>The results also point to the great importance of people with dementia having continued opportunities to help others, either through prayer, charitable support, relationships, helping others who also have dementia or other more ‘hands-on’ activities within supportive communities that value the remaining skills that they can offer. It is important for carers (both familiar and professional) of those living with dementia to consider how these people can also continue to care for others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-1471301211416608"><title>Implications for future research</title>
<p>The current research methodology focused entirely on interviews with people living with dementia. Further research could look into the experience of spirituality and dementia by including family and/or spiritual communities (for example ministers, spiritual guides and so on). It would be of value to conduct a more in-depth study looking at the interweaving experience of these three groups, in an effort to understand how to help people with dementia to retain their involvement within spiritual communities.</p>
<p>In addition, more in-depth case studies could be developed from the current research, to deepen understanding of the spiritual, psychological and social processes occurring for individuals at different stages of their journey with dementia and at different stages of later life.</p>
