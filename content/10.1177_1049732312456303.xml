<p>It is a pleasure to review two good books on grounded theory. Both books are great—in different ways and for different audiences. I highlight the strengths of each and explain why and when I would recommend each book.</p>
<p>The <italic>Essentials of Accessible Grounded Theory</italic> is part of a series of concise and comprehensive books that introduce qualitative methods. The title quite well describes the book’s aim: to make this approach understandable to readers, especially novices. This method can seem daunting to anyone new to the language of grounded theory. The accessible format, language, and well-chosen examples allow the novice to get a good feel for this method. The sound advice comes from the authors’ years of experience of clinical practice and research, and Phyllis Stern’s years as an editor.</p>
<p>This is a practical information and guidance book, not a cookbook with detailed step-by-step instructions. For a small book, it covers a lot. Included are descriptions of the background in sociology traditions and theoretical underpinnings that are necessary to understand and effectively use this technique. The book includes important aspects of developing and carrying out a grounded theory study—sampling, coding, memoing, building a conceptual framework, and getting research published. Especially useful for novices is the detailed description of the coding process. Selected, relevant references for further reading and a useful annotated bibliography are other resources provided.</p>
<p>This is the most upbeat and encouraging book I have ever read on research methods. It is friendly, almost folksy, encouraging and inspiring, with appropriate humor: “be of good cheer,” “be interesting,” “be brave” (p. 96). On the other hand, I found the description of Phyllis Stern’s development as a scholar, although interesting, to be of less didactic value, but novices might find it useful. This very readable book leads you along and makes you want to read more on grounded theory. In itself, the book does not provide enough guidance to do a dissertation, nor write a serious grant application, but it clearly meets the goal of the book: it is a concise and comprehensive approach to make grounded theory accessible.</p>
<p><italic>Grounded Theory: A Practical Guide</italic> is comprehensive and covers topics in depth. This book could be used as a text for an introductory class for graduate students. The format is very appealing and useful for teaching; it is well structured and clearly written. Each chapter includes learning objectives, introduction to the chapter, activities, a “window into GT” (grounded theory; well-chosen examples), “working grounded theory” (exercises), critical thinking questions, boxes, bullets, models, and conclusions.</p>
<p>The overview and philosophical grounding are presented as the foundation for the research procedures. The analysis process, often a challenging area for new researchers, is well explained—coding, developing categories, writing memos, exploring links. Readers are encouraged to be flexible and adapt the processes to their unique settings. In the Appendix, a detailed description of a study by one of the authors helps the reader to appreciate the experience of developing a grounded theory project, and the many phases and changes that are often involved.</p>
<p>The major differences in the two books arise from the aims. The Stern and Porr book is like an appetizer—intriguing—and you want more. Birks and Mills’ book is like the main course: filling and satisfying. Both bring together theory and practice, include well-grounded overviews, develop key concepts, and provide practical advice. I would recommend each book to different audiences: Stern and Porr’s book for the novice or the reader who wants a different perspective, and the Birks and Mills book for the graduate student who is ready to start serious grounded theory research. If I were still teaching doctoral nursing and education students, I might have them purchase the Stern and Porr book for an introductory qualitative methods class. For an advanced qualitative research course focusing on grounded theory, I would recommend the Birks and Mills book. Both books are welcome additions to the literature.</p>
