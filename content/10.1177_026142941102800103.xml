<italic>Early Childhood Matters</italic> traces the rapid development of early years education, from the 1990s up to the present time. It provides details of a project called the Effective Pre-school and Primary Education (EPPE) project, which has influenced national policy and practice, making a significant difference to children’s social and intellectual development. The book highlights the importance of the interaction of home and school environments on the progress of young children.</p>
<p>The project:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>provides new evidence of the importance of the influence of early childhood;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>shows how early experiences affect children’s cognitive, social and behavioural development;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>gives guidance with regard to educational policy and young child care; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>examines how the influences of home and school interact to shape educational outcomes.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The editors are both very experienced and expert in the field of early childhood education, and hence they bring deep insight and understanding into the text, making it a vital reference book for all parents, carers, and early years educators. The EPPE project is the first large-scale, longitudinal study to conclusively show not only that pre-school education provides children with a better foundation for more formal schooling, but also that these early years experiences form a lasting influence on children’s lives, especially those children from socially disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
<p>The effect of this early years research led to the UK government’s determination to establish quality pre-school education for all children, resulting in the creation of 3000 children’s centres and centres for parents who are the child’s first educators.</p>
<p>The high commitment of the research team and the rigour and mixed methodology of the actual research, together with its wide scope, detail and reliability, has resulted in a book that will be of supreme importance to policy makers, researchers, teachers and parents for many years to come.<disp-quote>
<p>The detailed case study evidence, [shows] that effective pedagogy in high quality settings is able to balance adult initiated and child-led activities, that cognitive and social development are complementary, and that children learn best through ‘sustained shared thinking’. (Foreword: Gillian Pugh)</p>

</p>
<p>I recommend this book to everyone concerned with early years education.</p>
