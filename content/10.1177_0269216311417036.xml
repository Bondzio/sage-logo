<abstract>
<p>Rigorous clinical research in palliative care is challenging but achievable. Trial participants are likely to have deteriorating performance status, co-morbidities and progressive disease. It is difficult to recruit patients, and attrition unrelated to the intervention being trialled is high. The aim of this paper is to highlight practical considerations from a forum held to discuss these issues by active palliative care clinical researchers.</p>
<p>To date, the Australian Palliative Care Clinical Studies Collaborative (PaCCSC) has randomized more than 500 participants across 12 sites in 8 Phase III studies. Insights from the 2010 clinical research forum of the PaCCSC are reported. All active Australian researchers in palliative care were invited to present their current research and address three specific questions: (1) What has worked well? (2) What didn’t work well? and (3) How should the research be done differently next time?</p>
<p>Fourteen studies were presented, including six double-blind, randomized, controlled, multi-site trials run by the PaCCSC. Key recommendations are reported, including guidance on design; methodologies; and strategies for maximizing recruitment and retention. These recommendations will help to inform future trial design and conduct in palliative care.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is a paucity of high-level evidence to guide clinical practice in palliative care. The problems encountered in conducting the clinical trials necessary to get this evidence have been well described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311417036">1</xref></sup> Recruitment of people into randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is challenging in any clinical discipline,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311417036">2</xref></sup> and the problems are magnified in palliative care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311417036">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311417036"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311417036">5</xref></sup> The number of RCTs in palliative care has increased over recent years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311417036">6</xref></sup> but generally they have been underpowered. Compared to other disciplines, the pool of palliative care patients for research participation is relatively small. Furthermore, unstable and progressive medical problems mean participants often need to withdraw before study completion unrelated to the intervention being trialled, contributing to high rates of attrition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311417036">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311417036">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In order for palliative care to develop a stronger evidence base, robust studies must be conducted. This can only be achieved by multiple centres participating, with the support of appropriate infrastructure that is adequately funded. One means of achieving this is through the development of collaborative, multi-site research networks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311417036">9</xref></sup> The Australian Palliative Care Clinical Studies Collaborative (PaCCSC) is an example of such an initiative.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216311417036">
<title>The Australian Palliative Care Clinical Studies Collaborative</title>
<p>Initiated in 2006, PaCCSC is a research collaborative with a central coordinating centre based at Flinders University, Adelaide, South Australia and 12 recruitment sites across Australia. It is funded by a competitive grant from the Australian Government. The recruitment sites have a range of service delivery models and cover metropolitan and regional areas. Each site has dedicated research staff to participate in the studies of the collaborative.</p>
<p>The aim of the PaCCSC is to undertake rigorous, high-quality RCTs to gather evidence for the use of medications differing from their current registered indications. Study quality is required to be sufficiently robust to inform registration and subsidy applications where results are positive. Although PaCCSC studies are focused on the requirements of the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), they provide data applicable to other registering agencies worldwide. Over 36 months, more than 500 participants have been randomized in PaCCSC studies.</p>
<p>In April 2010, PaCCSC held an inaugural national clinical research forum that brought together active palliative care clinical researchers to discuss key success factors for research and how to overcome specific challenges. This paper reports the discussions of this forum relating to the design and conduct of controlled clinical trials in palliative care.</p>
<p>The forum invited all current active clinical researchers in palliative care identified nationally. Active researchers were invited to present studies that were recently completed, underway or about to commence. Rather than presenting the conduct and findings of studies, each presenter was asked to address:</p>

<list-item><p>What has worked well?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What didn’t work well? and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How should the research be done differently next time?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The findings of the forum reflect actual challenges and solutions.</p>
<p>Fifteen papers were presented, 14 of which related to clinical studies and one of which was a pharmacoeconomic analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311417036">Table 1</xref>). The 14 studies comprised one pharmacokinetic study, one prospective observational study and 12 double-blind RCTs (of which two were single patient (<italic>n</italic>-of-1) studies, nine were parallel arm trials, and one was a cross-over study). Seven studies had been completed, six studies were recruiting and one was yet to commence.</p>

<title>Consensus findings in domains identified</title>
<sec id="section4-0269216311417036">
<title>Design</title>
<p>There was consensus that recruiting and retaining participants depended on minimizing burden on patients, family and clinical staff. Reducing burden necessitates the use of short study timeframes to the primary efficacy end point and strict limits on questionnaires and participant diaries. The least amount of data necessary for outcome and safety assessment should be collected and existing sources of data used wherever possible. Such data can be complemented with longer term follow up of study participants in the sub-group who are able. The literature available supports minimizing participant burden while seeking to actively engage participants in palliative care trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311417036">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311417036">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Researchers at the forum felt controlled clinical trials in palliative care are more likely to be successful if they replicate clinical practice as closely as possible. Clinical staff at sites where standard clinical practice varied significantly from the study protocol were reported to be more likely to limit or avoid approaching potential participants. Even where there was a poor or absent evidence base, which was being addressed by the study, if either the intervention or control arm varied greatly from local practice, recruitment was likely to be poor or absent. Of note, establishing an acceptable standard care arm was often more controversial than defining the new intervention arm in a controlled clinical trial. Highly divergent views were present from across the country. There are limited data in the literature reflecting these issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311417036">11</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216311417036">
<title>Use of placebo</title>
<p>Concerns regarding the use of placebo in palliative care trials continue to be prevalent. In the absence of an evidence-based comparator, placebo is not only acceptable, it is the only ethical stance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311417036">12</xref></sup> In dealing with clinician concerns at participating sites, the fact that trial participants do better than non-trial patients even when assigned the control arm was seen as important to share with doubtful colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311417036">13</xref></sup> Study designs that include rescue medications were seen by forum participants to reduce clinician concerns that the participant will be left with uncontrolled symptoms if they are randomized to the control arm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269216311417036">
<title>Participants: recruitment</title>
<p>A key success factor identified by several participants to aid recruitment was the need to have the broadest possible inclusion criteria. The numbers of patients excluded due to each criterion should be closely monitored early in the life of the study to ensure that there were not unintended limitations to study participation. Adjustment of criteria may be in order where it becomes clear that exclusion criteria do not compromise either the primary end point or safety.</p>
<p>Strategies recommended at the forum included the use of scripts and role plays when training research assistants to approach potential participants. Generating agreed responses to frequently asked questions can also help in this process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269216311417036">
<title>Participants: retention</title>
<p>Retention rates were considered likely to be improved if studies are conducted in populations with a longer expected survival and better performance status at the beginning of the study. Some studies will, by design, seek to study people later in the course of their illness and there is a need to represent the spectrum of people referred to hospice and palliative care services. This was seen as a trade off for generalizability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0269216311417036">
<title>Measuring the primary outcome</title>
<p>A key consensus at the PaCCSC forum was that primary end points should be timed as early as clinically relevant in order to reduce burden and minimize missing data. Validated measures should be used whenever possible. Measures should be chosen that maximize the ability to standardize measurement across sites, clinicians, research staff and participants. Given that the presentations were by active researchers, the need to find measures that can be used across multiple studies to aid subsequent comparison of results was felt to be a key area where ongoing consensus needed to be developed nationally and internationally. The ability to use currently collected data for primary outcome measures where such data exists was seen as an aid to minimizing study burden on participants and clinicians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311417036">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269216311417036">
<title>Sample size</title>
<p>The forum identified the ongoing challenge of <italic>a priori</italic> defining the net clinical benefit in order to determine sample size. For many clinical conditions, this continues to need to be defined by consensus given the absence of data on the minimally clinically meaningful difference for many symptoms and syndromes being studied. The need for quality pilot data was seen as crucial to help define both benefit and toxicity, and to gain some patient-based measures of meaningful differences.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269216311417036">
<title>Study conduct</title>
<sec id="section11-0269216311417036">
<title>Obtaining ethics approval</title>
<p>Encouragingly, researchers at the PaCCSC forum reported palliative care patients to be enthusiastic participants in research. However, patient support for research may not yet be equally reflected in the deliberations or decisions of some research ethics committees, with approvals not forthcoming on the grounds that palliative care patients represent a population that is too vulnerable to participate in research. A counter argument is that vulnerable patients should not be precluded from participating in research, provided appropriate safeguards can be put in place. This argument has been used successfully in obtaining approval for research with even the most vulnerable patients, those unable to participate due to delirium for whom proxy consent was approved after a long delay for one of the foundational PaCCSC studies.</p>
<p>The literature in this area reflects that patients with life-limiting disease are generally enthusiastic participants in clinical research that has a potential direct relevance to improving the quality of care for people at the end of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311417036">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311417036">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311417036">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311417036">16</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269216311417036">
<title>Adverse event reporting</title>
<p>A further ethics committee issue highlighted by PaCCSC forum delegates was related to adverse event reporting. Given the nature of the population under study, adverse events related to the progression of underlying disease, and even deaths, are very common but will, for the most part, be unrelated to the study intervention. Reporting all events unrelated to the intervention but reflecting disease progression risks key toxicities related to the intervention being lost in the large number of events reported in palliative care trials. Within the PaCCSC, this issue has been addressed by negotiating exemptions related to disease progression from routine, and immediate reporting to ethics committees whilst maintaining close surveillance of adverse events within the network.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311417036">17</xref></sup> As a safeguard, all serious adverse events are audited by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0269216311417036">
<title>Improving engagement of colleagues</title>
<p>The need to promote the value of clinical research in palliative care extends beyond ethics committees to the clinical workforce. Gate-keeping of this type is likely to be further exacerbated in other referring disciplines. Speakers at the PaCCSC forum included pioneers in <italic>n</italic>-of-1 trials, which allow study results to be translated into immediate benefit for each individual participant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311417036">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Study advocacy has potential not only to boost recruitment but also retention. Promotion was felt to be important for all staff in participating centres, including clinicians covering after hours who might otherwise change medications, leading to protocol violation and precipitating participant withdrawal. This problem is further minimized in sites where researchers will have primary responsibility for the care of patients on study.</p>
<p>Given the challenges faced when conducting research in a palliative care population, multi-site research is usually essential, even for simple studies looking at prevalent symptoms and common medications in palliative care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311417036">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311417036">20</xref></sup> and will aid generalizability. Multi-site research requires an efficient, central coordinating centre and an effective team representing each participating site to oversee all aspects of the study design, implementation, recruitment and completion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311417036">21</xref></sup> standard operating procedures (SOPs) need to be jointly owned and supported by all participating sites. As well as ensuring study protocols are followed, a central office can ensure effective communication between sites that enables problems to be solved and form part of an ongoing learning process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311417036">22</xref></sup> In the case of the PaCCSC this is complemented by a web-based Data Management System developed by CareSearch (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.caresearch.com.au">http://www.caresearch.com.au</ext-link>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311417036">23</xref></sup> This system is simple to use and allows efficient on-line data entry and data validation at no ongoing cost even where paper-based collection of data occurs at specific sites.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>High-quality, rigorous RCTs are not only feasible but essential to improving the quality of care in palliative care. Every successfully completed randomized trial (regardless of whether it is a positive or negative outcome) should reflect on key success factors and key barriers to optimizing participation and conduct. Without this, key ways of improving research design and conduct will be missed.</p>
