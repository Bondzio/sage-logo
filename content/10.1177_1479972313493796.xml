<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to give an in-depth consideration of the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients’ subjective view of the impact of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) on their lives. A systematic review in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and PsychInfo databases yielded 3306 articles, of which 387 were duplicates, 263 remained after screening abstract and title; of them, 4 were excluded (editorial or due to lacking of full text) remaining a total of 259 for full text reading. Among these, eight studies met the inclusion criteria and were finally included. The meta-ethnography approach synthesized an understanding of the studies, which focused on constructing interpretations and developed a ‘line-of-argument’ synthesis. The psychosocial support of PR contributes to the patients’ strength and desire for participation and the health education leads to illness-perception learning. Both psychosocial support and health education develop patients’ empowerment, while PR promotes opportunities to health transitions. The empowerment experienced by the patients in taking advantage of these opportunities leads to positive impacts over time. If they do not exploit these occasions, negative impacts arise in their life, which make the treatment assistance or follow-up more difficult. The COPD patients’ feedback revealed that PR promotes a better ‘way of life’, well-being and important behavioural changes towards health promotion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) progressively affects patients by causing physical constraints, psychosocial disturbances and an economic burden.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1479972313493796">1</xref>

</sup> Therapeutic options are centred on smoking cessation, pharmacologic therapies and other treatments such as rehabilitation, oxygen therapy, ventilatory support and surgical treatments.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1479972313493796">2</xref>
</sup> Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programme is a multidisciplinary and structured intervention to optimize the physical and social functioning of patients with chronic respiratory impairment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1479972313493796">6</xref>
</sup> It can be applied to inpatient,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1479972313493796">7</xref>
</sup> outpatient<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1479972313493796">8</xref>
</sup> or home environments.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1479972313493796">9</xref>
</sup> Duration, frequency of sessions and protocols differ according to the health-care professional team, setting and resources available,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1479972313493796">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1479972313493796"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1479972313493796">9</xref>
</sup> and the minimum length of an effective PR programme is 6 weeks.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1479972313493796">2</xref>
</sup> Its principal components are exercise training, which is considered the cornerstone of PR, education and psychosocial support.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1479972313493796">6</xref>
</sup> Elements of education and, in particular, self-management, substantially reduce hospitalization, emergency department and unscheduled physician visits among patients at risk.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1479972313493796">10</xref>
</sup> Psychological support in a PR reduces incapacity, anxiety and depression in large groups of patients suffering from these symptoms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479972313493796">11</xref>
</sup> Integration of occupational therapy can improve independence in activity, while nutritional intervention should be considered for underweight patients or those with body composition abnormalities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1479972313493796">12</xref>
</sup> Reduced dyspnoea sensation, improvements in exercise tolerance and quality of life (QoL) in COPD patients are some of the positive impacts of PR programmes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1479972313493796">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1479972313493796">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1479972313493796">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Despite the fact that these impacts have been well evaluated and established in quantitative studies,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1479972313493796">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1479972313493796">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1479972313493796">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1479972313493796">14</xref>
</sup> the overall understanding of PR and the psychosocial problems generated by this chronic illness from the patients’ perspective are limited. The benefits, difficulties or barriers of treatment as understood or perceived by the participants during and/or after treatment, as well as their opinions about the intervention, have been only scantly examined.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1479972313493796">15</xref>

</sup> A systematic synthesis of qualitative studies about COPD and PR may provide additional knowledge, which has not been revealed by a single study, by identifying common recurrent themes. This understanding of the experiences of COPD patients provides relevant information for health professionals, family members and/or caregivers, who must deal with those patients. It will help them to better understand the patients’ needs and expectations and concerns to give support for better treatment and care. Consequently, adjusting the COPD treatment according to the patients’ constraints and needs may contribute to their adherence to PR programmes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1479972313493796">16</xref>
</sup> Qualitative studies with COPD and PR may complement quantitative findings as quantitative research tries to explain the nature and strength of associations or relationships; qualitative studies also tend to develop an ever-widening explanation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1479972313493796">23</xref>
</sup> Qualitative studies have a specific methodology that, when applied properly, is a promising method to provide understanding of clinical settings.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1479972313493796">24</xref>
</sup> Qualitative methods<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1479972313493796">25</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1479972313493796"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1479972313493796">27</xref>
</sup> permit the exploration of patients’ lived experiences – their perspectives, beliefs and feelings – disclosing subtle details and meanings not identified using quantitative methods alone. In fact, a combination of both qualitative and quantitative research in a mixed methods study often offers the most comprehensive approach.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1479972313493796">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Thus, the aim of this systematic review is to provide in-depth consideration for the subjective view of COPD patients on the impact of PR on their lives, exploring the lived experiences and identifying the benefits, negative and positive aspects perceived during and/or after participation in PR programmes.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1479972313493796">
<title>Search strategy</title>
<p>The search process was performed in PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and PsychInfo electronic databases from December 2011 to January 2012 using specific search strategies specified in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1479972313493796">Appendix Tables A1–A4</xref>. Two reviewers (JMSP and AMN-N) conducted an independent title and abstract screening followed by an agreement reached between them on the selection of studies. Reviewers JMSP, AMM-N, MTAPM and TEPMM carried out the full text reading to identify articles to be included in the review.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1479972313493796">
<title>Inclusion criteria</title>
<p>We included studies that described the COPD patient’s experiences with PR – positive or not – related to the programme itself as well as to participant’s feelings and behavioural changes. The studies had to meet the following criteria: (1) articles using a qualitative methodology according to the existing guidelines<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1479972313493796">24</xref>
</sup> that report qualitative research only (using typical research methods such as interviews, focus groups or participant observation) or research using a mixed method (qualitative and quantitative methods) that describes qualitative findings (in this case, just qualitative findings were analyzed), (2) group of participants formed only by COPD patients or that included patients with COPD (in this case, just COPD patients’ reports were analyzed), (3) studies that applied any kind of PR (outpatient or hospital-based) and (4) articles published in English, Spanish or Portuguese. Both articles for which the full text was not obtained and editorials were excluded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1479972313493796">
<title>Methodology assessment</title>
<p>To assess the methodological characteristics of all the articles, a previous modified checklist<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1479972313493796">29</xref>
</sup> was used based on the content of the qualitative methodology, in order to get a methodological overview of the studies. This analysis allowed for a description of the research quality of all the articles. The assessment was conducted independently by three reviewers (JMSP, MTAPM and TEPMM) and any differences were solved by discussion and consensus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1479972313493796">
<title>Article analysis</title>
<p>Three reviewers (JMSP, MTPM and TEPMM) independently analyzed the article; discussions were necessary in order to define final results. The meta-ethnography approach, originally described by Noblit and Nare,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1479972313493796">30</xref>
</sup> was used as it is a well-developed method for synthesizing qualitative data in small groups of articles that are closely related.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1479972313493796">31</xref>
</sup> It is based on the interpretive paradigm and synthesizes an understanding of the studies focused on constructing interpretations – not analyses. This approach provides an alternative to traditional aggregative methods of synthesis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1479972313493796">32</xref>
</sup> and includes the following phases: (1) getting started (identifying the subject to be investigated), (2) deciding what is relevant to the initial interest, (3) reading the studies, (4) determining how the studies are related, (5) translating the studies into one another, (6) synthesizing translations and (7) expressing the synthesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1479972313493796">30</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Following this approach, lists summarizing the authors’ original finding, using their concepts and terms, were drawn up for each article. These summaries were abstracted from the appraisal sheets that had been prepared for each article. At the bottom of each list, key concepts were identified. The lists were drawn up by hand, on a long piece of paper, so that they could be easily compared with relationships between concepts in the different studies indicated by arrows and lines. Having identified the main concepts to emerge from each article (primary and secondary themes), a systematic search was undertaken for the presence or absence of these concepts in all the articles to be synthesized. The primary themes are identified from participants’ understanding presented in the Results section of the articles, and the secondary themes are derived from authors’ interpretations presented in the Discussion section of the articles. Primary and secondary themes influenced our approach towards the ‘themes’ (third-order interpretation).</p>
<p>Based on the translated themes, we developed a ‘line-of-argument’ synthesis,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1479972313493796">30</xref>
</sup> which was the most appropriate to depict our understanding of the COPD patients’ experience with PR. The ‘line-of-argument’ is the construction of an interpretation that reveals what is hidden in individualized studies, discovering a whole among a set of parts.<sup>

</sup> The multidisciplinary team of most programmes stimulates and encourages patients to achieve a new goal of exercise and self-management. The safe and motivating environment of the programmes, social encounters and group sessions with peers also encourage participants as well as family assistance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1479972313493796">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1479972313493796">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1479972313493796">18</xref>

</p>
<p>The health professionals supervise patients’ performance through close monitoring, giving them positive reinforcement and encouragement, which is the basis of the learning process;<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1479972313493796">15</xref>
</sup> they also motivate patients to continue exercising at home. The staff provide feedback regarding the progress of patient activities, which is ‘painfully slow’, increasing patients’ self-confidence; they stimulate participants to continue with the treatment and identify their own limits.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1479972313493796">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1479972313493796">19</xref>
</sup> This feedback characterizes a clear professional–patient communication, which restores patients’ confidence, as a patient reports: ‘Having someone persisting, cheerfully encouraging me to go on and do it, you know, I began to feel, “I can do that.” And that was the feeling of confidence, increasing feeling of strength’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1479972313493796">15</xref>
</sup> The health professional support influences the patient’s capacity to recognize health improvements.</p>
<p>Some participants had never met anyone else with COPD before initiating PR: ‘Up until then I hadn’t met anyone else with it, you think you are the only one’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1479972313493796">16</xref>

</sup> One patient explains his learning about medication: ‘I learned that Ventolin takes effect in five minutes or so, and the other one, Atrovent, it doesn’t start working for about 15 minutes … [Now I’m] leaving a little more time between taking the puffers <italic>…</italic> ’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1479972313493796">17</xref>
</sup> COPD patients affirm they use some energy conservation strategies taught, such as coordinating breathing with stair climbing, organizing the environment (such as stocking closets with seasonal clothes only), pacing meal preparation, sitting to rest during or between activities, arriving early for appointments, seeking help and so on.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1479972313493796">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Participants also learned to overcome inactivity by healthier routines and habits to carry out the exercise protocols and breathing strategies. Allison increased her use of the treadmill, which is nowadays a daily priority for her: ‘I go downstairs every day to do the treadmill … I never miss the treadmill, to me, that’s top priority’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1479972313493796">15</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1479972313493796">16</xref>
</sup> She acknowledged, however, that this happened as a result of her isolation in the group.

<p>Even though many patients recognized the support received in the PR as stimulated and motivated, others consider the ‘lack of support’ after PR to be an obstacle to the follow-up.

<title>The ‘line-of-argument’ description</title>
<p>The psychosocial support given to the COPD patients by the health professionals, peer groups and family during PR favourably contributes towards their strength, desire and motivation to be involved in PR. The health education associated with this support leads to a learning process, which provides knowledge and consciousness of the illness perception, including symptoms and progress, to the patients. Both psychosocial support and health education work together in PR treatment to contribute towards the development of patients’ empowerment. On the other hand, the PR itself promotes opportunities for health transitions in the patients’ life. So, if the COPD patients apply this developed empowerment to those opportunities, they achieve and perceive positive impacts over time. If they do not get physically and psychologically involved in this process of treatment and changes, negative impacts arise during the intervention, which makes their assistance or follow-up treatment more difficult. The ‘line-of-argument’ is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1479972313493796">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This systematic review disclosed the lived experience from the point of view of COPD patients who completed a course of PR. They experienced a feeling of being supported by health professionals, peer groups and family; they learned new knowledge about their illness and how to overcome the suffering caused by it and they took advantage of the opportunities given by rehabilitation to promote considerable physical and psychosocial changes. These positive impacts of PR marked the patients’ ‘health transitions’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1479972313493796">33</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While the patient’s voice expresses their treatment experience, it underpins the meanings in their social circle in response to bodily indications perceived as symptoms, that is, the illness behaviour.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1479972313493796">34</xref>
</sup> Although the COPD illness behaviour represents their suffering, the participants from this review were able to control the dynamics of the symptoms and their physical inabilities through PR. Thus, the PR programmes applied in the studies reviewed follow the orientation of the World Health Organization towards a New Public Health and Health Promotion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1479972313493796">35</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Although the PR can be applied in a group setting, this treatment depends on each patient’s condition and is planned individually. The ‘health education’ applied through education sessions aims to stimulate the consciousness, illness control and behavioural changes in each individual to promote health improvements. These individual changes indicate that the PR achieves the Health Promotion adopted in 1986 in Ottawa, Canada,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1479972313493796">36</xref>
</sup> defined as ‘the process of enabling people to increase control over and to improve their health’, with the focus on the individual behavioural changes that can be based on health education. Although it is an important part of the PR, it is worth considering that the education process alone does not necessarily lead to behavioural changes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1479972313493796">37</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Additionally, the value given to the education sessions and the recognition of the positive impacts of PR by the COPD patients in this review indicates the contribution towards empowerment, part of the Health Promotion,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1479972313493796">38</xref>
</sup> for the treatment of chronic diseases.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1479972313493796">39</xref>
</sup> Here, the empowerment can be identified by the strength of the patients to fight for new achievements and the hope for the future reported by some of them. It reflects the self-efficacy and control promoted by PR. Pulvirenti et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1479972313493796">40</xref>
</sup> argue that the process of empowerment involves the use of resources and that special attention must be paid to structural barriers that may affect the individuals’ health condition and their ability to care for and find mechanisms to deal with these barriers. Here, the resources available in PR contributed to patient empowerment; the individuals were able to recognize difficulties and barriers to start or follow the programme, and they also gave possible solutions for them. A literature review points out that the empowerment associated with planned visits and care coordination improves outcomes of COPD treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1479972313493796">41</xref>
</sup> Rohrer et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1479972313493796">42</xref>
</sup> highlight the adoption of a direct measure of empowerment, that is, the patients’ own perception of being in control of their own health. Moving in this direction, our systematic review revealed the patients control of their health state.</p>
<p>A systematic review about the influence of illness perceptions on the promotion of self-management in COPD patients who participated in interventions different from PR<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1479972313493796">43</xref>
</sup> disclosed that the perceived lack of control over the course of the illness reduces QoL, creates anxiety, leads to social isolation and reduces the motivation to acquire knowledge and skills for self-control. The author underscores that the lack of motivation, the inability to recognize cognitive and instrumental capabilities and the support of social and health professionals influence the low illness self-control and even non-adherence to therapy. Our review showed that the perceptions of COPD patients related to an effective intervention (PR) promotes opposite gains from these findings. In contrast to that study, most of the patients from this review recognized motivation, emotional and instrumental abilities, social and health professionals’ support and control over the COPD. The perception of the PR described here positively influenced the self-management of COPD patients. A qualitative study in Sweden with 12 people with rheumatic diseases<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1479972313493796">44</xref>
</sup> revealed the phenomenon of health-promoting self-care as a ‘way of life.’ Similarly, PR, which also provides self-care among other benefits to people with chronic lung disease,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1479972313493796">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1479972313493796">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1479972313493796">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1479972313493796">14</xref>
</sup> was recognized as a new ‘way of life’ by COPD patients. Through the self-care, Swedish chronic patients were ready to understand and respond to the signals their bodies sent out as a result of their illness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1479972313493796">44</xref>
</sup> After PR, the participants from our review avoided emergency attention due to a better understanding of COPD and the strategies to cope with the symptoms.</p>
<p>One topic regarding qualitative studies that require special attention is the selection bias of participants once they are likely ‘success cases.’ It is not possible to disregard selection bias in favour of those likely to be positive about the subject investigated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1479972313493796">45</xref>
</sup> If, for example, patients with a negative attitude towards participating in PR or who have experienced little effect despite significant investment are not selected in the sample, information will be lost. In this review, we found that in addition to showing the positive benefits of PR, some articles<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1479972313493796">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1479972313493796">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1479972313493796">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1479972313493796">22</xref>
</sup> also revealed the difficulties or problems suffered by the patients during the course of the programme.</p>
<p>Our systematic review has some implications for further research and clinical care in COPD patients. Assessing patients’ ‘treatment-perceptions’ will contribute significantly to a better understanding of the effects of intervention on the illness behaviour and of the adjustments of the negative points identified by the patients. We would encourage PR health professional teams to try to subjectively evaluate their patients in order to know their treatment expectations, their necessities during the intervention and, more importantly, the results achieved with a health intervention, which in this case is PR, although a more tailored approach, need further elaboration in busy clinical settings.</p>
<p>One limitation of this systematic review is the amount of articles included. Even though qualitative studies on COPD have been recently growing,<sup>

</sup> we limited our review to those related to COPD and PR, which gave us a final number of just eight. Nevertheless, our review provided knowledge of COPD patients’ own perception of PR, which was recognized by the patients as an important tool to make physical and psychosocial changes in their daily living with a progressive illness. The importance of investigating patients’ points of view using a systematic review of qualitative articles was the key to understanding what this experience represented to their chronic reality. Thus, the COPD patients’ voice revealed that PR promotes a better ‘way of life’, well-being and important behaviour changes towards Health Promotion<sup>
