<title>Results:</title>
<p>Seventeen studies were included: 11 class I and 6 class II studies involving 540 participants, of whom 73% were non-ambulant.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Upper motor neurone damage following conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis often results in problems of weakness, postural instability and spasticity that impair function and, particularly for more severely affected individuals, restrict mobility and limit weight-bearing activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512443373">1</xref></sup> Secondary adaptations in the musculoskeletal system occur rapidly in response to immobility. Muscle and soft tissue shortening with loss of passive joint range of movement is common and associated with pain, further spasticity and loss of function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512443373">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512443373"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512443373">3</xref></sup> Spasticity, contracture and weakness of the calf muscles frequently occur together and cause considerable disability; restricting ankle dorsiflexion, disrupting balance and interfering with functional mobility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512443373">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512443373">4</xref></sup> Reduced mechanical and gravitational loads due to muscle atrophy and limited weight-bearing remove an important stimulus for maintaining bone mineral density and increase the risk of fragility fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512443373">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512443373"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512443373">6</xref></sup> Substantial rapid bone loss following spinal cord injury is well documented and bone loss following stroke is increasingly reported along with high rates of fragility fracture in both populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512443373">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512443373"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512443373">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Each of these secondary problems further impairs the function and quality of life of individuals affected; they complicate care, delay rehabilitation and add to the costs of healthcare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512443373">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512443373">6</xref></sup> Effectively treating primary deficits, alongside preventing and addressing secondary complications, presents a challenge. For individuals who have insufficient lower limb strength, trunk or head control to stand actively, being passively supported in standing using adaptive equipment is a common treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512443373">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512443373"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512443373">9</xref></sup> Supported standing has many proposed effects, it can be carried out with multiple aims and the goals and potential benefits may differ from acute to chronic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512443373">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512443373"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512443373"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512443373">10</xref></sup> In early rehabilitation it can be used to improve respiratory function, increase arousal and manage orthostatic hypotension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512443373">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512443373"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512443373">11</xref></sup> It is thought to strengthen antigravity muscles and can be used to retrain head and upper limb control, to improve or maintain standing ability and in preparation for gait training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512443373">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512443373"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512443373"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512443373">14</xref></sup> Supported standing allows for full or partial weight-bearing through the lower limbs and regular standing may provide sufficient mechanical loads to maintain bone mineral density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512443373">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512443373"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512443373">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reviews that examine weight-bearing interventions for maintaining bone density in spinal cord injury populations consider standing and walking together and draw different conclusions as to effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512443373">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512443373">16</xref></sup> Supported standing also provides a prolonged weight-bearing stretch to hip, knee and ankle flexors and is often used to manage muscle length and spasticity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512443373">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512443373">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512443373">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512443373"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512443373"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512443373"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512443373"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512443373"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215512443373">23</xref></sup> The effectiveness of intermittent stretches without weight-bearing is uncertain but stretches with weight-bearing in standing might be more effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512443373">22</xref></sup> Prolonged stretching may alter the muscle’s viscoelastic properties, structure and excitability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512443373">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215512443373"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512443373">24</xref></sup> The upright position and sensory inputs to the sole of the foot may augment the inhibition of stretch reflexes and reduce motor neurone excitability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512443373">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215512443373">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Supported standing also has the potential for harm. Surveys of standing in spinal cord injury populations report positive responses but also adverse events that include: a case of hip fracture, increased pain and spasms and symptoms of hypotension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512443373">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215512443373">26</xref></sup> On-going standing programmes place additional demands on individuals, therapists and caregivers. Standing requires considerable commitment and resources and issues such as cost, storage and ease of use of standing equipment impact on success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512443373">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215512443373">26</xref></sup> Any potential benefits need to be interpreted in this context.</p>
<p>Despite its widespread use, no systematic review of the evidence for effectiveness of supported standing has been completed in adults with upper motor neurone damage. To prescribe standing confidently and most effectively a firmer basis for practice is needed. The aim of this review is to understand whether supported standing can affect lower limb muscle length, spasticity, bone mineral density or function in adults with stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A search was made of the following electronic databases; MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL and the Cochrane library including CENTRAL (Cochrane register of controlled trials) up until January 2012. A search of clinical trial registers via <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com">www.controlled-trials.com</ext-link> was also completed. Terms related to the standing intervention and populations of interest were searched (see Appendix 1 online). The searches were restricted to title, abstract and keywords and limited to human and adult studies, no date limits were employed and no language restrictions used. Electronic searches were complemented by citation tracking. The study populations were adults with stroke, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury. Studies of children 16 years old or younger were excluded because the aims of standing may differ and the immature musculoskeletal system may respond differently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512443373">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512443373">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512443373">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215512443373">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215512443373">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The intervention of interest was supported standing (i.e. being positioned passively in standing). To be included, the aim of the study must have been to position the individual in standing and to measure its effects. Any dose and setting of standing were accepted. All methods of reaching standing and all devices used to achieve standing were eligible (e.g. tilt-table, standing frame or prone stander). Studies where standing was active or achieved by electrical stimulation and those that combined standing with vibration, stepping, passive movements or gait training were excluded as these co-interventions might independently affect outcomes. Studies that compared these interventions with supported standing were eligible.</p>
<p>The primary outcomes of interest were measures of body structure; namely lower limb muscle length, spasticity and bone mineral density. Studies which used supported standing solely to investigate the properties of the stretch reflex were excluded. Secondary outcomes of interest were related to activity including: balance, activities of daily living, mobility and to the safety and tolerability of standing. Studies were excluded when effects on the outcomes of interest were not considered.</p>
<p>This review focused on class I studies: quasi-randomized and randomized controlled trials.<sup>29.</sup> We decided ‘a priori’ to analyse these separately and only to include trials of high quality in any meta-analysis. However, in rehabilitation few high-quality trials can exist and where standing is standard care, randomizing to no-standing can present ethical difficulties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215512443373">30</xref></sup> Consequently class II studies – experimental studies and prospective observational studies with concurrent control groups – were included.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215512443373">29</xref></sup> Observational studies without control groups – cross-sectional studies, surveys, case reports and expert opinion articles – were excluded.</p>
<p>The retrieved studies were initially screened by title then abstract. If this did not provide sufficient information and where potential studies were identified, the full-length article was screened. The full text of one Russian study was unobtainable; another study was translated from Korean but did not meet the inclusion criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215512443373">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215512443373">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>The two reviewers (KB, MN) independently reviewed articles, then came to a consensus on inclusion through discussion. Where data were incomplete or unclear the lead authors were contacted and information requested. Each reviewer (KB, MN) independently extracted information about study characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215512443373">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215512443373">2</xref>). Quality was assessed independently by the reviewers, one of whom (KB) was blinded to the article’s author(s), affiliation(s), publication date and journal. A domain-based risk of bias approach was adopted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215512443373">33</xref></sup> Items relevant to internal validity were reviewed (see Appendix 2 online).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215512443373">33</xref></sup> Each item was graded as ‘adequate’ (low risk of bias), ‘inadequate’ (high risk of bias) or ‘unclear’ (uncertain risk).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215512443373">33</xref></sup> The direction of any potential bias detected (to under/overestimate results) was compared with overall findings. Any items which were judged differently were discussed and disagreements were resolved during consensus meetings. A third person was available in the event of consensus not being reached but was not required.</p>

<p>No single outcome measure was used in all studies.

<p>Three class I studies (<italic>n</italic> = 56) examined the effect of standing on muscle length.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269215512443373">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269215512443373">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269215512443373">42</xref></sup> Two high-quality studies measured maximum ankle dorsiflexion with the knee extended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269215512443373">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269215512443373">42</xref></sup> In both standing had a small effect in preventing loss of dorsiflexion. In the study by Robinson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269215512443373">41</xref></sup> initial mean dorsiflexion was 15 (SD 9) degrees and both groups maintained mobility with no difference between them post treatment; splinting mean 14.1 (SD 6.4) degrees, standing mean 15.0 (SD 9.0) degrees; a mean difference of 1 degree (confidence interval −5 to 7); without contracture prevention participants lost dorsiflexion; a mean 3 (SD 7) degrees. In the study by Ben et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269215512443373">42</xref></sup> initial mean dorsiflexion ROM was 17 degrees; over 12 weeks both ankles lost dorsiflexion; standing mean 1 (SD 5) degrees, control mean 5 degrees (SD 3); a treatment effect of 4 (CI 2–6) degrees of dorsiflexion. Baker et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269215512443373">35</xref></sup> in a poor-quality study (<italic>n</italic> = 6) measured hip extension, knee extension and ankle dorsiflexion. Baseline measures show participants had flexion contractures at hips and ankles. Standing significantly increased median hip extension and ankle dorsiflexion compared to non-weight-bearing exercises and baseline. Knee extension did not change but baseline measures were within normal ranges.</p>
<p>Bone mineral density was the primary outcome in four studies with spinal cord injury populations (<italic>n</italic> = 105) and was assessed in varied ways at the proximal femur, the tibia, pelvis and leg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215512443373">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269215512443373">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269215512443373"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269215512443373">44</xref></sup> All studies reported bone loss. In the single high-quality trial a non-significant reduction in the rate of bone loss was observed: 6.0% (SD 6.1) intervention versus 6.6% (SD 4.4) control leg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269215512443373">42</xref></sup> In this study although single leg tilt-table standing meant high forces were applied to the weight-bearing leg the total dose of standing is low. The 12-week intervention is the shortest; 8 of the 20 participants did not receive the total intervention and load bearing time is only 90 minutes per week.</p>
<p>The class II studies reported more positive effects.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This review explored the effectiveness of supported standing in adults with upper motor neurone injury, focusing on understanding its impact on lower limb muscle length, spasticity, bone health and function. There are few firm conclusions that can be drawn from the existing evidence due to the lack of high-quality studies of sufficient size that consider the outcomes of interest. However the review does summarize the current information about this widely used intervention and highlight areas where the evidence for practice is strongest and also where further research is needed.</p>
<p>The review found some high-quality evidence that supported standing can prevent loss of calf muscle and soft tissue length. Two studies documented a small loss of ankle mobility without any specific intervention to prevent contractures and showed that regular standing had an effect on ankle dorsiflexion. In both studies participants stood on a tilt-table with the foot in maximum dorsiflexion for 30 minutes, undergoing a prolonged calf muscle stretch at the end of available range of movement. These findings are consistent with those of a number of uncontrolled studies of standing in patients with stroke and acquired brain injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512443373">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512443373">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512443373">24</xref></sup> The clinical importance of these small effects is questioned; with both studies suggesting 10 degrees of ankle dorsiflexion as the smallest clinically important treatment effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269215512443373">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269215512443373">42</xref></sup> Standing programmes do demand significant resources; preventing small losses in mobility need to be balanced against this.</p>
<p>Several points appear relevant. First, both high-quality studies describe a slow trend for a loss of ankle dorsiflexion without contracture prevention. If this continued it is conceivable that the benefits of standing in maintaining range might accumulate and larger treatment effects would emerge over time. The lack of long-term follow-up here is a key issue. Second, the extent to which participants were at risk of contractures might have influenced the size of their response to treatment. In both studies initial mean dorsiflexion is high and no information is provided about factors such as the presence of lower limb spasticity, which might increase the risk of ankle contracture. In fact in one study 2 of the 20 participants have a flaccid paralysis, placing them at lower risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269215512443373">42</xref></sup> This issue is partially addressed by the same study which analysed treatment response by initial ankle dorsiflexion and found no difference. However, this investigation was not pre-planned and the small numbers (<italic>n</italic> = 20) mean the study would have been underpowered to undertake subgroup analysis. Third, one study compared standing with an active control and both studies were conducted in inpatient settings with participants undergoing active rehabilitation, environments which in themselves reduce the risk of contracture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269215512443373">41</xref></sup> It is certainly possible that patients with existing contractures or at higher risk of developing contractures due to factors related to their condition or to their environment would show larger treatment effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269215512443373">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>For individuals at low risk of developing contractures the benefit of supported standing may be outweighed by the resources it consumes. However where the risk of contracture development is high and persistent, for example, in conditions such as severe brain injury where little functional recovery is expected or where the ability of the person is deteriorating (e.g. through progression of a condition such as multiple sclerosis), maintaining the physical condition is challenging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512443373">7</xref></sup> For these individuals, small contractures are likely to increase over time, especially as ongoing intensive rehabilitation is not available for most people with long-term neurological conditions. In this context the effects of supported standing in maintaining muscle length appear more important.</p>
<p>There is a wide variance in force distribution and actual axial load within standing equipment and it should be noted that standing using a tilt-table and standing frame are not equivalent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269215512443373">61</xref></sup> The review found only sparse low-quality evidence to suggest that standing in a frame can affect muscle length. Baker et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269215512443373">35</xref></sup> reported that standing increased hip extension and ankle dorsiflexion but had no effect on knee extension. These findings contrast with other uncontrolled studies in the literature. A case series of non-ambulant, chronic spinal cord injury and two multiple sclerosis patients found ankle dorsiflexion unchanged after six months using a standing frame,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269215512443373">56</xref></sup> while a case series of five non-ambulant children with cerebral palsy and knee flexion contractures reported standing in a frame for 60 minutes five days per week for six weeks significantly improved knee extension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512443373">21</xref></sup> The key consideration might be the extent to which standing in the frame provides a sufficient stretch; for example in the study by Baker et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269215512443373">35</xref></sup> participants had hip and ankle flexion contractures but adequate knee extension so standing would only have stretched the hip and ankle.</p>
<p>Programmes that aim to affect muscle length should consider which structures are affected by the standing position, whether a stretch is being applied at end of available range and consider potential effects at the hip, knee and ankle.</p>
<p>Investigations of the effect of standing on bone health were all conducted in spinal injury populations. The different outcome measures for bone mineralization used across studies, the different sites evaluated and the different time points for measurement make it difficult to compare studies and draw conclusions. Notably, no study collected information about fragility fractures, all using measures of bone density as a proxy for bone health. No study demonstrated an increase in bone following standing. This seems unsurprising. Bone loss following spinal injury is thought to occur for multiple reasons; loss of mechanical force applied to bone is considered a major contributor but neurogenic, vascular and hormonal changes are also factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269215512443373">62</xref></sup> An intervention such as standing which addresses the loss of mechanical stimuli even if effective is likely to only ameliorate the process. Bone loss begins just after injury, peaks in the first year, and then continues at a slower rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512443373">5</xref></sup> Three of the four studies in the review occurred only in the first year after injury, a time when significant demineralization and substantial bone loss that is especially rapid in the lower limbs is widely reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269215512443373">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269215512443373">62</xref></sup> Small effects on bone mineralization due to standing during this time might be easily missed or underestimated.</p>
<p>The single high-quality trial revealed no significant effect of standing on total bone mineral density at the proximal femur using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269215512443373">42</xref></sup> The standing dose is low in this regime compared to other studies and the loads delivered may have been insufficient. In addition, the primary sites for demineralization and fragility fracture early after spinal injury are the distal femur and proximal tibia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269215512443373">62</xref></sup> Measuring only at the proximal femur may have missed effects of the intervention at other relevant sites. The distal femur and proximal tibia are sites rich in trabecular bone. Trabecular bone is more metabolically active than cortical bone and would be expected to respond to mechanical loading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512443373">5</xref></sup> As DEXA scans provide a record of total bone mineral density and do not differentiate between cortical and trabecular bone, trabecular adaptations to standing may have been overlooked.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512443373">5</xref></sup> In addition, as Ashe et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512443373">15</xref></sup> point out, cortical bone remodelling can take at least six months. Consequently, studies such as this one which do not maintain an intervention for at least six months and report a lack of findings are not necessarily negative.</p>
<p>The results of the class II studies were more positive and suggested that supported standing may have an effect on preserving bone if commenced early after injury and carried out intensively over long periods. The results of the longitudinal study are of particular interest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269215512443373">44</xref></sup> Here differences in bone density at one year were not significant but at two years those undertaking standing had significantly higher density and a mean leg bone mineral density greater than 1.0 g/cm<sup>2</sup>. There is some evidence that fracture frequency is increased when mean bone mineral density is lower than 1.0 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, so in this case the clinical benefits of standing appeared to accumulate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269215512443373">44</xref></sup> The findings agree with those of a cross-sectional, observational study with healthy controls of 53 individuals a year or more post injury which found those who commenced standing in the first three months post injury and stood three or more times per week (<italic>n</italic> = 38) had significantly higher bone density at the femoral shaft compared to those who did not stand (<italic>n</italic> = 15).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269215512443373">53</xref></sup> Two systematic reviews in cerebral palsy children also provide positive support for standing in maintaining bone density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512443373">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215512443373">28</xref></sup> However, a case series and a number of cross-sectional, observational studies of participants with longstanding spinal injury, where standing commences at differing times post injury find little evidence of benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269215512443373">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269215512443373">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269215512443373"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269215512443373"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269215512443373">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>This mixed picture and the trend for studies with more intensive, long-term regimes to report positive outcomes suggests that the effects of standing may be dose-dependent and points to the need for further research. It also highlights the issue of compliance. In the study by Alenka et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269215512443373">44</xref></sup> fewer than half of the participants continued standing at the prescribed intensity at two years. Assessing outcomes based on compliance can introduce bias; those least likely to develop problems in any case may have been the most able to tolerate the intervention. Matching individuals by age, sex and lesion level as occurred in this study only partially addresses the issue. Further information about patient characteristics and factors that affect compliance seems necessary if long-term programmes of standing are to be prescribed. For instance, compliance may be low if the treatments are perceived as painful or ineffective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215512443373">27</xref></sup> but none of the studies in this review monitored comfort or investigated the experiences and attitudes of participants.</p>
<p>The effect of supported standing on spasticity was inconclusive. The small numbers, range of outcomes and low quality of studies provided limited insight. Two studies found posture-dependent reduction in the excitability of calf stretch reflexes on standing was preserved to some extent in people with spinal injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269215512443373">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269215512443373">47</xref></sup> In contrast, two other studies reported little change in reflex excitability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215512443373">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269215512443373">39</xref></sup> The difference could be due to the varying pathologies or degree of spasticity of participants, differences in measurement or in standing intervention. A separate study found reductions in resistance torque following standing which were largest when standing was combined with calf stretch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269215512443373">45</xref></sup> Findings that standing can produce short-term reductions in calf reflex excitability and resistance torque agree with other studies, including a randomized controlled trial in children with cerebral palsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0269215512443373">63</xref></sup> and an uncontrolled study of hemiplegic stroke patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512443373">24</xref></sup> Limited evidence suggested standing might reduce extensor spasms in patients with spinal cord injury, results supported by a previous case study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215512443373">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215512443373">34</xref></sup> Similar effects were not reported for flexor spasms, clonus or spasm frequency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215512443373">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269215512443373">35</xref></sup> Standing has not been linked to changes in muscle tone using the Ashworth Scale in this review or in other uncontrolled studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512443373">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215512443373">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269215512443373">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269215512443373">56</xref></sup> This may reflect limitations in the scale, its use in these studies or a true inability of standing to reduce muscle tone.</p>
<p>The clinical importance of any changes in these outcomes is uncertain; only one pilot study included measures of the wider impact of spasticity or related function. The lack of power in this study may be a contributory factor in the small changes seen in these measures. The current low level of evidence does not provide evidence that standing has no affect on spasticity but does highlight that research in this area is both necessary and complex. Future trials need to be adequately powered to undertake hypothesis testing, should consider measuring spasticity comprehensively and look at both immediate and longer term outcomes of any intervention.</p>
<p>It is not yet possible to establish whether supported standing can enhance recovery of lower limb motor function, standing or gait. Of the six studies that examined aspects of motor function four were of low quality. Five studies used active comparator arms which included standing or interventions that could affect function. This made it difficult to isolate any effects of supported standing and may have led to treatment effects being underestimated or missed. Exercising while standing might affect functional outcomes but not all studies documented whether exercises occurred and no study compared standing with or without exercises. Each study demonstrated functional improvements over time in groups undertaking supported standing but the potential exists for other factors such as natural recovery and other rehabilitation to have influenced results.</p>
<p>The outcome measures chosen and the way in which they were administered were not always appropriate, making evaluation difficult. For example, the index of standing weight-bearing symmetry used in two studies describes a single aspect of standing posture immediately post treatment; assessors were not blinded and measure reliability and validity not considered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512443373">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269215512443373">38</xref></sup> Whether an improvement in weight-bearing standing symmetry within a standing frame translates into clinical improvements in balance is uncertain. The fact that participants progressed to gait rehabilitation in both groups could suggest this but established clinical measures of standing balance would have provided insight. In the study by Bagley et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269215512443373">36</xref></sup> 65% of 140 participants had a large cortical stroke with a poor prognosis for recovery; functional improvements for these patients would be difficult to achieve. However, the measures in this study were administered at varying time points in relation to the intervention and were mainly related to gross function. As a consequence they may have lacked sensitivity to detect small changes in performance.</p>
<p>Moderate quality evidence suggests a single session of standing is unlikely to alter gait.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269215512443373">40</xref></sup> The findings agree with those of Richards et al. who reported that 30 minutes of standing did not affect the gait of 19 children with cerebral palsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0269215512443373">64</xref></sup> This lack of effect is unsurprising. Although a single stand might produce immediate changes in muscle length and reflex excitability, these are unlikely to be sufficient to prompt a lasting change in motor function. Despite this, it would be wrong to conclude that programmes of standing are an ineffective tool in gait rehabilitation; little research has been completed in adults with upper motor neurone injury. Salem et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512443373">13</xref></sup> reported significant improvements in gait in children with cerebral palsy following a three-week standing programme that included increased walking speed. Changes were attributed to increased ankle dorsiflexion and reduced calf muscle spasticity post standing.</p>
<p>All studies with functional outcomes involved stroke patients. Single-case studies and surveys suggest home standing programmes can be a valuable and cost effective way of optimizing balance, posture and function (e.g. transfer ability) in populations with long-term neurological conditions such as spinal injury or multiple sclerosis where deterioration might be expected due to disease progression or ageing, but the review has revealed little attention to this issue by researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512443373">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215512443373">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0269215512443373">65</xref></sup></p>

Two surveys of physiotherapists’ use of tilt-table standing report that common indications are to obtain weight-bearing, prevent contracture, improve lower limb muscle strength and manage muscle tone and the review did address these issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512443373">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512443373">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The main limitation was the methodological quality of the included studies. Conclusions from the pilot studies should be interpreted with particular caution; all undertook hypothesis testing without adequate power and all had key methodological flaws (e.g. lack of blinded assessment). Treatment regimes varied considerably, resulting in wide differences in standing dose (duration and intensity) and this, together with the incorporation of standing in both intervention and comparator arms, particularly in studies related to function may account for the generally small effect sizes and at times non-significant findings. Outcome assessment was problematic in most areas.</p>
<p>A further limitation might be the varied clinical populations in the review. Recognizing this, the reviewers have tried to describe the population characteristics carefully and to note where conclusions are based on studies conducted wholly within one diagnostic group (e.g. bone density in spinal injury populations). As few studies have been completed of supported standing it was thought useful to bring together the best information about standing. Although the conditions differ in many ways, many similarities remain both in initial problems and secondary complications and in the aims and use of supported standing with these patients. This approach revealed very little research in patients with multiple sclerosis, severe brain injury or long-term neurological disability and a lack of important detail about participant characteristics in some studies (e.g. information about lesion level, spasticity, participation in physical activity other than standing).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Overall, the review provides some support for the use of supported standing to maintain physical status and prevent loss of calf muscle length. It also reveals the limited and generally low-quality evidence for the use of standing to preserve bone mineral density, manage spasticity or promote function. The review highlights several issues relevant to future research in this area. Individuals who are most likely to undertake supported standing have relatively rare conditions and the mostly small sample sizes and limited research in some populations indicate the need for further studies and multicentre studies. Any study needs to describe patient characteristics fully and to quantify the standing dose with greater precision as these factors might independently affect outcomes.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of standing programmes carried out over many months and years remains unknown although these are prescribed. It is conceivable that small individual treatment effects may accumulate over time and gain greater clinical importance. Considering this it seems important that future studies investigate standing in a wider range of settings, including at home. Evaluating the probable multidimensional effects of standing using standardized measures would provide greater insight and be more cost effective than studies focused on a single outcome. For instance, evaluating effects on body structure, activity and participation in relevant areas (e.g. calf muscle length and spasticity, bone mineralization at the tibia, standing transfer ability, pain and quality of life). Any potential benefits of standing may not be achieved if compliance is low. Studies of standing need to collect more information about adverse events and factors that influence compliance (e.g. comfort). Qualitative research that explores the views and experiences of people with neurological disability and their carers about standing could contribute valuable information. Standing programmes need to be effective, tolerable and accepted if they are to enhance quality of life.</p>
