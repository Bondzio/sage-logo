<p>The traumatic border shifts and population upheavals of the mid-twentieth century destroyed the multiethnic patchwork of Central and Eastern Europe forever, replacing it with officially homogenous nation-states separated by rigid borders. In the space of decades, even years, the charred remains of a synagogue in Austria, a Junker estate in Silesia, a Polish manor house in eastern Galicia, or an Orthodox chapel in western Galicia more resembled ancient Roman ruins than the lively centers which exiled Jews, Germans, Poles, and Ukrainians remembered from their intimate pasts. It is, as Philipp Ther observed in 2001, <disp-quote>
<p>no exaggeration to say that a person who left East-Central Europe in 1938 would probably not have recognized it in 1948. By then, most Jews had been killed by the Nazis and many survivors had emigrated either to Israel or the United States. The German minorities were almost completely eliminated, including the population east of the Oder and Neisse. The Polish presence in Wilno (Vilnius), Lwow (L’viv), and in the former eastern territories of Poland was also radically reduced. In turn, up to 650,000 Ukrainians were removed from southeastern Poland.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0265691413478087">1</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The political stakes involved in assessing the many overlapping waves of displacement, in which perpetrators and victims regularly switched roles, makes such an appraisal a seemingly impossible task. Nonetheless, the epochal significance of the cataclysm that destroyed and remade East Central Europe in the modern era demands researchers who are dedicated to exploring the grievances of history with detachment, as an object of study, rather than a departure point for contemporary politics.</p>
<p>This essay explores recent scholarly approaches to ethnic cleansing and its legacies in twentieth-century Europe, with special attention to four studies that exemplify recent trends. Since the nationalist polarization that was prevalent before 1989, scholarship has been significantly enhanced by a rise in international collaboration and consensus. One could describe it as the fading of the era of the ‘Warring Scholars’ and the rise of a post-Cold War ‘Pax Scholastica’. Emphasis on recent international discussion does not imply that controversy and debate have departed from the mainstream scholarly field; rather, the national lenses through which scholars once depicted the history of twentieth-century population policies have lost their utility with the growing unlikelihood that these new borders and migrations will ever be reversed through some new upheaval, whether by war or diplomacy.</p>
<p>The new approaches that have thus become possible in today’s ‘Pax Scholastica’ will be highlighted in this essay over the course of three sections. Looking first at the recent work of Philipp Ther and Alexander Prusin, it will show how scholars have begun to write a new ‘grand narrative’ of the last century’s interconnected waves of ethnic cleansing and genocide. Second, the essay will examine how, with the period of the ‘Warring Scholars’ drifting into the past, the warring scholars themselves have become objects of study. Taking special note of Christian Lotz’s research, this section will trace the evolving debates and methods of nationalist mythmakers. The third and last section will ask what is at stake in the comparative approaches that have become possible in the new ‘Pax Scholastica’, and what is necessary for them to succeed.</p>
<p>Although the term ‘ethnic cleansing’ only appeared in the parlance of international law during the 1990s Yugoslav Wars, the concept of ‘cleansing’ a population reaches back into the propaganda of perpetrators throughout the century, referred to as <italic>Säuberung</italic> (German), <italic>očysta</italic> (Czech), <italic>oczyszczenie</italic> (Polish), <italic>chishchenie</italic> (Russian), <italic>čišćenje</italic> (Serbo-Croatian), and <italic>épuration</italic>, or purification (French). All along, ‘ethnic cleansing’ has fit its present definition as the systematically organized forced migration of an ethnic or national population and the accompanying attempt by the new occupying authority to eliminate all material traces of the former culture (see also Ther, 7–10, 271–3). In contrast, ‘genocide’ (according to the 1948 UN convention) requires the intended destruction of the biological substance (rather than displacement) of the targeted population (as was the case in the Holocaust). Ethnic cleansing usually involves a high mortality rate, but this is not the foremost intention of the perpetrators.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0265691413478087"><title>Grand Narratives about the Century of Expulsions</title>
<p>In his recently translated monograph about ‘how Breslau became Wroc<italic>ł</italic>aw during the century of expulsions’, Gregor Thum investigates Silesia’s capital as a case study in ethnic cleansing, identifying patterns that could be applied more broadly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0265691413478087">2</xref></sup> Taking the opposite approach, Ther and Prusin embrace a geographically and temporally expansive view, applying the findings of local studies to produce a meta-narrative. Whereas Ther explores twentieth-century ethnic cleansing across Europe and even southern Asia, Prusin confines his work to Russia’s western borderlands, a zone somewhat contiguous with the ‘Bloodlands’ recently explored by Timothy Snyder in his own grand narrative.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0265691413478087">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Drawing on hundreds of recent studies, Ther, who had established himself as an expert on post-1945 German-Polish migrations with a previous monograph,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0265691413478087">4</xref></sup> now provides a survey which is simultaneously a textbook and a specialist study. His book, the title of which could be translated as <italic>The Dark Side of Nation-States: ‘Ethnic Cleansing’ in Modern Europe</italic>, integrates twentieth-century European, eastern Mediterranean, and even south Asian forced migrations into a single narrative, without privileging one over the other. Employing the theories of Benedict Anderson and Eric Hobsbawm, Ther observes that ethnic cleansing was rooted in the nationalist thinking of the nineteenth century and the resulting ideal of the homogenous nation-state. This was intensified by the rise of census data as a means of classifying minorities within the nation, giving no quarter to nationally uncommitted regional populations, such as Upper Silesians or Alsatians (66). Applying the work of Zygmunt Bauman, Ther also links the outbreak of ethnic cleansing with the modern urge to rationalize and order. Above all, Ther insists that ethnic cleansing was made possible, not by the ‘irrational’ hatred of ordinary citizens toward their neighbors, but rather by the ‘rationally planned’ treaties signed by the great powers (16).</p>
<p>Ther traces the evolution of ethnic cleansing over four periods. The first began with the Balkan wars of 1912–13, which were marked above all by the violent expulsion of Muslims to Turkey. Continued ethnic cleansing in the eastern Mediterranean during and after the First World War was both justified and furthered through diplomatic agreements among the Western powers and affected states. In the larger scheme of the history of ethnic cleansing, the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) not only gave official sanction to the movement of about 1.2 million Christians and 400,000 Muslims: it became a model for ethnic cleansing to come (46–7, 100–1). Of course, apart from the eastern Mediterranean (and Alsace, where about 150,000 Germans were expelled), most of interwar Europe was governed by the concept that national states should protect the rights of minorities. This ended with the advent of a second period which Ther sees as beginning in 1938, when the Munich Agreement (again, signed by the major powers) broke with interwar minorities policy by sanctioning the Nazi creation of more homogenous German and Czechoslovak nation-states. The Nazis attempted to realize a German-dominated racial empire through ethnic cleansing in occupied Poland, but ultimately the Holocaust and invasion of the Soviet Union prevented them from realizing this goal.</p>
<p>The third period was already anticipated by the 1942 British agreement to transfer the entire German minority from Czechoslovakia. Although in continuity with the 1938 decision at Munich, namely that nations should be constructed around ethnic boundaries, it determined that Germans would now comprise the displaced population. Likewise, the decision to shift Poland to the West meant the displacement of the resulting minority populations. A paradigm shift occurred: this was no longer population exchange (two nations agreeing to exchange minorities), but population transfer (affecting one group moved in one direction). Such transfers impacted the losers of the war: notably Germany, but also Finland and Hungary. Ther also demonstrates how the ‘European model’ of ethnic cleansing and homogenization was transferred to India/Pakistan, where during the same period enormous population upheavals took place. The fourth period, the wars in 1990s Yugoslavia and the Caucasus, represented a return to the mid-century ethnic cleansing patterns of violence and displacement in the name of the homogenous nation-state.</p>
<p>Like Ther, Prusin covers most of the twentieth century, but his focus on the borderlands – and his different take on the roots of ethnic conflict – leads him to emphasize different turning points. Whereas Ther identifies nationalism, modernity, and international treaties as causes for ethnic violence, Prusin gives greatest weight to the ‘nationalizing policies of the state’, which he contends stood in direct conflict with the ethno-cultural diversity of the borderlands. German, Habsburg, and Russian authorities had striven throughout the pre-1914 era to impose supranational identities on their multiethnic borderland subjects, meaning that ‘in Galicia one could be a Ukrainian nationalist and at the same time an ardent Austrian patriot’ (4–5, 254).</p>
<p>This comparatively peaceful era ended with an acceleration of conflict between state authorities and borderland populations from 1914 onward. War prompted imperial authorities to act on their long-held suspicion of borderland groups, leading to waves of forced migrations, especially in Western Russia as the Germans advanced (54–6). The sudden disappearance of the empires and their replacement with nationalist successor states intensified conflict, not least because these states ‘failed to produce a supranational ideology’ and instead oppressed their minority populations as threats to state security (124). In 1939, the invading Soviets initiated ethnic violence in the name of class conflict, while the Nazi state integrated popular anti-Semitism into its overarching programme for the Holocaust (154). In keeping with the latest scholarly findings, the ethnic cleansing after World War II appears continuous with wartime violence, although Prusin reinserts his central thesis by showing that the Soviet authorities quickly quelled violence hostile to the state through repression and deportation (208). So it was that the centralizing state continued to arbitrate the fate of local nationalist movements until its collapse. For with the end of the Cold War, the very nationalities the state had sought to manage suddenly helped to hasten its demise.</p>
<p>Both grand narratives share the view that state actors exerted greater influence than local neighbors in facilitating and legalizing ethnic violence. Much as Ther assigns the greatest blame to the Great Power signatories, Prusin accuses whatever state authorities happened to have had power. Yet at times Prusin may go too far, portraying local populations as passive and malleable under ‘the state as the main instigator of violence’ (5–6). This is made more problematic due to his view, questioned by many leading scholars,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0265691413478087">5</xref></sup> that nationalism was worse in Eastern Europe because the region ‘lagged behind’ Western Europe’s political and socio-economic achievements (11–12, 253–4). This differentiation between East and West is hard to accept on many levels, not least given Ther’s successful demonstration that ethnic cleansing itself is a modern process that originated in the eastern Mediterranean and then spread into other parts of Europe.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0265691413478087"><title>From ‘Warring Scholars’ to ‘Pax Scholastica’</title>
<p>It should come as little surprise that nationalist mythologies prevailed during and in the aftermath of ethnic cleansing. With roots in longstanding ethnic and territorial irredentist claims, the mythologies deployed to justify crimes of mass deportation tended to come from well-established scholarly collaborators, even initiators in the nationalist project. Just as physical signs of the former population’s existence had to be erased or explained away, history itself had to be ‘cleansed’: whole ethnic groups had to vanish from the historical narrative, replaced by eternalized myths about ‘recovered’ territories, in order to defend the occupation of contested lands and transform the occupiers into a nation of victims overcoming injustice. In the case of West German and Polish scholarship, a binary, back-and-forth struggle arose, in which each camp became a mirror image of the other. Though some amateur, nationalist scholarship still draws on these myths, mainstream historiography since the end of the Cold War has largely sought an impartial orientation, to the point that earlier nationalist mythmakers themselves have become objects of study. Hermann Aubin, the father of postwar German <italic>Ostforschung</italic> (Research of the East), and Zygmunt Wojciechowski, the father of the postwar Polish <italic>myśl zachodnia</italic> (Western Thought), have been critically assessed in the scholarly biographies by Eduard Mühle and Markus Krzoska.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0265691413478087">6</xref></sup> Meanwhile, Christian Lotz has exhibited the contending interpretations of the expulsion of Germans from Eastern Europe by East and West German state and church functionaries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0265691413478087">7</xref></sup> Alongside the official politics of memory, ‘Pax Scholastica’ scholarship has also turned to another legacy of ethnic cleansing: the grassroots culture of commemoration. For the West German case alone, Robert Moeller, Jutta Faehndrich, and Andrew Demshuk have investigated how memories of ethnic cleansing and commemorative practices devoted to the lost homeland have influenced the evolution of expellee political outlook, nostalgia, and potential for healing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0265691413478087">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lotz’s latest work assesses the battle between German and Polish nationalist cartographic representations of the contested territories. Drawing on archival sources and published propaganda tracts and maps, he shows ‘how and why the content and form in Polish, West German, and East German foreign tourism maps changed after the Second World War, and what kinds of overlap or tension were revealed from one map to another’. Printed maps, Lotz argues, can illustrate how concepts of territory in the ‘mental map’ of leaders on both sides alternately depicted the past, present, and future of the prewar German borderland (8). As a matter of course, each side applied either German or Polish names to the contested territories. Some early Polish maps featured the borderland as a separate entity with ancient Polish cultural ties, but most portrayed it as ‘a self-evident part of the national territory’: the entire country was painted as a uniform whole, its transit networks, tourist attractions, and economic centers interconnected without reference to recent border and population shifts (33). This served to foster the appearance that the lands were and had always been integral parts of the Polish nation. Meanwhile, West German maps portrayed the 1937 borders to sustain territorial claims, inscribing the Oder-Neisse and East German territories respectively as ‘currently under Polish (or Soviet) administration’ (15). Yet the West German mental map beyond the Iron Curtain was far from certain: in contrast to plentiful geographical, cultural, and economic attractions indicated in the West, maps tended to leave spaces east of the Iron Curtain all but empty, sketching just a few major cities and roadways (18–19). Finally, East German maps either focused entirely on the ‘island’ of their tiny communist state or (before 1959) placed East and West Germany on the same map, as if to anticipate a future, united, socialist Germany (24).</p>
<p>Ideological-political tensions entered the public arena at Western events like the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels or fairs at Utrecht through the early 1960s. Polish observers raised a commotion at each event (and whenever they acquired internationally distributed West German tourist maps bearing the 1937 borders), thwarting Bonn’s attempt to separate itself from Germany’s territorial expansionist past, and giving East German delegates the chance to point to their maps as proof that theirs was the more tolerant Germany (71–2). By 1967, growing West German opposition to the maps, effective emphasis on Polish maps of Nazi crimes, and international indifference to German claims led to Polish success in banning maps with the 1937 borders from public exhibitions in Western countries – though domestically, the borders continued to appear in West German publications, especially school atlases, throughout the Cold War. Only since 1989 has genuine progress been achieved toward standardizing cartographic representations of the ethnically cleansed territories.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0265691413478087"><title>Comparative Approaches: Possibilities and Perils</title>
<p>As ‘Pax Scholastica’ scholars dispense with the emotional and politicized debates of the past, some have attempted to compare ethnically cleansed populations, even across radically different regions and time periods. Among many recent comparative approaches to European ethnic cleansing, two of the most commonly referenced have been Norman Naimark’s <italic>Fires of Hatred</italic> and the edited textbook <italic>People on the Move</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0265691413478087">9</xref></sup> For such works to be successful, two prerequisites need to be satisfied. First, a comparative history must critically evaluate the historical progression that led to each instance of ethnic cleansing. Merely placing ethnically cleansed populations side-by-side as fellow victims has the potential to erase this causality, with hazardous results. For instance, while not attributing ‘collective guilt’, one must identify preceding Nazi racial policies as the leading cause for the expulsion of Germans from Eastern Europe. Second, one should be skeptical of preferential victim narratives: again using the example of German expellees, the cult of West German victimhood in the 1950s helped many to ‘forget’ preceding German crimes. Having closely examined these prerequisite factors, there is much one could compare in cases of ethnic cleansing: it is never ‘orderly and humane’ and usually executed violently amid warlike conditions; it always yields the trauma of uprootedness; amid struggles for integration in the receiving territory, it often generates return-movements with tribal or nationalist characteristics; and it ruptures historical memory, stimulating serious damage to cultural artifacts (through erasure, neglect, etc.) and a pervasive sense of nostalgia and homesickness.</p>
<p>Ther, after laying out a contextual framework for each displacement and identifying the victims’ shared status as suffering human beings, compares his cases by referring to four overarching trends. First, as noted above, ethnic cleansing was rooted in nationalism and modernity. Second, although at first a ‘war mentality’ yielded lawless attacks by war-ravaged populations, it was the ‘rational’ decision-making of the Great Powers (such as at Lausanne or Potsdam) which usually allowed most of the displacement to take place. Third, one can trace an exponential increase in the number of victims as the century progressed, starting with the forced migrations from Macedonia, western Thrace, and Alsace during and after World War I, and climaxing with the Nazi population policies and ethnic cleansing they inspired during and after World War II. Finally, many population policies were utopian schemes to create homogenous nation-states and enacted especially in contested border regions, which the perpetrators hoped to gain at a future peace conference (274). The past could also motivate displacement, as when the Allies decreed the deportation of Germans from Eastern Europe as punishment for German crimes and to prevent German minorities from fostering future conflict.</p>
<p>Looking to the aftermath of World War II, Pascal Maeder compares expellee integration in West Germany (a devastated country accommodating almost 9 million expellees, one-fifth of the overall population) and Canada (a prosperous country accommodating over 36,000 expellees, less than one-third of the overall postwar German migration to Canada). Perhaps most interesting, expellees in both contexts clung to regional identities as Pomeranians or Danube Swabians – in West Germany to escape local xenophobia and embrace a regionalized identity, and in Canada to overcome anti-German sentiment and become part of the larger ideal of the ethnic ‘mosaic’ (45–6). ‘In effect,’ he concludes, ‘expellees found ways in both countries to avoid demeaning group labels and assert their place within the nation’ (206). Meanwhile, despite official toleration of expression, ‘the handful of Canadian expellee leaders built only small organizations with very limited political ambitions’, while in West Germany organizations were common and vocal (201). Whereas German Balts or Danube Swabians ‘kept to themselves and concentrated on social and cultural activities’, Sudeten Germans were weakened by political divisions (some had been Social Democrats already exiled to Canada in 1938/9). To sum up Maeder’s analysis, in the end Canadian ‘expellees were only a minority among a minority, which public officials could afford to ignore’ (202).</p>
<p>Finally, comparative approaches to ethnic violence must consider what place should be given to the Holocaust. Prusin’s inclusion of the Holocaust into his long story of Eastern European ethnic violence unintentionally causes it to blur into the background as one more atrocity during civil wars waged by the victims’ Christian neighbors. In contrast, Ther consciously avoids significant any discussion of the Holocaust, because it was not ethnic cleansing but an exceptional case of genocide, an industrialized mass-extermination campaign. It was not an escalation of the ethnic cleansing of the 1930s (like Nazi population policies against Poles), though it was interconnected: alongside their attempt to create ethnically pure states, Hungarians, Romanians, and Bulgarians also deported their Jewish populations into the jurisdiction of Nazi authorities.</p>
<p>In his final section, Ther observes that a review of literature on the subject of ethnic cleansing would ‘fill a multivolume bibliography’ (281). All four books reviewed here provide extensive surveys of the recent scholarship, and the list is impressive. Nevertheless, more works in English are needed for cases which have not yet received sufficient English-language treatment (one thinks of Karelia, the Crimea, or further case studies in the complex German-Polish-Ukrainian displacement after World War II). Further comparative treatments would also be welcome, especially texts which could be used in undergraduate teaching. To this end, it is hoped that translations of the scholarship by Ther and Lotz will be forthcoming.</p>
