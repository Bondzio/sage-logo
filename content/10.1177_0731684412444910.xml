<p>In this article, poly(p-oxybenzoate) composites with different contents of multi-walled carbon nanotubes were prepared by solution mixing and compression molding technique. The mechanical and tribological properties of poly(p-oxybenzoate) composites were investigated. The wear mechanisms were discussed. The results indicate that with increasing filler content, the compressive strength, hardness, impact toughness and bending strength increase to a maximum and then decrease. Also, the friction coefficient and wear rate of poly(p-oxybenzoate) composites significantly decrease after the addition of multi-walled carbon nanotubes. When the multi-walled carbon nanotubes mass fraction reaches 2 wt.%, the mechanical and tribological properties of poly(p-oxybenzoate) composite are the best. Scanning electron microscopy analysis shows that the wear mechanism of the poly(p-oxybenzoate) samples is delamination and fatigue wear, while the wear mechanisms of multi-walled carbon nanotubes/poly(p-oxybenzoate) composites change to abrasive wear. Therefore, the wear resistance significantly improved.</p>

<p>Poly(p-oxybenzoate) (POB, trade name Ekonol) is a wholly aromatic polyester resin and is employed primarily as engineering plastic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412444910">1</xref></sup> By comparison with other engineering plastics such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyetheretherketone (PEEK), POB has the following outstanding properties: high stiffness and hardness; very low creep; excellent solvent resistance and electrical insulation; high thermal conductivity; excellent self-lubricating; no wear damage to metal surface; excellent high-temperature stability and radiation resistance. Therefore, POB polymer has been widely used in many fields such as machinery, aerospace, electronic instrument, nuclear power, chemical industries to produce compressor rings, ‘O’ rings, piston rings, self-lubricating bearings, rotors or vanes of process pumps, electronic parts requiring high thermal conductivity, slide bearings, bushes, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412444910">2</xref></sup> However, POB polymer also possesses some inherent disadvantages such as high brittleness, difficulty in forming, low bending strength, low tensile strength and elongation at break, relatively high coefficient of friction and low wear resistance, which greatly limited its large-scale applications in engineering field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412444910">3</xref></sup> In order to realize full potentials of the POB material and extend its application fields, the modification of the POB appears very important.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412444910">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412444910">5</xref></sup> It is proved to be an effective method to improve the properties of the POB by incorporating particles or fibers to form POB composites. Sun et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412444910">6</xref></sup> found that the incorporation of Kevlar fibers into the POB matrix significantly improved the impact strength of Kevlar/POB composites, and the friction coefficient of the POB composites decreased compared to pure POB after the addition of carbon fibers. He et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684412444910">7</xref></sup> investigated the effect of the POB filled with PTFE, glass fibers and graphite on the tribological properties, respectively, and found that these composites improved the tribological properties and the PTFE/POB composites exhibited the best tribological performances. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered as ideal reinforcing agents to produce high-performance composites because they possess superior mechanical properties (Young’s modulus: 1 TPa; Bending strength: 14.2 GPa), high aspect ratio (&gt;1000), high electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684412444910">8</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684412444910">11</xref></sup> Therefore, the addition of CNTs in POB matrix is highly expected to improve mechanical and tribological properties of the POB. To the best knowledge of us, this work has not been reported.</p>
<p>In this study, the multi-walled carbon nanotubes/POB (MWCNTs/POB) composites with different MWCNTs contents were prepared. The effect of different contents of MWCNTs on mechanical and tribological properties of POB composites was examined and the wear mechanisms were discussed.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec4-0731684412444910"><title>Sample preparation</title>
<p>MWCNTs were stirred into the mixture of concentrated HNO<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> with a volumetric ratio of 1 : 3. The weight ratio of MWCNTs to mixed acid was 1 : 400. The above MWCNTs mixture was boiled at 80°C for 2 h by stirring at 300 rpm. After this mixture was cooled to room temperature, it was diluted with deionized water and then vacuum-filtered through 0.22 µm millipore PTFE membranes, and washed with an excess of distilled water until the pH value of the filtrate reached approximately 7. The filtrated solid was dried under vacuum at 100°C for 10 h. After pre-treatment of MWCNTs, appropriate mass of MWCNTs and POB powder were combined to achieve 0 wt.%, 1 wt.%, 2 wt.%, 3 wt.% and 4 wt.% MWCNTs/POB mixtures. The powder ensembles were combined with ethanol, mechanically stirred at high speed for 10 min, then ultrasonically dispersed for 1 h (sonotrode: JP-020/S, power output 150 W, Skymen Cleaning Equipment Shenzhen Co. Ltd, China). Then the suspensions were heated to 100°C in a vacuum oven using electric heater for 2 h to remove the ethanol and then further dried under vacuum for 10 h at 80°C to obtain solid MWCNTs/POB mixtures. Following dispersion and drying, the dried powder was compression molded at 380°C under a pressure of 50 MPa for 1 h and then machined into test specimens.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0731684412444910"><title>Mechanical properties test</title>
<p>The compression test took the standard of ISO 604-2002 as a reference and was performed on an electronic universal testing machine Zwick- E (made in Germany). The size of the specimen was 10 × 10 × 5 mm<sup>3</sup>, and the test speed was 2 mm/min. The bending test took the standard of ISO 178-2010 as a reference and was conducted on Zwick-E machine. The size of the specimen was 80 × 10 × 4 mm<sup>3</sup>, and the crosshead speed was 2 mm/min. The impact toughness test took the standard of ISO179-2-1997 as a reference and was done on a tester of XJJ-5 (made in China). The size of the specimen with no notch was 120 × 15 × 10 mm<sup>3</sup>. The hardness test took the standard of ISO 2039-1973 as a reference and was performed on a XHB-3000 digit-display hardness tester (made in China). The indenter comprised a cemented carbide ball and the diameter of the ball was 5 mm. The initial load was 9.8 N and the test load was 132 N with a test of 15 s duration. All the reported results for the mechanical tests were the average of five specimens.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0731684412444910"><title>Tribological proterties test</title>
<p>The tribological property of the composites was evaluated on a ball-on-block reciprocating UMT-2 tribometer at room temperature with a relative humidity of 50%. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412444910">Figure 1</xref> is the sketch of the friction pair (UMT-2, Center for Tribology Inc., California, USA). The specimen was fixed on the surface of reciprocating base plate. The load was applied to the specimen through the counterpart (GCr15 steel ball) fixed in the ball holder. The wear loss of the specimen was measured using the electronic balance (accuracy: 0.1 mg; China). The specific wear rate, <italic>K</italic> (mm<sup>3</sup>/Nm) of the composite was calculated using the equation <italic>K</italic> = <italic>M</italic>/(<italic>gLF</italic>), where <italic>M</italic> is the wear mass in g, <italic>g</italic> is the density of the composites in g/mm<sup>3</sup>, <italic>L</italic> is the total sliding distance in m and <italic>F</italic> is the applied load in N. The specimens were polished using a fine grade SiC emery paper, cleaned ultrasonically with acetone, and dried before testing. The reciprocating friction stroke was 5 mm and tests were conducted at a normal load of 15 N with a reciprocating frequency of 10 Hz. The friction time was 120 min. The counterpart (ball of 3 mm in diameter) was made up of GCr15. The hardness of the counterface was HRC 45 and the surface roughness was 0.1 µm. Five identical specimens were obtained to conduct tribological tests under the same testing conditions. Average values of measured friction coefficient and wear loss were used for further analysis.

<p>The morphology of the wear surface of the specimens was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM: Quanta 200 FEG, FEI).

The specimen surfaces were coated with gold before observation.</p></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec8-0731684412444910"><title>The effects of MWCNTs content on compressive strength and hardness</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412444910">Figure 2</xref> shows representative stress-strain curves of POB and POB composite with 2 wt.% MWCNTs. It can be seen that there is no significant yield point in the compressive curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412444910">Figure 2</xref>. Thus, according to the compressive test standards, the compressive stress at break is defined as the compressive strength of POB and MWCNTs/POB composites, respectively.
<fig id="fig2-0731684412444910" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Typical compressive stress-strain curves of POB and POB composite with 2 wt.% MWCNTs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412444910-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The relationship between MWCNTs content and compressive strengths of the POB composites is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412444910">Figure 3</xref>. The compressive strength of POB composites first increases and then decreases with increasing MWCNTs content. When MWCNTs mass fraction increases to 2%, the compressive strength reaches the maximum (136.5 MPa), which is 30% higher than that of pure POB specimen (105 MPa).
<fig id="fig3-0731684412444910" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Relationship between MWCNTs content and compressive strengths of POB composites.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412444910-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412444910">Figure 4</xref> reveals the relationship between MWCNTs content and hardness of POB composites. It can be seen that the hardness of POB composites increases significantly with the increase of MWCNTs content. When the MWCNTs content varies from 0 to 2 wt.%, the hardness of POB composites is increased sharply from 31 to 40 HBW (Brinell Hardness). As the MWCNTs content is increased from 2 to 4 wt.%, the hardness of POB composites increases slightly and then decreases.
<fig id="fig4-0731684412444910" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Relationship between MWCNTs content and hardness of POB composites.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412444910-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>From the results above, it is found that both compressive strength and hardness of POB composites first increase and then decrease with the increase of MWCNTs. The main reasons are as follows: The hardness of MWCNTs is much higher than that of POB matrix. In addition, a strong π-π interaction may be formed in the interface between the MWCNTs and the POB molecular chains during the process of composites formation.</p>
<p>A π-π interaction was originally proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684412444910">12</xref></sup> as an explanation of the attractive interaction of molecules containing π orbitals, in the absence of spectroscopic evidence for HOMO–LUMO interactions. It is, in fact, an electrostatic interaction in which the offset and/or orientation of π orbitals on opposing molecules maximizes the opposing σ-π attractive interactions while minimizing the opposing π-π repulsive interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684412444910">13</xref></sup> It has been observed that polycyclic aromatic compounds adsorb strongly on graphite surfaces due to the presence of π-π interaction of aromatic ring and graphite surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412444910">14</xref></sup> Also, the adsorption increases in strength with an increasing number of aromatic rings. Carbon nanotube (CNT) consists of one or several graphene sheets rolled up into a seamless tube. The fact has been confirmed that the polycyclic aromatic compounds such as poly(diallyl dimethylammonium) chloride (PDDA), benzyl mercaptan and porphyrin can enter into π-π interactions with the CNTs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684412444910">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684412444910">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412444910">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412444910">16</xref></sup> and such π-π interactions with the CNTs can be surprisingly strong.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412444910">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, the POB resin is a typical wholly aromatic polymer, and benzene ring (−C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>−) in the POB molecular chain was expected to strongly interact with the sidewalls of CNTs via π-stacking to form π-π interaction. The schematic diagram of π-π interaction of CNT and POB molecular chain is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412444910">Figure 5</xref>. When the composites are affected by compressive stress, the matrix can effectively transfer the stress to fillers due to strong interfacial adhesion (π-π interaction) and result in the increase in compressive strength and hardness of the composites. However, higher filler content would result in poor dispersion of nanofillers in the matrix which will lead to stress concentration and thus bring about the decrease in compressive strength and hardness of the composites.

<sec id="sec9-0731684412444910"><title>The effects of MWCNTs content on impact toughness</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412444910">Figure 6</xref> shows the relationship between MWCNTs content and impact strength of POB composites. With the increase of MWCNTs content, the impact strength of POB composites first increases linearly and then decreases slightly. The impact strength of pure POB is 1.4 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>. At 2 wt.% MWCNTs, the impact strength of POB composites reaches maximum value, 8.2 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>, which is approximately 5 times higher than that of pure POB. This result shows that the addition of MWCNTs greatly improved the impact strength of POB composites. The main reasons are as follows: The pure POB specimen is very brittle, which is favorable for fast crack propagation and thus results in its very low impact toughness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412444910">3</xref></sup> However, during the stage of crack initiation and propagation for POB composites, when cracks meet MWCNTs, they could not get through the MWCNTs to propagate continuously. Therefore, MWCNTs will hold back the cracks to form the fracture throughout the whole material. Moreover, during the stage of composites fracture, crack bridging structures are formed between the POB matrix and the MWCNTs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684412444910">18</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412444910">20</xref></sup> and the pull-out of MWCNTs from the matrix must overcome the interfacial adhesion between the matrix and MWCNTs, and some MWCNTs would break, which is helpful for the matrix to dissipate energy. Therefore, the impact strength is greatly improved.
<fig id="fig6-0731684412444910" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Relationship between MWCNTs content and impact strength.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412444910-fig6.tif"/></fig></p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-0731684412444910"><title>The effects of MWCNTs content on bending strength</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412444910">Figure 7</xref> shows the relationship between MWCNTs content and bending strength. With increasing MWCNTs content up to 1 wt.%, bending strength of POB composites hardly increases. In contrast, when the MWCNTs content varies from 1 to 2 wt.%, bending strength of POB composites significantly increases to the maximum value, 80.1 MPa, which is approximately 58% higher than that of pure POB. When the MWCNTs content is over 2 wt.%, bending strength of POB composites sharply decreases. The above results are attributed to the incorporation of the MWCNTs. On the one hand, when a small amount of MWCNTs (less than 1 wt.%) was incorporated into the POB matrix, bending strength of the composites increased very slightly. This similar result was observed by Schulte et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684412444910">18</xref></sup> Due to the absence of stress transfer to internal layers, only the outermost layers of MWCNTs contribute to the mechanical reinforcement. Moreover, an effective surface area of only 9% of the total weight of MWCNTs contributes to the reinforcement of the matrix under given nanotube parameters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684412444910">18</xref></sup> So, the smaller interfacial area may result in no significant increase in bending strength. When MWCNTs content increases up to 2 wt.%, the interfacial area significantly increases and the volume fraction of MWCNTs may reach the maximum. On the other hand, the dispersion of MWCNTs in the POB matrix will also affect the mechanical properties. A relatively small amount of MWCNTs is apt to achieve uniform dispersion and thus to improve the mechanical properties. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412444910">Figure 8(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412444910">b</xref>), it can be seen that the MWCNTs sticking out of the matrix are homogeneously distributed on the fracture surfaces, and most MWCNTs exist in the form of individual MWCNT as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412444910">Figure 8(A)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412444910">B</xref>) – the magnified images of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412444910">Figure 8(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412444910">b</xref>) – respectively. This phenomenon indicates that MWCNTs have good dispersion in POB matrix. However, higher amounts of MWCNTs will lead to entanglement and agglomerate of MWCNTs because of Van der Waals force and thus have negative effect on mechanical properties of the composites. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412444910">Figure 8(c)</xref> shows that the MWCNTs sticking out of matrix surface are entangled with each other, indicating the sign of poor dispersion of MWCNTs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412444910">Figure 8(C)</xref>, the magnified image of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412444910">Figure 8(c)</xref>, shows that the diameter of MWCNTs significantly increased, which implies that MWCNTs begin to be bundled together in POB matrix. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412444910">Figure 8(d)</xref>, it is seen that most MWCNTs assemble at the center of matrix surface and only few individual MWCNTs exist at the edge of debris.

The agglomeration of MWCNTs would act as imperfections in the composite and induce early failure, leading to a rapid decrease in bending strength.

<p>According to the resulting mechanical data, conclusions can be drawn that the mechanical properties of the composites first increased moderately to a maximum (corresponding to approximately 2 wt.% MWCNTs) arising from an increasing interfacial interactions (π-π interaction) between the CNTs and the POB, and then decreased significantly arising from an increasing susceptibility of MWCNTs agglomeration with increasing MWCNTS content. Yang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412444910">21</xref></sup> showed a similar influence of CNTs content on the hardness in the case of polymethylmethacrylate/CNTs (PMMA/CNTs) nanocomposites containing up to 2.5 wt.% carbon nanotubes, and the hardness of the composites was approximately 50% higher (optimum content at 2 wt.%) than that of neat PMMA. Vail et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412444910">22</xref></sup> revealed that the addition of 2 wt.% of single-walled carbon nanotubes in PTFE matrix improved the tensile stress by 51% compared to neat PTFE. The optimum content of carbon nanotubes was 2 wt.%, as observed in the present work.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-0731684412444910"><title>Friction and wear properties of MWCNTs/POB composites</title>
<p>Typical coefficient of friction (COF) curves for the investigated MWCNTs/POB composites are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684412444910">Figure 9</xref>. The COF remains stable within about 2 h. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684412444910">Figure 10</xref> shows the relationship between MWCNTs content and friction coefficient of POB composites. It can be seen that the friction coefficient of POB composites decreases sharply when the MWCNTs content increases from 0 to 2 wt.%, and then increases slightly with the MWCNTs content ranging from 2 to 4 wt.%. The friction coefficient of POB composites reaches the minimum value (0.12) when the MWCNTs content is 2 wt.%, while the friction coefficient of pure POB is 0.29. It indicates that the addition of a certain amount of MWCNTs greatly improved the friction-reducing property of the POB materials.

<p>The variation of specific wear rate of POB composites with increasing MWCNTs content is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0731684412444910">Figure 11</xref>, which exhibits almost the same trend as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684412444910">Figure 10</xref>. It can be seen that the POB composites shows the lowest specific wear rate when the content of MWCNTs is 2 wt.%, while pure POB has the largest one. The specific wear rate of POB composites with 2 wt.% MWCNTs is only one-tenth that of pure POB specimen. The optimum content at about 1–2 wt.% of nano-fillers was also reported by Jacobs et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684412444910">23</xref></sup> It indicates that MWCNTs could significantly reduce the wear loss of POB material so as to effectively improve wear resistance of POB composites.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684412444910">Figure 12</xref> shows the SEM micrographs of worn surfaces of POB composites with different contents of MWCNTs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684412444910">Figure 12(a)</xref>, severe delamination, peeling, some large layered spallings and microcracks can be found on the wear surface of pure POB, which is indicative of fatigue delamination generated under repeated loading during sliding. Fatigue wear has been regarded as a main mechanism responsible for the sliding of pure POB against a hard counterpart.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412444910">17</xref></sup> The model of fatigue wear is based on the sub-surface crack nucleation and coalescence due to shear deformation of the softer surface induced by the traction of harder asperities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684412444910">24</xref></sup> However, the worn surfaces of POB composites are characterized by varying degrees of abrasive wear as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684412444910">Figure 12(b)</xref> to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684412444910">e</xref>).

<p>It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684412444910">Figure 12(b)</xref> that some micrometer size debris and the resulting furrows appear on the worn surface of the POB composites with 1 wt.% MWCNTs. We can infer that MWCNTs might pin POB macromolecular chains on the specimen surface and prevent macromolecular chains from detaching from the POB matrix, thus leading to a sharp decrease in wear rate.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684412444910">Figure 12(c)</xref>, the wear surface of POB composites with 2 wt.% MWCNTs is much smoother than that of pure POB and POB composites with other different contents of MWCNTs, and the extent of abrasive wear is also the smallest. In addition, many tips of MWCNTs are uniformly sticking out of the matrix surface, which could sustain the load and reduce the contact area between two sliding counterfaces. Moreover, few MWCNTs are also observed existing on the matrix surface, which causes the friction form to change from sliding friction to a coexistence of sliding friction and rolling friction. Therefore, the friction coefficient significantly decreased and the wear resistance greatly improved. However, the incorporation of higher MWCNTs content will increase abrasive wear. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684412444910">Figure 12(d)</xref> shows that there are some small pits left on the composite surface, and some agglomerated CNTs (white points) are exposed to small pits, which indicates that the edges of the pits have weak points and stress concentration. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684412444910">Figure 12(e)</xref>, some debris and small holes appear on the worn surface. Especially, there are a few boundaries between the neighboring surfaces, which may be indicative of crack initiation.</p></sec></sec>

<p>In this study, the MWCNTs/POB composites with different concentrations of MWCNTs were prepared by solution mixing and compression molding technique. The mechanical and tribological properties of POB composites were examined. The results show that the mechanical properties of POB composites, such as compressive strength, hardness, impact toughness and bending strength, increased significantly and then decreased with increasing MWCNTs content. The optimum MWCNTs content was obtained at 2 wt.%. In addition, the friction coefficient and wear rate of POB composites sharply decreased with the increase of MWCNTs, and the wear rate of POB composites was one-tenth of that of pure POB materials when MWCNTs content was 2 wt.%. The main wear mechanisms of pure POB were delamination and fatigue wear. After the addition of MWCNTs, the main wear mechanism of POB composites changed to abrasive wear.</p></sec>
