<abstract>
<p>This essay examines natural and artificial signifiers in a tract of colonised land in south-east Australia. The essay asks how do country and human consciousness mingle to fashion each other in long processes of remembrance? How does the present loom out of the past across generations, ecologies and geographies, within communities formed by actively remembering individual psyches? Language is one of these ways. Therefore, the essay pays attention to the form of its writing.</p>

<p>With this essay, I ask, how can tracts of country and drafts of consciousness mingle to fashion each other in long processes of remembrance when the present looms out of the past over lifetimes and across generations, ecologies and geographies, within communities that are persistently meshed by actively remembering individual psyches?</p>
<p>This raises an issue concerning my writing style. In order to take account of the self’s experience in this process of epochal remembering, my writing needs a first-person tone. Critical distance – maintained with third-person diction and disembodied cerebration – misses many of the palpable aspects of remembrance that I must anatomise and survey here. In other words, I want to give you – the reader and rememberer – the option of considering your own inseparability from the experience of remembrance. This is because remembrance happens to you and in you as well as by you. Admittedly, remembrance is often spurred by whatever mnemonic prompts you might encounter at the edges of yourself, but I would be distorting the experience, the <italic>event</italic>, of remembering, if I contrived to keep myself and yourself at a distance from the object of our discourse here. Remembering is a personal, embodied experience.</p>
<p>Therefore, this account puts you in the process. Asking you to project, imagine and remember, my essay starts with you in a car, heading west into young farming country that is also ancient.</p>
<p>After you have driven three hours out of Melbourne, into the pastoral tracts of the region now known as the Western District in the state of Victoria, you cross an exposed flat stretch leading to the town of Camperdown. At the verge of this hamlet, a hillock gives the road a gentle climb and then you ease over the other side of a shallow crest, down to where traffic lights mark the civic edges. I can sketch the scene, from memory, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1750698013482642">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Camperdown is snug in a lull of land that is not quite a hollow. Tidy houses and shops cluster around municipal buildings that are built staunch in the local bluestone. Protected from the tough southerly winds because the streets are cupped all around by modest rises, it is cosier here than on the plain you have just crossed. Everything feels still and settled. Then as you travel northwesterly out the other side of the town, you meet the next undulating crest when you bank left in an arc around the volcanic crater-rim of neighbouring Lake Gnotuk.</p>
<p>At this moment, you comprehend how the hills puckering all around are part of some larger warp-and-weft that is patterned into the country. You recall how the car has been lolling across the countryside for the last hour or so – rising, falling, rising every 500 m – like a boat cruising on the waves of a placid ocean.</p>
<p>In fact, Camperdown nestles between a couple of terrestrial wave-peaks that were made by surface-agitation during volcanic times dating back tens of thousands of years, when all this plain was a smear of lava popping magma bubbles, which formed ringed ridges and craters that soon became lakes. At the outskirts of the town, you can climb one of these ridges to see how the road you have driven along is a record.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1750698013482642">1</xref></sup> The road is a physical analogue of past volcanic actions. Arrayed at geographical scale, the road threads through country that is a materialised index of hot fluid jostling then cooling and solidifying. The country undulates in contact with deep time. The past is right there, laid out in ground that holds an eonic memory. When you envisage the lava oozing, you can see how the country registers its formative fluidity still in its topography today.</p>
<p>Fluidity defines this place. The surface of the land undulates; the weather up above pulses, minute by minute, bringing bluster with the wind and rain; wild, slow-throbbing light flares and bastes bruised clouds tumbling massive above the crater lakes; the temperature rises and falls in a breathing rhythm, as does the humidity and before long, with a slower diurnal beat that draws night-time in, starlight pulses in an obsidian vault.</p>
<sec id="section1-1750698013482642">
<title>Remembering with eels and water</title>
<p>Then there is the annual pulse of the eels, an event that is both naturally immanent and culturally maintained. Across the coastal floodplains at the back-end of the Western District, throngs of eels travel in a breeding cycle that distributes them in prodigious migratory arcs through salt and fresh water from spawning grounds off New Guinea, down past the Barrier Reef and the Eastern Australian Seaboard to the chilly southern ocean, into the Victorian river systems, and then out and north again, 3000 km contrary to the current, back to the tropic Coral Sea.</p>
<p>Numberless generations ago, in the basalt lowlands at the coastal edge of the District, the indigenous people studied the upwelling and draining of the seasonal waters until they learned how to improve the existing landscape by constructing ramparts of stacked-stone that combine artfully with water-scoured run-off channels. Throughout centuries of arduous, unglamorous labour, the people of the eel country fashioned and maintained immense networks of cairned dams that guide the divagating fish across the Lake Condah floodplain. Stacking stone upon stone, the people worked on the country and worked it into themselves, thereby making for themselves an inter-generational identity stitched to this eventful place that they have tended to so persistently and so ritually. With each countless placement and replacement of stone, iteration after iteration, season after season, the people made from the basaltic matter a memory, something purposefully fostered from the past to guide actions in the present and to give momentum to the future. With the accrual of billions of individual exertions performed by the deliberate practitioners of the dam country, culture and nature produced together a legacy for the unborn, a communal memory in and of labour and harvest.</p>
<p>Every year, the eels move through this watery world in teeming numbers, particularly in the rainy season when quick rivulets help the remnant lakes swell, and the volcanic plain fills like a sieved pan. Then as the weather cycle turns and the waters subside, stacked-stone traps herd the oily fish into covert collection bays that have been designed to expose the writhing food when the ebb-flows of water pulse away. Nearby these corrals, you can still visit, touch and <italic>smell</italic> enormous hollowed trees where the eels have long been hung, smoked, dried and stored as sustenance for the coming year.</p>
<p>Imagining the eel harvest, you might begin to understand a cycle of rhythmic and ritualised replenishment that has been made endemic to the Western District, and you might get an inkling of how the natural world can give shape to the cultural world, and vice versa, when the inhabitants and the environment collaborate to put continuous, considered vitality in place over time. This unstinting rhythm of work ensures that the future keeps unfurling through the present out of the past. It is a process that is as historical as it is natural, and it involves memorial practices therefore, practices of statement and reiteration, fabrication, performance and active repetition designed to charge places and times with urgency as well as with semantically communicable meanings and instructions. Over time, by dint of survival, the land and its pulses, its morphology and its people have all been made into a system that garners cross-generational longevity for every vital being that is productively integrated to this portion of the world. So the Western District has stayed coherent. Despite all the depredations in 200 years of colonialism, the District continues to grow out of its remembering past. Vitality thrums here and rules over morbidity. There is something ‘undead’ – something cultural as much as natural – in the place. It is something that has been abraded, but it is not easily stanched.</p>
<p>I borrow this notion of ‘undeadness’ from Eric Santner who, with his enigmatic meditations on the ‘creaturely’ force that he detects in his encompassing world of post–World War II Europe, seeks a kind of spiritual understanding of home that is also pragmatic, historical, ecological and psychological. For Santner, the creaturely force courses through any worldly system that has not succumbed to inertness, any system that has been kept significant through cultural determination. This force ‘constrains’ and ‘excites’ everything in the lively world of knowable experience, granting all elements therein access to the welling ‘dimension of surplus animation’ that he calls ‘undeadness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750698013482642">Santner, 2006</xref>: 105).</p>
<p>This surplus animation is a kind of active worldly memory that is made by people and installed in places and times so that wilful, recalling subjects can reach the richness that past generations have made for the future. The surplus animation is manifest in the material constructs and the ritualised practices and narratives that are more than just latent in the eel country, for example, even in the aftermath of colonialism. This surplus is a practical, deliberately husbanded animation. Not some ineffable, mystical animus, it is a continuously restorative task of active remembering. Understood as a process of applied encryption and exegesis that is active so long as the present is uttered at least somewhat meaningfully out of the past, surplus animation resonates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698013482642">Robert Pogue Harrison’s (2003)</xref> contention that ‘nature and culture have at least this much in common: both compel the living to serve the interests of the unborn’ (p. ix). Which means that everything undead is indebted to the dead because tools and practices of remembrance have let the value of the dead be paid forward in the currency of communicable knowledge that has already been harvested by past sojourners in cultural time and space. Or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698013482642">Pogue Harrison (2003)</xref> explains, ‘the dead, through the care of the living, perpetuate their afterlives and promote the interests of the unborn’ (p. 40). Thus, remembrance can be defined as a deliberately facilitated partnership between the dead and the undead. Therefore, the stones in the eel-traps, for example, are not inert things. They prevail from the past and bring nourishment and a sense of momentum to the cusp of the future.</p>
<p>From the particular qualities of the eel country, we might extrapolate some general principles for defining how memory can be understood as a system of mnemonic prompts, processes and products maintained over generational time on a societal scale. It is with continuous, custodial work – memory-work – that undeadness prevails and the interests of the unborn are served. Remembrance therefore is a stimulated action of retrieval and re-synthesis, something that can be made ready not only in human bodies but also in places, in landscapes, in animals and vegetation, perhaps in minerals too, and in physical forces such as wind patterns, seasonal cycles, tides and humidity rhythms. All this potential for the storage and retrieval of cached knowledge can be made ready for massed memory when appropriate prompts stimulate personal and communal recall in the apposite times and places.</p>
<p>Or such mnemonic readiness might be more resonantly understood as a system of enchantment, provided ‘enchantment’ is defined technically rather than sentimentally, as a constantly reiterated assertion of the utterances that must be remembered. (I take this insight, of course, from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750698013482642">Morris Berman’s (1981)</xref> bold study, <italic>The Reenchantment of the World</italic>.) Such systems of enchantment are usually maintained by myriad reiterating memorialists, only some of whom are human. The vim in undeadness is memory, therefore, which is a persistently activated, integrative force that is made and maintained so that purposes can be pushed deliberately from waned life through death and over to the next generation. Thus, memorial vitality is what keeps societies burgeoning over oblivion.</p>
<p>Pulsing still through the Western District, this combined human and organic memory-system still replenishes against depletion. The District continues to grow out of the past. Undeadness presses through a systematic memory that involves animal, vegetable and mineral components in the pulses of the landscape. And human beings are just one set of agent entities here, merely one of the myriad elements remembering in the place. If you were to insist on a hierarchical account of all life here, then most likely, the eels would be named sovereign. However, really, every remembering element in the District is best understood as an equal (but different) ecological component cohering in a larger, headless body of persistent liveliness that is best known with the Aboriginal-English word ‘country’.</p>
<p>The arrival of Europeans in the Western District two centuries ago damaged the indigenous societies that have been in and of this country for at least 10,000 years, since the cessation of the most recent volcanic activity. There would have been, and may still be, ancient stories accounting for the oozy topographics of this place. Colonialism has assailed the narratively stored and transmitted systems that have long processed the stored information and narrated experiences holding the lore for these primary societies. Much knowledge has gone missing since the influx of the Europeans. Therefore, this old consciousness is grievously dismembered now and can be remembered only with bold speculation. However, some knowledge is still held close, stored in strategic silence, extant among the careful survivors but not shared with the interlopers.</p>
<p>This brings us to a crucial notion, the reason why I have tarried so long in describing the pulsed character of the Western District: for the indigenous and the incursive societies, both, the land itself is a memory-system not unlike the classical mnemonic palaces that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750698013482642">Frances Yates (1969)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698013482642">Jonathan Spence (1985)</xref> once described, but with undulations and organics added. For indigenous and incursive cultures, albeit in different registers and across different arcs of time, memories are deliberately stored all over the country, ready to be recalled in and about particular places when the pertinent seasonal moments and ceremonial conditions dictate. And in this particular place, the stories that are told – by indigenous, by incursive narrators, no matter which – are accounts of <italic>fluidity</italic>. The country dictates that fluidity is definitive of all existence here. Therefore, all that is known and all that is remembered here refers to fluids. Memory itself is unthinkable here except as a system of pulses, as an endlessly sluicing rhythm of depletion and repletion. The country holds memories of fluidity. Indeed, the country shows how memory here <italic>is</italic> fluidity. The country is a tangible, inhabitable example of how memory can work in individuals and communities through human history. This is not to say the country is just a metaphor for memory. Rather, the country here is indistinguishable from memory. The country has been fashioned so by generational work. The country is a materially exact manifestation of how memory can work to make the sensible world at the same time as the world can whelp and host all its memorial entities – animal, vegetable, mineral. The District shows how memory can organise all the undead elements that carry patterns of purposeful action and reactions across all the land’s generations, out of the past into the future.</p>

<title>Memory, country, body and mind</title>
<p>The Australian environment is strewn with the debris of systems that were once functional and robust. These include indigenous systems of hunting and fire-farming, narrative systems that allow the storage and recovery of lore and endemic ecological systems as well as some ancient procedures of land-husbandry that have been recently imported, such as peasant customs (from Asia and from Europe) of agrarian placemaking, plus the metropolitan urbanism of modern capitalist cultures. Especially since the Europeans arrived, much has been forgotten here. Which means there is much to imagine that is necessarily supplementary to the portions that remain now as traces in the landscape, as recall-triggers in the organic and social memory of the place.</p>
<p>This imagining serves the surplus animation that Santner lauds, and it is partly fictive speculation and partly historic remembrance. ‘Remembrance’ is a <italic>bodily</italic> word drawn from two roots: ‘memor’ – to be mindful and ‘membrum’ – a limb. When you remember, you put a body back together by coordinating some disaggregated, wasted or severed members. You re-member a dis-membered thing. You organise thoughts and feelings. With remembrance, you become mindful in the present by bringing component organs of some past body of experience back together in your sense-supplied cognition. And having remembered, you ask yourself, does this thing hold firm now? Is it plausible? Does it flex with the shapes and shifts of my experience? Does it make integrated sense when recalled to the present? Does it feel lively and entire?</p>
<p>Remembrance can help portions of the world persist undead. For example, it helps an inhabited landscape stay known as a live thing, sensible as an integrated body that is always pulsing, spending and replenishing under natural stimuli and human patterns of work. The accrued meaning of a well-remembered part of the world is kept true to the world, as past impressions are matched and proved against present perceptions and future intentions.</p>
<p>More than just a holding bay, though, memory can <italic>recreate</italic> the gone world. In many cultures, memorial ceremonies and performances are often charged with blooming joy rather than with anxious vigilance shored against the leaching that worries with amnesia. This push of thrilling recollection is at the centre of the Japanese haiku, for example. Without memory, the haiku cannot exist. And the haiku exists in service and in celebration of the act of remembrance.</p>
<p>Here is a fine haiku by the Japanese poet Seishi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750698013482642">Blyth, 1964</xref>), a twentieth-century master:<disp-quote>
<p>The signal pistol</p>
<p>Echoes on the hard surface</p>
<p>Of the swimming pool. (p. 346)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And the following tiny gem is by the contemporary Australian writer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750698013482642">Robert Gray (1985)</xref>, matching Seishi for precision even though Gray’s poem is fashioned from a much looser part of the world:<disp-quote>
<p>Torpid farmland afternoons.</p>
<p>A windmill stirs</p>
<p>as a bubble breaks in buttermilk. (p. 91)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Founded on astutely selected and aligned details extracted from the panoply of past experience, entire worlds of palpable and cogent existence are sketched quickly but exactly in these works. Shifts of scale spring from quickly conjured settings. Conjunctions of heat and smell and sound all shuttle across your cognitive frame, putting you here and there in a flash, giving you sudden and intense access to realities within the settings that are being recalled. From the intimacy of your own witnessing body, you span out to encompass sharp details of large places – the hard acoustic slap in a swimming pool that is big enough for tournaments, the almost-imperceptible transpiration across flatland paddocks that need more liquid than raw nature supplies. And then in the next instant, as the meagre syllables slip along, memories pulse suddenly within your sensorium to bring you quickly back close to yourself via past time. All this occurs in a rhythm that folds the larger world and you together in the interlude of a sparkle.</p>
<p>Seishi once explained why utterances as tiny as these can be so thrilling, so revelatory, so poignantly memorial. In an aside made to acknowledge his admiration of the French symbolist poets, he quoted Stéphane Mallarmé’s assertion that ‘[because] objects are already in existence, it is not necessary to create them … all we have to do is grasp the relationships among them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750698013482642">Seishi, 1993</xref>: xix). This chimes well with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750698013482642">Thomas Hoover’s (1978)</xref> vivid account of what happens in a successful haiku: ‘the mind is struck as with a hammer, bringing the senses up short and releasing a flood of associations’ (p. 205). In the moment of intensified interpretation that gets laid out across three concise lines, messy existence can be re-membered as a refined set of organised elements and shaping influences that hold a larger world intensified on a page and poised to expand again as a tiny, apt record in your mind. A cognitive jolt quickens remembrance and sends the pertinent fragments into vivid confluence.</p>
<p>A similar push of replenishment galvanises many indigenous Australian cultures. For example, David Mowaljarlai, the great lore-man and philosopher from Kimberley country in northern Australia used to speak of a guiding force or energy that would ‘swing’ through and around him when he needed orientation in the ‘pattern thinking’ that enlivened him in his home country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698013482642">Malnic and Mowaljarlai, 1993</xref>, passim; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750698013482642">Mowaljarlai, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750698013482642">Muecke, 2004</xref>: 172). My guess is he was describing a very precise form of mindfulness that was informed by his homelands, the place where he learned and taught so much memory-work throughout his long life. Certainly, he was describing remembrance as a joyous, infusing repletion, not an anxious stanch against depletion. There is a vivacious pulse in Mowaljarlai’s language when he describes being in country, washed in the flood of associations. Notably, the Kimberley is water-pulse country too. In this respect (if in almost no other), it is similar to the Victorian Western District. Each place is soaked in its peculiar replenishment animus. Each stretch of country – walked, sung and parsed by its knowledgeable custodians – shows how remembered coherence can surge in a joyous influx. In healthy memory-country, the dismembered mnemonic fragments are poised for the guidance of the celebrating exegete. And although Mowaljarlai would be properly unwilling to espouse about other peoples’ country, I think I can make a general extrapolation from his insights about the Kimberley, to observe that depletion can be overwashed with repletion when recalled fragments integrate to bring the full body of a felt record quickly burgeoning in response to mnemonic triggers that are arrayed across a landscape.</p>
<p>In another of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698013482642">Robert Gray’s (1998)</xref> Australian variations on the haiku form, he observes that<disp-quote>
<p>The world, it seems, is the maximum</p>
<p>Number of things, or of forces,</p>
<p>That can exist together. (p. 296)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Which shows me how to conclude my own brief account of landscape mnemonics here – by carefully mis-remembering and expanding Gray’s canny epigram:<disp-quote>
<p>Serving the undead world,</p>
<p>Memory, it seems, is the most forceful minimum</p>
<p>Number of stored and charged details</p>
<p>That can pulse generatively into each other.</p>

<p>How does a live thing maintain its pulse? It needs to <italic>record</italic> everything that can keep it undead, everything vital for remembrance. ‘Record’ is a startling word. Literally, it means ‘to bring back to the heart’. It is from the root that gives ‘cardiac’ in English, <italic>corazon</italic> in Spanish and <italic>coeur</italic> in French. To prepare something to move again through the heart is what we do when we record. A record well stored and well retrieved can bring life in its connection to the larger body of present knowledge. This notion of a partial body brought back to full liveliness through the activation of records is central to this essay.</p>
