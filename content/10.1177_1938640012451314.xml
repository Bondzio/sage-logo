<abstract>
<p>The reverse camber shoe (RCS) is commonly used for forefoot off-loading during mobilization after forefoot surgery. However, patient satisfaction and compliance may be affected because of the altered gait pattern that is conferred. The aim of this study was to investigate the patient-related factors associated with the compliance in the use of this device. The authors retrospectively reviewed a single surgeon series of 64 patients who underwent forefoot surgery and who were subsequently rehabilitated with early mobilization using the RCS. Data on patient age, arthritic comorbidities, adaptation to device, and symptoms during use were collected via a standardized postal questionnaire. In all, 39 patients complied with the use of the RCS for 8 weeks (group A), whereas 11 patients managed it for less than 6 weeks (group C). Also, 14 patients used the shoe for more than 6 weeks but less than 8 weeks (group B). The authors found that compliance in the use of the RCS is lower in older patients following forefoot surgery. This may be related to poor adaptation in the presence of preexisting arthritis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A multitude of effective osteotomy procedures are recognized in the treatment of hallux valgus deformities of the forefoot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012451314">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012451314"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012451314">3</xref></sup> Stabilization at the osteotomy site remains a key consideration in the postoperative rehabilitation of such ambulatory surgery because the first ray is the most heavily loaded structure during gait.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012451314">4</xref></sup> In particular, weight distribution to protect the osteotomy site is an important issue and can be modified by various methods, which include below-knee walking casts, aircast braces, and a multitude of heel weight-bearing devices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012451314">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012451314"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012451314">7</xref></sup> The reverse camber shoe (RCS) remains a popular orthotic choice in the postoperative rehabilitation after hallux valgus surgery. Previous work has shown the efficacy of off-loading the forefoot using shoes with posteriorly placed heels when compared with barefoot walking or other alternatives such as rocker sole devices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012451314">7</xref></sup> The underlying principle of this device is to provide external fixation and allow partial weight bearing while concomitantly off-loading the forefoot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012451314">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640012451314">8</xref></sup> Under normal circumstances, the forefoot carries 28% of the weight-bearing load. Glod et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012451314">5</xref></sup> have shown that the use of these shoes alter gait patterns by decreasing the average pressure on the forefoot by up to 51.2%. Trnka et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640012451314">8</xref></sup> also demonstrated that during gait, wedge-based shoes provide protection to the operative site by ensuring low peak pressure under the first metatarsal following different osteotomies. The ensuing changes in gait patterns have resulted in reported complications of calf pain with potential problems in adaptation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012451314">9</xref></sup> Certainly, in patients with coexistent hip, knee, or spinal disease or in elderly patients with walking difficulties patient adaptation and compliance using the RCS for postoperative rehabilitation after forefoot corrective surgery is of potential concern.</p>
<p>There is a paucity of information on patient compliance and adaptation in the use of the RCS after forefoot surgery. Its use for symptom control alone has been advocated following scarf osteotomies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012451314">9</xref></sup> whereas others have advocated return to early weight-bearing mobilization because of its stable configuration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640012451314">10</xref></sup> The aim of this study was to investigate patient-related factors that would affect patient compliance and satisfaction in the use of the RCS during ambulation after first metatarsal osteotomies of both stable and unstable configurations for hallux valgus deformities.</p>

<title>Methods and Materials</title>
<p>We identified a single surgeon series of 76 patients who were subjected to forefoot corrective surgery for isolated halux valgus deformities or in combination with lesser toe deformities of the forefoot at our institution. Patients were subjected to either a Chevron or Scarf osteotomy with an additional Akin procedure or a combination procedure with additional Proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) fusions of associated toe flexion deformities. No patient had bilateral procedures. Patients were identified from theater logs and hospital databases. Information on comorbidities and coexisting musculoskeletal disease of the hip, knee, and spine were identified from patient notes, electronically stored outpatient correspondence, and discharge summaries. Data on patient adaptation and compliance were retrospectively collected via a standardized postal questionnaire (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1938640012451314">appendix</xref>). The average amount of time from cessation of the use of the RCS shoe to administration of the questionnaire was 6.2 months (1-11 months).</p>
<p>Our indications for corrective surgery included symptomatic hallux valgus deformities of the first metatarsal. All operations were performed under tourniquet control, inflated to 150 to 200 mm Hg above systolic blood pressure at the midthigh level. A single dose of intravenous gentamicin with flucloxacillin was administered preinduction for infection prophylaxis in all cases except in cases of penicillin allergy, when intravenous vancomycin was used. A standard medial incision was used for exposure and was extended distally or proximally pertinent to the procedure undertaken. Additional soft-tissue release was achieved by performing a second incision in the first dorsal web space when necessary. Following soft-tissue release, fixation of the osteotomies was implemented using 2 Barouk screws (De Puy, Warsaw, IN). In cases where a further Akin’s osteotomy was undertaken, MEMOMETAL varisation staples (De Puy, Warsaw, IN) were used. Associated lesser-toe deformities were treated with PIPJ fusion using 1.5 mm Kirschner wires and associated soft- tissue procedures. Closure of wounds was undertaken using nylon sutures with overlying wool and crepe dressings.</p>
<p>A standardized postoperative rehabilitation protocol was undertaken in all cases. Patients were instructed to mobilize full weight bearing with a RCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640012451314">Figure 1</xref>) for at least 8 weeks starting on the first postoperative day. All patients were assessed in the outpatient clinic at 2 weeks after surgery for wound review and removal of sutures. Subsequently, further follow-up at 4 weeks was undertaken for the removal of Kirschner wires in cases of PIPJ fusion. All patients were assessed clinically and radiographically in the outpatient clinic at a final follow-up of 8 weeks.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 74 patients identified, 64 returned the completed postal questionnaire. The median age was 47.5 years (22-73 years) with a male to female ratio of 1:20. The mean BMI of the patients was 27.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. There were 52 cases of biplanar chevron’s of which 24 had an additional Akin’s procedure. There were 12 cases of Scarf’s osteotomy. Additional PIPJ fusion procedures were undertaken in 12 cases—10 in the biplanar chevron’s group and 2 in the Scarf group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1938640012451314">Table 1</xref>). Also, 10 patients developed minor, early postoperative complications during follow-up: 4 patients developed superficial wound infection, which was treated successfully by oral antibiotics; 3 patients complained of minor paresthesia around the scar and the big toe; and 3 patients had oozing of the wound in the early postoperative period, which was treated with compressive dressing. There were no major postoperative complications such as failures of osteosynthesis or fractures at final follow-up in our series.</p>

<p>The mean time wearing the RCS postoperatively was 7.2 weeks (3.5-12 weeks). Of the 64 patients, 39 wore the shoe for a full prescribed time of 8 weeks or more (group A); 14 patients wore the shoe for more than 6 weeks but less than 8 weeks (group B), whereas 11 patients managed to wear the RCS for less than 6 weeks (group C). The mean age in group A was 52.5 years (22-76 years); it was 67.5 years for group B (51-79 years) and 68.5 years (57-83 years) for group C. The mean age for all patients who wore the shoes for less than 8 weeks (groups B and C) was 68.1 years. There was a significant difference in age between the 3 groups on ANOVA analysis (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Post hoc Tukey analysis (honestly significant difference) showed no difference between groups B and C but significant difference between group A and the 2 other groups. This was confirmed on comparing the mean ages between patients who wore them for the prescribed period of 8 weeks or more and less than 8 weeks (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001).</p>
<p>The incidence of preexisting osteoarthritis (OA) was lowest in group A with only 1 patient suffering from knee OA and another from preexisting chronic back pain.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study evaluated the patient-related factors associated with compliance in the use of the RCS after forefoot osteotomies for symptomatic hallux valgus deformities. Although various osteotomy procedures have been described for the treatment of hallux valgus deformities, patient-related factors affecting the postoperative rehabilitation and in particular the use of foot orthotic devices following surgery has been less explored. Conventionally, cast immobilization along with a non–weight-bearing period has been advocated after forefoot surgery characterized by less mechanical stability or in those with poor bone quality,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012451314">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640012451314">12</xref></sup> whereas others support early mobilization with good outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640012451314">13</xref></sup> In a series of 43 patients with a standard Mitchell’s osteotomy, there was no difference in terms of time to union or complication between the use of forefoot plaster and wooden sole shoe rehabilitation postoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640012451314">14</xref></sup> Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis has found that early weight bearing and even the use of crepe bandage alone is not detrimental to the final outcome following forefoot surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640012451314">15</xref></sup> However, the importance of the RCS in off-loading the forefoot during rehabilitation after surgery cannot be undermined because off-loading the traumatized area is necessary to ensure bone healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012451314">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640012451314">16</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that patient adaptation and compliance in wearing these shoes could be related to their age and preexisting comorbidities. Patients who managed to wear the RCS for the full prescribed time of 8 weeks or more (group A) were significantly younger compared with the other groups (B and C). They had fewer preexisting comorbidities, with a lower incidence of pain symptoms related to the use of the RCS. All patients within this group felt that they had adapted to the use of the RCS for the whole treatment period. Patients wearing the RCS for more than 6 weeks but less than 8 weeks (group B) were considered to be partially compliant, whereas those who only managed it for less than 6 weeks (group C) were considered to be noncompliant. There was no difference with respect to age, preexisting comorbidities, and pain related to the use of the RCS when comparing groups B and C. However, patient adaptation was comparatively higher in the former compared with the latter. This can be explained by the fact that causes of noncompliance can also be multifactorial, and social support, support from family, and education about the importance of outcome is necessary for compliance in the elderly population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938640012451314">17</xref></sup> Proper education also reduces unrealistic expectations of the patient, which is also important in the final outcome of the treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938640012451314">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1938640012451314">19</xref></sup> However, we believe that the reason for noncompliance in groups B and C when compared with group A is because of the increased age of patients in these groups apart from their comorbidities. No adverse incidents, such as falls and fractures were reported during our study. But because the RCS shoes are known to change gait pattern,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012451314">9</xref></sup> there will always be the possibility of such complications, particularly with elderly patients with foot problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1938640012451314">20</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>We have a very stringent postoperative rehabilitation protocol supported by physiotherapists and nurse practitioners. Emphasis on reeducation and encouragement to wear these shoes in the postoperative period till 8 weeks are given in the follow-up clinic.</p>
<p>We have identified a few limitations in this study. First, this was a retrospective study, and there were no control groups with which we could compare our results. Second, no power calculations were undertaken; however, we had a good number of patients to arrive at a reasonable conclusion.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We found in our study that the RCS shoes are a safe and effective rehabilitation tool in the early postoperative period after hallux valgus surgery. The RCS shoes protect the operative site and ensure bone healing by off-loading the forefoot postoperatively. However, we believe that clinicians should take into consideration the age and existing comorbidities of the patient. Also, it is essential to have a supporting network of specialist nurses and physiotherapists, as continuity of care and supervision is vital to achieve a satisfactory outcome as regards rehabilitation.</p>
