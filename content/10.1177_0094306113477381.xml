<p>Alluding by its title to Adam Smith, <italic>The Cultural Wealth of Nations</italic> contributes to a field of cultural economics pioneered by scholars such as Viviana Zelizer, that explores the inseparability of economic and cultural domains and more specifically, the creation of economic value through symbolic representations, ritual, and narrative. The editors compiled a number of case studies that illumine the manner in which cultural resources (cultural “heritage,” narratives about artifacts and places, images shaping the perception of products and peoples) are transmuted into economic wealth. The book examines historical processes, institutions, and agents that have effected such transformations, the social actors best positioned to recoup the resulting profits, difficulties encountered in attempts to turn culture to economic ends, and tactics used to surmount them.</p>
<p>The case studies, almost all of which usefully cross-reference one another, stress a common theme: nations, ethnic groups, and diverse economic actors may be advantaged or disadvantaged in efforts to marshal cultural resources to create economic value through “heritage” tourism, the “branding” of nations, peoples, and commodities, and the management of consumer perceptions of production processes.</p>
<p>Several common theoretical perspectives on the transmutation of cultural resources into economic wealth underlie the specific subjects examined by each of the papers. One is that there are asymmetries and inequalities, whether between nations, ethnic and occupational groups, or producers of any marketed commodity, in the power to define cultural values and turn them to economic use. A paper on the history of heritage conservation and on the designation of UNESCO World Heritage sites offers a detailed account of the specific political history, as well as the institutionalized professional power and ethos that resulted in a clustering of designated heritage sites in wealthy nations. These nations are then better positioned than others to recoup the economic value to be culled from the exploitation of heritage sites for tourist and other commercial purposes. A transnational mobilization of conservation professionals, embedded in universities, scholarly disciplines, and cultural bureaucracies has resulted in the institutionalization of rules favoring “cultural heritage” production in some countries more than in others.</p>
<p>Adopting a “global value chain perspective,” some papers demonstrate that in a long chain of production and marketing, in which goods are endowed with symbolic value through branding, design, and narratives targeting particular groups of consumers, the creators of added cultural value often recoup most of the economic value of the final product—for example, companies in the United Kingdom responsible for the branding of South African wine, or middlemen in Thailand selling silk cloth on the internet.</p>
<p>Erving Goffman’s work on impression management, long turned to good use by scholars in the sociology of institutions, occupations, and tourism, is explicitly adopted here as a helpful perspective in the study of cultural economy. What are the options for a country heavily dependent upon international tourism whose image as an attractive destination is spoiled by war and widely circulated images of atrocities? Will it turn the death camps and killing fields into historical “attractions”? Or will it attempt to erase all signs recalling its stigmatizing history, rebranding the nation as identical to that of other countries whose imagery and histories it hijacks as its own? One paper in this volume, analyzing Croatia’s tactics for managing a discreditable national identity in the interests of resuscitating its tourist industry, adopts Goffman’s theory of stigma, suggesting that the consequences of nations’ “rebranding” initiatives may reach well beyond the economic realm.</p>
<p>The creation of economic value through action aimed at managing symbolic imagery, design, and narrative, also shapes landscapes, collective identities, and representations of national history. It often involves conflict as some people’s activities, narratives, and self-images are subordinated to others’ or are even firmly and deliberately suppressed. The outcomes of value-creating social processes may not be fully planned or even anticipated. A paper on the now iconic Tuscan landscape, which endows wine, olive oil, tourist destinations, and innumerable other “exports” with cultural value, charts the creation of this landscape through a combination of relatively recent social and political processes, from post-war land reform, and a crisis in traditional share cropping, to European integration, rural depopulation, tourism, and newly introduced legal constraints upon building. A landscape now widely accepted as the embodiment of centuries old Italian “traditions” is in fact the product of post-war economic, political, and demographic changes. As a consequence of these multiple contingent historical developments, a cultural patrimony was invented and rural Tuscans redefined.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole this volume offers a useful perspective on modes of production of cultural capital, from the branding of products (wine of specified regions, fair trade coffee, “made in Switzerland,” or the USA labels), to the creation and representation, for marketing purposes, of iconic landscapes, world heritage sites, and in an excellent paper on the Mundo Maya, ethnicity. The book stimulates awareness of inequalities in the power and capacity to turn cultural values, meanings, and narratives to economic profit. The reader will be reminded that culture is a dynamic and competitive field, in which all created meanings and marked values are subject to challenge, and in which symbols and narratives lose potency over time unless they are reproduced and adapted to changing circumstances. This is a book that should be required reading for graduate students doing research in heritage management, tourism, and economic development. The theoretical perspective it offers on the inseparability of cultural and economic life will be helpful for any advanced student of sociology, anthropology, or economics. As an undergraduate text however, some of the papers suffer from “socspeak” and might prove a bit dry for young and curious minds not yet consecrated to professional use.</p>
