<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>: This study compared overall bacterial and bloodstream infection rates in patients receiving premixed parenteral nutrition (PN) with vs without lipid emulsion. <italic>Methods</italic>: Data from hospitalized patients who were ≥18 years of age and receiving premixed PN between 2005 and 2007 were extracted from the Premier Perspective database. Data were categorized into 2 groups: patients who received premixed PN only and those receiving premixed PN with lipids. Multiple logistic regression was used to adjust for risk factors and potential confounders, reporting the probability of risk for an infection. <italic>Results</italic>: The group without lipids was observed to have lower rates of both overall bacterial infection (43.5% vs 53.5%) and bloodstream infection (14.5% vs 18.9%). However, after adjusting for baseline characteristics, there were no significant differences in overall risk of bacterial infections (51.4% vs 53.5%; odds ratio [OR] = 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96–1.27) or bloodstream infections (19.6% vs 19.2%; 0.97; 0.81–1.16). In a subset of patients in the intensive care unit for ≥3 days, lower overall bacterial infection rates (58.3% vs 67.3%) and bloodstream infection rates (31.0% vs 37.0%) were observed in the group without lipids. After adjustment, there were no significant differences in risk of overall bacterial infection (OR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.75–1.22) or bloodstream infection (0.92; 0.71–1.19) between the 2 groups. <italic>Conclusions</italic>: When administered with premixed PN, lipid emulsion was not significantly associated with an increase in the risk of infectious morbidity when compared to omitting lipids from therapy.</p>

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>Reducing the risk of bloodstream infection in parenteral nutrition (PN) patients has the potential to improve both clinical and economic outcomes. This study was able to retrospectively evaluate the correlation between the administration of lipid emulsions and bloodstream infections in PN patients. The use of a large data source helps to produce more generalizable results and provides insight for future prospective research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0148607111420061" sec-type="intro">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In May 2009, the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (SCCM/A.S.P.E.N.) released joint guidelines for the provision and assessment of nutrition support therapy for critically ill adult patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111420061">1</xref></sup> These guidelines, although recognized as controversial, state that when enteral nutrition (EN) is not feasible and parenteral nutrition (PN) is necessary, soybean oil–based lipids should be omitted from therapy during the first week of hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU). It is important to recognize that soybean oil–based lipid emulsions are the only type of lipid emulsion available at this time in the United States.</p>
<p>The committee supported its lipid-omitting recommendation with a grade D evidence rating because it is supported by one small clinical trial (n = 57).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111420061">2</xref></sup> Battistella et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111420061">2</xref></sup> showed a reduction in infectious morbidity, decreased hospital length of stay (LOS), decreased LOS in the ICU, and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation in patients receiving PN without a soybean oil–based lipid emulsion (n = 27) compared to those on PN with a soybean oil–based lipid emulsion (n = 30). Although patients in this study were matched for overall injury severity and degree of head and chest injuries, the nonprotein calories were not matched. Patients administered PN without lipid emulsion were “underfed” for the 10-day study period. This confounding variable prevented definitive conclusions from being made regarding the relationship between soybean oil–based lipid emulsions and the patients’ susceptibility to infection.</p>
<p>In the current analysis, we present data from a large retrospective study of patients receiving PN with and without a soybean oil–based lipid emulsion. The purpose of this study was to compare overall infection and bloodstream infection (BSI) rates in a large inpatient population who received PN to determine if including lipids with PN therapy was an independent predictor of infections.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-0148607111420061">
<title>Data Source</title>
<p>We explored infectious complications associated with the use of soybean oil–based lipid emulsions in patients receiving premixed PN using claims data from a nationally representative group of hospitals managed by Premier healthcare alliance. The Premier Perspective database is the largest inpatient clinical and financial data warehouse in the United States, containing more than 45 million discharges from acute-care facilities. Data records include patients’ complete billing and coding history, with procedures, medications, laboratory, diagnostic, and therapeutic services detailed at the individual level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0148607111420061">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>We included all hospital inpatients at least 18 years of age who received any premixed PN product between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007. Excluded were all patients who were admitted with a primary or secondary outcome, including any bacterial infection, hepatic dysfunction, hypoglycemia, acute cholecystitis, phlebitis, or thromophlebitis (because these conditions were study outcomes of interest).</p>
<p>All patients received commercially available premixed PN via a dual-chamber bag with glucose and amino acids, which may have included additional minerals, vitamins, and/or electrolytes. PN use was identified via charge codes in the Premier charge master file, which was searched for the standard charge code description, clinical detail description, clinical summary description, and product name. Patients received their PN either with supplemental soybean oil–based lipid emulsion or without. Lipid emulsions were administered either through a separate line or piggybacked through the PN line rather than being added to the PN container.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0148607111420061">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>The primary outcomes of interest were patients who had any bacterial infection or a BSI. Patients with BSIs (bacteremia or septicemia) were identified by a charge for an intravenous (IV) antibiotic and a diagnosis identified via <italic>International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision</italic> (<italic>ICD-9</italic>) codes 038.2, 790.7, 999.31, or 996.62. Patients with any infection were identified by an IV antibiotic charge and at least 1 <italic>ICD-9</italic> code used by previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607111420061">3</xref></sup> as indicators of bacterial infection and BSI. Outcomes were compared for all patients in the 2 treatment groups, with a separate subanalysis of patients who were in the ICU for at least 3 days.</p>
<p>Secondary outcomes included hospital LOS, reported to the day per the hospital billing charges. The use of ICU was flagged if a patient had at least 1 ICU room and board charge, and the LOS in the ICU was calculated as the number of ICU room and board charges per patient. Discharge statuses were also analyzed, including in-hospital deaths and readmission within 2 months.</p>
<p>Other secondary clinical outcomes were adverse events potentially related to PN administration, including hypoglycemia (<italic>ICD-9</italic> code 251.2), hepatic dysfunction (<italic>ICD-9</italic> codes 570 and 572.2), acute cholecystitis (<italic>ICD-9</italic> code 575.0), use of ursodeoxycholic acid or cholecystokinin, phlebitis or thrombophlebitis of the upper extremities, and pulmonary embolism (<italic>ICD-9</italic> codes 451.82, 451.83, 451.84, and 415.1x).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0148607111420061">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Baseline demographics, comorbidities, and hospitalization characteristics were reported descriptively for each treatment group using means (with standard deviations) and medians (with ranges) for continuous variables and by raw counts (with percentages) for categorical measures. Differences were reported via χ<sup>2</sup> for categorical measures, <italic>z</italic> tests for proportions, and <italic>t</italic> tests for continuous variables. Observed incidence rates for outcomes were reported by treatment group.</p>
<p>All Patient Refined Diagnostic Reported Group (APR-DRG) classifications are generally used to estimate severity of illness and risk of mortality. APR-DRGs are widely used in health services, quality improvement, and economics research and by many states for public reporting. The APR-DRG software organizes about 20,000 clinical diagnoses and procedures into about 300 groups at 4 levels of severity (minor, moderate, major, and extreme). APR-DRGs were reported descriptively.</p>
<p>Comorbidities were reported based on <italic>ICD-9</italic> codes and/or billing charges that included malnutrition (<italic>ICD-9</italic> codes 260, 261, 262, 263.x, 264.x, 265.x, 266.x, 267, 268, 269.x), intestinal malabsorption (<italic>ICD-9</italic> codes 579.x), acute pancreatitis (<italic>ICD-9</italic> code 577.0), peritonitis (<italic>ICD-9</italic> codes 567.x, excluding 567.3), gastrointestinal fistula (<italic>ICD-9</italic> code 537.4), Crohn disease (<italic>ICD-9</italic> codes 555.x), malignancy (<italic>ICD-9</italic> codes 140.x–209.3x), cirrhosis or chronic liver disease (<italic>ICD-9</italic> codes 571.x-573.x), renal failure (<italic>ICD-9</italic> codes 584.x and 585.x), diabetes (<italic>ICD-9</italic> codes 250.x), and tuberculosis (<italic>ICD-9</italic> codes 010.x–018.x).</p>
<p>Multivariate logistic regression was used to create a model that estimated the risk of infection for patients receiving premixed PN with or without lipid emulsion. The model adjusted for risk factors and potential confounders available in the database, including hospital variables (size, geographic region, teaching status, and urban/rural location), patient demographics (age, sex, ethnicity, payor), patient comorbidities, and other indicators of acuity (emergency or urgent admission, surgical status, prior surgery or prior PN). APR-DRGs were not included in the model, which are assigned at discharge and would be dependent on study outcomes (ie, a serious bacterial infection during hospitalization would result in a more severe APR-DRG categorization) and thus would be inappropriate to include in the model.</p>
<p>The initial model contained all independent variables listed above. Variable-selection procedures were aimed at selecting a reduced set of independent variables providing the best fit of the model. The final model was determined using backward elimination variable selection, with a significance level of .10 of the Wald χ<sup>2</sup> statistic to specify the covariates that would remain in each step. Model fit was assessed using the C-statistic, which corresponds to the area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve indicates the probability that randomly selected patients with the event have a higher predicted probability of the event than randomly selected patients without the event. Risk of infection was reported as adjusted probability of the event that compared with lipids vs without and odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence level. Further details on the analysis of these data, including sensitivity analyses and other data integrity safeguards, are discussed in Mercaldi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607111420061">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>As propofol use (a lipid-based delivery system) might confound the effects of lipid emulsion, an additional analysis was performed comparing the overall infection and BSI rates among patients without any propofol use.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Overall, 11 million inpatients were in the Premier database between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007. After excluding patients who were younger than 18 years of age, those who met the exclusion criteria, and those who did not have any billing charge for a premixed PN product, the final sample size was 4669 patients: 2023 without lipids and 2646 with lipids. Among them, 1464 patients spent ≥3 days in the ICU: 564 without lipids and 900 with lipids.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607111420061">Table 1</xref> compares the baseline characteristics of the patients who received premixed PN with and without lipids. In general, the group who received lipids were slightly younger and in larger urban hospitals, had more surgeries, and were more likely to be diagnosed with peritonitis or cancer but less likely to have diabetes. For the subset of patients in the ICU ≥3 days, baseline characteristics were similar between patients who received premixed PN with and without lipids except for urban location, prior PN use, peritonitis, cancer, and diabetes.</p>

<p>Observed infection rates trended higher in patients receiving lipid emulsion in all groups, but failed to reach a significant difference. Infections of any type were observed in all patients at a rate of 53.5% vs 43.5% (P&lt;.0001) with lipid vs without lipids while observed BSIs were 18.9% vs 14.5% (P&lt;.0001).

After adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607111420061">appendix</xref>), the probability of any infection in the overall study population was no different between the groups with or without lipids (OR = 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96–1.27; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607111420061">Figure 1</xref>). Similarly, there was no difference in the probability of BSI between groups (OR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81–1.16) in the overall study population.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Data from the Premier Perspective database were used to retrospectively compare infectious and other outcomes in hospitalized patients receiving premixed PN with vs without lipids. The unadjusted results showed that the use of premixed PN with lipids was associated with higher incidences of overall infections and BSI, as well as longer hospital and ICU stays. However, after adjusting for the poorer initial health status of patients receiving PN with lipids, the probability of developing any infection or a BSI was similar between groups. Of particular importance, fewer patients who received premixed PN with lipids died, in both the entire study population and the ICU subset. The reason may be partly explained by the beneficial effect of lipids in avoiding a calorie deficit that could lead to poor outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607111420061">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>We recognize that the majority of BSIs are related to the use of central venous catheters (CVCs) with multiple contributing factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111420061">6</xref></sup> To suggest that lipids are the sole contributor to the differences in infection rates in this study would be conjecture. However, a cohort study comparing the incidence of BSI among patients using a CVC with and without PN found that PN was an independent risk factor for BSI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111420061">7</xref></sup> These findings suggest that either some component of the PN or particular characteristics specific to PN patients are different from other patients with CVCs. It is well recognized that lipids are good bacterial growth media.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607111420061">8</xref></sup> This characteristic has led to the hypothesis that lipids are the likely PN contributor that increases BSI risk. Yet, the findings from this study do not support that hypothesis and present a contrast to the Battistella et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111420061">2</xref></sup> study. The reason for the different findings might be related to the study population and design. We included a broader and larger patient population using a claims database, whereas Battistella et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111420061">2</xref></sup> limited their prospective study to a small group of trauma patients. Our study also removed the influence of hyperglycemia as a potential confounder because there was no difference in that secondary outcome between groups in either the overall study population or ICU subgroup.</p>
<p>Although there are several limitations associated with retrospective database analyses, our study nonetheless provides valuable insights into the real-world use of PN. In contrast to the Battistella et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607111420061">2</xref></sup> study, this study demonstrated a lack of association between lipid use and BSI rates. The retrospective nature of the study and our subsequent inability to randomize limited our capacity to determine a causal relationship between use of lipid emulsions and infections, and we were limited to adjusting for baseline variables that could be identified and measured in the database. Furthermore, infections and BSIs were identified via <italic>ICD-9</italic> codes plus antibiotic use, but this was not validated with patient records. However, it can be assumed that any error in identifying infections would be random across both treatment groups. In addition, because we could not reliably identify the presence of IV catheters, we were unable to report BSI/catheter days, as is the generally accepted practice. The impact should be limited, as enough of the literature reported simple infection rates to provide an appropriate context for our findings. We were also unable to distinguish when lipids were given through a separate line or piggybacked through the PN line. Finally, our population was limited to patients who received premixed PN, so generalizability is limited to this patient group.</p>
<p>The size of the population in this study, in addition to the broad-based patient and hospital characteristics, helps to lend external validity to these findings, despite the limitations inherent to large claims database studies. The findings of this evaluation raise important questions for patient safety and future research. Avoiding the occurrence of BSI is a vital patient safety issue and should be a priority to healthcare providers, as the cost of treating BSI is very expensive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607111420061">9</xref></sup> Therefore, one important question that relates to the findings of this study is whether the administration of lipid emulsion can improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare cost in a large controlled trial.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The analysis of a large U.S. database of patients using premixed PN found that the probability of developing any infection or BSI among patients who received premixed PN that included lipid emulsion was not likely associated with an increase in infectious morbidity or mortality. Further work is needed to evaluate the source of infections among these groups.</p>
