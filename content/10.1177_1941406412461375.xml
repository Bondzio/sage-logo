<abstract>
<p>The ketogenic diet (KD) has been used to improve seizure control in patients who have intractable epilepsy. It typically stimulates energy metabolism and, thus, calorie requirements, raising the concern of growth impairment among children. We have identified 3 patients who paradoxically gained weight over time with decreased daily calorie requirements while on the KD. Although the exact mechanism for this unexpected side effect is unknown, it is likely related to improved seizure control.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite advances in clinical pharmacology and epilepsy surgery, 20% to 40% of children with epilepsy still experience partially controlled or intractable seizures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412461375">1</xref></sup> The ketogenic diet (KD), first introduced in the early 1900s, has recently experienced a rise in popularity as an adjunctive treatment for patients who either do not respond to or cannot tolerate anticonvulsant medications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412461375">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412461375"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412461375"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412461375">5</xref></sup> Although the exact mechanism of seizure control is unknown, several studies have shown reduced seizure frequency in the majority of children treated with the KD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412461375">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412461375">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The KD is an individualized, high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate protein diet requiring strict calculations and adjustments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412461375">8</xref></sup> The goal of the diet is to stimulate ketone body formation, which is believed to have an effect on seizure control. The KD has been shown to upregulate energy metabolism through induction of different pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412461375">9</xref></sup> As a result of this, children often exhibit increased calorie requirements while on the diet, and for this reason, growth impairment has been a big concern among children who follow the diet. This can be prevented by carefully monitoring growth parameters and by adequate caloric adjustments.</p>
<p>With this article, we provide a case series of children who exhibited gradual decrease in calorie requirement and weight gain in association with seizure control after initiation of the KD.</p>

<title>Cases</title>
<p>All children cited in the following case studies are from the same center. Energy needs are determined based on food history (current calories at time of start of KD), and protein needs are calculated using the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein for age. None of the patients had changes in their medication regimen that were expected to modify their appetite or weight during the reported period of observation.</p>

<title>Patient 1</title>
<p>BT was a 17-year-old female adolescent with a history of severe cognitive impairment, cerebral palsy, and symptomatic epilepsy with generalized tonic clonicseizures. She was wheelchair bound and had minimal interaction with her surroundings. She was fed through her gastrostomy tube (G-tube). Despite being on multiple antiepileptic drugs (clonazepam 2 mg, 1 tablet twice a day [BID]; levetiracetam 1000 mg, 2 tablets BID; and pregabalin 400 mg BID), she continued to have frequent clinical seizures up to 20 times a day. For this reason, the KD was initiated at a ratio of 3:1, 1640 kcal/d (weight = 44.8 kg, 36.6 kcal/kg/d; height = 144 cm; BMI = 21.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and then increased to 3.5:1 to attempt better seizure control. She responded partially to the KD with a 50% to 75% reduction in seizure frequency. Her daily activity did not change because it was limited as a result of severe developmental delay and cerebral palsy. Then, 2 months later, her daily calorie intake was decreased by 100 kcal because of a 2.2-kg weight gain (weight = 47 kg, 32.7 kcal/kg/d; BMI = 22.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Despite this decrease, she continued to gain weight (2 kg within 3 months) while maintaining improved seizure control. Consequently, her daily calorie intake was decreased by 10% to 1390 kcal/d (weight = 49 kg, 28.4 kcal/kg/d; BMI = 23.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Thereafter, her weight remained stable (only 1 kg increase in 6 months) with concomitant improved seizure control. Because of her mother’s concern about the slight weight gain, her daily calorie intake was decreased to 1320 kcal/d at the same ratio of 3.5:1 (weight = 50 kg, 26.4 kcal/kg/d; BMI = 23.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). On subsequent visits over the next 9 months, she continued to gain weight gradually, and her calorie intake was adjusted accordingly (1250 kcal/d; weight = 53 kg; 23.6 kcal/kg/d; height = 146 cm; BMI = 24.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<title>Patient 2</title>
<p>JO was a 7 month old with a history of microcephaly, lissencephaly, cognitive impairment, and symptomatic epilepsy. She was initially treated with levetiracetam 300 mg/d; topiramate 50 mg/d, and clonazepam 0.25 mg/d to control her seizures. She was started on the KD at a ratio of 3:1 and 625 kcal daily (weight = 5.7 kg, 109 kcal/kg/d; height = 62 cm; head circumference = 40.5 cm), then advanced in a few days to a ratio of 4:1. Two weeks later, her daily calorie intake was decreased to 476 kcal/d (83 kcal/kg/d) to improve ketosis. Within 2 months, her weight increased significantly to 8.1 kg as part of expected infant growth. As a result of this, daily calorie intake was increased to 719 calories/d (88.7 kcal/kg/d). However, 2 months after this increase, because of continued weight gain, daily calorie intake was initially decreased to 595 kcal/d (weight = 9.5 kg, 62 kcal/kg/d) and then to 535 kcal/d (weight = 10.1 kg, 53 kcal/kg/d).</p>

<title>Patient 3</title>
<p>PG was a 10-year-old boy with a history of encephalitis, cognitive impairment, and symptomatic epilepsy, resistant to multiple antiepileptic drugs, including carbamazepine, valproate, phenytoin, and phenobarbital. He was minimally interactive with his surroundings and wheelchair bound. He was fed through his G-tube. Pertinent neurological exam findings included diffuse spasticity, muscle atrophy, and hyperreflexia. He was on phenobarbital 200 mg/d, felbamate 1500 mg/d, and gabapentin 1200 mg/d when the KD was initiated at a ratio of 3:1 with total daily calorie intake of 1250 kcal (weight = 30 kg, 41.6 kcal/kg/d; height = 142 cm; BMI = 14 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). During the following weeks, he became more alert and interactive with improved seizure control. Within 6 months after diet initiation, his weight increased gradually to 33 kg (37.9 kcal/kg/d) with sustained seizure control. During the next 6 months, he was not able to develop ketosis probably because of a severe, prolonged bacterial infection. His KD ratio was initially raised to 4:1 and then to 4.7:1 in an attempt to regain ketosis. During this time interval, his weight gain was slight (weight = 34 kg). To prevent growth delay, his daily calorie intake was increased to 1994 kcal/d (58.6 kcal/kg/d). His seizures were controlled after this increase. Over the following years, he was kept on the same KD regimen of ratio 4.7:1 and 1994 kcal/d. His weight gradually increased from 34 kg to 50.8 kg in the following 3.5 years with respective gradual decline in intake from 58.6 to 53.2 kcal/kg/d. During the same time period, his height increased from 146 to 157 cm with pronounced increase in BMI from 15 to 20.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although the exact mechanism of the anticonvulsant action of the KD is still unknown, several hypotheses have been postulated. Several studies suggest that β-hydroxybutyrate is the active ketone body, with one reporting that the presence of β-hydroxybutyrate correlates with seizure control more than urine ketones, requiring levels &gt;4 mmol/L.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412461375">10</xref></sup> Another mechanism may be increased conversion of glutamate to <italic>-aminobutyric acid</italic> (GABA), resulting in decreased excitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412461375">11</xref></sup> Another is membrane hyperpolarization by adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–sensitive potassium channels (K<sub>ATP</sub> channels) because of decreased availability of glucose. The K<sub>ATP</sub> channels couple cell metabolic activity to the cell membrane polarization and consequently to neuronal excitability. The changes induced by the KD are believed to modulate the closure and opening of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. The effects of the KD on 2-pore-domain K+ channels (K<sub>2P</sub> channels) may also play a role in its anticonvulsant effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412461375">12</xref></sup> One other mechanism is an increased level of ATP, shown to decrease seizure frequency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412461375">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Under physiological conditions, glucose is the primary energy source of the brain. For this reason, glucose homeostasis is tightly controlled to ensure constant sufficient levels in the brain. Epilepsy induces changes in this homeostatic mechanism. In addition, the blood-brain barrier and membrane transporters are also modified in epileptic patients. Because brain energy metabolism mostly depends on glucose availability, the KD can potentially alter it. The KD typically increases brain energy metabolism through upregulation of several genes and proteins participating in energy metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412461375">9</xref></sup> Those who are on high-fat, low carbohydrate diets have been shown to have higher metabolic rates with elevated calorie requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412461375">14</xref></sup> Because of its impact on energy metabolism, the KD can be a useful tool for losing weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412461375">15</xref></sup> For this reason, when treating epileptic children with the KD, possible growth impairment is a concern for medical providers. Despite being on the KD, our patients did not experience weight loss. Instead, their calorie requirements gradually decreased over time. Although we are not sure about the underlying reason, several mechanisms can be postulated.</p>
<p>Generalized convulsive seizure is a hypermetabolic state during which the body consumes more energy than it can generate, resulting in decreased levels of ATP and energy reserves. In animal studies, it has been demonstrated that cerebral metabolism increases focally with concomitant decrease in energy reserves and glucose levels because of increased cerebral discharges during a seizure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412461375">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412461375">17</xref></sup> The muscles also consume more energy with frequent convulsive activity. For this reason, multiple daily seizures could potentially result in a state of relative malnourishment, thus impairing overall growth and brain development. Improved seizure control using the KD could decrease daily energy consumption and thus the calorie requirement. We observed better seizure control soon after initiation of the KD. Decreased calorie requirements seen in our patients might be the result of improved control of their seizures. The fact that our patients continued to gain weight despite a decrease in weight-based daily calorie intake supports this idea.</p>
<p>In nonepileptic individuals, the KD diet stimulates energy metabolism resulting in increased calorie requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412461375">14</xref></sup> However, in epileptic patients who generally have a higher metabolic rate because of frequent seizures, improved seizure control could reverse the stimulatory effect of the diet on metabolic rate. Likewise, improved seizure control in our patients preceded weight gain.</p>
<p>Looking at the situation from a reverse angle, better seizure control over time might result in a decreased need for the KD. Because the diet stimulates energy metabolism, its reduced intake over time could gradually decrease energy requirement. Finally, genetic differences in individuals could have an impact on metabolic adaptation of the body to the KD and possibly result in decreased metabolic rate and daily caloric requirement.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although uncommon, following the KD could result in decreased metabolic rate and unexpected weight gain in epileptic patients through different mechanisms. Patients’ weight and daily calorie intake should be monitored closely in accordance with their clinical response while on the KD, so that the diet can be adjusted according to their needs. We may need to consider a decrease in the total calorie intake for those patients who respond well, with a significant decrease in convulsive activity.</p>
