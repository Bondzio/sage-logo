<abstract>
<p>Central venous catheters are commonly utilized to gain vascular access for varied clinical indications. Successful catheter placement requires not only technical expertise but also awareness of the potential complications. In this article, we report a malposition of a central venous catheter in a hemodialysis patient. We review the complications of this catheter misplacement, as well as complications resulting from other central venous catheter malpositions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 26 million people, progressing to end-stage renal disease each year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates the prevalence of hemodialysis (HD)-dependent person at 0.4% of the US population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574411433288">1</xref></sup> Current Kidney Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines recommend patient referral to a vascular surgeon for education about vascular access for HD. Once a patient has been diagnosed with CKD stage 4 (estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574411433288">2</xref></sup>), the KDOQI recommends early creation of arteriovenous (AV) access prior to complete kidney failure. The preferred access is a creation of an AV fistula in the nondominant forearm, with other access site considered in a stepwise manner (ie, nondominant upper arm, to dominant forearm, to dominant upper arm, etc).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574411433288">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite efforts to create suitable vascular access in renal patients with early surgical creation of an AV fistula, tunneled HD catheters remain an important adjunct for temporal and medium-term access for HD. All central venous catheters have many known complications. The most common complications arising from insertion of the catheter include pneumothorax, arterial puncture, local infection, thrombosis, hematomas, dysrhythmia, and thrombosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574411433288">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574411433288"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574411433288">5</xref></sup> Mechanical complications of tunneled catheters include kinking and occlusion of the catheter. A rare complication that was recently encountered at our institution was the inadvertent insertion of catheter into the right internal mammary vein, despite the use of fluoroscopy for confirmation of positioning. This case report will review the presentation of the complication and discuss this unusual catheter placement as compared with the current literature.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 49-year-old woman was admitted to Charleston Area Medical Center for evaluation of a fever (103°F) and arm cellulitis over previously placed AV access. With further evaluation, it was noted that the patient’s left brachioaxillary AV graft, which was used for dialysis, was infected. The patient’s AV graft was subsequently removed and there was placement of a tunneled HD catheter via a right internal jugular vein ultrasound-guided access.</p>
<p>Procedural details included—the right internal jugular vein was accessed with ultrasound guidance via a lateral supraclavicular approach. After the access was achieved, a 0.035 guide wire was advanced without any difficulty into what appeared to be the superior vena cava (SVC). A counter incision was made over the chest wall. A 14.5F × 19 cm cuff to tip dialysis catheter (Tal Palindrome, Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) was tunneled into the jugular vein entrance site. Sequential increasing venous dilation was performed with fluoroscopic assistance then advancement of a peel away sheath into the venous system. The catheter was then advanced, with tip of the catheter at the SVC-right atrial junction and sheath subsequently removed.</p>
<p>During the patient’s next dialysis session, postoperative day 1, she had severe pain in her chest upon catheter aspiration. A posteroanterior (PA) chest x-rays appeared to have normal placement of a tunneled catheter with the tip at the SVC-right atrial junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574411433288">Figure 1</xref>
). Secondary to the severe pain that occurred with aspiration and flushing of the catheter, a computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed. Axial image demonstrated the tip of the catheter was malpositioned in the right internal mammary vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574411433288">Figure 2</xref>
). The patient had bedside removal of the catheter and subsequent placement of a new catheter again via a jugular approach which was uneventful and functioned normally.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This case report demonstrates the rare malposition of a central venous catheter into the right mammary vein. Although many known mechanical complications of catheters are known, kinking, malposition in the ipsilateral jugular, or innominante vein placement. Few cases reported on malposition in the internal mammary vein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574411433288">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574411433288">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Anatomically, unlike the internal mammary artery which arises from the subclavian artery, the internal mammary vein originates from the innominate vein. This vein travels adjacent to the same named artery on the posterior aspect of the anterior chest wall. From a right internal jugular approach, this anterior branch overlies the SVC and standard PA chest radiographs appear to have placement within the SVC. However, lateral imaging is needed to confirm this placement.</p>
<p>In this specific case, there was concern of catheter malposition secondary to severe pain in the chest open aspiration and flushing the catheter. Unaware of this potential malposition, a CT examination of the chest was performed. The axial imaging demonstrates the catheter just posterior to the sternum. A lateral chest film could have revealed this anterior catheter placement but still would have not clearly shown whether the catheter was in the venous system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1538574411433288">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Catheter malposition following dialysis catheter placement is not unusual; however, placement within central venous branches is uncommonly reported. Understanding and review of the central venous branches can help physicians appreciate successful catheter placement.</p>
