<abstract>
<p>The AIDS Education and Training Centers National Evaluation Center led collaborative research to evaluate whether Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI)-funded clinical training changes clinical practice. Chart abstraction and feedback (34 clinics; n = 530) were used to assess adherence to clinical practice guidelines, identify training needs, and assess change in clinical practice (14 clinics, n = 271). Generalized estimating equations were used to account for repeated measures within each clinic. At baseline, clinics displayed 49% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 44-53) adherence to clinical practice guidelines. After feedback associated with the baseline chart review and subsequent implementation of MAI-funded clinical training, an 11% increase (95% CI = 7-16) in adherence to clinical practice guidelines was observed. MAI-funded clinical training was associated with increased adherence to clinical practice guidelines for HIV care. Chart abstraction is useful to assess clinical practice, facilitate conversations about quality improvement, and evaluate the effectiveness of clinical training.</p>

<body>
<p>Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS. The majority of new HIV infections, AIDS cases, and AIDS-related deaths in the United States are among racial and ethnic minorities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612453756">1</xref></sup> African Americans represent approximately 13% of the US population but account for more than half of all estimated new HIV infections and half of new AIDS diagnoses. Latinos represent 14% of the US population but account for 20% of estimated new AIDS diagnoses. Together, Asian/Pacific Islanders and American Indian/Alaska Natives represent 1% to 2% of estimated new AIDS diagnoses. Although relatively small in number, recent increases in HIV and AIDS diagnoses among American Indians and Alaska Natives are of particular concern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612453756">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Released in 2010, the National HIV/AIDS Strategy prioritizes improving the quality of care, improving health outcomes, and reducing HIV-related health disparities within highly affected communities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612453756">3</xref></sup> One plan to address these priorities includes increasing the number and racial and ethnic diversity of providers available to provide HIV care, treatment, and associated services for people with HIV. Several federal programs are designed to help achieve and maintain these priorities. In particular, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) funds 11 regional AIDS Education and Training Centers (AETCs) and 5 national centers to provide clinical training on HIV testing, care, and treatment throughout the United States and its territories.</p>
<p>The AETC network receives additional targeted funding, through the Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI), to increase organizational capacity and expand HIV care services available in minority communities. The MAI is one of 6 federal initiatives created to eliminate health disparities among racial and ethnic minorities (minorityhealth.hhs.gov). MAI funding provides AETCs with valuable resources to deliver innovative training programs to clinicians who provide care to underserved communities disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>This article presents findings from an evaluation of MAI-funded AETC training programs. The authors used chart review to assess the quality of HIV care within a clinic, to identify organizational and individual training needs, and to assess change in practice behavior over 1 year. This approach has been recommended as a strategy to improve implementation of clinical practice guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612453756">4</xref></sup> It has been used extensively to assess quality of care and to target and evaluate quality improvement efforts across a variety of medical settings and conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612453756">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612453756"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612453756"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612453756"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612453756">9</xref></sup> However, it has yet to be used to facilitate and evaluate capacity building for HIV care and treatment.</p>
<sec id="section1-1062860612453756" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This evaluation was conducted by the AETC National Evaluation Center (NEC) in collaboration with 5 regional AETCs and the National Minority AETC. Participating regional AETCs included the Florida/Caribbean AETC, the Mountain Plains AETC, the Northwest AETC, the Pacific AETC, and the Southeast AETC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612453756">10</xref></sup> Each region identified 1 or more clinics (n = 34) for participation in the evaluation. Clinic eligibility included receipt of Ryan White Program funding, service to an underserved population, and willingness to participate in training with an AETC region. Many clinics had established long-term relationships with AETC regional trainers, whereas others were just initiating these relationships. Because chart audits included a random sample of cases from each care facility and training was oriented to the entire clinic, this evaluation uses the clinic as the unit of analysis.</p>
<p>Prior to implementation, this study received approval from the Committee on Human Research at the University of California, San Francisco. Each clinic signed a memorandum of understanding allowing the aforementioned committee to serve as the reference ethical review board and affirming that participating staff would have access to, but would not record, identifying information on patients whose charts were included in the project.</p>
<p>This evaluation used a model developed by the Florida/Caribbean AETC, which uses systematic medical chart audits to identify and target future trainings and to assess changes in clinical care associated with clinical training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612453756">10</xref></sup> Prior to the site visit, clinic staff completed a chart assessment, which recorded the types of services provided, how long these services had been provided, and a description of the patient population. During the site visit, AETC NEC or AETC regional staff conducted baseline chart abstraction on up to 30 patient charts to assess the degree to which clinical care in clinics was consistent with current Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) clinical practice guidelines for HIV care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612453756">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612453756">11</xref></sup> Charts to be reviewed were randomly selected from current patients by clinic staff. Clinic staff were asked to oversample new patients, women, and patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection to assess the quality of care within these subpopulations.</p>
<p>After completion of chart audits (n = 34 clinics), AETC NEC or AETC regional staff provided written summaries of findings and areas for improvement in addition to convening feedback sessions with clinical staff and an AETC trainer to review the results of the chart abstraction and to plan future training (n = 30). During the course of these sessions, AETC NEC staff wrote extensive notes to capture staff reaction to and discussion of the results. These notes served as an additional source of process data to better understand the contextual factors that affect the results of the chart audit. A year later, after implementation of MAI-funded clinical training and capacity-building assistance, AETC NEC or AETC regional staff returned to conduct a second chart review (n = 14) and again review the results with clinical staff (n = 12), both in person and in writing.</p>
<sec id="section2-1062860612453756">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The quality of clinical care was assessed in 3 primary areas: (1) treatment (antiretroviral therapy, opportunistic infection [OI] prophylaxis and laboratory testing); (2) monitoring (testing at initial visit, HIV- and non-HIV-related health monitoring and charting); and (3) prevention (sexually transmitted infection [STI] testing, vaccination, screening, education, and counseling). The indicators measured under each area have been described in detail previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612453756">10</xref></sup>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1062860612453756">Table 1</xref> includes a summary of indicators included in each category. Because guidelines change over time, many indicators are described as “appropriate” care in a particular category. The specific criteria for each indicator were determined based on the DHHS guidelines at the time of the chart abstraction. All indicators were summed and standardized to form a 0 to 100 scale representing the overall quality of HIV care. Indicators within each category were summed and standardized to form 0 to 100 subscales.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The characteristics of participating clinics are described using frequencies and proportions for categorical variables and means and standard deviations for continuous measures. Clinic characteristics were compared among those with and without follow-up assessment using χ<sup>2</sup> tests of homogeneity and <italic>t</italic> tests. Generalized estimating equations were used for all analyses related to care according to clinical practice guidelines. These analyses control for the correlation in care across patients within each clinic. Baseline quality of HIV care overall and within each subscale is described using predicted means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Percentage change (with 95% CI) in adherence to clinical practice guidelines overall and within each subscale was assessed using models that controlled for differences in the quality of care within each clinic at baseline.</p>
<p>The content of the feedback session notes was analyzed following a step-by-step process: (1) organizing the handwritten notes into an electronic document resembling meeting minutes; (2) categorizing the content of each document according to thematic areas that emerged during the meeting; and (3) conducting a close read of the data by 2 analysts to assign content into salient domains, including challenges, facilitators, and training needs.</p>

<title>Clinic Characteristics</title>
<p>The 6 collaborating AETCs identified 34 clinics for participation in this evaluation activity. Baseline data collection was completed in all 34 clinics (n = 530), and follow-up data collection was completed in 14 clinics (n = 271). The majority of the clinics provided comprehensive services, including case management (86%), mental health services (86%), nutritional counseling (71%), and prenatal care (57%). Fewer clinics (29%) provided dental services. Across clinics, patients were predominantly African American, white, and Latino. In all, 29% of clinics served largely rural populations, and 43% of clinics served predominantly uninsured populations. All but 1 clinic received Ryan White funding. Most (86%) had been caring for patients for a minimum of 7 years. The number of active patients ranged from 80 to 1122 (median = 501). Clinics that were included in follow-up were similar to those not included in follow-up.</p>

<title>Baseline Adherence to Clinical Practice Guidelines</title>
<p>The results from baseline chart abstraction are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1062860612453756">Figure 1</xref>. At baseline, clinics displayed moderate overall adherence (49%, 95% CI = 44-53) to clinical practice guidelines. Adherence to specific aspects of the clinical practice guidelines varied significantly. Adherence to guidelines for HIV treatment and laboratory testing was significantly higher than the overall quality of care (antiretroviral therapy = 71%, 95% CI = 65-77; OI prophylaxis = 74%, 95% CI = 65-83; laboratory testing = 67%, 95% CI = 61-73); adherence to guidelines for overall health monitoring and charting was slightly higher than, but not significantly different from, the overall quality of care (testing at initial visit = 60%, 95% CI = 48-73; health monitoring = 60%, 95% CI = 55-65; and charting = 60%, 95% CI = 49-62); adherence to guidelines for STI testing and vaccinations was slightly lower than, but not significantly different from, the overall quality of care (STI testing = 56, 95% CI = 48-65; vaccination = 47%, 95% CI = 37-56); and adherence to guidelines for other screening, education, and counseling was significantly lower than the overall quality of care (screening, education, and counseling = 41%; 95% CI = 34-49).</p>

<p>Rural clinics were the most affected by challenges related to community and clinic context as well as coordination of care. The dispersion of people with HIV affects not only a clinic’s ability to bring patients and providers into a clinic but also limits the ability of providers and HIV-infected patients to build support communities. HIV-infected patients served by rural clinics often did not feel the support of their communities with regard to accessing and remaining in HIV care. Thus, patients served in rural settings are often socially isolated from others with HIV. This lack of community results in a high proportion of missed appointments and high rates of loss to follow-up in these communities. Clinics in rural settings face many challenges in providing adequate HIV care related to the inability to recruit highly qualified staff, high staff turnover, and the inability to fund auxiliary positions necessary for comprehensive HIV care. HIV care providers in rural communities also face challenges in engaging other providers in their communities to facilitate receipt of services for their HIV-infected patients. In one clinic, providers were reluctant to refer patients infected with hepatitis C virus to specialty care because local providers were not willing to accommodate patients with complex needs. In another clinic, HIV-infected patients did not receive dental care because of active discrimination by local dentists. This lack of community cohesion limited the quality of core and support services provided in rural communities.</p>
<p>Although rural clinics were the most affected by community-level challenges, all clinics appear to face clinic- and provider-level challenges. Many clinics did not have adequate resources to manage patients and their information. Ignorance and misconceptions also contributed to gaps in the quality of HIV care. For example, one clinic did not provide resistance testing because it was not aware of how to receive reimbursement for this service. Providers in several other clinics were hesitant to provide services related to sexual health because of their inability to conduct gynorectal exams or to discuss sex with their patients.</p>

<title>Change in Adherence to Clinical Practice Guidelines</title>
<p>After feedback associated with the baseline chart review and subsequent implementation of MAI-funded clinical training, an 11% increase (95% CI = 7-16) was observed in overall adherence to clinical practice guidelines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1062860612453756">Figure 2</xref>). This difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and accounted for differences in clinical practice across clinics.</p>

<p>Adherence to clinical practice guidelines increased across all aspects of care measured. The largest increases in adherence to clinical practice guidelines were observed for areas of care that involve 1-time (laboratory testing at initial visits, +18%; 95% CI = 3-33) or periodic nonmedical interventions (screening, education, and counseling, +18%; 95% CI = 7-29). Moderate increases in adherence to clinical practice guidelines were observed in areas of care that involve periodic medical testing or interventions [health monitoring, +11, 95% CI = 5-16; STI testing, +11; 95% CI = 6-17; vaccinations/tuberculin purified protein derivatives (PPD), +10%, 95% CI = 3-17]. Smaller increases were observed in ongoing aspects of care (antiretroviral therapy, +5%, 95% CI = 2-9; OI prophylaxis, +3%, 95% CI = −14 to 21; laboratory testing, +8%, 95% CI = 1-14; charting, +8%, 95% CI = 1-14). Each of these differences was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), except OI prophylaxis.</p>

<sec id="section9-1062860612453756">
<title>Targeting of Challenges to Adherence to Clinical Practice Guidelines</title>
<p>The amount of change in each area of treatment, monitoring, and prevention measured was associated with the particular community-, clinic-, and provider-level challenges in each clinic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1062860612453756">Table 2</xref>). AETC training was able to change provider misconceptions but had less impact on clinic-level challenges and no impact on community-level challenges. For example, in one clinic, providers believed that they could not receive appropriate reimbursement for antiretroviral resistance testing. The AETC trainer was able to educate staff on how to seek reimbursement for publicly funded patients. This training resulted in an increase in resistance testing in that clinic. In another clinic, clinical staff found it difficult to discuss sex with heterosexual patients. Subsequent to receiving this feedback, health educators in the clinic attended several trainings on delivering HIV prevention counseling to HIV-infected patients. This resulted in an increase in STI testing, risk screening, risk reduction education, and counseling in this clinic. New models for AETC capacity building and distance learning (Tele-health) efforts have the potential to affect clinic-level challenges. In several clinics, AETC staff were able to work with clinic staff to improve information flow and documentation of clinical care in medical charts. This resulted in care that adheres more closely to the goals of the clinical practice guidelines.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this evaluation are important in 3 ways. First, these results provide important information about the quality of clinical care in underserved communities targeted by MAI-funded AETC training programs. Second, they demonstrate the effectiveness of AETCs in helping improve the quality of care at clinics that serve these populations—even those experiencing substantial challenges to the provision of quality HIV care. Third, they point to aspects of care that require additional attention within capacity-building programs.</p>
<p>These results suggested that MAI-funded AETC training programs appropriately target clinics in underserved communities. At baseline, patients’ care met quality standards for 49% of the quality indicators. Although the overall quality of care in targeted clinics was quite low, the quality of care with respect to HIV treatment and laboratory testing was quite high (over 70%), whereas the quality of care was lower in the monitoring of patients’ overall health (60%) as well as periodic nonmedical screening, education, and counseling (approximately 45%). These findings suggest that the quality of HIV care in targeted clinics at baseline was substantially below the quality of care observed in previous research. Grol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612453756">12</xref></sup> reviewed adherence to clinical practice guidelines across many settings and conditions and found that clinicians follow clinical practice guidelines in 67% of clinical decisions. Similarly, Kazi and Boroumand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612453756">9</xref></sup> assessed the quality of clinical care in 1 Ryan White–funded clinic in Baltimore and found that care provided to 80% of HIV-infected patients met quality standards for at least half of the identified indicators.</p>
<p>These results demonstrate the effectiveness of MAI-funded AETC training using chart audit, clinical feedback, and targeted training. Over the 1-year observation period, we observed an increase of 11% in adherence to clinical practice guidelines and statistically significant increases in the quality of care across almost all aspects of care. These findings were comparable to those observed in a recent Cochrane review of interventions, which estimated that interventions that use chart audit and feedback for quality improvement in clinical settings increase adherence to clinical practice guidelines by 16%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612453756">13</xref></sup> These results also were similar to previous interventions in a Ryan White–funded clinic in which an 11% increase in undetectable viral load was observed after chart audits were used for quality improvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612453756">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previous research suggests that clinicians are most receptive to chart audit feedback when critiques are nonjudgmental and recommendations are specific and delivered in writing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612453756">15</xref></sup> In the present study, we used chart review, interactive feedback sessions with clinic staff, and follow-up in writing. These methods were effective for identifying training in participating clinics. Feedback sessions with staff were helpful to identify specific challenges to the provision of quality HIV care in each clinic. When chart review identified gaps in documentation, trainers were able to target future training and improve the provision of comprehensive, continuous care in the complex setting of HIV—a setting in which multiple providers are involved in the care of a single individual.</p>
<p>MAI-funded targeted trainings, conducted over our 1-year observation period, were most effective at improving the quality of care for 1-time medical interventions and periodic nonmedical interventions. We observed smaller increases in overall health monitoring and charting as well as HIV-specific treatment and laboratory testing. However, the quality of care for HIV-specific treatment and laboratory testing was already quite high at baseline.</p>
<p>Clinics need more complex capacity-building assistance to improve ongoing care and monitoring. These activities may include a review and revision of the structure, procedures, and work flow within clinics. Capacity-building assistance also may include facilitating conversations with specialty care providers as well as provision of technical assistance resources. Several regional AETCs have established community- and clinic-level capacity-building programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612453756">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1062860612453756">17</xref></sup> It will be important to evaluate the effectiveness of these programs in affecting the quality of HIV care.</p>
<p>This evaluation has several limitations. First, all clinics participated in the chart audit and feedback. Because the assessment (chart audit) is also part of the intervention, we were not able to include clinics that did not participate in the intervention. Therefore, we were not able to distinguish between changes in care that were the result of targeted trainings and those that may have been the result of other factors that were associated with changes in care. However, the size and consistency of the findings (we observed positive changes in the quality of care in all clinics) as well as the number and geographic diversity of participating clinics suggests that targeted clinical training did, in fact, improve the quality of HIV care in participating clinics. Second, we used chart review to assess the quality of HIV care and the change in the quality of HIV care within participating clinics. As discussed, chart review has been criticized as underrepresenting the actual quality of care provided. However, because chart review has been used to assess the quality of care for all components of this and previous studies in this area, we are confident that these results reflect comparable increases in the quality of HIV care in participating clinics. Third, we were not able to document all the capacity-building and training activities that led to improvements in HIV care in participating clinics. Although AETC trainers conducted MAI-funded AETC trainings within participating clinics, providers also attend other AETC and non-AETC trainings outside of the clinic. At the time of the evaluation, it was not possible to link trainees to their clinics in order to capture all trainings that benefit a specific clinic. Recent changes to AETC standardized data collection forms will allow linking trainings that benefit providers within a specific clinic. This will enhance future evaluation of targeted training efforts.</p>
<p>In spite of these limitations, these findings demonstrate the effectiveness of MAI-funded AETC training in reducing disparities in HIV care. This is the first evaluation to document that AETC training using clinical indicators improves the quality of HIV care. In spite of the successes observed, further development and evaluation of AETC capacity-building programs is still necessary to continue to reduce demographic and geographic disparities in HIV care. The AETCs will continue to play an integral role in the implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. Identified roles include development of relationships to enable care in high-need areas and settings, provision of technical assistance to support the development of comprehensive care systems, and the development of community-level approaches in all capacity-building programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612453756">18</xref></sup> This role will be particularly important in the face of changes in HIV care structure and delivery associated with implementation of the Affordable Care Act.</p>
