<sec id="section1-0363546512472325">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Current methods for estimating glenoid bone loss in patients with chronic shoulder instability include computed tomography imaging with 3-dimensional reconstruction, specialized computer software, and imaging of the contralateral shoulder. An ideal method of glenoid measurement would require only magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the injured shoulder.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512472325">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To determine whether MRI measurement of glenoid height, as well as sex, could be used to estimate glenoid width in healthy subjects with no history of shoulder instability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512472325">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512472325">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Bilateral shoulder MRIs were obtained in a healthy cohort of young athletes as part of the baseline assessment in a prospective cohort study. A musculoskeletal radiologist measured glenoid height and width using the sagittal MRI cuts. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to determine whether demographic and MRI measurements of the glenoid could be used to estimate glenoid width.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512472325">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Of the 1264 shoulder MRIs evaluated, the mean glenoid width was 26.67 mm (±2.49 mm), and the mean glenoid height was 42.15 mm (±3.00 mm). There were significant differences between the 129 female glenoids and the 1035 male glenoids for both width (23.1 mm, 27.1 mm, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) and height (37.9 mm, 42.7 mm, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001); however, the relationship between glenoid height and width was similar for both men and women. The glenoid width was found to correlate with the height measurement (<italic>r</italic> = 0.56) for the entire cohort. Based on the results of linear regression analysis, controlling for the influence of sex, a formula was created that represents the relationship between these variables for male subjects: Glenoid Width = (1/3 Height) + 15 mm. Female patients are estimated with a formula that represents the same slope but a different intercept: W = 1/3 H + 13 mm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512472325">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Significant differences in glenoid height and width were found by sex; however, the relationship between height and width was similar. These variables are correlated, and the resultant formula can be used to estimate the expected glenoid width in a patient with bone loss. This formula allows for easy calculation of the amount of glenoid bone loss with only a ruler and an MRI of the injured shoulder.</p>

<body>
<p>Burkhart and De Beer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512472325">2</xref></sup> introduced the concept of glenoid bone loss in shoulder instability and the highly associated rate of failure. Since then, multiple measurement techniques have been proposed. However, most of these techniques involve the use of computed tomography (CT) scan with 3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction as well as advanced software that places a circle over the inferior two-thirds of the glenoid to assist in measurement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512472325">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512472325">10</xref></sup> A challenge of measuring glenoid bone loss is that the goal is to measure something that is not present, without known normative data. For this reason, some authors have suggested that a second CT scan of the contralateral shoulder should be obtained for comparison.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512472325">1</xref></sup> There is concern about the radiation dose and costs associated with additional CT scans. These measurement techniques also require postimaging software to perform, which may not be available at all locations of care.</p>
<p>We sought to determine the inherent relationship between glenoid height and width in a healthy cohort. We hypothesized that these variables would be correlative. We then sought to determine a formula with which the expected glenoid width could be calculated for any given glenoid height. This would provide a surgeon the ability to estimate glenoid bone loss based on the ipsilateral magnetic resonance image (MRI) using nothing more than a ruler.</p>
<sec id="section7-0363546512472325" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>After obtaining institutional review board approval, we initiated a prospective cohort study of young athletes to determine the risk factors for shoulder instability in 2006. This high-risk population was studied with baseline assessment upon enrollment and was followed for subsequent injuries during 4 years of surveillance. The methods of this study have been reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512472325">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512472325">7</xref></sup> Among these baseline assessments were bilateral shoulder MRIs without contrast.</p>
<p>To address this specific research hypothesis, we used baseline MRIs from a healthy cohort. The MRI examinations were performed on a 1.5-T imaging system (Intera, Philips Medical Systems, Andover, Massachusetts), using a phased array surface coil (Synergy Flex-M, Philips Medical Systems). An abbreviated protocol was used. Oblique coronal, turbo spin-echo, fat-suppressed T2-weighted images were performed (echo time [TE]/repetition time [TR] 50 ms/2000 ms; field of view [FOV] 160-180 mm; slice 4 mm; interslice gap 0.4 mm; matrix 256 × 256; echo train length [ETL] 8-10; number of excitations [NEX] 2). Additionally, an axial 3D fast field-echo sequence was performed (TE/TR/flip angle 9 ms/18 ms/15°; FOV 160-180 mm; slice 2.4 mm; slice overlap 1.2 mm; matrix 256 × 256; NEX 2), from which multiplanar reformatted (MPR) images in oblique coronal and oblique sagittal planes were obtained at 1.3-mm intervals. Sagittal MPR images were aligned parallel to the glenoid fossa. Measurement of glenoid height and width was performed lateral to the coracoid base on the lateral-most image through the bony glenoid fossa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512472325">Figure 1</xref>). Measurements were performed by a musculoskeletal radiologist (S.C.) using standard digital measurement software. Maximal glenoid height was determined to be the maximal length possible from the base of the coracoid (12-o’clock position) to the inferior glenoid (6-o’clock position). The maximal width was the maximum length possible in an orthogonal orientation to the previously measured height. These measures were displayed to a tenth of a millimeter.</p>

<p>We calculated means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies and proportions for categorical variables of interest using shoulder as the unit of analysis. We used independent <italic>t</italic> tests to examine differences in glenoid height and width measurements between men and women. We also calculated Pearson correlation coefficients to evaluate the relationship between glenoid height and width for all subjects, as well as for subjects stratified by sex. Finally, we used multivariable linear regression to predict glenoid width based on glenoid height, after controlling for the influence of sex among study participants. All analyses were performed using STATA version 10.1.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 1264 shoulder MRIs were evaluated in this analysis. The mean glenoid width was 26.67 mm (±2.49 mm) and the mean glenoid height was 42.15 mm (±3.00 mm). There were significant differences between the 129 female glenoids and the 1035 male glenoids for both width (23.1 mm, 27.1 mm, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) and height (37.9 mm, 42.7 mm, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001); however, the relationship between glenoid height and width was similar for both men and women. The glenoid width was found to correlate with the height measurement (<italic>r</italic> = 0.56) for the entire cohort (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512472325">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Given the results of linear regression analysis, controlling for the influence of sex, we created a formula that represents the relationship between these variables for male subjects: Glenoid Width = (1/3 Height) + 15 mm. Therefore, in a male with suspected bone loss whose glenoid height is 45 mm, the estimated glenoid width would be W = 30 mm. If the actual measured width is 20 mm, this would represent a 33% loss in glenoid width. Female patients are estimated with a formula that represents the same slope but a different intercept: W = 1/3 H + 13 mm.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Glenoid bone loss has become appreciated recently in shoulder instability patients as a cause of recurrent instability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512472325">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512472325">5</xref></sup> Multiple measurement techniques have been proposed; however, no consensus exists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512472325">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512472325">10</xref></sup> Unfortunately, most proposed measurement techniques have been performed on CT scans of the ipsilateral shoulder or even both the ipsilateral and contralateral shoulders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512472325">1</xref></sup> In this study we have shown that glenoid width correlates with glenoid height, and we have proposed a simple formula for glenoid width estimation based upon the measured height using ipsilateral MRI study. The resultant formula is easy to remember (W = 1/3 H + 15 mm) and incorporate into clinical practice as it can be used on hardcopy or digital MRI with a ruler. We provide a small consecutive series of patients undergoing bone augmentation procedures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512472325">Table 1</xref>). These patients had a mean glenoid bone loss of 25% according to this formula. Although this does not validate the formula, it does suggest some amount of clinical utility.</p>

<p>Recent studies have shown MRI assessment of glenoid bone loss to be as accurate as CT scans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512472325">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512472325">11</xref></sup> We also found that MRI allowed for a reliable determination of cortical bone margins as well as labral and other soft tissues. Although our proposed formula needs to be validated in a clinical series and in comparison with other measurement methods, this proposed simple measure may make routine 3D CT scans unnecessary and may obviate the need for contralateral comparison images.</p>
<p>Our study does have some limitations, namely that we measured a cohort of young men and women (mostly men) who may not be representative of the general population. We believe that this population is representative of the young athletes who experience shoulder instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512472325">8</xref></sup> and would potentially require measurement for bone loss. Our study used MRIs from a single magnetic resonance unit and readings from a single radiologist, and the relationships we discovered may not be transferable to other magnetic resonance systems and readers. In addition, our measurement of the width and height may not accurately represent actual area of loss as has been described by others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512472325">6</xref></sup> The use of MRI for measurement can be seen as a weakness, as most prior studies used CT scans. However, this was intentional since MRI studies are commonly the imaging modality ordered by referring providers in instability patients, and the hope was to eliminate the need for CT scan. However, comparison of our technique using CT scans is needed and currently ongoing.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found that a relationship does exist between glenoid height and width in our study population. We present a formula to be used for estimation of the glenoid width for any measured height on MRI study. Further work is needed to assess this formula using CT images.</p>
