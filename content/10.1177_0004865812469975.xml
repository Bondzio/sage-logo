<abstract>
<p>Most public and scholarly debate about immigration in Australia has focused on irregular arrivals of asylum seekers by sea and the harsh system of externalised border controls designed to deter and contain them. This paper concentrates on the operation of Australia’s internal borders. We present a critical account of onshore migration policing networks in the Australian state of New South Wales, which are conceptualised as a distinctive form of policing. Using the techniques of nodal cartography described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865812469975">Johnston and Shearing (2003)</xref> we identify the institutions, mentalities and technologies driving the development of migration policing networks and discuss their structure and internal dynamics. We then examine the means by which chains of public and private actors are recruited to perform a migration policing role, drawing on Garland’s ideas about government-at-a-distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004865812469975">Garland, 1997</xref>). We identify responsibilising strategies that capitalise on overlapping organisational interests, others that are underpinned by the threat of legal sanctions, and others that are directed towards changing the behaviour of unlawful non-citizens themselves. We conclude that the Australian state is not diminished by adopting a networked approach to onshore migration policing, but instead garners significant resources which it can then invest in the construction of a multi-faceted, structurally-embedded and potentially ubiquitous border.</p>

<p>The Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) has estimated that 58,400 people were in Australia without legal authority on 30 June 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865812469975">DIAC, 2011</xref>: 152). The precision of this estimate (which probably refers only to visa overstayers), and the confidence with which it is stated stands in stark contrast to most comparable countries, for example Britain, where estimating the size of their illegally resident population has been the subject of major research efforts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0004865812469975">Pinkerton et al., 2004</xref>). In the United States, undocumented immigrants number around half the size of the total Australian population, and media commentators content themselves with reporting estimates to the nearest million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865812469975">Gaynor, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004865812469975">Preston, 2010</xref>). Australian immigration officials express a high degree of confidence in Australia’s comprehensive visa system, claiming that only Japan and New Zealand come close to maintaining the same level of pre-entry, on-entry and exit checks. However, this ‘surveillance fantasy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004865812469975">Aas, 2011</xref>) of perfect sovereign control does not translate into a seamless system of enforcement, and the detection of ‘unlawful non-citizens’ (defined later) proceeds along a number of fronts, some more systematic than others.</p>
<p>In 2011/12, 15,477 unlawful non-citizens were ‘located’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0004865812469975">1</xref></sup> by immigration authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865812469975">DIAC, 2012</xref>: 174). Although DIAC has primary responsibility for the enforcement of immigration controls, these locations are not solely attributable to the efforts of DIAC compliance officers. In fact, the Sydney Compliance Office, which is the largest in the country, has only a small team of officers dedicated to the detection and apprehension of unlawful non-citizens. This modest enforcement contingent is supplemented by a web of formal partnerships with federal and state police, service providers and regulatory agencies, and looser alliances with ‘responsibilised’ members of the wider community. Collectively these partnerships greatly extend DIAC’s capacity for surveillance and monitoring, and secure an array of additional skills, legal powers, information and financial resources that can be used to identify individuals who can potentially be ‘removed’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0004865812469975">2</xref></sup> from Australia. Departmental statistics show that only around 18 per cent of locations result from the direct efforts of DIAC compliance officers working in the field and referrals by other agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865812469975">DIAC, 2011</xref>: 167). The vast majority (82%) of unlawfully present individuals come to notice through so-called ‘voluntary’ reporting, the ‘voluntariness’ of which will be subject to examination in this article.</p>
<p>Networked forms of migration policing align with wider developments in policing and governance. The advent of neo-liberal governments that prefer to ‘steer rather than row’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0004865812469975">Braithwaite, 2000</xref>) has created the conditions for a pluralisation of policing functions, a blurring of public/private and civil/criminal distinctions, and the formation of multi-agency networks aimed at reducing risk and promoting security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865812469975">Dupont, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865812469975">Fleming and Rhodes, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865812469975">Johnston and Shearing (2003)</xref> describe these multi-agency regulatory systems in terms of ‘nodal governance’ in which official authority for security production may be dispersed across a range of public and private agencies. Nodes in security networks are conceptualised as sites of governance at which knowledge and resources are mobilised in order to ‘manage a course of events’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865812469975">Burris et al., 2005</xref>: 33). Within a nodal conception of governance, the contribution of each node, including government agencies, is regarded as an empirical question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865812469975">Johnston and Shearing, 2003</xref>). While nodal governance has provided a convenient framework for characterising contemporary forms of multi-agency policing, critics have observed that few local policing initiatives have demonstrated a de-centring of state control to any significant degree. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865812469975">Coleman and Sim (2005)</xref> have argued that nodal forms of governance simply express state power in a different guise within a new ‘terrain of power relations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865812469975">Coleman and Sim, 2005</xref>). Moreover, these dispersed modalities of governance, characterised by Garland as ‘government-at-a-distance’, raise significant new problems for states, since ‘[p]ower is not a matter of imposing a sovereign will, but instead a process of enlisting the cooperation of chains of actors who “translate” power from one locale to another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004865812469975">Garland, 1997</xref>: 182).</p>
<p>In this article we introduce immigration enforcement as a distinctive form of policing, using findings from an empirical project, the Migration Policing study. We begin by describing the structure and function of onshore migration policing networks in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) using a process described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865812469975">Johnston and Shearing (2003)</xref> as ‘nodal cartography’. We then identify the mentalities driving the participation of a range of institutional and private actors, with reference to Garland’s concept of ‘government-at-a-distance’. Finally, we consider some of the normative implications of the involvement of such a diverse range of agencies in the detection of unlawful non-citizens.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0004865812469975"><title>Studying migration policing</title>
<p>The Migration Policing study included a mixed method case study built around the DIAC Compliance Office in Sydney, and five case studies in selected NSW Police Local Area Commands. The Sydney Compliance Office was selected for study because it handles the vast majority of enforcement workload nationally, estimated at 60 per cent by senior DIAC staff. NSW Police play an equally dominant role in immigration enforcement, accounting for more than half the calls at national level made to DIAC’s Immigration Status System (ISS), a 24-hour national inquiry line that was introduced in 2006 primarily to enable police to check the immigration status of particular individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865812469975">Weber, 2011</xref>). The sampling rationale for the police case study sites was purposive, that is, intended to identify as wide a range of migration policing practices as possible. The two rural and three urban police locations were selected using data provided by DIAC which showed they were all active in making checks using the ISS system.</p>
<p>In order to gather data beyond these central actors, a ‘fanning out’ methodology was adopted to identify more peripheral migration policing partners at each study site. The objective was to make a broad mapping of migration policing institutions and their interagency connections, rather than produce a deep examination of practice within individual agencies, although considerable attention was focused on the core agencies of NSW Police and DIAC. Obtaining access to this wide range of agencies proved to be extremely time consuming. Data was collected primarily through recorded interviews with one or more key informants from each organisation conducted at their place of work, with a focus on identifying policies, partnerships and organisational incentives for their participation in migration policing networks. The data reported in this article therefore operates primarily at the level of stated policy and reported procedures. This was supplemented where possible by departmental documentation, and researchers were provided with what DIAC managers described as a ‘walk through’ of the operational units in the Sydney Compliance Office, accompanied by descriptions of their everyday practice. Experiments with observational techniques, such as attending police-led ‘taxi operations’ (described later) proved to be of limited value, since the identification of unlawful non-citizens is an unpredictable event and did not occur at all on the two occasions attended in the pilot. Researchers were not granted access to observe or question front-line DIAC field officers. This was possibly because of continuing local sensitivities over the public criticisms discussed in the next section, although the reason given was that researchers would not ‘learn anything’ from such an exercise. While this material would have added depth to the study overall, it is not integral to the broad inter-agency mapping process, which was the main objective of the study.</p>
<p>Interviews with strategically positioned individuals who can act as departmental spokespersons were chosen as an efficient way to gain insights into difficult-to-observe phenomena – such as exchanges of electronic data, the development of inter-agency Memorandum of Understandings or the existence of inter-agency committees – and to explore the mentalities driving these organisational and inter-organisational developments. The key informant approach assumes that a single spokesperson has the organisational knowledge, sense of authority and motivation to discuss departmental procedures openly and honestly, and that a single ‘organisational perspective’ exists. This, of course, is not always true. The conduct of multiple interviews within the two core organisations meant that specialist informants could be targeted about specific procedures. It also enabled comparisons to be made across interviews to assess consistency and identify instances of individual or place-based differences in perspective (e.g. between Local Area Commanders, as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004865812469975">Weber (2012)</xref>). Where possible, the information provided about specific procedures was checked by reference to legislation and departmental documents. In smaller or more peripheral organisations, reliance on a single informant may be more of a limitation, and the discussion about the role of these agencies is correspondingly less detailed. While this method would be unsuitable for a study purporting to evaluate or theorise actual practices on the ground, the research has produced quite rich data in relation to the core agencies and at least indicative information about more peripheral partners, which is commensurate with the broad objectives of nodal cartography.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0004865812469975">Table 1</xref> shows the organisational spread of the 67 interviews obtained. Due to limitations of time and resources, no interviews were conducted with private individuals such as employers or affected community members. Some additional detail about police practice was obtained using a self-report questionnaire completed by 371 operational police officers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0004865812469975">Table 2</xref>). The sampling processes varied across locations due to operational constraints, so the survey findings are used to add further detail to the interview data rather than report generalisable statistical estimates. In this case, research participants were reporting on their own knowledge, preferences and occupational experiences, rather than providing general information about departmental policies. The well-known limitations of reliance on self-reported practice need to be balanced against the gains in identifying a wide range of practices that extend well beyond what could have been observed within the available time and resources.

<p>Taken together, this data provides a series of snapshots into an increasingly complex migration policing machinery from a number of different perspectives. Before describing the structure of this machinery, it is important to define the target to which this expansive enforcement effort is directed, namely ‘unlawful non-citizens’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0004865812469975"><title>The legal and political context</title>
<p>Under section 14 of the Migration Act 1958, all non-citizens who enter or remain in Australia without a valid visa are considered to be ‘unlawful non-citizens’. This may occur through overstaying, or temporary visas may be cancelled due to breaches of conditions, such as unauthorised working. The cancellation of permanent resident visas due to criminal convictions is another small but significant source of unlawful non-citizens. The sheer complexity of the visa system and the inflexibility built in to enforcement mechanisms has prompted one commentator to describe Australian immigration enforcement as ‘automated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004865812469975">Nicholls, 2007</xref>). Public revelations about the wrongful detention and deportation of Australian citizens – in particular the prolonged detention of a mentally ill citizen, Cornelia Rau, which was documented in the Palmer Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004865812469975">Palmer, 2005</xref>) – have led to a raft of organisational changes known within DIAC as the ‘post-Palmer reforms’. Although these reforms define the context in which the Migration Policing research was conducted, the study was not designed specifically to evaluate their implementation or impact.</p>
<p>The post-Palmer reforms include training in decision-making, a stated shift away from automatic enforcement and towards promoting visa compliance, and massive investments in specialist units and information technologies such as Systems for People, the Visa Entitlements Verification Online system (VEVO), the Provider Registration and International Student Management System (PRISMS) and the Immigration Status System (ISS). These systems are designed to establish identity with greater accuracy and enable external agencies (ISS) and employers (VEVO) to enquire about immigration status; monitor visa compliance by international students (PRISMS) and guide DIAC case managers to make lawful and well-informed decisions (Systems for People). Despite their breadth and significance, it is notable that these reforms have generally not been underpinned by legislation, despite public commitments by an incoming Labor government in 2007 to adopt a more humane approach to immigration enforcement. In fact, with boat arrivals off the northern coast of Australia still monopolizing political debate, and in the absence of further revelations about enforcement ‘mistakes’, the business of enforcing the internal border has largely continued to operate beneath public notice.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0004865812469975"><title>Mapping the institutions of migration policing</title>
<sec id="sec6-0004865812469975"><title>DIAC Sydney Compliance Office</title>
<p>Unlawful non-citizens were said to come to the attention of immigration authorities through a number of means. This included individuals who approached a DIAC public counter voluntarily to make enquiries about their visa options; bridging visa (BVE) holders who are required to report to a Client Services office, having already been identified as unlawfully present; and others who are required to report following notification through some other visa monitoring process. Referrals from these public information counters to DIAC compliance teams are the main source of ‘voluntary’ locations of unlawful non-citizens. However, the categorization of these cases as voluntary masks the monitoring functions performed on behalf of DIAC by other agencies A common example is international students referred to DIAC by education providers due to lack of progress in their courses, according to statutory requirements set out in the Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000.</p>
<p>Unlawful non-citizens are also identified in-house through the weekly production of an Overstayer’s File. As Australia operates both entry and exit border checks, it is possible to identify visa holders who are recorded as remaining in the country following the expiry of their visa. The accurate recording of immigration status is not a straightforward matter, as explained by this Canberra-based official: ‘The thing with overstayer data is that it is quite dynamic because people can become an overstayer for a day and then it [sic] becomes lawful tomorrow, as they can go in and get a bridging visa’ (Interview 42, Canberra DIAC). DIAC Compliance staff working in Client Services areas said they canvassed all possibilities to regularise legal status as a first step, arguing that placing an individual on a bridging visa pending further applications or arrangements for departure was the ‘last option’ (Interview 54, Sydney DIAC). Although it was not possible to verify these claims using other data, these statements indicate the dynamic nature of legal status, and suggest an ongoing dialectic between the demands of compliance and status determination regimes.</p>
<p>The Compliance Information Management Unit (CIMU) is tasked with responding to the cases identified from both internal and external sources. CIMU staff said that they first prioritized allegations received by mail, email or phone, according to the Compliance Priorities Matrix which regulates their work according to risk categories. Staff reported receiving about 350 allegations per month by phone alone at the time of the interviews, the majority from the general public. Sources included notifications through the public ‘dob-in’ service; information provided by inter-agency committees or individual agencies; cases ‘escalated’ from Client Services following non-compliance with departure arrangements; or locations arising from aggregate data-matching processes (Interview 49, Sydney DIAC). After ‘value-adding’ to the reports by investigating, sometimes using powers under section 18 of the Migration Act to request information from other agencies, CIMU staff said they referred cases that were judged to require further action to the Compliance Early Response Team in the case of low risk, ‘non-warranted’ enquiries; to general Compliance field teams for enforcement-orientated visits; or sometimes to specialist teams such as Employer Awareness, the Fraud Team or the Complex Case Team.</p>
<p>Because section 188 of the Migration Act allows designated officers to check the immigration status of anyone they reasonably believe to be a non-citizen, compliance field work need not always be based on information received about particular individuals. Because researchers were not granted access to speak with field officers, most of the first-hand information obtained about proactive, intelligence-led operations targeted at particular locations came from discussions with partner agencies, and will be discussed later. In discussions with Compliance managers, ‘warranted’ jobs involving a search for a named individual were described as ‘easy’, whereas ‘non-warrant’ jobs that were based on more speculative information were said to be more problematic – the vast majority concerning business addresses.</p>
<p>The Compliance staff interviewed rejected the suggestion that visa holders were ‘monitored’ in any way, and considered the location of unlawful non citizens to be largely ad hoc or intelligence-driven. The only groups they considered to be monitored by them at all, were individuals on bridging visas and potential ‘criminal deportees’ who had already come to their notice pending resolution of their status. Apart from ‘police referrals’ which are designated as ‘mandatory work’ on the Priorities Matrix, the highest priority work for these teams at the time of interview was said to be the removal of rejected asylum applicants (Interview 48, Sydney DIAC).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0004865812469975"><title>State and federal police</title>
<p>As the largest dedicated law enforcement agency in the state, NSW Police make a significant contribution to the location of unlawful non-citizens. The value of this policing resource is well understood by DIAC officers, one of whom described police as being their ‘eyes and ears’ on the ground (Interview 51, Sydney DIAC). As ‘designated officers’ under the Migration Act police officers are authorised, in theory, to apply any of the powers specified in the Act. In practice, they question suspected non-citizens about their immigration status under section 188, detain those reasonably believed to be unlawfully present under section 189, take part in joint operations involving DIAC and other agencies, and may make immigration checks in the context of criminal investigations. From the totality of the interview and survey data, there appeared to be little priority attached by state police to proactively identifying unlawful non-citizens for its own sake. Their immigration enforcement efforts were always reported to be secondary to police objectives, such as criminal prosecution or order maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865812469975">Weber, 2011</xref>). Even so, two DIAC Liaison Officers were posted within NSW Police Headquarters at the time the research was completed, indicating an active working relationship.</p>
<p>Seventy-eight per cent of survey respondents who identified as general duties police and 84 per cent of highway patrol officers reported having checked someone’s immigration status at least once in the 12 months prior to the survey. In addition to checks made in the context of street encounters, 84 per cent of the detectives who completed the survey said they had checked someone’s immigration status in the previous 12 months. Data provided by DIAC indicated that only around 13 per cent of the checks made nationally by police led to the identification of an unlawful non-citizen. Despite this low success rate, NSW Police contribute substantially to the total number of locations of unlawful non-citizens because of the high volume of contact.</p>
<p>NSW Police also reported running joint operations from time to time which may have the potential to identify unlawful non-citizens. Their motivation in conducting these operations was invariably expressed in terms of crime and safety concerns. Regulatory checks of taxi drivers, which are a standard feature of the work of NSW Police Commuter Crime units, were said to be pursued on an ongoing basis through a well-established multi-agency approach. The presence of DIAC compliance field officers could also be requested on an ad hoc basis where it was anticipated that one-off police operations pursued for a crime-related purpose could identify unlawful non-citizens. Police also reported participating in DIAC-led operations. As well as assisting DIAC to execute warrants to apprehend specific, ‘high-risk’ individuals (generally criminal deportees), police also participated in place-based ‘raids’, where DIAC either expected to locate unlawful non-citizens, or had a warrant to search for documentation. Understandings of the police role in these activities varied between informants, but included providing intelligence to assess risks, effecting forced entry if necessary, protecting DIAC staff, securing the perimeter of targeted areas to prevent escape, or merely providing a uniformed presence to promote compliance. DIAC compliance field officers – despite their wide powers of search and arrest – are not equipped or trained in the use of force, and said they relied on police in the minority of cases where active resistance was expected.</p>
<p>Australian Federal Police (AFP) are also ‘designated officers’ under the Migration Act and liaise closely with DIAC Compliance in relation to the trafficking and exploitation of foreign workers. The federal police have a Memorandum of Understanding with DIAC covering information exchange and assistance on investigations. The fact that they are constituted at federal level means that their organisational links with DIAC are in some ways deeper than the links reported between state and federal police, although focused within a more limited range of concerns. At the time of interviewing, the federal police had a Sydney-based liaison officer dedicated to facilitating the working relationship between the two agencies, and a DIAC liaison officer was embedded within the AFP’s Identity Fraud Team. In contrast to state police who refer requests about immigration status to embedded DIAC liaison officers or directly to the Immigration Status System controlled by DIAC, selected federal police officers were said to have direct access to some DIAC systems (Interview 66, Australian Federal Police).</p>
<p>Rather than the security role played by state police on DIAC operations, the assistance of the federal police was said to be requested because of their evidence-gathering expertise. Where federal police initiated workplace raids themselves it was likely to be in relation to large-scale organized criminal activities, and the presence of immigration officers would be requested to identify the visa status of any individuals questioned. When asked about the circumstances in which federal police officers were likely to work with DIAC in relation to unlawful non-citizens, the AFP informant gave a description which suggested a far closer identification with immigration control objectives than was obtained from any of the NSW Police interviews: ‘We’ll just go along as immigration officers, like assisting Immigration. [So you are actually considering yourself as being designated officers under the Migration Act?] Yes, we don’t really highlight the fact that we’re police’ (Interview 65, Australian Federal Police).</p>

<p>At the time the research was conducted, Sydney DIAC Compliance staff reported that Memoranda of Understanding relating to the conduct of joint operations and/or data sharing existed with Centrelink, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), Department of Employment, Education and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) and the Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA). A further agreement was being finalized with one metropolitan council. The Sydney Compliance Office was also hosting a liaison officer from Centrelink to facilitate ongoing information exchange and joint working, and was negotiating a similar arrangement with the Taxation Office. The involvement of some of these agencies in migration policing will be outlined briefly in this section.</p>
<p>The core business of the Australian Tax Office brings them into contact with unlawful non-citizens most often in relation to their pursuit of unpaid taxes within the ‘cash economy’. Although their focus is more often on the employers, the ATO, like other government agencies, are highly risk-driven, and occasionally identify tax avoidance risks associated with particular visa types. At the time the research interview was completed in 2009, no record of immigration status or even nationality was being kept on ATO systems. However aggregate data matching checks against DIAC’s Overstayers file were said to be run on an ad hoc basis at the request of DIAC. There were also moves to establish routine data matching with DIAC records to check visa status at the time business names were registered to ensure that the business owner was entitled to work independently or host temporary workers on special visas. In addition, the ATO informant reported occasional involvement in proactive multi-agency operations, such as those targeting the taxi industry.<disp-quote>
<p>I would think probably at least once every year each airport in Australia has a joint raid and the cars come along and the police check the licenses, and DIAC check if they are legal, and Centrelink check if they are on benefits, and the RTA checks if the vehicle is roadworthy, and at the end of the line is the Tax Office who sees whether they have got an ABN [Australian Business Number]. (Interview 60, Australian Taxation Office)</p></disp-quote>According to information provided in interviews, the social security provider, Centrelink, is not required to advise DIAC if they believe a claimant to be unlawfully present in Australia. However they may reveal this information indirectly in the course of enquiring about visa status under the Memorandum of Understanding between the two agencies (Interview 62, Centrelink). The ‘front end’ checking of immigration status in order to determine eligibility for benefits was believed to be so effective that the discovery of unlawful non-citizens amongst existing Centrelink claimants almost never occurred. Dob-ins from the public were said to be the most likely avenue for suspicions to be raised about Centrelink clients who may be unlawful non-citizens, and it was reported that this information would be passed on to DIAC after initial investigation within the organisation.</p>
<p>Local council authorities in New South Wales have a range of regulatory responsibilities related to building standards, public health and safety. This makes them useful partners in inter-agency migration policing operations because of the legal powers they hold to enter and inspect certain properties. One local council officer responsible for regulating brothels said he engaged in regular joint operations with DIAC, was enthusiastic about their value in terms of his own objectives, and claimed to come across unlawful non-citizens or ‘persons with questionable status’ engaged in sex work at least once a month (Interview 61, Local Council). However an officer from another local council with a public health background had participated in joint operations rather more reluctantly, expressed concern about the conduct of the operations he had observed, and was sceptical about the organisational benefits (Interview 10, Local Council). Other regulatory authorities such as the Department of Employment, Education and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) and the Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) have responsibilities that require them to work closely with DIAC. DEEWR operates the automated PRISMS system and acts as a link between education providers and DIAC in relation to international students. The RTA regularly requests information about immigration status from DIAC while processing applications for driving licenses, which sometimes reveals the applicant’s unlawful status.</p>
<p>In response to the high political priority assigned to the identification of criminal deportees within the Compliance Priorities Matrix, DIAC has established a specialist Remand Team in Sydney to liaise with criminal justice agencies. Remand Team officers monitor the cases of criminal defendants following ad hoc notifications from police, attend trials, and receive regular reports from prisons identifying time-served prisoners who may be deportable. One hundred and ninety prisoners were said to have been released to DIAC custody in the two years prior to interview – 107 in 2007 and 83 in 2008. An informant from the Sentence Administration section within the NSW Department of Corrective Services claimed they ‘chase it a bit more aggressively nowadays … we just want to make sure that if somebody is required for deportation that we will try to facilitate it’ (Interview 59, Corrective Services).</p>
<p>Service providers form the final category of external organisations that may be cast into a migration policing role. The Educational Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 requires universities and other education providers to report on the attendance and progress of international students through the automated PRISMS system. Education providers also now bear the responsibility of making first-instance enquiries with students who appear to have breached these strict visa conditions. Community services, hospitals and even banks were also mentioned in interviews with DIAC Compliance staff as sources for the identification of unlawful non-citizens. No welfare or hospital informants were interviewed for the migration policing study as it was difficult to identify appropriate informants for interview. However it is notable that the wrongful detention and removal of Australian citizen Vivian Solon began with a referral to DIAC from a social worker following Ms Solon’s admission to hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004865812469975">Commonwealth Ombudsman, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0004865812469975"><title>Private citizens</title>
<p>Responsibility for migration policing is also projected onto the population at large. The legal requirement on employers to check the immigration status of prospective employees, under threat of criminal sanction, is an important part of DIAC’s ‘educative’ compliance strategy. The number of on-line VEVO (Visa Entitlement Verification On-line) checks made by employers increased dramatically from 245,000 in 2007/8 to 1.338 million in 2011/12 (DIAC, 2012: 179). Although DIAC’s primary enforcement concern is said to be with unscrupulous employers rather than illegal workers, VEVO enquiries about the employment entitlements of individual workers leave a record which can be acted upon if follow-up is considered necessary (Interview 42, Canberra DIAC). A report commissioned by the federal government has recently recommended that new civil sanctions for non-complying employers be increased, and existing criminal sanctions be more consistently enforced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004865812469975">Howells, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>DIAC also relies heavily on voluntarily provided ‘community information’. A 2004 report from the Auditor-General noted that community ‘tip-offs’ have always played a significant role in the identification of unlawful non-citizens (Australian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004865812469975">National Audit Office, 2004</xref>: 17–18). A new ‘Dob-in Service’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0004865812469975">3</xref></sup> was launched in 2004. It received 2481 allegations in 2007/8, of which only 154 (6%) were said to be formally investigated (DIAC, 2008 personal correspondence). By 2011/12 this had grown to 18,900 reports from community sources across the department as a whole (DIAC, 2012: 178). The NSW Police also receive reports from the public about alleged breaches of immigration law. One Local Area Commander said he believed it was more likely that unlawful non-citizens in his area would be protected by the community, rather than reported to the police (Interview 6, Police Local Area Command). However up to 50 per cent of police survey respondents in some Local Area Commands reported having checked someone’s immigration status in the previous 12 months following a report from a member of the public.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0004865812469975"><title>The dynamics and implications of migration policing networks</title>
<p>The previous section identified the major agencies and groups that contribute to migration policing and described their individual roles and occupational mentalities from a migration policing perspective. However the construction of a nodal cartography of migration policing demands a deeper examination of the inter-connections between network nodes. This section gives an overview of the multiple inter-agency networks identified in the Migration Policing study and discusses some aspects of their dynamics and recruitment methods.</p>
<sec id="sec11-0004865812469975"><title>Network morphology</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865812469975">Shearing and Wood (2003)</xref> have noted that nodal security networks may contain any combination of state actors (described as ‘first sector’ nodes); corporate or business actors (‘second sector’); and non-governmental organizations (‘third sector’). The migration policing networks identified in this study are overwhelmingly constituted by state and federal agencies, with the most direct role played by NSW Police and DIAC compliance officers, all of whom are ‘designated officers’ under the Migration Act. Rather than a multi-connected network of equal participants, migration policing is driven primarily by these core agencies, with other service-providing or regulatory agencies making up the periphery of the migration policing machinery. Private actors such as employers and universities have also become embedded within informated networks through their use of automated technologies such as VEVO and PRISMS. The ‘fanning out’ methodology did not identify any NGO participants, but the possible role played by NGOs, and by other service sector agencies such as hospitals, medical practitioners and schools, is worthy of further investigation. Although they are not integral to formal migration policing networks, it is clear that ‘dob-ins’ from the public make a significant contribution to the identification of unlawful non-citizens. Community members appear to occupy what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865812469975">Shearing and Wood (2003: 405)</xref> describe as a ‘fourth, informal sector, made up of people who operate outside of the first three sectors’.</p>
<p>The networks identified in the Migration Policing study can be categorized as either ‘operational networks’ which depend on the sharing of resources, skills and legal powers; or ‘informated networks’ which operate through the exchange of electronic information. Clearly neither can exist nor function in isolation from the other. For example, a joint operation to check for unlawful non-citizens at a particular workplace will require an exchange of intelligence information in the planning stages in order to define the target, identify risks and obtain the necessary legal authorisation. In addition, it will rely on real-time access to official records held by one or more participating agency once suspect individuals are identified, in order to confirm identity, check warrants, and determine immigration status. At other times, for example in relation to aggregate data matching processes or where records relating to a particular individual are requested, the informated networks operate across agencies in ways that are not aligned with any particular operation. A third category of ‘strategic’ networks is also apparent, where representatives from different agencies meet regularly to discuss matters of mutual concern at a policy level. Examples mentioned repeatedly in interviews include the Cash Economy Working Group which includes DIAC, the Australian Taxation Office and Centrelink; and the Police-DIAC Practice Management network – both of which operate at national level. These two strategic constellations no doubt reflect the political priority attached to criminal deportation within the immigration domain, and to whole-of-government cost recovery measures more generally.</p>
<p>Migration policing networks can also be categorised according to their longevity. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865812469975">Shearing and Wood (2003: 404)</xref> note, ‘the specific way in which governmental nodes relate to one another will vary across time and space’. Most of the time, operational and informated migration policing networks are ad hoc and time-delimited, being negotiated and constituted as needed. Examples include aggregate data matching against the Overstayers’ file conducted by taxation authorities on request from DIAC; and special-purpose joint operations which are constituted on the basis of particular ‘intelligence’. Compared with these irregular operations, strategic networks exhibit more continuity over time. However, information exchange networks may also be more enduring, such as the ongoing cross-agency transfer of enrolment and compliance information on international students effected through the PRISMS system; or the regular liaison between the Department of Corrective Services and the DIAC Remand Team over the impending release of potentially deportable prisoners. Moreover, traces of the operational networks deployed for a particular joint operation may persist over time, ready for a repeat performance involving the same organisational players. This was most apparent in relation to the regular multi-agency operations targeting the taxi industry, which were clearly well-rehearsed exercises. Moreover, these more enduring formations exhibited the multi-nodal characteristics of true networks, whereas much of the informated ‘networking’ identified in the study was limited to bilateral exchanges between DIAC and other agencies in the migration policing periphery.</p>
<p>Embedding a liaison officer within a partner organization is another way to build an enduring inter-agency network. Although the relationship is ostensibly bilateral, liaison officers may act as nodes ‘where knowledge and capacity are mobilized for transmission’ across a wider network of actors within each agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004865812469975">Burris 2004</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865812469975">Crawford, 2006</xref>: 458). In addition to a maze of inter-agency liaison-officer relationships identified in the study (notably between DIAC and police), an entire unit devoted to liaising with police over serious immigration-related crime – the Law Enforcement Liaison Unit – has been established in the Canberra Headquarters of DIAC. These developing relationships indicate the priority given to criminal deportations within the Compliance Priorities Matrix, and suggest that DIAC remains the driving force behind these inter-agency developments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0004865812469975"><title>Network dynamics</title>
<p>Forms of networked governance can be distinguished not only by their morphology, but also in terms of the way they operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865812469975">Johnston and Shearing, 2003</xref>). The diverse resources mobilised through nodes in migration policing networks include information, legal powers, skills and financial resources.</p>
<p>Information sharing is such a rapidly developing area that many agencies were found to have specialist staff to interpret legislation, negotiate inter-agency agreements, act as organisational ‘gatekeepers’ and seek out externally-held information requested by their co-workers. Most of the time, information exchange was mediated through purpose-built online systems or specialist liaison officers. In exceptional circumstances (notably the liaison between federal police and immigration authorities over people trafficking), working relationships were so close that direct access to information held by another agency was authorised for selected officers. The picture that emerged from this study is not yet one of super-connectivity. A complex legal web of privacy and disclosure rules still surrounds the exchange of personal data between agencies.</p>
<p>For DIAC, the main legal authority for requiring information from other agencies is section 18 of the Migration Act. This power applies so long as the information is required in relation to an individual believed to be an unlawful non-citizen, but does not compel disclosure of information in other circumstances. Examples of requests that would not fit the legal criteria included data to assist DIAC with investigations into immigration fraud (Interview 44, Canberra DIAC) or simply to ‘go fishing’ in search of potentially unlawful non-citizens (Interview 49, Sydney DIAC). Legislation governing the provision of information by other organisations also contains similar restrictions related to the legitimate activities of each agency. In order to overcome these limitations, DIAC informants said they liaised with other agencies to promote the collection of personal data in ways that would later enable its lawful disclosure, and expressed support for changes to legislation that would open up new possibilities for intelligence exchange and data matching, or the sharing of ‘best practice’.</p>
<p>Other indications from the interviews suggested that federal and state agencies are moving towards greater connectivity in the policing of migration. Garland has observed that ‘neo-liberal techniques of government, rely upon, and stimulate, <italic>agency</italic> while simultaneously reconfiguring (rather than removing) the constraints upon the freedom of choice of the agent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004865812469975">Garland, 1997</xref>: 197). Examples from the research interviews of these responsibilising techniques included inter-agency awareness programs and information technologies intended to shape the behaviour of organisational actors in desired directions, as described here.<disp-quote>
<p>We need to be using all the mechanisms that are in place for us … and if one of those mechanisms is immigration, and using our powers under the Migration Act, well so be it. But we need to prompt [police officers] to think along those lines, because it is only really a matter of doing it once or twice and then they think and they get it and they do it … The Department of Immigration want to see them prompted – to ask them questions. (Interview 35, NSW Police)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Beyond information-sharing, joint operations also provide opportunities to pool occupational skills (such as state police training in the use of force, or federal police investigative capacity) as well as legal powers, thereby opening up new possibilities to stop and search vehicles and individuals, enter premises, request or require information from other agencies, and use legally sanctioned force to achieve operational goals. However, where the legal powers of one agency are accessed in relation to objectives identified by another agency, gaps or disputes over legal authority were sometimes reported.<disp-quote>
<p>The reason that council was there was because [the police] believed that we had the ability to gain access to the properties without obtaining a warrant. The police were also in that situation, that they had no evidence of anything criminal going on. So it was a bit of a bizarre situation … In reality we shouldn’t have been going back to these premises unless there was new evidence [of planning breaches] to suggest that something had occurred. (Interview 10, Local Council)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This leads us to the important question of how individuals and agencies with differing occupational goals and professional values are recruited to become nodes in migration policing networks, and come to align themselves with migration enforcement objectives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0004865812469975"><title>Recruitment and resistances</title>
<p>In line with those who are sceptical of the ‘de-centring’ of state power in real-world examples of nodal governance (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865812469975">Crawford, 2006</xref>), migration policing networks were found to be largely driven by government border control imperatives. This is not surprising given the character of border control as primarily a national, rather than local, concern.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0004865812469975">4</xref></sup> The participation of a diverse range of agencies was achieved through a variety of techniques of persuasion which exploited overlapping interests across government agencies (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0004865812469975">Figure 1</xref>), while reserving legal sanctions for non-government actors, such as employers and education providers, whose cooperation could not otherwise be guaranteed.
<fig id="fig1-0004865812469975" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Overlapping targets for migration policing.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0004865812469975-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Working relations between partners can be classified according to levels of inter-agency integration. Gelsthorpe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0004865812469975">1985</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865812469975">Johnston and Shearing, 2003</xref>: 108) described a continuum of inter-agency relationships ranging from communication models based solely on information exchange, to cooperation then coordination models, and finally to highly integrated federation and merger models where members share similar organisational goals and incentives. Migration policing networks were most often found to be restricted to information exchange (communication models), or to involve joint action on mutually defined problems (cooperation models). Within these networks, individual agencies maintained their own organisational objectives, and cooperated either directly or indirectly in the identification of unlawful non-citizens, sometimes out of a general commitment to a whole-of-government approach (where federal agencies were concerned), or whenever their distinct organisational objectives happened to overlap, as reflected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0004865812469975">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>Relationships between core agencies were generally reported to be positive. A senior NSW Police manager described DIAC as ‘very participative and consultative, especially in relation to immigration and settlement stuff’ (Interview 40, Police Headquarters). However, network relationships are not always a picture of seamless cooperation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865812469975">Shearing and Wood (2003</xref>: 406) have noted that nodes within security networks ‘can operate in benign neglect of one another, or in forms of outright conflict’. One local council officer claimed that ‘it’s not our role to do that, to get involved in accusing people of – or even making that assumption that they are illegals or not. It probably oversteps our mark’ (Interview 10, Local Council B). Similar conflicts in organisational mentalities and methods were sometimes reported between the police and DIAC. One Local Area Commander, concerned about the public relations implications of police accompanying DIAC to serve immigration arrest warrants, argued: ‘if there is an image problem, then why should we get involved in it when it can actually be done by somebody else? (Interview 6, NSW Police Local Area Commander). Several DIAC and police participants noted the unrealistic expectations of many rank-and-file police officers about using immigration law as an instant solution to crime and disorder problems: ‘I have been to one of the lectures and the cops sit there and they go – Really, I didn't know that! How come we can’t just toss people out of the country?’ (Interview 35, NSW Police). As argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004865812469975">Garland (1997</xref>: 182), the governmental process ‘always entails activity on the part of the “subjects of power” and it therefore has built into it the probability that outcomes will be shaped by the resistance or private objectives of those acting down the line’.</p>
<p>Despite these resistances, one senior DIAC official argued that a new cross-agency perspective was emerging, in which government agencies were recognizing that multiple forms of non-compliance might be co-located: ‘[C]ompliance is about … making sure that people comply in the broader sense with the tax model or the welfare model or whatever else’ (Interview 44, Canberra DIAC). This creates conditions in which cross-agency incentives for cooperation based on shared objectives can be mobilised.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0004865812469975"><title>Structural embedding and the ubiquitous border</title>
<p>In this section we focus on emerging forms of ‘structurally embedded’ migration policing which point towards the development of a ‘ubiquitous border’. This networked border is intended not only to increase the chances that partner agencies will identify and report unlawful non-citizens – the main thrust of the networked strategies described so far – but will ‘responsibilise’ individuals with no legal entitlement to stay, so that they effectively self-police.</p>
<p>As discussed earlier, DIAC has adopted a range of ‘post-Palmer’ reforms that are intended to project a ‘softer’ image and begin a process of ‘building up trust again’ with the community (Interview 53, Sydney DIAC). This study has not been designed to evaluate the extent to which these stated changes in practice have been realised on the ground. What can be said is that, following a dip beginning around the time of the Palmer Inquiry, the number of reported removals is once again on the rise, and is edging closer to the 2002–3 peak of 13,878 removals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004865812469975">DIAC, 2003</xref>). It seems that many of the recent reforms, while ostensibly signalling a shift away from the openly coercive methods that characterised the pre-Palmer era, are intended to improve the efficiency and accuracy of systems aimed at identifying unlawful non-citizens in ways that are likely to increase the number of removals.</p>
<p>A significant new development described by one senior DIAC official suggests an intention to embed migration policing as deeply as possible into essential support networks, so that individuals without lawful status will have no choice but to bring themselves to the notice of immigration authorities. DIAC was said to be ‘shifting where our resources apply’ with a view to ‘making life difficult for people… so that they come in and see us’ (Interview 45, Canberra DIAC). This self-reporting could be motivated by a conscious intention to seek assistance to leave the country, or could be undertaken in the hope of finding a way to regularize their legal status. The latest DIAC Annual Report notes an increase in ‘voluntary’ departures as a result of deliberate departmental strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865812469975">DIAC, 2012</xref>), suggesting some success with these measures. However, this more detailed explanation of what is meant by ‘making life difficult for people’ calls into question the ‘voluntariness’ of this self-reporting:<disp-quote>
<p>[A]lready someone that’s overstayed and disappeared and has no entitlements and Medicare benefits or …  any form of social security benefit or anything like that, so they’re very dependent on employment. And you know putting in place these sort of structural things to make it look … it increases incentives for people … people to come in and engage with us. (Interview 45, Canberra DIAC)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Just as governmental techniques shape the choices exercised by organisational actors operating within migration policing networks, it seems the choices of unlawful non-citizens are being significantly narrowed by embedding the border more and more deeply into essential support networks. Because of the negative public image associated with more openly coercive enforcement tactics, one senior police officer interviewed for this study welcomed these developments, believing they would shift the emphasis away from police checks and improve efficiency.<disp-quote>
<p>We are not a nation where you are stopped and your papers are checked, so as a result [visa compliance] is difficult to police. However when these people go to hospitals and things like that, it is those routine things where presentation of documents is required where usually the apple cart starts to spill. (Interview 40, NSW Police Headquarters)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>While the emphasis within the post-Palmer DIAC is said to be on finding ways to regularise status wherever possible, the result is still likely to be the creation of ambient insecurity for those with irregular or uncertain immigration status. In addition, the existence of an anonymous dob-in service places enormous power in the hands of those who seek to exploit or control unlawfully present or other vulnerable non-citizens. Furthermore, rather than being a ‘softer’ option, structurally embedded migration policing networks are likely to be less visible, and therefore even more difficult to hold publicly accountable than street-level tactics. A full exploration of the social implications of structural embedding of the internal border requires further research of a more community-oriented and ethnographic nature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0004865812469975"><title>Recognising migration enforcement as policing</title>
<p>As a step towards increased knowledge and accountability, the operation of the internal border must first be recognised as a form of policing, no matter whether it is performed by a traditional law enforcement agency, by an organisation with an entirely different primary purpose, or by responsibilised private actors. DIAC officers – even those who work within the compliance field – resist the characterisation of their function as ‘policing’. However, we contend that the enforcement of immigration law is a form of policing and should be understood and studied as such. This is so not only because DIAC officers, like police, exercise coercive powers to search, question, apprehend and detain suspected unlawful non-citizens, but also because the role of state police themselves is much broader than is generally understood and also encompasses non-coercive approaches as well as coercive law enforcement. The capacity for involuntary expulsion will always give migration policing a character that is distinctive from the policing of citizens. But once policing, as we know it, is acknowledged as a much broader practice of order maintenance, the enforcement of immigration law can be seen more clearly as a specialised form of pluralised policing, leading not only to enforcement through deportation or removal, but also involving attempts to ‘restore order’ through regularising visa status, and to promote compliance through public education and various techniques of persuasion and ‘soft’ coercion.</p>
