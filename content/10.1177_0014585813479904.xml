<p>While a reader/buyer will still not find a section devoted to Italian Americana in any bookstore, Italian-American studies has now generated a well-recognized body of research, scholarship, literature and publications. In this tangled thicket one can find almost anything: both micro and macro studies, memoirs, pietism and absorbing criticism. Peter Carravetta, one of the leading practitioners in the field, acknowledges that Italian-American studies, though still an academic ‘minority’, is no longer ‘at the margins’. What Italian-American studies lacks, argues Carravetta, is a sophisticated or even adequate theoretical rigor. Could it be that the oft-cited pragmatism of the Italian-Americans, crafted in both the persistence of feudal conditions well into the 20th-century Italy they left as well as the cauldron they found in migration and the New World, has tempered the supposedly innate bent of Italians, especially southern Italians, to contemplative reflection?</p>
<p><italic>The Status of Interpretation in Italian American Studies</italic> is the collected proceedings of the very first (but hopefully not the last) Forum in Italian American Criticism (FIAC) organized by Carravetta in his capacity as the Alfonse M. D’Amato Chair in Italian and Italian-American Studies at Stony Brook University. The conference, which unfolded over 2 days at Stony Brook’s Manhattan campus, brought together scholars from the United States and Italy to assess where we are at theoretically and where we might go in the near future. (Full disclosure: while I attended and acted as a moderator for a panel, I did not present a paper for the conference or submit an essay.)</p>
<p>The conference was a ‘taking stock’ of sorts. Because of the work of giants in the field such as Rudy Vecoli, there is now a younger generation of scholars doing sophisticated archival work, while others, such as James Periconi, have devoted themselves to the rescue of forgotten and rare Italian-American publications. A true ‘archeology of the self’. Italian-American studies can now boast of a dozen endowed chairs in universities across the country, journals and publishing initiatives (Fordham and SUNY university presses and Palgrave Macmillan have series devoted to Italian-American studies while Bordighera and Forum Italicum publish exclusively Italian and Italian-American scholarship.) The American Italian Historical Association, founded in 1966 by historians and social scientists, recently changed its name to the Italian American Studies Association to better reflect the changing make-up of its membership and their scholarship.</p>
<p>But where do we stand in relation to Italian studies and other area studies such as American studies or Cultural studies? As Carravetta pointedly inquires in his preface to the volume: ‘what is <italic>Italian</italic> American criticism a criticism of?’ We have reached a point in our discipline where we can ask (<italic>must</italic> ask, writes Carravetta)</p><disp-quote>
<p>whether it is still fruitful to continue working with the known self-canceling dichotomies: Italian-American, identity-difference, marginal-mainstream, immigrant-assimilated … when there is always a risk of validating essentialist projects and logical conundrums … It is high time we take leave of facile dualism and investigate instead pluralities, convergences both local and international, hybridity, mobility, and the interstices where a variety of apparently unrelated forms of interaction yield new social subjects and new lines of inquiry and intervention. (p. viii)</p></disp-quote>
<p>Editor Jerome Krase offers, in his introduction to the volume, a topography of both Italian-American studies and the essays collected here, noting that three of the participants and contributors – namely, Robert Viscusi, Fred Gardaphè, and Anthony Tamburri – are also subjects of other contributors’ essays. Viscusi’s brilliant keynote address, ‘The Ice Margin’, uses the field and images of glaciology to re-think what the glaciers of history and emigration have left in their wake. The ‘detritus’ left behind Viscusi categorizes and characterizes in four ways: ‘fragments’, ‘facsimiles’, the ‘invisible’ and the ‘illegible’. By some process of either alchemy or serendipity, these four categories reappear in most of the 11 subsequent essays.</p>
<p>Gardaphè, in ‘Commedia della Morte: Theories of Life and Death in Italian American Culture’, wonders why death – which is so often present, even if unmentioned, in Italian-American literature – has not been properly theorized. Using Pietro Di Donato’s last (and soon to be <italic>finally</italic> published) novel, <italic>The American Gospels</italic>, Gardaphè examines the intersection of humor, irony and death in Italian-American literature, touching on Mary Jo Bona’s recent book, <italic>By the Breath of Their Mouths</italic>, as well as Frank Lentrichhia’s powerful and disturbing novel, <italic>The Italian Actress</italic> (Lentrichhia’s sequel, <italic>The Accidental Pallbearer</italic>, is forthcoming from Melville House). Tamburri’s late night speculations on where we’ve been and where we might go from here are used to reflect on a long history of discrimination, incendiary images and self-inflicted wounds, such as Gay Talese’s infelicitous 1993 essay on the front page of the <italic>New York Times Book Review</italic>: ‘Where Are the Italian American Novelists?’</p>
<p>William Boelhower’s ‘Renewing the Conceptual Dimensions of Italian-American Writing and Scholarship’ argues that three concepts from the paradigm of Atlantic studies (the circumatlantic, the transatlantic and the cisatlantic) can be used to good effect in Italian American studies. Djelal Kadir, coming from the fields of globalization, Latin American studies and postcolonial studies, makes a compelling argument that ‘the poetic’ must be added to the by now embedded quaternion of race, gender, class and identity. Martino Marazzi concisely interrogates tradition and traditionalism in Italian-American literature while Krase’s ‘Interpreting the Look: A Visual Semiotics of Ethnic Authenticity’ (supplemented with a 20-image visual essay) argues that there is indeed an indigenous and coherent Italian-American ethnicity.</p>
<p>Francesca Canadé Sautman’s ‘Creolizing the Lack: Interpreting Race and Racism in Italian America’ is perhaps the most demanding essay of the collection. But once the reader understands the theory of ‘creolization’ as put forth by the Martinique philosopher and poet Edouard Glissant, we can understand how cultural hybridity would be a powerful tool to reconceptualize Italian-American culture. Stefano Lucconi in ‘Whiteness and Ethnicity in Italian-American Identity’ asks why whiteness studies have not had as much impact on Italian-American studies and offers an excellent introduction to the topic. Gerry Meyer’s ‘Theorizing Italian American History’ is a plea for a historiographical paradigm, reflecting on Vecoli’s work and Donna Gabbaccia’s <italic>From Sicily to Elizabeth Street</italic>, ending with an appeal to Leonard Covello’s cultural pluralism. Donna Chirico’s ‘The Dog Catches His Tail’ is a charming autobiographical contribution using narrative psychology to delineate a racial and ethnic identity. Finally, Ottorino Cappelli in ‘Re-Interpreting Italian-American Politics’ asks whether an ‘Italian American ethnic politics’ exists today after generations of assimilation.</p>
<p>Taken together, these essays are a welcome stimulus to what can only be hoped is a new catalyst in Italian-American criticism and theory. As Carravetta reminds the reader in his preface, the <italic>Theorós</italic> is an emissary sent to observe and participate in a celebration. ‘The root of the word contains a sense of light, of god even’ (p. ix). So let us go forth with these essays and these colleagues to observe, to investigate, to participate and to celebrate this bewitching, bewildering, and bedeviled culture of ours.</p>
