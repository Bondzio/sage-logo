<p>Instruction about goal setting can increase students’ self-determination and reduce problem behavior. Computer-assisted instruction could offer teachers another format for teaching goal setting and self-determination. This study used a multiple probes across participants design to examine the effects of computer-assisted instruction on students’ knowledge of the Self-Determined Learning Model of Instruction (SDLMI) and level of disruptive behavior. Results indicated increased knowledge of the SDLMI and decreased levels of disruptive behavior for all participants. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Disruptive behavior is one of the greatest challenges classroom teachers face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022466910362261">Alberto &amp; Troutman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022466910362261">Kerr &amp; Nelson, 2010</xref>). As students progress through school, they are expected to meet not only academic expectations but behavioral expectations as well. Students who fail to meet behavioral expectations are at increased risk for poor peer relationships, increased office referrals, suspensions, referral to special education, change in disability category to emotional disturbance (ED), and assignment to self-contained settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022466910362261">Lane, Wehby, &amp; Cooley, 2006</xref>). Ultimately, these negative in-school outcomes may lead to poor postschool outcomes. For instance, research indicates that students with ED (a) are more likely to drop out of school, (b) are less likely to graduate with a regular diploma, (c) are more likely to become incarcerated, (d) are less likely to enroll in postschool education, and (e) have difficulty maintaining postschool employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022466910362261">Wagner, Newman, Cameto, Levine, &amp; Garza, 2006</xref>). As a result, it is increasingly important to address behavior problems early to prevent students from being identified with ED and increase positive in-school and postschool outcomes for students with behavior problems.</p>
<p>Incorporating self-determination into the curriculum and explicitly teaching self-determination as early as preschool may be one method for preventing ED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022466910362261">Clark, Olympia, Jensen, Heathfield, &amp; Jenson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022466910362261">Forness et al., 2000</xref>). Students who are taught self-determination skills tend to have fewer behavior problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022466910362261">Pierson, Carter, Lane, &amp; Glaeser, 2008</xref>). In addition, self-determination has been identified as an in-school predictor of positive postschool outcomes for students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022466910362261">Test et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, teaching students self-determination strategies can help them make progress in the general curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022466910362261">Wehmeyer, Field, Doren, Jones, &amp; Mason, 2004</xref>). In a recent survey of elementary and middle school teachers about the importance of incorporating self-determination into the curriculum, results suggested that both groups felt seven components of self-determination (i.e., problem solving, self-management, decision making, goal setting, self-awareness, choice making, self-advocacy) were important additions to general and special education curricula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022466910362261">Stang, Carter, Lane, &amp; Pierson, 2009</xref>). Specifically, goal setting was one component that was rated as extremely important but not consistently taught to students in general and special education classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022466910362261">Stang et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Instruction about goal setting can increase students’ self-determination, reduce their problem behavior, and increase accountability for their actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022466910362261">Snyder &amp; Shapiro, 1997</xref>). Goal setting is a self-mediated strategy in which students self-select and set personal goals that relate to improving behavior and/or academic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022466910362261">Mooney, Ryan, Uhing, Reid, &amp; Epstein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022466910362261">Ryan, Pierce, &amp; Mooney, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022466910362261">Konrad, Fowler, Walker, Test, and Wood (2007)</xref> conducted a review of self-determination interventions for improving the academic skills of students with learning disabilities. Results of the review suggested that goal setting and goal setting plus self-management were effective interventions for improving students’ academic skills. In addition, in a literature review conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022466910362261">Mooney et al. (2005)</xref>, goal setting was identified as an effective self-management strategy for improving the academic performance of students with ED.</p>
<p>Although goal setting has been taught using various instructional methods (e.g., small-group and one-on-one instruction using teacher modeling and guided practice, self-setting goals based on teacher request and performance feedback, self-management intervention packages), one specific intervention that has been used to teach students goal setting is the Self-Determined Learning Model of Instruction (SDLMI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022466910362261">Agran, Blanchard, &amp; Wehmeyer, 2000</xref>). The SDLMI is an instructional model teachers can use to “teach students to become self-regulated problem-solvers, to self-direct instruction toward self-selected goals, and gain enhanced self-determination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022466910362261">Agran et al., 2000</xref>, p. 353). This instructional model requires students to set a goal, make a plan to address the goal, and make necessary changes to be successful at meeting the specific goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022466910362261">Agran, Cavin, Wehmeyer, &amp; Palmer, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies support the use of the SDLMI as an effective model for teaching students with disabilities to self-set goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022466910362261">Agran, Blanchard, Wehmeyer, &amp; Hughes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022466910362261">Agran et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022466910362261">Agran et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022466910362261">Agran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022466910362261">Fowler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022466910362261">McGlashing-Johnson, Agran, Sitlington, Cavin, &amp; Wehmeyer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022466910362261">Palmer &amp; Wehmeyer, 2003</xref>). Across these studies, participants ranged in age from 5 to 20 years old. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022466910362261">Agran et al. (2002)</xref> found that using the SDLMI with middle school students with autism, intellectual disabilities, or multiple disabilities improved students’ ability to self-set goals and reduced problem behaviors (i.e., inappropriate touching, not following directions). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022466910362261">Agran et al. (2006)</xref> found when middle school students with moderate to severe disabilities were taught the SDLMI, students’ ability to self-select academic skills (i.e., physical science lab activities, social studies mapping skills, life science skills) improved. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022466910362261">Palmer and Wehmeyer (2003)</xref> investigated using the SDLMI to teach elementary students at risk for, or with, disabilities to self-set academic and behavior goals (e.g., following directions, writing one’s name, spelling). Students in this study ranged in age from 5 to 10 years old. Palmer and Wehmeyer found the SDLMI helped the students attain academic and behavior goals. Finally, one study not only investigated the effect of SDLMI on student academic goal attainment but measured elementary students’ ability to learn the steps of the SDLMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022466910362261">Fowler, 2008</xref>). Students in this study ranged in age from 6 to 10 years old. Fowler found when elementary students with ED were taught the SDLMI, students acquired knowledge of the SDLMI and attained academic goals (i.e., writing, spelling).</p>
<p>In these studies, the SDLMI was taught using traditional instructional methods, such as teacher-directed small-group instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022466910362261">Agran et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022466910362261">Fowler, 2008</xref>), one-on-one instruction at job sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022466910362261">McGlashing-Johnson et al., 2004</xref>), and one-to-one classroom instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022466910362261">Agran et al., 2002</xref>). Computer-assisted instruction (CAI) could offer teachers another format for teaching goal setting and self-determination and could be used to present the SDLMI. CAI offers an interactive format that can present multiple examples of content and provide immediate feedback on student performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022466910362261">Hutcherson, Langone, Ayers, &amp; Clees, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022466910362261">Mazzotti, Test, Wood, &amp; Richter, 2009</xref>). CAI can allow students to work independently or with minimal guidance from a teacher.</p>
<p>Research has shown that CAI can be an effective format for teaching students at risk for, and with, disabilities various skills such as knowledge of postschool options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022466910362261">Mazzotti et al., 2009</xref>), life and employment skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022466910362261">Mechling, Gast, &amp; Krupa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022466910362261">Mechling &amp; Ortega-Hurndon, 2007</xref>), social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022466910362261">Sansosti &amp; Powell-Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022466910362261">Simpson, Langone, &amp; Ayres, 2004</xref>), math skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022466910362261">Fuchs et al., 2006</xref>), and reading skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022466910362261">Coleman-Martin, Heller, Cihak, &amp; Irvine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022466910362261">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). Research on teaching the SDLMI process using CAI could make a valuable contribution to the literature. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of computer-assisted SDLMI on students’ knowledge of the SDLMI and disruptive behavior.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants (pseudonyms are used throughout) included three elementary students with disabilities who exhibited chronic behavior problems. All three students (two males, one female) were 10 years old, received instruction in a general education classroom, and were eligible for special education services based on North Carolina state eligibility guidelines. Two of the students were African American, and one was Caucasian. Students who met the inclusion criteria for participating in the study were (a) in a fourth-grade general education classroom and (b) identified on the basis of office referrals by the classroom teacher as students with chronic behavior problems.</p>

<title>Qu’Viah</title>
<p>Qu’Viah was a 10-year-old African American female with learning disabilities in the areas of reading, writing, and math. In addition, Qu’Viah was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder at the beginning of the school year. She received her instruction in an inclusion classroom that included seven other students with disabilities in addition to students without disabilities. Qu’Viah was identified by the classroom teacher as a student with numerous office referrals for both major and minor offenses (e.g., fighting, defiance, excessive talking, off-task behavior).</p>

<title>Branford</title>
<p>Branford was a 10-year-old Caucasian male with a specific learning disability in reading and writing. He received instruction in an inclusion classroom that included seven other students with disabilities in addition to students without disabilities. Branford had attended the school since he was in kindergarten and was identified as having a learning disability when he was in first grade. According to Branford’s teacher, Branford was a student with chronic behavior problems who had numerous office referrals each year. The classroom teacher identified Branford as having chronic behavior problems including major and minor offenses (e.g., fighting, stealing, noncompliance, fidgeting during instruction). Because of Branford’s chronic behavior problems and numerous office referrals, he had been re-referred to the school’s intervention team to determine if his disability category needed to be changed to ED.</p>

<sec id="section6-0022466910362261">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The study took place at an elementary school located in a large, urban school district. The school population totaled 928 students (51% male, 49% female). The population was diverse, with 55.7% African American, 24.8% Caucasian, 10.6% Hispanic, 5.6% multiracial, 2.6% Asian, and 1.2% American Indian students. Students with disabilities represented 12.8% of the total school population. The school followed a schoolwide model of positive behavior support. The study was conducted in the spring during the third and fourth quarters. The intervention was conducted in a small office next to the general education classroom setting during the first morning block at 7:30 a.m. Intervention sessions ranged from 8 to 22 min with a mean of 15 min.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022466910362261">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>A laptop computer equipped with Microsoft PowerPoint<sup>©</sup> and Microsoft Word<sup>©</sup> 2007 was used to facilitate the intervention. The researcher used Microsoft PowerPoint<sup>©</sup> to create the visual and audio components of the intervention (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022466910362261">Wood, Mackiewicz, Van Norman, &amp; Cooke, 2007</xref>) and Microsoft Word<sup>©</sup> 2007 to capture students’ typed responses during the intervention. In addition, Comic Creator<sup>©</sup> was used to create comics for Part 1 of the intervention to provide students with examples of strengths and needs. Once the comics were created, SNAGIT<sup>©</sup> was used to copy the comics into the Microsoft PowerPoint<sup>©</sup> slides. SNAGIT<sup>©</sup> was also used to download photographs representing appropriate behavior (e.g., seated at desk and working on an assignment) throughout all parts of the intervention. A digital voice recorder was used to audio record the narrative of the intervention. Other materials included data collection sheets (i.e., pretests, posttests, probes, partial-interval recording, procedural fidelity checklists, interrater reliability checklists, social validity checklists), a clipboard, and pencils for scoring.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022466910362261">
<title>Experimenter</title>
<p>The experimenter (first author) was a doctoral student in special education. Prior to entering the doctoral program, the experimenter had taught students with disabilities in inclusion settings at the school where the study was conducted. The experimenter contacted the school’s principal to gain access to students exhibiting behavior problems for this study. General and special education teachers did not play a role in implementing the intervention but were aware of the intervention’s purpose and procedures. In addition, the general education teacher was aware that behavior data were being collected; however, the general education teacher was unaware of the system used to collect the data or the time during which the behavior data were collected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022466910362261">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>The study included two dependent variables. The first dependent variable was knowledge of the SDLMI, measured by a 27-point probe. The SDLMI has three basic parts: set a goal, make a plan, and adjust your goal. Knowledge of the SDLMI was defined as students’ ability to orally define each of the three basic part questions (i.e., 1 question per part) and 12 supporting questions (i.e., 4 questions per part). The researcher measured each student’s response item by item based on his or her oral response to the questions. For stating each basic part question, incorrect (0 points) or correct (1 point) was scored, and the 4 supporting questions for each part were scored on a 3-point Likert scale (i.e., 0 = <italic>incorrect</italic>, 1 = <italic>partially correct</italic>, 2 = <italic>totally correct</italic>) totaling 9 points for each part of the SDLMI. The probes for students’ knowledge of the SDLMI were administered following each intervention session and included 5 questions (1 question with a possibility of 1 point and 4 with a possibility of 2 points) per SDLMI part. The questions for the SDLMI probe were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022466910362261">Fowler (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022466910362261">Palmer and Wehmeyer (2003)</xref>. The probes were read aloud to the students, and the students provided answers orally. The researcher scored items using the probe checklist by circling “incorrect” or “correct” for the 3 questions that required the student to provide a single response and rating answers for the 12 questions that required a partial or total correct response using the 3-point Likert scale. The percentage of partially/totally correct responses to the 27-point probe were graphed (i.e., 9 points for <italic>set a goal</italic>, 9 points for <italic>make a plan</italic>, 9 points for <italic>adjust your goal</italic>). Scores on the computer-assisted SDLMI probes were converted to percentages to compare students’ progress on the intervention to students’ disruptive behavior. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022466910362261">Figure 1</xref> for an example of the computer-assisted SDLMI probe.</p>

</fig>
<p>The second dependent variable was a measure of students’ disruptive behavior. Disruptive behavior was defined as (a) talking or conversing during teacher instruction, (b) annoying other students (i.e., making faces, giggling, touching, making noises, tapping or hitting on desk, throwing or manipulating objects), (c) paying attention to other stimuli (i.e., playing with or attending to objects in desk or other instructional items), (d) scribbling or drawing pictures, (e) writing notes, (f) spitting, (g) sucking fingers, (h) getting out of seat without permission (i.e., leaving assigned area), (i) tipping or moving chair to bring legs off floor, and (j) calling out (i.e., not raising hand when the teacher asks a question, before another student responds, or before the teacher answers a question; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022466910362261">Lambert, Cartledge, Heward, &amp; Lo, 2006</xref>). Disruptive behavior was measured using a partial-interval recording system. The observation period was divided into a series of 10 s intervals. The observer recorded whether the target behavior occurred at any time within the interval using the disruptive behavior recording form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022466910362261">Cooper, Heron, &amp; Heward, 2007</xref>). An outside observer was trained to conduct observations of each student as a means of collecting interrater reliability for this dependent variable. This observer was trained on appropriate data collection and observation procedures. Behavior data were collected 5 days per week during math instruction for all students from a small office through a two-way mirror from which all students could be viewed in the general education classroom. All three students were observed during 10 min observation periods, and observations for each student were rotated after every 15 s (i.e., 10 s observe, 5 s record) until 10 min elaspsed, resulting in 10 complete intervals per student.</p>
<sec id="section10-0022466910362261">
<title>Interrater reliability</title>
<p>Interrater reliability was collected on 30% of the probes for the first dependent variable (i.e., knowledge of the SDLMI) using item-by-item scoring. Student responses to SDLMI probes were recorded using a digital audio recorder for each intervention session. The researcher trained a second observer to collect data on the first primary dependent variable. The second observer was a doctoral research assistant and did not play a role in the study other than conducting interrater reliability for the first dependent variable. To facilitate interrater reliability, the second observer was given a copy of the probe checklist prior to scoring and the audio recording, which included student responses to the probes. An agreement was recorded if both observers identically scored the answer as correct or incorrect. A disagreement was recorded if questions were not scored identically. Percent agreement for each probe was calculated by dividing the number of agreements by the number of agreements plus disagreements and multiplying by 100. Interrater reliability for the first dependent variable was 94.6%.</p>
<p>In addition, interrater reliability was collected for the second dependent variable (i.e., students’ disruptive behavior). The researcher collected data using the disruptive behavior recording form at the same time the outside observer collected data for 47% of the observations conducted for each student across all phases (i.e., baseline, intervention, maintenance). Interval-by-interval comparison was used to determine agreements and disagreements. An agreement was recorded if both observers identically scored the interval as yes or no. A disagreement was recorded if intervals were not scored identically. Percentage agreement for each disruptive behavior recording form was calculated by dividing the number of agreements by the number of agreements plus disagreements and multiplying by 100. Interrater reliability for the second dependent variable was 97.7%.</p>

<title>Social validity data</title>
<p>At the conclusion of the study, the students’ classroom teacher was given a questionnaire to determine perceptions of the effectiveness of the computer-assisted SDLMI intervention, students’ ability to self-set behavior goals, and feasibility of CAI as a method of instruction. The questionnaire included four open-ended questions. Students also received questionnaires that used a 4-point Likert rating scale (i.e., 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 2 = <italic>disagree</italic>, 3 = <italic>agree</italic>, 4 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>) to assess their perceptions of the intervention and using CAI.</p>
<p>In addition to social validity data, social comparison data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022466910362261">Brulle, Barton, &amp; Repp, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022466910362261">Cooper et al., 2007</xref>) were collected. Social comparison data were collected beginning in Part 2 of the computer-assisted SDLMI and were collected consistently for the duration of the study. For the purposes of this study, social comparison data were collected on four “best-behaved” students in the participants’ general education classroom nominated by the classroom teacher, and data were compared to the behavior of students who were taught the SDLMI strategy. The researcher collected social comparison data using the disruptive behavior recording form at the same time the outside observer collected data for 31% of the observations conducted for each best-behaved student.</p>

<sec id="section12-0022466910362261">
<title>Design</title>
<p>The experimental design was a multiple probe across participants design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022466910362261">Cooper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022466910362261">Tawny &amp; Gast, 1984</xref>) to evaluate the effects of the computer-assisted SDLMI on students’ knowledge of the SDLMI and disruptive behavior. During baseline, a minimum of three data probes were collected on each student to determine the level of performance prior to the intervention. Qu’Viah (i.e., student with the lowest, stable baseline data probe) entered intervention first. Once Qu’Viah showed an increase on probes for three consecutive sessions during intervention, another baseline data probe was administered to the remaining students to determine if their levels of performance had remained stable and low. Based on this baseline probe, Branford had the lowest level of performance and entered the intervention phase. Zion entered the intervention phase using the same method.</p>

<sec id="section13-0022466910362261">
<title>Procedures</title>
<sec id="section14-0022466910362261">
<title>General procedures</title>
<p>Students participated in the intervention for approximately five 15-min sessions per week (i.e., one session per day). After every intervention session, probes were conducted to evaluate students’ knowledge of the SDLMI. Following the probe, students returned to their classroom, and the researcher collected data about each student’s disruptive behavior by observing through a two-way mirror from a small office adjacent to the students’ classroom.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0022466910362261">
<title>Baseline</title>
<p>Prior to beginning the computer-assisted SDLMI intervention, the researcher collected baseline data on all students for the first and second dependent variables. Students were administered probes to determine their knowledge of the SDLMI prior to the intervention, and disruptive behavior data were collected using the recording form.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0022466910362261">
<title>Computer-assisted SDLMI</title>
<p>Students were trained on the steps of the intervention in the small office located next to the general education classroom. Specifically, students received step-by-step instructions about how to navigate through the CAI program and respond to the visual and audio components of the intervention. First, students watched the researcher demonstrate procedures. Second, students were given an opportunity to practice procedures with the researcher. Finally, students practiced procedures independently until mastery (i.e., 100% on the procedural fidelity checklist) was reached.</p>
<p>The intervention was presented in three parts. Intervention procedures included visual and audio components presented in the following sequence. For all three parts of the intervention, students completed worksheets on the computer. Part 1 (set a goal) included three lessons: (a) Lesson 1, Identify Strengths and Needs, included describing what a goal is, identifying students’ strengths and needs based on classroom expectations, and completing a strengths and needs worksheet using Microsoft Word<sup>©</sup> 2007; (b) Lesson 2, Expected Behavior, included describing what a goal is, comparing current behavior to school/class expectations, providing examples of appropriate behavior, identifying barriers, and completing the behavior worksheet using Microsoft Word<sup>©</sup> 2007; and (c) Lesson 3, SDLMI and Setting Behavior Goal, included “Where I am?” to “Where I want to be?,” identifying what the student wanted to accomplish in terms of behavior, and completing a set a goal worksheet using Microsoft Word<sup>©</sup> 2007.</p>
<p>Part 2 (make a plan) included three lessons: (a) Lesson 4, Problem Solving and Plan Development, included completing an interactive problem-solving activity, identifying barriers and solutions to meet goals, and completing a barriers worksheet using Microsoft Word<sup>©</sup> 2007; (b) Lesson 5, Identifying Supports to Achieve Goals, included supports for goal success, tools for achieving goal (e.g., cue cards, task analysis, self-monitoring checklist, student-directed worksheet), and student’s self-selecting tool for success; and (c) Lesson 6, Finalize Plan Towards Goal, included identifying specific steps to meet the goal, providing supports required for meeting the goal, and developing a plan.</p>
<p>Part 3 (adjust your goal) included two lessons, (a) Lesson 7, Self-Evaluation/Record Performance Data, providing students with information about their progress since the start of the SDLMI strategy, graphing progress toward their goal, providing reasons why progress was made toward the goal, students reviewing plans, and completing steps identified; and (b) Lesson 8, Adjust the Goal, included identifying whether the student’s goal was met, identifying changes to student’s goal if not met, providing examples of how and why changes may need to be made to the goal if the student was not making progress, and completing a goal revision worksheet using Microsoft Word<sup>©</sup> 2007. CAI followed the same format for each SDLMI part and included a model-lead-test format (i.e., listen to the model, say it with the model, say it on your own) throughout the intervention.</p>
<p>Lessons for each intervention part (i.e., set a goal, make a plan, adjust your goal) were presented sequentially each school day (i.e., 5 days per week), and probes were conducted at the end of each lesson. Mastery criteria for student responses to the probes were set based on partially correct or correct responses to questions for each SDLMI part. Students remained in the intervention for each part of the SDLMI until they had scored seven out of nine possible points (78%); however, if a student met mastery criteria prior to completion of lessons for each part of the SDLMI, instruction and probes continued until all lessons were taught. If a student did not meet the mastery criteria, booster sessions were conducted for the SDLMI part(s) the student had difficulty mastering. In addition, the researcher recorded each student’s disruptive behavior daily using a partial-interval recording system. Once a student in the intervention met the criteria for all three parts of the SDLMI, the intervention was stopped, and the student entered the maintenance phase.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0022466910362261">
<title>Booster sessions</title>
<p>Booster sessions were needed for Branford during Part 3 (adjust your goal) of the computer-assisted SDLMI. Because Branford did not reach mastery of Part 3 for two consecutive sessions, he participated in a booster session. The booster session included a review of the last computer-assisted SDLMI lesson (i.e., Lesson 8) for Part 3 with the researcher observing to ensure that all the information was reviewed thoroughly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0022466910362261">
<title>Maintenance</title>
<p>When students met mastery criteria on the probes for all three SDLMI parts, the intervention was stopped, and maintenance data were collected once per week for 3 weeks. Maintenance data were collected on students’ disruptive behavior using the same procedures used during the baseline and intervention phases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0022466910362261">
<title>Procedural fidelity</title>
<p>Procedural fidelity was measured for the intervention. A procedural fidelity checklist was used for the computer-assisted SDLMI procedures. Procedural fidelity was established by calculating the percentage of items on the procedural fidelity checklist presented correctly by students during the intervention. The researcher observed 25% of the sessions distributed evenly across students and across the three parts of the intervention. Procedural fidelity was 96.1%.</p>

<title>Qu’Viah</title>
<p>During baseline, Qu’Viah’s performance on the computer-assisted SDLMI probe was stable, and scores ranged from 0% to 7% correct with a mean of 3.75%. Disruptive behavior during baseline was high and showed an increasing trend, ranging from 50% to 70% with a mean of 60%. During Part 1 of the computer-assisted SDLMI, Qu’Viah’s performance showed an increasing trend, with scores ranging from 11% to 26% correct with a mean of 20.5%. Disruptive behavior during Part 1 showed a decreasing trend ranging from 50% to 40% with a mean of 45%. During Part 2 of the intervention, Qu’Viah’s scores were variable; however, ultimately showed an increasing trend, with scores ranging from 33% to 52% with a mean of 42.2%. Disruptive behavior during Part 2 was variable, ranging from 10% to 100% with a mean of 30%, but ultimately showed low levels of disruptive behavior. During computer-assisted SDLMI Session 7 (Part 2), Qu’Viah’s disruptive behavior was at 100%, and performance on the probe decreased, creating high variability during this part. The teacher reported that Qu’Viah had a “rough” morning on the basis that Qu’Viah had not wanted to attend school and had an altercation with another student prior to the start of the school day. Therefore, this may have been the reason her behavior escalated and performance decreased. During Part 3 of the intervention, Qu’Viah’s performance showed an increasing trend, with scores ranging from 70% to 89% with a mean of 81.3%, and disruptive behavior remained low, ranging from 10% to 20% with a mean of 16.7%. Maintenance data for Qu’Viah’s performance on the computer-assisted SDLMI probes remained at high levels, ranging from 78% to 89% with a mean of 83%, and disruptive behavior remained low and within a socially acceptable range, with a mean of 23%.</p>

<sec id="section23-0022466910362261">
<title>Branford</title>
<p>During baseline, Branford’s performance on the computer-assisted SDLMI probe was stable and remained at 4% correct with a mean of 4%. Disruptive behavior during baseline was variable and ranged from 60% to 70% with a mean of 62%. During Part 1 of the computer-assisted SDLMI intervention, Branford’s performance on the probes showed an increasing trend, with scores ranging from 7% to 30% correct with a mean of 20.5%. Disruptive behavior during Part 1 showed a decreasing trend, ranging from 40% to 20% with a mean of 27.5%. During Part 2 of the intervention, Branford’s performance on the probes showed an increasing, stable trend, with scores ranging from 41% to 52% with a mean of 47.3%, and disruptive behavior showed a variable trend, ranging from 20% to 30% with a mean of 20%. During Part 3 of the intervention, Branford’s performance on the probes showed an increasing trend, ranging from 56% to 85% with a mean of 73.5%, and disruptive behavior was variable, ranging from 20% to 30% with a mean of 20%. When probed on Session 12, Branford did not reach mastery criteria for Part 3; therefore, a booster session was conducted during Session 13. Branford was probed at the end of Session 13 and on Session 14, at which time he met mastery criteria for Part 3 for 2 consecutive days and exited the intervention. Maintenance data for Branford’s performance on the computer-assisted SDLMI probes remained at a high level, ranging from 74% to 81% with a mean of 77.6%, and disruptive behavior remained low and within a socially acceptable range, ranging from 20% to 40% with a mean of 30%.</p>

<p>During baseline, Zion’s performance on the computer-assisted SDLMI probe was stable, ranging from 4% to 7% correct with a mean of 4.3%. Disruptive behavior during baseline showed an increasing trend, ranging from 50% to 80% with a mean of 65%. During Part 1 of the computer-assisted SDLMI intervention, Zion’s performance on the probes showed an increasing trend, with scores ranging from 15% to 33% correct with a mean of 26.75%. Disruptive behavior during Part 1 showed a stable and decreasing trend, ranging from 50% to 40% with a mean of 47.5%. During Part 2 of the intervention, Zion’s performance on the probes showed an increasing trend, with scores ranging from 37% to 56% with a mean of 50.25%, and disruptive behavior showed a variable trend, ranging from 20% to 40% with a mean of 32.5%. During Part 3 of the intervention, Zion’s performance on the probes showed an increasing trend, ranging from 60% to 81% with a mean of 74%, and disruptive behavior was variable, ranging from 20% to 30% with a mean of 20%. Maintenance data for Zion’s performance on the computer-assisted SDLMI probes remained at a high and stable level at 74% with a mean of 76%, and disruptive behavior remained low and within a socially acceptable range with a mean of 25.3%.</p>

<title>Social Validity</title>
<p>The classroom teacher felt computer-assisted SDLMI was “successful for both acquiring self-determination skills and helping students to self-set behavior goals.” In addition, the teacher indicated the computer-assisted SDLMI would be a beneficial supplement to instruction to help students attain self-determination skills but felt it may take additional time to manage along with regular instructional activities.</p>
<p>On a 4-point Likert scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 4 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>), students agreed or strongly agreed (<italic>M</italic> = 3.67) that the computer program helped them learn how to set goals and liked using the program. All students agreed the computer program was easy to use. All students strongly agreed the computer program taught them how to set goals, helped them focus on the goals needed to improve their behavior, and improved their behavior because goals were set.</p>
<p>Finally, the researcher collected social comparison data about the best-behaved students in the class. Disruptive behavior for the four best-behaved students ranged from 0% to 40% with a mean of 16% (see the shaded areas on the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022466910362261">Figure 2</xref>). All three students who received the SDLMI intervention maintained improved behavior that compared favorably to the best-behaved students in the class. Specifically, Qu’Viah’s disruptive behavior was maintained at socially acceptable levels beginning with computer-assisted SDLMI Session 3 in Part 1 and stayed within a socially acceptable range for the duration of the study, with the exception of computer-assisted SDLMI Session 7 (Part 2). Branford’s disruptive behavior was maintained at socially acceptable levels beginning with computer-assisted SDLMI Session 1 (Part 1) and stayed within a socially acceptable range for the duration of the study. Finally, Zion’s disruptive behavior was maintained at socially acceptable levels beginning with computer-assisted SDLMI Session 4 (Part 1) and stayed within a socially acceptable range for the duration of the study.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a computer-assisted SDLMI intervention on students’ knowledge of the SDLMI and disruptive behavior. Visual analysis of graphed data showed a functional relationship between SDLMI and increased knowledge of the SDLMI process and reduced disruptive behavior for all three students. As student knowledge of the SDLMI process increased, students’ disruptive behavior in the classroom decreased. In addition, students were able to maintain knowledge of the SDLMI while achieving low levels of disruptive behavior that remained in a socially acceptable range compared to the best-behaved students.</p>
<p>The current findings lend additional support to the literature in a number of ways. First, goal-setting theory suggests that when individuals set specific goals, they are more likely to work toward the goals, and performance improves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022466910362261">Schunk, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022466910362261">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022466910362261">Tollefson, Tracy, Johnsen, &amp; Chatman, 1986</xref>). The results of the current study demonstrated this pattern in that during Part 1, when students were just beginning to identify strengths and needs and self-set goals for decreasing their disruptive behavior, students’ disruptive behavior began to improve before they began to implement the self-management plan and data collection strategy developed in Parts 2 and 3. As a result, the findings are consistent with goal-setting theory and provide further evidence that goal setting is an effective strategy for reducing problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022466910362261">Agran et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022466910362261">Palmer &amp; Wehmeyer, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the results of this study provide additional support for CAI as an effective method for teaching secondary transition–related skills (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022466910362261">Mazzotti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022466910362261">Mechling &amp; Ortega-Hurndon, 2007</xref>). Results from the current study also suggest CAI may be an effective instructional tool for teaching students goal-setting skills to promote self-determination. Furthermore, elementary and middle school teachers have identified the importance of incorporating self-determination into general and special education classrooms, specifically identifying goal setting as an important component of self-determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022466910362261">Stang et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, the computer-assisted SDLMI may be an effective method for incorporating components of self-determination into the curriculum. In addition, the SDLMI has typically been taught using teacher-led instruction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022466910362261">Agran et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022466910362261">Agran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022466910362261">Fowler, 2008</xref>). Finally, this study extends the SDLMI literature by delivering the model through CAI.</p>
<sec id="section27-0022466910362261">
<title>Limitations and Implications for Future Research</title>
<p>Although the results of this study were positive, there were limitations to this study. First, data on students’ disruptive behavior were collected in only one general classroom setting during one class period. Therefore, the extent to which the intervention may have reduced problem behavior in other settings is unknown. Future research should be designed to promote and evaluate setting/situation generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022466910362261">Cooper et al., 2007</xref>) of students’ behavior in other classroom or school settings. Second, the small number of students limits generality to other student populations; however, results were promising, and researchers are encouraged to conduct systematic replications of this study to determine its effectiveness across other students and geographic locations. Third, this study used Microsoft Word<sup>©</sup> 2007 to record students’ responses to the intervention. The experimenter found this method time consuming and difficult for the students who had limited typing skills. Future research could use alternative ways to capture students’ responses. For example, Camtasia Studio<sup>©</sup> is a screen-recording software that could be effective in two ways, including (a) providing a method for recording student responses without requiring typed responses and (b) allowing procedural fidelity data to be collected through video and audio recording as students navigate through the computer program. ScreenFlow<sup>©</sup>, another type of screen-recording software, could also be used to capture student responses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0022466910362261">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Self-determination is valued by both general and special education teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022466910362261">Stang et al., 2009</xref>). However, due to other curriculum objectives, teachers might not have enough time for instruction on self-determination. This is particularly important because teachers have indicated they rarely teach self-determination skills to students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022466910362261">Stang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022466910362261">Wehmeyer et al., 2004</xref>). Computer-assisted SDLMI can provide teachers with an effective method for teaching one component of self-determination (i.e., goal setting) to students exhibiting problem behaviors. Furthermore, the CAI feature allowed students to work independently to learn the SDLMI process and could be implemented in general or special education classrooms. In conclusion, in the present study, computer-assisted SDLMI was an effective tool for promoting self-determination skills of students exhibiting problem behavior while reducing disruptive behavior in the classroom.</p>
