<p>Recognition of cultural changes in the US workforce has prompted many public sector organizations to take action to increase diversity and cultural awareness. Specific characteristics of diversity initiatives in local government organizations are not well documented. In this study, interviews were conducted with representatives from eleven local governments in the Willamette Valley region in Oregon. Through thematic analysis of the interview transcripts and other documents, this study catalogues types of diversity activities conducted by local governments and identifies key factors in the development and successful implementation of diversity initiatives.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recognition of demographic and cultural changes in communities and the workforce have prompted governmental organizations across the United States to adopt more inclusive approaches to diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160323X12439475">Riccucci 2002</xref>). Local governments are on the frontlines of this trend. There are nearly 90,000 local governments in the United States, employing more people and providing more direct services than other levels of government, and they are “the most likely point of contact between government and citizen” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160323X12439475">Newell 2004</xref>, 1). Many local governments have launched initiatives and programs to promote and manage diversity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X12439475">Hernández, Brown, and Tien 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160323X12439475">Dobbs 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160323X12439475">Reichenberg 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160323X12439475">Chambers and Riccucci 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>This study explores diversity development and management initiatives in local government by interviewing government officials involved in diversity efforts at eleven local governments in the Portland metropolitan area and Willamette Valley in the state of Oregon. The following questions guided the research: (1) What types of activities are conducted by local governments in their diversity development and management initiatives? (2) What factors affect the progress of local government diversity development and management initiatives? (3) What recommendations can be drawn for future diversity development and management initiatives? Interview results address these questions and provide a basis to discuss factors in undertaking a successful diversity development and management initiative.</p>

<title>Review of the Literature</title>
<sec id="section3-0160323X12439475">
<title>Diversity Research in Local Government</title>
<p>Local governments in the United States are beginning to acknowledge demographic changes and cultural diversity in the communities they serve. One leading textbook for local government managers states that local governments are endeavoring “to accommodate the needs of an increasingly diverse population” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160323X12439475">Newell 2004</xref>, 86). The International City/County Management Association (ICMA) lists as one of its eight core beliefs: “ensuring that local governments and the association reflect the diversity of the communities we serve” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160323X12439475">ICMA 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite this attention, few studies have been conducted to examine <italic>what</italic> local governments are doing to promote and manage diversity and <italic>how</italic> they are doing it. Most studies that examine public sector organizations focus on activities related to specific categories of individuals, such as race/ethnicity, sex, age, or disabilities. A few of these studies present the views of managers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160323X12439475">Bradbury and Kellough 2008</xref>) but do not highlight organizational perspective on the strategies for promoting and managing diversity. Many studies focus on state governments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160323X12439475">Charles 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0160323X12439475">Rangarajan and Black 2007</xref>) or the federal government (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160323X12439475">Dobbs 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160323X12439475">Kellough and Naff 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160323X12439475">Naff and Kellough 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160323X12439475">Soni 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160323X12439475">Pitts 2009</xref>). A few case studies have addressed local governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160323X12439475">Chambers and Riccucci 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160323X12439475">Dobbs 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160323X12439475">Reichenberg 2001</xref>). The present study contributes to this line of research by gathering and analyzing information on diversity-related activities from multiple local governments to identify common themes across the jurisdictions.</p>

<sec id="section4-0160323X12439475">
<title>Defining Diversity</title>
<p>Despite increasing use of the term “diversity” and the growth of diversity management in the workplace, there are various definitions of the concept. Narrow definitions typically reflect the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) law and define diversity in terms of race, gender, ethnicity, age, national origin, and disability (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0160323X12439475">Wheeler 1994</xref>). Other views expand the categories. In the broadest perspective, diversity refers to any attribute people use to recognize that another person is different (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X12439475">Page 2007</xref>). It is important to recognize how diversity is defined in a given organization, because it affects organizational goals and actions related to the concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160323X12439475">Harrison and Klein 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0160323X12439475">Winn and Taylor-Grover 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0160323X12439475">
<title>Motivations for Diversity Development and Management</title>
<p>Three motivations are frequently cited as reasons to support diversity in an organization: (1) demographic composition and change, (2) legal compliance, and (3) organizational effectiveness. One or more of these motivations may be emphasized in particular instances.</p>
<sec id="section6-0160323X12439475">
<title>Demographic composition and change</title>
<p>Many arguments for organizational diversity are based on demographic changes in the population (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160323X12439475">Rice 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160323X12439475">Pitts et al. 2010</xref>). Reports on the increasing diversification of racial and ethnic groups in the United States since the late 1980s are reflected in Oregon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160323X12439475">Johnston and Packer 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160323X12439475">Judy, D'Amico, and Geipel 1997</xref>). According to the US Census 1990 and 2000, the nine Willamette Valley counties represented by local governments in this study<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160323X12439475">1</xref></sup> contained nearly 70 percent of the Oregon population; in the ten-year period, the region’s population grew by 418,000 (21 percent) to 2.38 million people. Regarding the most prominent ethnic minorities, individuals of Hispanic origin increased 167 percent, from 4 percent to 8 percent of the population; individuals of Asian origin increased 64 percent, from 3 percent to 4 percent of the population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0160323X12439475">2</xref></sup> This notable surge in culturally diverse communities continued through the period of this study and was more pronounced in a few of the jurisdictions. For local governments, diversity in terms of culture and language poses challenges for public services, equal opportunity, and fair treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X12439475">Hernández, Brown, and Tien 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Some scholars emphasize the importance of demographic composition in relation to the principle of <italic>representative bureaucracy</italic>, which proposes that a bureaucracy should mirror the demographic composition of the general public (Pitts 2007b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160323X12439475">Kingsley 1944</xref>). The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 “endorsed the idea of representative bureaucracy, calling for a workforce reflective of the nation’s diversity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160323X12439475">Kellough 1992</xref>, 124).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0160323X12439475">3</xref></sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0160323X12439475">
<title>Legal compliance</title>
<p>A frequently mentioned reason for organizations to be concerned with diversity is the need to conform to various legal requirements and avoid costly discrimination lawsuits and settlements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160323X12439475">Embrick and Rice 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160323X12439475">Rice 2010</xref>). In the United States, under the general umbrella of EEO policy, several laws prohibit organizations from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability, including the Equal Pay Act of 1963; the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) and 1991; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967; the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978; and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160323X12439475">Commission United States Equal Employment Opportunity 2012</xref>). Original provisions of these acts have been extended to cover state and local government organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160323X12439475">Gutman 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0160323X12439475">
<title>Organizational effectiveness</title>
<p>Diversity may produce tangible benefits in an organization, notably by enhancing service delivery through better communication and understanding for the needs of a community (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X12439475">Hernández, Brown, and Tien 2007</xref>; Pitts 2007b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0160323X12439475">Strauss and Thompson 1992</xref>). Some scholars argue that a diverse workforce may also foster creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160323X12439475">Egan 2005</xref>) and contribute to better problem solving and decision-making capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160323X12439475">Phillips, Northcraft, and Neale 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160323X12439475">Page 2007</xref>). This proposition is based on observations that people working in a diverse organization are exposed to alternative points of view. The argument remains popular, though research results are equivocal: some studies show a positive impact and others show no effect or a negative impact (Pitts 2007a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0160323X12439475">Pelled 1996</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0160323X12439475">
<title>Diversity Development and Management Activities</title>
<p>Past research recognizes three major types of activity under diversity development and management initiatives: (1) activities to diversify demographic composition of the organization, (2) activities to better serve diverse clientele, and (3) activities to value and integrate a diverse workforce.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0160323X12439475">
<title>Activities to diversify demographic composition</title>
<p>Many organizations take steps to diversify the demographic background of employees by actively recruiting, hiring, and retaining members of traditionally underrepresented groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160323X12439475">Naff and Kellough 2003</xref>). Some of the approaches recommended by experts include advertising in minority-based newspapers and magazines, targeting recruitment for women and minority-group members, examining the interview process to eliminate bias, and developing support group (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160323X12439475">Fenn and Irvin 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160323X12439475">McKay and Davis 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0160323X12439475">
<title>Activities to better serve a diverse clientele</title>
<p>Some organizations take actions to improve services to a diverse community, such as hiring Spanish-speaking employees to improve communication with the Hispanic community (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X12439475">Hernández, Brown, and Tien 2007</xref>; Pitts 2007b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0160323X12439475">Strauss and Thompson 1992</xref>). Other approaches to improve services include establishing community programs and liaison officers, providing translation at council meetings, and disseminating information in multiple languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160323X12439475">Hernández, Brown, and Tien 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0160323X12439475">
<title>Activities to value and integrate a diverse workforce</title>
<p>Once an organization starts to increase demographic diversity, the benefits of diversity are enhanced by actively recognizing how culturally based skills, beliefs, and practices affect work behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X12439475">Cox 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0160323X12439475">Thomas and Ely 1996</xref>). Specific actions include developing a formal, accountable process that makes diversity an ongoing and measurable result in the organization, providing diversity training through all levels of the workforce, and providing mentors for minority employees (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160323X12439475">Naff and Kellough 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160323X12439475">Reichenberg 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0160323X12439475">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Face-to-face, semistructured interviews were conducted with key informants from five counties and six cities in the Willamette Valley region in Oregon, including the Portland metropolitan area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0160323X12439475">4</xref></sup> Prior to the interviews, counties and principal cities were selected within a convenient distance from Portland. Most of the sites appeared to have diversity management initiatives, according to information on their official Web sites. When the Web site clearly identified key personnel responsible for the diversity initiative, they were contacted directly with a request for an interview. Other interviewees were identified through contact with the human resources department.</p>
<p>In face-to-face meetings, interviewees were asked to discuss the accomplishments and challenges of their diversity plans and to provide recommendations for other local governments. A total of seventeen people were interviewed in eleven interview sessions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0160323X12439475">5</xref></sup> In addition to the interviews, Web sites and available documents (such as diversity plans) were reviewed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0160323X12439475">

<title>Activities in the Diversity Development and Management Initiatives</title>
<p>Interviewees identified a wide range of activities.

In addition, interviewees highlighted the significance of preparatory activities that took place prior to the launch of the diversity initiative, and ongoing collaborative activities with other organizations.

<title>Diversify the Organization</title>
<p>All interviewees identified recruiting and hiring employees with diverse demographic and cultural backgrounds as a core activity in the diversity development and management initiative, and emphasized that the process was not simple. They noted that doing the “regular” things—such as putting advertisements on multiple media, including minority-focused media, or attending job fairs—was not enough to hire good employees with diverse backgrounds. One interviewee concluded: “we can put an ad in this newspaper or that newspaper, but we never get a response from it ... We know we never get anyone there, but we’ll try.” Generally, interviewees said they need to be proactive in developing pools of applicants. Networking with community organizations was a common theme, combining recruitment for diverse employees and outreach strategies for more culturally competent services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0160323X12439475">
<title>Better Serve a Diverse Clientele</title>
<p>One of the goals of local government diversity development and management initiatives was to enhance the capacity to provide culturally competent services to a diverse client population. Language was the principal issue. A few interviewees shared examples of communities responding enthusiastically to services in their own language. The reason for having a local government that “looks like America,” another interviewee argued, is not just for representation, but to provide culturally competent services: “we want folks who understand disability issues; we want folks who are bilingual in Spanish, Russian or Korean.” Comments from the interviewees suggested that services to a diverse clientele could be improved by hiring employees with a particular cultural background and skill set; and also, by training employees with culture-specific information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0160323X12439475">
<title>Integrate and Value a Diverse Workforce</title>
<p>The interviewees in this study noted three key actions to integrate and value a diverse workforce. First, many, though not all, local governments established a formal diversity plan. Second, they developed an organizational structure to oversee the diversity development and management initiatives. Third, they provided diversity training to employees to develop awareness and skills for cultural competence. These three key actions are described below.</p>
<sec id="section19-0160323X12439475">
<title>Diversity plan</title>
<p>Nine of the eleven local governments in this study had a formal, organization-wide diversity plan. The plans delineated goals, objectives, action items, timelines, and the person or office responsible to take action. Common action items included community and employee needs assessments, policy review, training, affirmative action plans, community outreach, and employee performance evaluations. One diversity plan focused only on hiring and read more like an affirmative-action plan.</p>
<p>Two local governments in this study did not have a formal diversity plan. Absence of an explicit plan, however, did not preclude positive action for diversity development and management. In one instance, based on a general goal-setting session at a city council meeting, the city manager created a position for a bilingual community relations officer and established incentives for employees with bilingual language skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0160323X12439475">
<title>Develop an organizational structure</title>
<p>Most local governments in this study created an organizational structure for diversity work, starting with appointing a diversity office or a diversity manager, usually affiliated with the human resources department, or the office of the city manager or county administrator. Many diversity initiatives involved a committee with decision-making authority—typically called a diversity action council, committee, or task force—including members from across the organization.</p>
<p>Many interviewees noted that the diversity committee was more influential when leaders in the organization, such as commissioners or department heads, were among the active members. They also observed that the effectiveness of the committee depended on the degree of authority delegated to it, and the degree of commitment to the work by the people on the committee. Interviewees described the importance of leadership, involvement, and commitment, and suggested that simply creating the organizational structure alone would not develop organizational culture that promotes diversity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0160323X12439475">
<title>Diversity training</title>
<p>All interviewees recognized the importance of having members of the organization understand the importance of diversity. Most of the local governments in this study provided training opportunities to employees that focused on diversity and cultural competence. Typically, the training for new hires was mandatory. Other employees received diversity training as part of management training or in the context of antiharassment rule compliance.</p>
<p>Many of the diversity training curricula were developed by external consultants. Some relied on external trainers to deliver the training. Others emphasized the importance of using internal trainers to develop a sense of ownership.</p>
<p>Many interviewees emphasized the importance of making the training focus on communication and supervisory skills. One interviewee emphasized that diversity training should not be used as a forum for blame, saying: “There’s no white-man bashing. None of that stuff. And to me, why bash?

<p>Other interviewees pointed out the importance of flexibility in the direction of training, so it can address specific needs and issues of different departments. Interviewees emphasized the importance of paying attention to <italic>how </italic>the training should be offered. The presentation needs to be tailored to fit different groups of employees, even within one organization. Flexibility in style appeared to be an important factor in producing a significant impact on participants.</p>

<sec id="section22-0160323X12439475">
<title>Preparatory Activities</title>
<p>Some interviewees noted that their organizations conducted a needs assessment with the community and/or employees prior to launching the diversity initiative. Community needs assessments were typically conducted by hiring an outside consultant. Overall, interviewees emphasized the importance of initiating diversity-related activities based on a good grasp of community and employee needs.</p>

<sec id="section23-0160323X12439475">
<title>Collaborative Activities</title>
<p>The local governments in this study often expanded their efforts to promote diversity development and management beyond their single organization. Three partnership resources were mentioned repeatedly: <italic>Community Alliance for Diversity</italic>, <italic>Partners in Diversity</italic> and <italic>City/County Diversity Conference</italic>. Interviewees emphasized the usefulness of these community and regional networking opportunities to share information, support each others’ work, and gain new ideas. The <italic>Community Alliance for Diversity</italic> and <italic>Partners in Diversity</italic> are both regional networks of local governments, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and schools that collaboratively promote efforts to recognize, appreciate, and celebrate diversity. The members cohost and sponsor diversity-related community events, forums, and study circles, and provide diversity resources to the members. <italic>Partners in Diversity</italic>, for example, supports projects to foster diverse civic leaders and provides a model for an effective diversity plan developed by <italic>the Portland Workplace Diversity Taskforce</italic>. <italic>The City/County Diversity Conference</italic> is an annual one-day conference, operating for more than fifteen years, which draws some 800 public employees from the City of Portland, and Multnomah and Clackamas counties (City/County Diversity Conference, 2008).</p>

<title>Factors in Developing Diversity Initiatives</title>
<p>Interviewees noted a variety of factors that affected the development and implementation of diversity initiatives. Three factors were emphasized: (a) community climate, (b) organizational culture, and (c) the role of leadership.

<sec id="section25-0160323X12439475">
<title>Community Climate</title>
<p>Interviewees in this study acknowledged that increasing diversity in the community was one of the drivers for their organization to start a diversity development and management initiative. One interviewee calculated the community population of 22,000 was now 50 percent Hispanic and 68 percent Hispanic in school enrollment. This development produced new challenges in the provision of services. Diversifying the workforce was viewed as an appropriate response to achieve better service.</p>
<p>The necessity to develop a diversity plan and initiate diversity development and management effort was most often triggered by expressions of frustration from the community—especially from communities of color—complaining that the local government was not addressing its needs. One interviewee observed: “The city got involved [in diversity], because there was an expression of outrage on the part of African, Hispanic, Asian communities that the city was not responsive.” In this city, the community members filed a complaint to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the threat of losing funding accelerated the city’s diversity management plan.</p>
<p>Identifying an appropriate plan was not always straightforward, because of conflicting community demands. At one jurisdiction, for example, requests for bilingual services were contradicted by other community groups that thought such services were a waste of tax money.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0160323X12439475">
<title>Organizational Culture</title>
<p>Many local governments faced resistance against diversity development and management initiatives from their own employees. There was an organizational culture that resisted change. The interviewees who were the agents responsible for their organizations’ diversity development and management initiatives, faced resistance in a variety of ways, including personal attacks. One interviewee recalled being labeled a “troublemaker.” Another interviewee said he was labeled as an “oversensitive diversity person.” Even without direct opposition, interviewees often faced passive and apathetic attitudes toward diversity. Resistance was especially strong in organizations where many of the employees had long tenure. One interviewee observed: “We’re going from a small-town atmosphere to a larger more diverse culture. It’s hard for long-time employees.”</p>
<p>Some interviewees referred to nepotistic hiring practices as a barrier to diversifying the workforce. One interviewee explained that the official hiring system does not endorse overt nepotism, but informal information sharing and organizational culture supported those who were already in the system, which worked against the organization’s intention to be more open to a diverse workforce. One interviewee described the system, saying: “That’s what we call the FBI system of hiring—friends, brothers and in-laws.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0160323X12439475">
<title>Leadership</title>
<p>Most of the interviewees emphasized that without strong support and genuine commitment from people in leadership positions, it would have been difficult to develop and implement the diversity initiative. Typically, leadership came from the mayor, city manager, county commissioners, city council members, and department heads. One interviewee said: “If it doesn’t come from the top or supported from the top, it doesn’t happen.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0160323X12439475">
<title>Recommendations for a Successful Diversity Initiative</title>
<p>Four key recommendations were identified by interviewees: (1) clearly articulate the concept of diversity and differentiate it from affirmative action, (2) institutionalize the diversity development work, (3) develop commitment by the leadership, and (4) develop an effective diversity champion. These issues are presented below and summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0160323X12439475">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Articulate Diversity</title>
<p>Interviewees noted the importance of having a clear definition of diversity that differentiates it from affirmative action and EEO compliance. They recommended that the definition of diversity should be broader than the categories stipulated in EEO laws, and the focus of the diversity initiative should be on developing an inclusive, multicultural workplace, where everybody’s diverse background is valued and respected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-0160323X12439475">
<title>Institutionalize Diversity Work</title>
<p>Interviewees indicated the importance of institutionalizing diversity development and management work. Developing a written plan was a common step. Another key step involved developing an organizational structure to oversee diversity development and management. Many of the interviewees emphasized, however, that confining diversity activities and advocacy to one person or an office weakens a sense of ownership among employees and could result in a slow, frustrating, and unproductive process. One interviewee noted: “Get your employees involved. Your employees are the best spokespersons for diversity.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-0160323X12439475">
<title>Leadership Commitment and Diversity Champions</title>
<p>As indicated earlier, many stories attributed the successful beginning of an organization’s diversity development and management initiative to an explicit statement of support or demand for action from a formal leader in the organization. Interviewees also indicated the importance of having a diversity champion in making a diversity initiative an operable part of the organization. Almost all the individuals interviewed in this study were the diversity champion: the ones who ensured the diversity plan was developed, printed, and disseminated; went around the departments to talk about minority hiring; and found diversity trainers and arranged training sessions. In describing these activities, interviewees emphasized the importance of finding the right style to gain support from others, suitable for the organization, unit, or jurisdiction. No one style is right for all settings, and an inappropriate style can breed resistance.</p>
<p>Effective champions appeared to settle on a style following a period of trial and error. Some developed allies on a one-to-one basis. One diversity manager stated: “There is no, ‘This is the best method’ … You have to be highly sensitized and individualize things, at least in an organization like this where we have multiple cultures going on.” Others took a more forceful, no-nonsense approach, saying things like “Put the foot down” or “Do the right thing regardless of whatever opposition you may receive.” Though different, interviewees agreed that the fit of the approach affects how the diversity initiative is implemented.</p>

<sec id="section32-0160323X12439475">
<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>This study contributes to the knowledge and literature on diversity in the public sector by focusing on the views of local government managers on the forefront of diversity development and management. Results from the interviews provide a snapshot of activities and important factors in the development of diversity initiatives, and recommendations for other organizations.</p>
<p>Participants in this study recognized demographic change as a primary motivation for a diversity development and management initiative and acknowledged the importance of diversifying the employees in their organizations to effectively serve diverse members of the community. This point of view supports the argument that diversity and cultural competence are important factors in improving public service delivery (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160323X12439475">Rice 2007</xref>). It contrasts with a traditional approach that values neutrality and treating all community members in the same manner and ignoring cultural variations. Interviewees emphasized the importance of being mindful of the diverse opinions and needs of community members. This position corresponds to a current idea of “new public service” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160323X12439475">Denhardt and Denhardt 2007</xref>), in which government is expected to broker interests among diverse groups of citizens and create shared values.</p>
<p>The diversity development and management initiative was also viewed as an opportunity to change organizational culture and create an inclusive workplace. These aspects of the diversity management plan were purposely broader than EEO/affirmative-action compliance. A commitment from leaders was found to be a critical factor for success. The common focus among interviewees on culture change and leadership reflects a line of scholarly argument that advocates moving away from legal compliance toward a concept of diversity as a management strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0160323X12439475">Thomas and Ely 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160323X12439475">Cox 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160323X12439475">Slack 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Possible future studies might expand the number of jurisdictions to assess regional differences. Another question could address the comparative effectiveness of different diversity practices in successfully promoting specific objectives. A subsequent study, similar to this one over the same jurisdictions, could provide useful information on the sustainability of diversity initiatives over time in traditional government bureaucracies.</p>
