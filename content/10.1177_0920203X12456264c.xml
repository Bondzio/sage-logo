<p>Michael Keane’s most recent study on ‘creative clusters’ in China follows more than half a decade of research. It grounds an important scholarly interest for the adaptation of creative industries in China. Creative industries were first developed in the UK during the late 1990s as part of New Labour’s strategy to win the support of conservative voters. As Keane states, ‘the creative industries were a product of the times’ (p. 20). During the first decade of the 21st century, creative industries became an important export product, including through the work of the British Council and the Creative Industries Unit (launched in 2001) and following John Howkins’s publication of his best-selling book <italic>The Creative Economy: How People Make Money from Ideas</italic> (London: Penguin Group, 2001).</p>
<p>Keane’s analysis provides a welcome dose of critical assessment in examining the adaptation of the creative industries model in China. Of particular interest is the effect of what can best be seen as the <italic>agencies</italic> of creative industries – beyond the ‘idea’ or ‘discourse of creativity’ (following Keane) – in bringing ‘social change’ to China (p. 34). Keane examines the development of ‘creative clusters’ on the rationale of a ‘clustering strategy’ in spawning strategies for innovation, economic growth, and cultural reform in China (although the last item is not explicitly mentioned by Keane). Keane’s analysis is foremost focused on an ‘economic rationale’ and on the potential for these creative clusters to generate new ‘economies in innovation’. The socio-political conditions of these ‘clusters’ to ‘act as a conduit for new ideas and knowledge’ remain largely an area for further examination.</p>
<p>Keane’s study centres on specific case studies in Foshan, Guangdong Province; the city of Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province; and on Beijing and Shanghai. The case studies on Beijing and Shanghai show the continuous rivalry between these two important urban centres in China. Chapters 3 to 7 present case studies that focus on the ‘relative success’ of creative clusters in Foshan and in Hangzhou (Chapter 3); the repositioning of Beijing as a ‘creative city’ after 2005 (Chapter 4); the development of ‘art clusters’ in Beijing (798 Art Zone, Songzhuang, and Caochangdi) and by comparison with Dafen Art Village in Shenzhen, on the border with Hong Kong SAR (Chapter 5); and the visible prominence of ‘creative clusters’ in Shanghai (in Chapter 6).</p>
<p>Chapter 7 continues its focus on Shanghai and on the adjacent city of Suzhou (the ‘Garden City’), and it examines the position of ‘media clusters’, which, as Keane points out, links to the prominence of these media clusters in other parts of the world. It is somewhat surprising that Keane does not mention the example of India, nor of the Middle East; despite the continuous global presence of the Indian media and technology industry, and the more recent prominence of the Qatar-based global media network Al Jazeera, as well as the anticipated Sadiyaat Cultural District in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Further research in China, meanwhile, could draw specific attention to the important economic and cultural centres of Chengdu and Chongqing in Sichuan Province. In particular, Chengdu is the site of the Jianchuan Museum Cluster (founded by the real estate magnate and collector Fan Jianchuan), and Chongqing is gaining momentum as a future hub in Asia – in 2011 it was announced that Chongqing would build a special international cloud-computing zone.</p>
<p>Five years on, research on creative industries in China could do well with expanding analysis across regions and in a global context. Keane mentions Taiwan, Hong Kong SAR, Japan, and Korea, and twice points at how the ‘Korean wave … alerted Chinese media players and policy makers that their most valuable markets were in Asia, not the West’ (pp. 32 and 142). Yet, China’s strategic position is not clear.</p>
<p>A more detailed examination of the socio-political context that fosters the growth of ‘creative industries’ in China would provide particular value to the analysis. Here Keane’s study makes references to China’s recent calls for a ‘harmonious society’ (…), which can be connected to important research on this guiding principle. Hu Jintao first raised the concept of a ‘harmonious society/harmonious world’ during the Asia–Africa Summit in Jakarta on 22 September 2005, on the 50th Anniversary of the Asia–Africa Conference (also known as the 1955 Bandung Conference). Hu then expanded the notion during the World Summit of the 60th General Assembly of the United Nations in New York on 17 September 2005. It became best visualized in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and also sparked some controversies.</p>
<p>Moving the study of the ‘creative industries’ in China beyond the context of ‘economic rationale’ and into the examination of unstable conditions for social change in China also involves drawing attention to the antagonistic role of experimental art and new cultural production in China. Overall, Keane’s latest book on ‘creative clusters’ raises important questions, and these questions alone make this a valuable and durable study for researchers and professionals working on China.</p>
