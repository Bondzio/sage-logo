<abstract>
<p>The concept of job satisfaction has gained much importance in modern times. Job satisfaction is determined by factors such as goal-setting, job design, demographic profile, rewards, leadership and individual differences. In the present study the effect of demographic variables, namely experience and educational level on job satisfaction of telecom executives was studied. Differences in job satisfaction across experience and educational level were studied on 320 executives working in telecommunication organizations located in North India, using job satisfaction scale developed by Spector (1985). The study revealed that there were significant differences between job satisfaction and its dimensions with regard to experience while there were no significant differences between job satisfaction and its dimensions with regard to educational level. The study implies that as the experience increases, job satisfaction also increases while educational level has no effect on job satisfaction of executives.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Job satisfaction is one of the top issues for management and organization researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0258042X13484835">Locke and Latham, 2000</xref>). This is an attitude which shows the level of being happy or unhappy with the workplace, work and organization. That is, satisfied workers have positive perceptions and attitudes towards their organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0258042X13484835">Dessler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0258042X13484835">Rocca and Konstanski, 2001</xref>). Research shows that happy employees are productive while unhappy ones are not; therefore, success of the organization depends on the satisfaction of their workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0258042X13484835">Lise and Judge, 2004</xref>). Organizations want their employees to be satisfied to become productive, efficient and committed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0258042X13484835">Shah and Jalees, 2004</xref>). Job satisfaction can also be viewed as the degree of an employee’s affective orientation toward the work role occupied in the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0258042X13484835">Tsigilis, Zachopoulou and Grammatikopoulos, 2006</xref>). Therefore, job satisfaction is a very important attribute that is frequently measured by all types of organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0258042X13484835">Wikipedia, 2009</xref>). Researchers have unearthed a set of factors or variables, which stand responsible for the overall satisfaction of employees in any organization, for example, pay, work, supervision, promotion, work environment and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0258042X13484835">DeVane and Sandy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0258042X13484835">Ellickson and Logsdon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0258042X13484835">Lise and Judge, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0258042X13484835">Stacey, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0258042X13484835">Williams and Sandler, 1995</xref>). Other investigators have used different terminologies to express factors for job satisfaction, such as personal and organizational factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0258042X13484835">Saiyadain, 1998</xref>), personal and job characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0258042X13484835">Sokoya, 2000</xref>), mentally challenging work, equitable rewards, supportive working conditions, supportive colleagues, good personality and supportive workers (Naval and Srivastava, 2002), and ‘demographic relationships’ between satisfaction and faculty members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0258042X13484835">Shah and Jalees, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0258042X13484835">Tsigilis et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the effect of demographic variables namely experience and educational level on job satisfaction of telecom executives.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<sec id="section3-0258042X13484835">
<title>Job Satisfaction and Experience</title>
<p>Experience or tenure refers to the length of time for which the individual has worked for the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0258042X13484835">Lim et al., 1998</xref>). Research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0258042X13484835">Jinnett and Alexander, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0258042X13484835">Jones Johnson and Johnson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0258042X13484835">Staw, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0258042X13484835">Vecchio, 1988</xref>) indicates that employees with longer tenure have a greater propensity to be satisfied with their jobs than employees with shorter tenure.</p>
<p>Moreover, a study by Chambers (1999) established that employees with longer tenure were more satisfied with their work itself as well as their level of pay. From this it might be concluded that satisfaction increases with time and that those benefits that increase in time, such as security and experience, are likely to have an important influence on employee satisfaction.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Lambert et al. (2001) argue that an inverse relationship exists between tenure and job satisfaction. The reason the literature is both inconsistent and inconclusive in this regard may be because the relationship between these variables depends on the specific organization and how tenure is viewed. In some organizations, senior employees are highly respected, while high tenure is viewed as a liability in other organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0258042X13484835">Lambert et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0258042X13484835">
<title>Job Satisfaction and Educational Level</title>
<p>Research is unequivocal with respect to the relationship between job satisfaction and educational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0258042X13484835">Camp, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0258042X13484835">Loscocco, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0258042X13484835">Ting, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Some proponents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0258042X13484835">Larwood, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0258042X13484835">Saal and Knight, 1988</xref>) maintain that the relationship between education and job satisfaction is positive in nature. For example, Quinn and Mandilovitch (1975) and Glenn and Weaver (1982) reveal a positive relationship between job satisfaction and education.</p>
<p>However, Campbell, Converse and Rodgers (1976) found an inverse relationship between job satisfaction and education. Ting (1997) states that the higher an individual’s qualifications, the higher that individual’s job level and, consequently, so too the employee’s degree of satisfaction. Conversely, Clark and Oswald (1996) found a negative relationship between educational levels and job satisfaction.</p>
<p>Gazioglu and Tansel (2002) observed that those with degrees, including postgraduates, had lower levels of job satisfaction compared to individuals with lower levels of education. Clark and Oswald (1996) argued that due to expectation differentials between different levels of education, the relationship between education and job satisfaction is unclear.</p>
<p>Conversely, Lambert et al. (2001) found education to have no significant effect on job satisfaction. Research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0258042X13484835">Ting, 1997</xref>) indicates that education has no effect on the satisfaction of federal government employees. Similarly, Rogers (1991) did not support a link between the satisfaction and educational level of correctional service employees.</p>
<p>Recent studies suggest, however, that educational level is positively related to job satisfaction, subject to a successful match being made between the individual’s work and qualifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0258042X13484835">Battu, Belfield and Sloane, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0258042X13484835">Jones Johnson and Johnson, 2000</xref>). This implies, therefore, that better educated employees are only likely to experience higher levels of job satisfaction when the duties performed by them are in line with their level of education.</p>

<sec id="section7-0258042X13484835">
<title>Sample and Data Collection</title>
<p>Data was collected by going to the various telecommunication organizations and all the selected managers were apprised of the nature and purpose of the research work. The participation and willingness to cooperate was sought for before administering them the questionnaire. They were assured that the results and the information obtained would be kept strictly confidential and used for research purpose only. A simple random sampling was used to draw the sample. In this sampling, each individual is chosen randomly and entirely by chance, such that each individual has the same probability of being chosen at any stage during the sampling process. A total of 459 persons were asked to fill the questionnaire, out of which 320 respondents returned the completed questionnaires. The response rate was 69.7 per cent.</p>
<p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0258042X13484835">Table 1</xref>, the executives were classified under three subgroups according to their years of experience, viz. less than 5 years, 5–10 years and more than 10 years. It can be viewed that the majority of managers (67 per cent) have more than 10 years of experience followed by 27 per cent of the managers having less than five years of experience and only 6 per cent of managers having an experience of 5–10 years. According to educational level of the sample, executives were classified into three categories, viz. graduate, postgraduate, and M.phil/Ph.D. The table depicts that the majority of managers (57 per cent) were graduates, 39 per cent were postgraduates and 4 per cent of the managers had M.Phil/Ph.D qualification.</p>

<title>Measure of Job Satisfaction</title>
<p>For the purpose of measuring job satisfaction, the scale developed by Spector (1985) was used. It was designed to assess employee attitudes about the job and aspects of the job. It consists of 36 items which describe nine job facets (four items per facet). The job facets include Pay Satisfaction (PS), Promotion Satisfaction (PRS), Supervision Satisfaction (SS), Benefit Satisfaction (BS), Reward Satisfaction (RS), Operating Procedure Satisfaction (OPS), Co-worker Satisfaction (CWS), Work itself Satisfaction (WS), and Communication Satisfaction (CS). The items were scored on a six-point scale according to the following response categories: (<italic>i</italic>) disagree very much (<italic>ii</italic>) disagree moderately (<italic>iii</italic>) disagree slightly (<italic>iv</italic>) agree slightly (<italic>v</italic>) agree moderately (<italic>vi</italic>) agree very much.</p>

<title>Differences in Job Satisfaction of Executives with Regard to their Experience</title>
<p><italic>H1) Whether there is a significant difference between job satisfaction of executives and their experience.</italic></p>
<p>The degree of job satisfaction at workplace was gauged through the experience of the executives in their respective organizations. Job satisfaction is usually supposed to increase as the years of service in a particular job increase.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0258042X13484835">Table 2</xref> shows the mean score and standard deviation for different categories of years of experience, viz. less than 5 years, 5–10 years and more than 10 years as 145.55 (S.D = 19.48), 150.63 (S.D = 22.74) and 153.04 (S.D = 19.36) respectively. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) result revealed that the p-value was 0.012 which is less than the assumed value of 0.01 level. Thus, the increase in mean scores and significant p-value showed that job satisfaction of the executives improved with their work experience.</p>

<p>It was further found that executives who had more than 10 years of experience were more satisfied with pay and operating procedure as compared to their counterparts. While on the other hand, the executives who had experience between 5 and 10 years were more satisfied with supervision and reward as compared to their counterparts. Hence, the hypothesis is accepted as majority of the dimensions of job satisfaction show significant differences with regard to experience of the executives.</p>
<p>While there were no significant differences in the dimensions of job satisfaction, viz.

<p>The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also calculated to find out the differences in job satisfaction and educational level of the executives under study. It was found that the p-value was 0.110 which is greater than the assumed value of 0.05 level. Thus, it can be concluded that the difference between job satisfaction and educational level is not significant. This implies that the educational level does not really matter much in determining the job satisfaction of the executives. Hence, the hypothesis is rejected.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Major objective of the present research was to identify the differences in job satisfaction and its dimensions with regard to experience and educational level. The results revealed that there was significant difference in job satisfaction of executives with regard to experience; hence hypothesis is accepted. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was computed to examine the differences in dimensions of job satisfaction and experience. It revealed that dimensions of job satisfaction, namely pay satisfaction, reward satisfaction, operating procedure satisfaction (significant as p &lt; 0.01) and supervision satisfaction (significant as p &lt; 0.05) differed significantly amongst subgroups based on experience. Therefore, hypothesis is accepted. It showed that job satisfaction increases with experience. The results of this study were consistent with Jinnett and Alexander (1999), Jones Johnson and Johnson (2000), Staw (1995), Vecchio (1988) and Chambers (1999), which indicates that employees with longer tenure have a greater propensity to be satisfied with their jobs than employees with shorter tenure.</p>
<p>On the other hand, using analysis of variance (ANOVA), it was found that there were no significant differences between job satisfaction and its dimensions with regard to educational level. Hence, the hypothesis is rejected. The results of this study correspond with that carried out by Campbell et al. (1976), Gruneberg (1980) and Clark and Oswald (1996) which found that there is negative relationship between job satisfaction and educational levels.</p>
