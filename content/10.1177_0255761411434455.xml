<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of flow experiences among high school music students attending a two-week summer instrumental music camp. Specifically, the study sought to determine if: (1) students do indeed experience flow in summer camp settings; (2) what activities are conducive to flow; (3) what is the relationship between academic and social contexts in inducing high-level flow experiences; and (4) what is the relationship between attention and enjoyment among these experiences. A researcher-designed questionnaire was used to solicit information regarding the aforementioned factors. Results suggested that students experienced flow during a large range of activities, but that musical/academic activities were more conducive to flow than social activities. Additionally, moderate to strong levels of association were found between the variables of attention and enjoyment among the highest-ranked flow-inducing activities. Suggestions for further research as well as implications for music educators are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Summer music camps have been an established facet of American music education since the early part of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411434455">Paul, 2010</xref>). Although specific research regarding music camps is limited, studies suggest that students attend camps for a number of reasons, including: (1) camp specialization; (2) affiliation; (3) availability of financial aid; (4) location; (5) residency characteristics (day or overnight); (6) student population characteristics; and (7) type of activities offered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0255761411434455">Bialeschki &amp; Malinowski, 2007</xref>). Findings also indicate that, in general, students attribute musical growth over social experiences as the primary impetus for attending camps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0255761411434455">Kelly &amp; Juchniewicz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0255761411434455">Paul, 2010</xref>). If musical growth is indeed a key rationale for camp attendance, then it would appear important for camp administrators to gather information on the specific types of musical opportunities which might best serve these needs. Currently no research is available which examines this factor. In the present study, the value of these experiences will be examined through the construct of flow, a state in which individuals report enhanced levels of effortless concentration and enjoyment as a product of intense engagement on a given task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761411434455">Csikszentmihalyi, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761411434455">Csikszentmihalyi (1990</xref>, p. 4) describes flow as a ‘state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter, the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost for the sheer sake of doing it.’ Flow is said to occur when an individual perceives their skills as ‘in balance’ with the demands of an activity, and when the activity provides clear goals and immediate feedback regarding progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761411434455">Nakamura &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2002</xref>). When individuals perceive that they are in flow, they experience feelings of seamless absorption. These perceptions are also usually accompanied by one or several of the following experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0255761411434455">Nakamura &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2002</xref>, p. 90):</p>

</list>
<p>In educational research flow has been explored as a means of predicting student interest, teacher effectiveness, and other variables related to creating optimal conditions for learning. Using the framework of challenge and skills, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0255761411434455">Moneta and Csikszentmihalyi (1996)</xref> found that a balance between these factors was the best predictor of student involvement and concentration among talented high school students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0255761411434455">Nakamura (1988)</xref> found that low-achieving students reported higher levels of anxiety and lower levels of flow compared to high-achieving students. Additional findings suggest that students who come from a supportive yet challenging home environment experience more flow in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0255761411434455">Rathunde, 1996</xref>). From an instructional perspective, teachers who were identified as effective spent more time in flow than those in a control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761411434455">Gunderson, 2003</xref>), and students who had teachers who structured classes around student involvement experienced more flow than they did with other instructional approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761411434455">Coleman, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761411434455">Csikszentmihalyi (1990)</xref> identifies music as a universal, flow-inducing stimulus. Among music researchers several qualitative studies have investigated how flow manifests among individuals engaged in musical activities. One of the theoretical pre-requisites of the experience, a perceived balance between skills and challenges, was found to be related to the occurrence of flow states during improvisational activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0255761411434455">Matthews, 2003</xref>) and in musical activities among young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0255761411434455">Custodero, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0255761411434455">Sutton (2004)</xref> observed that opportunities for collaborative work among artist-level chamber ensemble musicians were highly conducive to flow, with similar results found for members of collegiate marching bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411434455">Steckel, 2001</xref>). In collegiate wind ensemble settings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411434455">Kraus (2003)</xref> found that flow was more prevalent among older versus younger students and that it was more likely to occur during the latter part of rehearsals rather than the beginning.</p>
<p>Existing literature provides a great deal of evidence that musical activities present an optimal context for inducing flow, especially when activities are structured to provide continuous feedback, and when individuals feel that activities are neither too difficult nor easy in relationship to their skills. However, unlike previously-investigated settings, summer music camps also provide an environment in which structured and unstructured social activities are a primary facet of the overall experience. Previous studies have not examined how academic and social musical contexts may compare in their propensity to induce flow, nor considered how high school-aged populations might differ from other populations in relationship to these variables.</p>
<p>In addition to investigating how different types of activities might influence the occurrence of flow, it might be helpful to examine the relationship between the attributes of attentiveness and enjoyment as they relate to the experience. Although engagement throughout a number of activities might demand a great deal of focused attention, these activities might not necessarily be conducive to inducing positive affective states. Thus, in the present study, these issues were explored within the context of the following questions:</p>

<list-item><p>Do high school music students experience flow during summer camp activities, and, if so, what types of activities are conducive to these experiences?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Among students experiencing flow, what activities are most likely to lead to the experience?</p></list-item>

<title>Participant and camp characteristics</title>
<p>A convenience sample of high school students (<italic>N</italic> = 87, grades 9–12) attending a two-week-long summer instrumental music camp at a large southeastern university participated in the study. Participants included string, wind, and percussion players. The camp provided opportunities for students to engage in a number of activities, including large ensemble opportunities, music theory, electives, private lessons, master classes, attending and performing concerts, and social activities. String students were the only segment of the population that was not provided with an opportunity to select electives. General admittance to the camp was based on filling a preset number of available spaces, with participants selected on a ‘first-come, first-served’ basis. When arriving at the camp, students were asked to audition as well as take a diagnostic theory and aural skill exam to determine placement among several levels of music theory and ensemble opportunities. Each student was required to perform in either a large or chamber ensemble, attend master classes and music theory, and attend concerts and social events. Private lessons were considered optional.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0255761411434455">
<title>Data collection and questionnaire</title>
<p>One hundred and fifty copies of a researcher-designed questionnaire were distributed to five summer camp instructors (each received 30 copies). Each instructor was asked to solicit participants for the study from among their classes. The classes represented one theory class, a conducting class, two group instruction classes (master classes), and a large ensemble class (orchestra). The questionnaire was administered on the last full day of camp, a day before students performed on their final concert. Students in wind ensembles had already performed one concert the week before, but string students had not yet performed a full concert. A total of 87 surveys were returned.</p>
<p>The questionnaire was developed (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0255761411434455">Appendix 1</xref>) to ascertain if participants had experienced flow throughout their summer camp experience. Additionally, the questionnaire was used to gather information on what, if any, activities may have induced flow, what activities among these where the most conducive to the experience, and what participants’ level of attention and enjoyment were among their top activities.</p>
<p>Since previous studies have indicated that the term ‘flow’ is unfamiliar to many music students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411434455">Diaz, 2011</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761411434455">Csikszentmihalyi’s (1990)</xref> description of the experience was used as a means of ascertaining whether students had experienced flow throughout the summer camp (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0255761411434455">Appendix 1</xref>). The questionnaire prompted participants who had affirmed experiencing flow to survey a randomized list of social and academic activities available at the summer camp, and select any which they had been involved in when they had experienced flow. The list was created based on activities as published in the camp’s brochure, as well as in consultation with a camp administrator. To assure that all possible activities had a chance of being represented, students could also provide any unlisted experience(s) under the ‘other’ category on the questionnaire. After selecting general activities, participants were then prompted to select their top three activities, and using a 10-point Likert-type scale (1 = very low; 10 = very high), indicate both their level of attention as well as enjoyment for each activity.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section4-0255761411434455" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>All participants (<italic>N</italic> = 87) indicated that they had experienced at least one instance during the camp when they were ‘so absorbed or focused on an activity that nothing else seemed to matter.’ Furthermore, every activity on the list was selected at least once, and four additional activities were added under the heading of ‘other’ on the questionnaire. The four additional activities included ‘sleeping,’ (selected by two participants) ‘thinking,’ and ‘not thinking.’ Classification of all selected activities into either social or academic categories was determined independently by each investigator then checked for reliability. Analysis of agreements/agreements + disagreements of activity classifications yielded 100% agreement between the two researchers. Overall, the results suggested that a large variety of both academic and social activities were considered sufficient for inducing flow.</p>
<p>In response to question two, the number of times each of the listed activities was selected was tallied and ranked by frequency from highest to lowest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0255761411434455">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0255761411434455">Figure 1</xref>). The three activities receiving the most votes were large ensemble rehearsals (<italic>n</italic> = 64), ‘hanging out’ with friends (<italic>n</italic> = 51), and electives (<italic>n</italic> = 44). The three lowest selected activities were watching TV (<italic>n</italic> = 4), using a computer (<italic>n</italic> = 4), and other (<italic>n</italic> = 4). These values indicated that 73% of students experienced flow while rehearsing in large ensemble rehearsals and at least 50% experienced it while hanging out with friends or when engaged in an elective. Only 4%, however, experienced flow while watching TV or using a computer. It should be noted that the camp did not prohibit the use of mobile internet devices and that television sets were available during leisure time. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that students had sufficient opportunity to engage in these activities if so desired.</p>

<p>For question three, respondents chose the top three activities from their selected list and indicated a score from 1–10 for each top-rated activity describing their level of attention and enjoyment respectively. The number of times an activity was listed among the top three was tallied and ranked by frequency from highest to lowest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0255761411434455">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0255761411434455">Figure 2</xref>). The three highest-ranked activities were large ensemble rehearsals (<italic>n</italic> = 55), electives (<italic>n</italic> = 44), and music theory (<italic>n</italic> = 26). Overall, 63% of students selected large ensemble rehearsals as one of their top three flow inducing activities. By comparison, electives were placed in the top three by 45% of students and theory by only 29%. Hanging out with counselors and eating meals were selected as top three activities by only 4% and 3% of students respectively.</p>

<p>In order to further examine differences between all selected activities, frequency data was collapsed into either an academic, social, or other category. Of the 477 total selections in response to question two, 60% (<italic>n</italic> = 290) of activities were of an academic nature, 39% (<italic>n</italic> = 183) were social, and less than 1% (<italic>n</italic> = 4) were in the category of ‘other.’ In respect to the top three activities (question three), academic activities represented 81% (<italic>n</italic> = 188) of the selections while social activities represented 18% (<italic>n</italic> = 41). The most selected activities in the academic category were large rehearsals (<italic>n</italic> = 64), electives (<italic>n</italic> = 44), and live concerts (<italic>n</italic> = 35). The least selected were sectionals (<italic>n</italic> = 21), practice (<italic>n</italic> = 20), and lessons (<italic>n</italic> = 13).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In response to the first research question ‘do high school music students experience flow during summer camp activities, and if so, what types of activities are conducive to these experiences?’, all students in the sample reported having flow-type experiences throughout the camp. Additionally, almost every activity in the questionnaire was selected at least once, suggesting that a wide range of opportunities exist for students to become highly focused and engaged throughout camp activities. Among the most often cited activities, large ensembles, hanging out with friends and electives were selected by over 50% of participants. These findings are consistent with previous research indicating that large ensemble rehearsals appear to be conducive to flow experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0255761411434455">Kraus, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0255761411434455">Steckel, 2001</xref>), but add the dimension of social activities (time with friends) as flow inducing as well.</p>
<p>When students were asked to rank their top three flow-inducing activities, large ensembles and electives were the most frequently selected high-ranked activities, followed by music theory. In the context of the present study, this finding suggests that, although many activities are cited as conducive to flow, and at least one of the most frequently cited is of a social nature, the most frequently cited high-ranking activities are all academic/musical in nature. In fact, among the 10 most frequently cited high-ranking activities, only two activities – friends and hanging out in the dorm – appear on the list. As no existing literature addresses preference among flow-inducing activities in music camp settings, this finding might present a further avenue of investigation.</p>
<p>In regards to flow and specific types of academic activities, there are several findings in the current study that are worth noting. First, it appears that very few students found opportunities for flow when engaged in lessons, individual practice, or sectionals. It should be noted that lessons as well as individual practice sessions were optional activities, and thus the low frequency of selection may be due to low participation rates in these tasks. Sectionals, however, were a regularly scheduled aspect of every student’s weekly activities. By comparison, a high number of students found flow in large ensembles, electives, and when attending live concerts.</p>
<p>When these findings are considered in the context of flow theory, it may be possible to attribute frequency of selection to the process of creating a sustained cycle of feedback concerning skills and challenges. Specifically, in large ensembles as well as electives, the feedback process is typically designed and controlled by an experienced teacher, allowing for the likelihood of well-executed teaching cycles (instruction–student response–feedback), as well as properly sequenced and appropriately-selected tasks. Sectionals, however, were often taught by graduate and undergraduate students with limited teaching experience. For many high school students, it is likely that the skills necessary to sustain well-executed cycles of personal goal setting and self-evaluation may have exceeded their current level of development, and may have been lacking in their instructors as well. Future studies should examine what strategies might be beneficial in helping to create and sustain flow experiences during individual practice sessions, and in other musical activities that require student-directed self-organization and evaluation.</p>
<p>Another finding of interest concerns the low selection rate of TV and computers in eliciting flow. It is well known that school-aged children spend significant amounts of time using electronic media for both social and academic purposes, and many music educators have attributed this to lowered rates of participation and increased distraction within their classes. If the findings in this study are subsequently replicated, especially using larger populations and diverse settings, music educators might be prompted to examine how flow theory may improve conditions for learning and motivation within their classrooms. Evidence of the use of flow principles in creating effective classroom environments has already been examined in other academic settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0255761411434455">Coleman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0255761411434455">Gunderson, 2003</xref>), but few have investigated how these principles might be systematically incorporated into music classrooms.</p>
<p>Flow, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0255761411434455">Csikszentmihalyi (1990)</xref>, includes both engagement and enjoyment as composite aspects of the experience. As engagement implies attention, students in the current study were asked to indicate their level of attention as well as enjoyment during their top-ranked flow-inducing activities. The results of the current study indicate moderate to strong correlations between these variables, suggesting a positive valence characteristic to attentiveness which has received very little discussion within the literature on music and attention. This finding is interesting in light of previous discussions on the value of engagement during musical tasks. Specifically, although attention is considered necessary for musical learning, skill acquisition, and other variables, the role of enjoyment as an artifact of attention is rarely discussed, except in relationship to aesthetic experience.</p>
<p>One recent study provided evidence that, similarly to aesthetic response, flow might also provide intense enjoyment due primarily as an artifact of enhanced attention rather than the emotional characteristics of an attendant musical stimulus or process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0255761411434455">Diaz, 2011</xref>). These findings warrant further investigation, as attributing intense cognitive involvement (in relationship to attention) as opposed to emotion as the primary cause of enhanced affective experience during musical activities suggests a departure from traditional investigations into heightened psychological experiences.</p>
<p>The general findings of this study suggest that flow experiences are prevalent among students attending summer camps, and that high magnitude experiences are attributed primarily to academic/musical activities. However, the small sample size, convenience characteristics, and descriptive nature of the study limit generalizing these results to other populations. Future studies should attempt to sample responses from a wider population, and include questions geared specifically to understanding what aspects of academic activities make them more conducive to flow experiences. Information regarding these factors could be valuable in designing activities for future camps, and may offer insights for music educators seeking to improve the level of engagement and enjoyment among their own classes.</p>

<title>Dimensiones del movimiento en actividades sociales y académicas entre participantes de un campamento musical de verano</title>
<p>El propósito de este estudio fue investigar la ocurrencia de experiencias relativas al movimiento entre estudiantes de música de Secundaria que asistían a un campamento de verano de música instrumental de dos semanas de duración. Más concretamente, el estudio buscaba determinar:a) si verdaderamente los estudiantes experimentan el movimiento en los campamentos de verano; b) qué actividades propician el movimiento; c) cuál es la relación entre contextos académicos y sociales al inducir movimientos completo; d) qué relación hay entre atención y disfrute en este tipo de experiencias. Se utilizó un cuestionario diseñado para solicitar información respecto a los susodichos factores. Los resultados sugirieron que los estudiantes experimentaron el movimiento en una amplia gama de actividades, si bien las actividades académico-musicales propiciaban más el movimiento que las actividades sociales. Además, se encontraron niveles de asociación que iban de moderados a fuertes entre las variables de atención y disfrute en las actividades más valoradas como actividades propiciatorias del movimiento. Se debaten sugerencias para estudios posteriores, así como implicaciones para los educadores musicales.</p>
