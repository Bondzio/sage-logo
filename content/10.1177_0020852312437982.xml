<abstract>
<p>The relationship between transparency and participation of government is not well articulated in the literature. Transparency provides stakeholders with knowledge about the processes, structures and products of government. Participation refers to the quantity, quality and diversity of input of stakeholders into government decision-making. Greater transparency and participation are often considered to operate side by side. However, in the Internet age the change in the magnitude of information disclosure may outweigh the change in the level of participative government. This article uses data from a 2010 national survey of five US local government agencies to test hypotheses about the relationship between transparency and participation and the factors that affect them. Findings show that participation is positively associated with transparency, but transparency does not lead to participation. In addition, organizations that are under stronger influence from external stakeholders report higher levels of participation but in some cases higher levels of external influence dampen transparency.</p>
<sec><title>Points for practitioners</title>
<p>For practitioners, the article provides a framework for understanding the relationship between transparency and participation as two dimensions of open government. While in some departments these two dimensions are present at similar levels, in others they are not. For example, among five departments, police report the lowest overall participation and transparency levels, while parks and recreation and the mayor’s office report the highest transparency and participation levels, respectively. In addition, police departments report significantly higher transparency than participation, while the reverse is true for community development departments. The article provides public administrators with greater insight into causes of and relationships between transparency and participation.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0020852312437982" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is often expected that transparency of and participation in government are linked. Typically, it is expected that these two constructs are positively correlated such that governments high in transparency also exhibit high participation, as it is thought that transparency is necessary for participation. Yet little research has actually investigated whether this true, and in fact, at the outset of this article the opposite should be considered. It is entirely possible that greater levels of transparency are associated with lower levels of participation, or that the relationship between transparency and participation depends upon different organizational and environmental factors.</p>
<p>Moreover, transparency and participation are not monolithic – there are multiple definitions and perspectives about their boundaries, or rather their distinctness. In the transparency literature, several authors recognize that transparency concerns the extent to which an organization provides information about its own internal processes, decision and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020852312437982">Curtin and Meijer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020852312437982">Gerring and Thacker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020852312437982">Welch and Wong, 2001</xref>). Heald identifies three different dimensions of transparency: decision-making, policy content and policy outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020852312437982">2006</xref>). The participation literature considers the ways in which stakeholders’ ideas, concerns, and interests are integrated into organization decisions and actions. Some research examines how participation processes are affected by such factors as problem salience and power distribution among actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020852312437982">Downes and McMillan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020852312437982">Heeter, 1989</xref>; McMillan, 2002). Other research examines how stakeholder input is integrated into decision outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020852312437982">Alter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020852312437982">Macintosh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020852312437982">Masters et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This article distinguishes between the two constructs based on the level of interaction the decision-maker has or intends to have with a stakeholder. <italic>Transparency</italic> is defined as the active disclosure of information by an organization that enables external actors to monitor and assess its internal workings, decisions and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020852312437982">Grimmelikhuijsen and Welch, forthcoming</xref>). This is generally a one-way communication process in which the organization provides information to other stakeholders. <italic>Participation</italic> is defined as the involvement of one or more stakeholders in decision-making or policy in such a way that the stakeholder input is considered during the decision-making process and influences the decision outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020852312437982">Bickerstaff and Walker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020852312437982">Roberts, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020852312437982">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020852312437982">Rowe and Frewer, 2000</xref>). This is generally a two-way communication process in which the stakeholder is considered a participant in the decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020852312437982">Welch and Fulla, 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0020852312437982">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Transparency and participation have strong normative foundations: in general people often believe that more is better. More information is important for citizens and other stakeholders to understand how their taxes are spent and help them make decisions about who to support in the next elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020852312437982">Etzioni, 2010</xref>). In public administration, transparency is often linked to more trustworthy, accountable and open government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020852312437982">Hood, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020852312437982">Meijer, 2009</xref>). Similarly, government decisions are expected to reflect the interests and needs of stakeholders, and participation is an important component of that process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020852312437982">O’Connor et al., 2000</xref>). In newer governance models, citizens and other stakeholders are participants in the governing process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020852312437982">Henderson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, public organizations are likely to be strategic about transparency and participation. In a turbulent environment in which stakeholders are always presented with the results of media inquiries, budget cuts, and whistleblowers, public organizations manage their exposure. Hence, this article seeks to understand whether organizations vary in terms of transparency and participation, how the two dimensions are related, and what factors predict them. It asks three questions: How does transparency affect participation and vice versa? How is the use of technology associated with transparency and participation? How does external stakeholder influence affect the levels of transparency and participation in public organizations? The answers to these questions will also provide insight into current government policies. For example, many of the Obama administration open government initiatives discuss transparency and participation without recognizing their differences or potential relationship.</p>
<p>This article takes advantage of a recent study of local governments in the United States in which survey data were collected from five different government departments: the mayor’s office, community development, parks and recreation, finance, and police. The survey sought to understand both basic levels of transparency and participation, but also how technology is used by the organization for both information dissemination and participation with stakeholders. This article first develops a set of hypotheses and then tests the hypotheses using two-stage least squares regression. Findings show that participation in local governments is positively associated with transparency, but that the reverse does not hold; transparency does not always lead to participation. In addition, organizations that are under stronger influence by external stakeholders report higher levels of participation, but in some cases higher levels of external influence dampen transparency. The use of information and communication technologies in local government agencies is positively associated with transparency but not associated with participation. Conclusions discuss the implications of these findings for theory and for current policy and management.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0020852312437982"><title>Separating transparency and participation</title>
<p>It is possible to consider transparency and participation as separate constructs, located on two different axes that range from low to high. The resulting diagram, presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0020852312437982">Figure 1</xref>, shows that the two dimensions give rise to four quadrants. Quadrants two and four are the easiest to explain and conform to general expectations regarding the relationship between transparency and participation. In quadrant two, both constructs are on the higher end, indicating that organizations found in this quadrant are both highly transparent and highly participative. To some extent, an example of such a situation may be found at multilateral international negotiations where decisions are based on consensus, participation in deliberations is open to all member nations, and desired insertions and deletions in the negotiated text are clearly visible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0020852312437982">2</xref></sup> Organizations in quadrant four are less transparent and less participative. There are probably many examples of these agencies, but it is safe to identify national security agencies as most likely to fit into this quadrant. For such organizations, transparency and participation represent activities that may jeopardize the mission of the agency. Recent work has shown that despite the rhetoric of openness, these agencies are increasingly secretive and offer very limited access to highly scrutinized outsiders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020852312437982">Lewis, 2010</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-0020852312437982" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Four potential relationships between participation and transparency</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0020852312437982-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In quadrants one and three, the situation is mixed. In quadrant one, where there is higher participation and lower transparency, organizations are more likely to interact with stakeholders and provide opportunities for input into their decision processes; however, they disseminate less information to the stakeholders. Such a situation may occur in highly turbulent or politicized environments, where there is a perceived need to maintain control over the interpretation of the disclosed information. Transparency, which is the one-way disclosure of information, may be perceived to be more risky than a more participative approach where information can be provided in a more controlled, contextualized, give-and-take environment. In addition, greater interaction with stakeholders is also a potential source of power for more political (or politically vulnerable) agencies, whereas the distribution of information may not result in relationship building. It is likely that the mayor’s office or the city’s executive council office would be more politicized than, for example, parks and recreation agencies. As such, we would expect the mayor’s office to respond to external stakeholders through participation more than transparency.</p>
<p>In quadrant three there is lower participation by external stakeholders in internal decision-making and higher transparency. In such situations, accountability may be less related to political responsiveness and more related to professionalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020852312437982">Bovens, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020852312437982">Romzek and Dubnick, 1987</xref>). Police agencies may be more likely to provide information about recent crimes and the extent to which crimes are solved, than to allow external stakeholders to provide input into decision-making; here, participation may reduce control while selective information disclosure helps maintain control and demonstrate professionalism.</p>
<p>This framework helps visualize that the relationship between transparency and participation may be less straight forward than is commonly recognized. Some agencies may find participation a less risky choice, while others feel that dissemination of information is more appropriate. Two caveats. First, this discussion recognizes only the relative variation in transparency and participation, not their overall levels, which could be continually increasing or decreasing. Second, this framework is not normative. Rather, it considers that agencies may be using transparency and participation strategically, as two complementary responses to external stakeholders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0020852312437982"><title>A strategic response</title>
<p>The political context of public organizations requires managers to simultaneously address external political demands and maintain sufficient control to carry out the tasks required of the agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020852312437982">Bozeman and Straussman, 1990</xref>). As a result, managers must ‘negotiate, bargain, and compromise with the external forces in the environment in order to set and carry out an organization’s goals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020852312437982">Knott, 1993</xref>: 109). In addition, managers must be strategic. They make decisions and plan in ways that optimize the ability of employees to accomplish work and the responsiveness to political exigencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020852312437982">Bryson, 1995</xref>). Given that managers are essentially information brokers between the internal organization and the external environment, they develop strategic means of providing information in ways that simultaneously satisfy external groups and maintain organizational control. Because transparency and participation are two potentially different means of communicating and conveying information, it is likely that managers will use different mixes of the two depending upon the political context of the organization.</p>
<p>Principal–agent theory provides a mechanism for understanding how the political context of public organizations will affect the information provision behavior of managers. A principal sets a contract with an agent to conduct an activity that benefits the principal, but is costly for the agent to carry out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020852312437982">Laffont and Mordimort, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020852312437982">Mitnick, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020852312437982">Moe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020852312437982">Pratt and Zeckhauser, 1991</xref>). Because explicit contracts are rare, observation and monitoring of agents is difficult, and the goals of the principal and agent differ. For example, when the agent’s activity is difficult to observe and monitor, <italic>information asymmetry</italic> – an imbalance in the amount or quality of information held by the two parties – may result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020852312437982">Laffont and Mordimort, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020852312437982">Mitnick, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020852312437982">Moe, 2006</xref>). When an agent’s behavior is difficult or costly to monitor, principals cannot determine if the agent has conducted the contracted activity.</p>
<p>Agents resist the provision of information, preferring to minimize uncertain response by external stakeholders. Thus, even though an agent may commit to a contract that serves the goals of the principal (i.e. open democratic processes), information asymmetry provides discretionary power to the agent and enables the agent to pursuit its own interests. In this case, external stakeholders (the public) are principles who have an implicit contract with government to develop programs, establish policy, and deliver services that are in the best interests of the public. Without having incentives or disincentives that increase the willingness of the agent to provide information, the agent may not abide by the implicit contract and, consequently, not fulfill the goals of the principal. This problem is called <italic>moral hazard</italic>. To guard against this, citizens and other stakeholders demand more information, and more access to and inclusion in decision processes as a means of holding government accountable to the implicit contract.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0020852312437982">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>As noted above, it is likely that transparency and participation represent two different mechanisms through which public organizations can respond to stakeholders, demonstrate openness, and satisfy accountability demands. Transparency provides explicit information on the organization, its processes, events, activities, and outcomes. Often this is in the form of written formal reports, data, memos, schedules, and meeting agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020852312437982">Meijer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020852312437982">Pitrowski and Borry, 2009</xref>). But it can also be in the form of allowing observation of decision-making activity. Participation, as defined above, is the opportunity for external stakeholders to provide input into decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020852312437982">Ho, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020852312437982">Jennings and Zeitner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020852312437982">Norris, 2001</xref>). Such activities create a more complex decision environment where government and stakeholders disclose preferences and positions. While this interaction is essentially a bargaining situation in which neither side is completely open, participation does provide stakeholders access to information about the public agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020852312437982">Roberts, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020852312437982">2004</xref>). Moreover, because information is disclosed in a richer contextualized setting, the government may be able to control the way in which decision preferences are presented. Such control may reduce the risk that one-way transmission of information (transparency) is misinterpreted or misapplied. When an organization provides explicit information in a one-way process its opportunity to control the interpretation and use of the information occurs prior to delivery, during the content development stage. An organization that engages in participation provides information as well – both explicit and tacit – but it is delivered within a more highly controlled context.</p>
<p>Given this, it is likely that the two forms of openness will be used at different times or for different circumstances. For example, if the political environment is turbulent (or potentially turbulent) the agency may be less likely to provide explicit information and more likely to seek mechanisms to present contextualized information within a controlled context. When the political environment is less uncertain, agencies may be more able to anticipate interpretation of explicit information, and be more able to control the message before it is released. By controlling the message, agencies may be able to maintain discretion and power, and at the same time comply with accountability requirements.

<p>H2: <italic>Higher</italic> levels of external stakeholder influence (lower relative levels of agency control) will be associated with <italic>lower</italic> levels of transparency.</p></disp-quote>When an organization increases participation, such that it increases the ability of stakeholders to provide input into decision-making, it also gives up some level of control over information disclosure. In some cases, the agency may prefer contextualized disclosure over explicit disclosure, as noted in the framework above. However, greater participation may also require additional disclosure of explicit information; external stakeholders, especially non-government stakeholders (citizens, businesses and advocacy groups), will require some level of additional information in order to effectively participate in decision-making or policy-making. As a result, increased participation may lead to greater transparency. While the agency’s calculus is strategic and continues to result in information asymmetry, it considers that further loss of control through participation is likely to be lower than the loss that would have occurred through transparency.
<disp-quote>
<p>H3: <italic>Higher</italic> levels of participation will be associated with <italic>higher</italic> levels of transparency.</p></disp-quote>By contrast, higher levels of one-way disclosure of information may not lead to two-way engagement with stakeholders in ways that garner input to decision-making. Transparency enables the organization to be visible; participation increases visibility of the organization as well, but it also enables external actors to actively contribute to the decision processes of the organization. To change visibility into active engagement, some kind of additional incentive or requirement may be needed. For example, a third party (political body or court of law) may demand greater citizen involvement in agency decision-making. Hence, release of more information (quantity or quality) is not expected to lead directly to greater participation.</p>
<p>The role that technology plays in transparency and participation is potentially large. New information and communication technologies enable government agencies to more easily provide information and citizens and other stakeholders to access it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020852312437982">Bimber, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020852312437982">Jun and Weare, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020852312437982">La Porte et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020852312437982">Musso and Weare, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020852312437982">Tolbert and Mossberger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020852312437982">Welch and Fulla, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020852312437982">West, 2004</xref>). More than a convenience, new online applications provide the means for stakeholders and government to communicate, and to record the interactions. A perennial question in the field of electronic government concerns the relationship between technology and behavior. The perspective taken here is that the effect of technology on organizations depends upon the socio-technical context in which it is embedded. This helps explain why ‘thirty years of systematic empirically grounded research about IT and organizational change suggests that many organizations have trouble in readily changing their practices and structures to take effective advantage of IT ‘(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020852312437982">Kling and Lamb, 2000</xref>: 2). In line with prior work, it is expected that organizations that use internet technologies more will report higher levels of transparency and participation.

<p>The models comprise a set of equations in which the first equation specifies the <italic>Decision Transparency</italic> model and the second equation specifies the <italic>Decision Participation</italic> model. The two equations are estimated simultaneously due to the potential for endogeneity, or mutual causality, that may exist among Decision Transparency and Decision Participation. The estimation technique is appropriate here because it is possible that (1) a more active participation process may lead to an increase in the need for more transparency (e.g. more information about the parameters of the decision), and (2) a more transparent process may lead to greater levels of participation. Although the cross-sectional nature of the data used in this study does not allow strict testing of causal relationships, the simultaneous estimation of the two equations does recognize the potential two-way associations that are of interest in this article.</p>
<p>To carry out the two-stage least squares estimation technique, endogenous variables are first regressed on all exogenous variables. In the second stage, predicted values obtained through the estimation are then substituted on the right-hand side of the equation. This reduces the correlation between the variable and the error term for the equation and results in more consistent estimates than would have been obtained using ordinary least squares regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020852312437982">Greene, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020852312437982">Pyndyck and Rubinfeld, 1991</xref>). The two equations are:
<disp-quote>

<p>Decision Participation = (<italic>Decision Transparency</italic>, External Stakeholder Influence, Organization Characteristics, Participation Technology, City Size)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In these equations, the endogenous variables are found on both sides of the equation, while the exogenous (those determined outside of the equation) are only on the right-hand side of the equation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0020852312437982"><title>Data</title>
<p>The analysis uses data from a web survey on e-government technology and civic engagement conducted for the Institute of Policy and Civic Engagement at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The survey was administered to government managers in 500 local governments with citizen populations ranging from 25,000 to 250,000. Because larger cities often have greater financial and technical capacity for e-government, all 184 cities with a population over 100,000 were selected while a proportionate random sample of 316 out of 1002 communities was drawn from cities with populations under 100,000. For each city, lead managers were identified in each of the following five departments: general city management, community development, finance, the police, and parks and recreation. A total of 2500 city managers were invited to take part in the survey. The survey began on 2 August 2010 and closed on 11 October 2010. A total of 902 responses were received for a final response rate of 37.9 percent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0020852312437982">4</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec7-0020852312437982"><title>Endogenous variables</title>
<p>The two endogenous variables used in the article are transparency and participation. Transparency is measured using an index of 12 survey items asking respondents about the frequency with which the agency uses different mechanisms to disseminate information. Participation is measured as an index of the perceived frequency with which 13 different stakeholders participated in agency decisions and policy-making. The correlation between these two indexes is 0.20, indicating that while they are significantly related in the positive direction, the level of correlation is low. Correlations between these two variables are similar for different categories of city size. However, they vary substantially by department type. For example, the correlations between participation and transparency are 0.54, 0.42, and 0.31 for finance, police and parks and recreation departments, respectively.</p>
<p>ANOVA tests were conducted to understand more about how transparency and participation vary across departments. Results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020852312437982">Table 1</xref> show that in two departments – the mayor’s office and community development – participation is statistically higher than transparency. This compares to parks and recreation and police where transparency is perceived to be higher than participation. There is no difference between the two in finance departments. These findings not only demonstrate the potential importance that organizational and environmental factors have on the two variables, but they also provide some evidence of construct validity for the analysis. As discussed above, agencies that are more political or politically vulnerable are relatively more focused on participation than transparency. The opposite is true for those agencies that are more professionalized and less political.

<p>Means and standard deviations for these variables are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020852312437982">Table 2</xref>. However, departments also vary in terms of the absolute levels of transparency and participation. For example, respondents from mayors’ offices reported the highest levels of participation, followed in order by community development, finance, parks and recreation and police. The department reporting the highest transparency was parks and recreation, followed by the mayor’s office, finance, community development, and police.

<sec id="sec8-0020852312437982"><title>Exogenous variables</title>
<p>The <italic>Decision Transparency</italic> equation has multiple exogenous variables on the right-hand side. Three measures used to operationalize external influence were constructed based on a two-stage statistical process. First, factor analysis with varimax rotation was used to factor respondent perceptions of the influence of ten different external actors. The results, shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020852312437982">Table 2</xref>, identified three different factors with loadings over 1.0 – <italic>Civil Society Influence</italic>, <italic>City Influence</italic>, and <italic>State Influence</italic>. The civil society influence factor includes advocacy groups, businesses, media and public opinion. The city influence factor includes the mayor, city departments, and the city council, while the state influence factor includes the governor, state courts and state legislature. Loadings for both factors exceeded 1.0. As a second step, the different measures were then combined into additive scales and tested for reliability (Chronbach’s alpha, reported in the Appendix). The scale variables were used in the estimation.</p>
<p>Other organization-related exogenous variables in the transparency equation include one variable that captures the existence of an information security policy in the organization (<italic>Security Policy</italic>); one capturing perceived level of employee discretion over the disclosure of information in the agency (<italic>Employee Disclosure Discretion</italic>); one that measures the percentage of employees that use the Internet (<italic>Percent Internet Use</italic>); and one, called <italic>Organization Size</italic>, is log of the number of full-time equivalent employees in the organization. In addition, the equation contains dummy variables for department and city size where the reference groups are police and large city size, respectively. The five city size variables are coded based on the population of the 500 cities in the sample: small (under 50,000); small-medium (50,000 to 99,999); medium (100,000 to 149,999); medium-large (150,000 to 199,999); and large (200,000 to 250,000).</p>
<p>Several of the same exogenous variables appear in the <italic>Participation</italic> equation including the three stakeholder influence, organization size, department and city size variables. However, this second equation removes the three variables related to information provision and substitutes them with three others related to participation. The Participation equation includes one participation technology variable that captures the extent to which the agency uses different technologies to enable citizen and stakeholder participation (<italic>Participation Technology</italic>), and two variables capturing the perceived effect of technologies on participation (<italic>Bad Democratic Outcome</italic> and <italic>Good Decision Outcome</italic>). The last two outcome variables were created using the same two-stage method described for the influence variables in the previous paragraph. Results are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0020852312437982">Table 3</xref>. The <italic>Good Decision Outcome</italic> factor includes perceptions that electronic and communication technologies can lead to revitalization of public debate, improved government decision-making and better policies. The <italic>Bad Democratic Outcome</italic> factor also includes three responses: increased conflict with citizens, undermining of democratic practices, and distortion of political information and facts. Loadings for both factors exceeded 1.0.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0020852312437982">Table 5</xref> presents results from the two-stage least squares regression model. The sample size has dropped due to listwise deletion of missing values. In general, the findings show mixed support for expectations that external stakeholder influence will affect transparency and participation. <italic>Decision Participation</italic> model results show that as organizations experience higher levels of influence from civil society, they engage in more frequent participation activities that involve stakeholders in decision-making. In addition, organizations that perceive higher amounts of influence from city government report more frequent participation activity. These findings are in line with prior literature and support the first hypothesis (H1). State influence does not seem to affect participation frequency. This is probably because many of the city-level participation activities would be more related to local issues; decisions or policies that are less likely to result from state pressure. As predicted in Hypothesis 2 (H2), city influence is negatively associated with transparency. Managers who perceive higher levels of influence from the city (mayor, other departments, and city council) are more likely to report lower levels of transparency. By contrast, neither state influence nor civil society influence is associated with transparency.

<p>It is possible to interpret the findings to indicate that as city government seeks greater control over the organization, managers and other employees are less likely to provide explicit information that could further loss of control and are more likely to provide contextualized information through participative activity. That is, as the city principal seeks to increase its ability to direct the organization, the agency alters its information provision strategy from explicit (transparent) to contextualized (participative). In this way public agencies respond to external pressure in ways that enable them to simultaneously respond to informational demands and maintain control. In situations where bureaucratic politics are particularly strong, this strategy may be particularly prominent.</p>
<p>In addition, results show that while the coefficient for participation in the transparency model is positive and significant, the coefficient for transparency in the participation model is not statistically significant. This provides evidence for the third hypothesis (H3) that greater participation will lead to more transparency. There is no evidence that transparency has a direct effect on participation. Further, it is useful to compare the direct and indirect effects of city influence on transparency. The direct effect is negative – a 1 unit increase in city influence is associated with a 0.09 point decrease in transparency – while the indirect effect city influence on transparency through participation is positive – a 1 unit increase in city influence results in a 0.07 point increase in transparency (0.07 × 1.03 = 0.07). The compensation is almost equivalent, further supporting the general expectation that transparency and participation are complementary strategies.</p>
<p>Results also show mixed support for the fourth prediction (H4) that greater use of information and communication technologies would be associated with higher levels of transparency and participation. Organizations in which a larger proportion of employees use the Internet at work report greater frequency of information disclosure; however, the number of participation technologies used by the agency has no effect on participation frequency. In addition, organizations that report having an information security policy tend to report lower levels of transparency. Presumably internal disclosure rules work to prohibit frequency of information dissemination activities, thereby limiting transparency.</p>
<p>Larger organizations appear to be more able to undertake participative decision-making activities, but organization size is not associated with transparency. Specific to the <italic>Decision Participation</italic> model, perceptions of the respondent that participation leads to better policy and decision-making is positively associated with participation. This finding may indicate that the attitudes of managers have an effect on the level of participation pursued by the organization. Mayors’ offices and community development agencies are more transparent than the police departments, while all four departments in the model – mayor’s office, parks and recreation, finance and community development – undertake participative decision-making activities more frequently than police departments.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0020852312437982" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article has examined the relationship between transparency and participation and the environmental influences that affect them. Findings generally show that transparency and participation levels vary by department. For example, community development departments and mayors’ offices report greater frequency of participation than other departments. Probably this is due to the more political nature of the departments, legal requirements, or the traditions of more direct interactions with stakeholders. The article also showed that there are differences in the relative levels of transparency and participation across departments with some reporting higher relative levels of transparency and others reporting higher relative levels of participation. In addition, analysis shows that the two are complementary. It is possible to conclude that participation and transparency are separate, unidirectionally related constructs.</p>
<p>Model results reinforce the descriptive findings, but also provide greater insight into the mechanisms by which transparency and participation are encouraged or discouraged. For example, higher levels of city influence are positively related to participation, but negatively related to transparency, after controlling for departmental and other organizational variables. These relationships are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0020852312437982">Figure 2</xref>. This indicates that managers may be responding to external pressures by shifting modes of information and communication from indirect one-way (transparency) to direct two-way (participative). However, when managers move toward more participative activities in response to external influence, transparency rises due to the need created by greater participation. This indicates that external influences (as operationalized here) have little to no overall effect on transparency, but increase participation.
<fig id="fig2-0020852312437982" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Depiction of the empirical relationships between transparency, participation and website dissemination quality in local governments</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0020852312437982-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Finally, the relationship between participation and transparency is unidirectional: participation is associated with increased transparency, but greater transparency does not result in more participation. This is an important finding that furthers understanding about the mechanisms of openness in public organizations. Provision of more information may provide greater ability for external stakeholders and citizens to observe the work processes and outcomes of government, but the provision itself is not indicative of participation. It is possible that transparency could increase citizen political pressure, which would then affect the participatory activity of government. Future work should investigate this. However, it is theorized and substantiated in the regulatory research community that voluntary disclosure provides a means of reducing rather than increasing political pressure. Greater disclosure drives a wedge between citizens and regulators, thereby reducing the strength of political demands for change. Whether the same mechanism works for participation and transparency of the public sector is unclear. Longitudinal studies of participation and transparency would be able to examine this.</p>
<p>Finally, while it appears that in some ways technology does affect transparency, having the tools does not seem to matter for participation. It is possible that the revolution in e-government is increasing interest in participation and transparency by researchers more than new media technologies are actually affecting participation and transparency outcomes. Further work should be done to distinguish technological effects from the potentially more powerful determinants of department mission, goals, history, social context and political pressure.</p>
<p>The implications of these findings for management and policy are potentially far reaching. Increased participation of stakeholders in local government will likely be due to conscious internal management decisions to more fully engage stakeholders in discussions to understand stakeholder needs and gather input for decisions. The findings presented in this study indicate that substantive participation is not directly increased through increased provision of information, nor is it likely to be useful or politically productive to claim that such a connection exists. National-level efforts to increase postings and improve Freedom of Information Act processing speeds, such as those established as part of the Obama presidency’s open government initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020852312437982">Coglianese, 2009</xref>), may slightly alter the amount of information available to potential consumers, but they are also not likely to directly affect participation by stakeholders in government decision-making.</p>
<p>Implying that transparency and participation are two sides of the same coin, as academic literature and public policy efforts often do, provides a disservice to managers and the public. Transparency and participation represent two different approaches to government accountability, and hence two different mechanisms by which the governing and the governed should interact. Transparency is a means of demonstrating to external observers that the government actor is operating within parameters that are acceptable to the public. Transparency enables citizens and other stakeholders to watch government and, if transgressions are identified, challenge it through the media, courts or other institutions. Transparency-based accountability is generally reactive in nature and possibly encourages an adversarial, indirect approach to governance; as transgressions occur, the governed resort to established institutions to address concerns and force change. Here transparency and participation are integrated, yet they operate at arm’s length. A participative mechanism provides a means of substantively integrating citizens and other stakeholders into the decision-making process; it enables a co-management process in which all participants are, to varying degrees, accountable to the decision process and prospective outcomes. Substantive participation requires greater information provision to external stakeholders and may encourage a more collaborative approach to governance.</p>
<p>National, state and local policies that seek to simultaneously encourage transparency and participation do so from different approaches to governance and these different perspectives are evident in the analysis in this article and in current open government initiatives. When an open government policy is <italic>transparency leading</italic> (as the Obama policy is), participation will follow indirectly through established institutional governance mechanisms. When open government policy is <italic>participation leading</italic>, transparency will follow directly through necessary provision of information. Researchers and policy-makers should more fully distinguish between the two.<sup>5</sup></p>
