<abstract>
<p>This article presents excerpts from a case study describing Angelica Dawson, a New York State music educator. Angelica makes improvisation a central part of her curricula in ways that transcend traditional offerings prevalent in American public schools. Qualitative research methods were used to document Angelica’s work over the course of an academic year at a rural public school in New York State. Data collection utilized ethnographic techniques including interviews, observations and informal conversations. Data analysis employed interpretive coding guided by a constant comparative approach. Analysis revealed challenges posed by teaching improvisation in the school music context, including: conflicts with tradition; conflicts with the expectations of colleagues, parents, students, and administrators, and standing apart from the prevailing practices of colleagues. Angelica’s story suggests that teachers who break from traditional pedagogical practices face profound challenges and feelings of isolation.</p>

<p>A number of national school music programs have incorporated improvisation or musics dependent on improvisation into general music curricula. This has been reported in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1321103X13486569">Green, 2008</xref>), Costa Rica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1321103X13486569">Rosabal-Coto, 2010</xref>), Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1321103X13486569">Väkevä, 2006</xref>), and Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1321103X13486569">Heimonen, 2004</xref>). In the United States, improvisation in school music programs occurs in two primary areas, elementary methods and middle and secondary school music jazz programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1321103X13486569">Hickey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1321103X13486569">Kratus, 1996</xref>). In those areas, standards, policy and curricular documents tend to encourage teacher-driven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1321103X13486569">Hickey, 2009</xref>), “sequential and prescripted” approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1321103X13486569">Benedict, 2006</xref>, p. 28). Such documents privilege instructor control over student agency.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1321103X13486569">Alperson (1984)</xref> observed that considerable “human agency is required in order to bring a set of musical sounds into existence” (p. 18). Improvisers exercise agency by engaging in dialogic exchanges with their surroundings, with their audiences, and with other improvisers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1321103X13486569">Csikszentmihalyi &amp; Rich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1321103X13486569">Sawyer, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1321103X13486569">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1321103X13486569">2008</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1321103X13486569">Hickey (2009)</xref> argued that trying to teach improvisation might prove less fruitful than encouraging students to improvise freely. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1321103X13486569">Wright and Kanellopoulos (2010)</xref> posited that “[i]mprovisation might emerge as a moment and a practice of rupture with linearity of progress, working against reification of knowledge and glorification of received information” (p. 71).</p>

<title>Previous studies of improvisation in school music contexts</title>
<p>Many studies of improvisation explore how children learn to improvise or improvise in service of other endeavors such as composition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1321103X13486569">Azzara, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1321103X13486569">Brophy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1321103X13486569">Burnard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1321103X13486569">Davies, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1321103X13486569">Flohr, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1321103X13486569">Freundlich, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1321103X13486569">Hargreaves, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1321103X13486569">Kratus, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1321103X13486569">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1321103X13486569">McPherson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1321103X13486569">Moorhead &amp; Pond, 1977</xref>). Researchers have also investigated the implications of improvisation-based curricula (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1321103X13486569">Gregory, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1321103X13486569">Mroz, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1321103X13486569">Sarath, 2002</xref>). Still other scholars have documented how American music educators view improvisation or implement improvisation instruction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1321103X13486569">Bitz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1321103X13486569">Byo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1321103X13486569">Conway, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1321103X13486569">Lehman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1321103X13486569">Orman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1321103X13486569">Ward-Steinman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1321103X13486569">Whitcomb, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Abundant research literature documents improvisation and its applications in elementary music instruction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1321103X13486569">Davis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1321103X13486569">Flohr, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1321103X13486569">Freundlich, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1321103X13486569">Kratus, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1321103X13486569">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1321103X13486569">Reese, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1321103X13486569">Whitcomb, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1321103X13486569">Wiggins &amp; Espeland, 2012</xref>). Scholars have also addressed improvisation in relation to jazz education (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1321103X13486569">Azzara, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1321103X13486569">Kuzmich, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1321103X13486569">Prouty, 2002</xref>), jazz pedagogical methods (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1321103X13486569">Carter, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1321103X13486569">Murphy, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1321103X13486569">Snyder, 1994</xref>; Witmer &amp; Robbins, 1998), and jazz ensemble student experience (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1321103X13486569">Goodrich, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1321103X13486569">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1321103X13486569">Leavell, 1996</xref>). Studies describing American teachers who employ other approaches to improvisation remain relatively sparse.</p>

<title>Purpose of the study</title>
<p>The purpose of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1321103X13486569">Pignato, 2010</xref>) from which this article is derived was to identify and describe selected New York State music educators who feature improvisation as a central characteristic of their curricula in ways that transcend traditional approaches. Participants considered for this study taught improvisation in “trans-stylistic” ways, or via a “palette of improvisatory experiences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1321103X13486569">Sarath, 2002</xref>, p. 191) and encouraged student agency. Such teachers incorporated improvisation via a variety of musics including rock, blues, hip hop, electronica, avant-garde music, Appalachian folk music, and free improvisation. The data presented here focus on Angelica Dawson, a teacher in New York’s rural upstate region. All names, including Angelica’s, are pseudonyms.</p>
<p>The following questions guided the investigation: What are relevant training, prior experiences, teaching practices, and belief systems of the participant? How do students experience the “improvisation culture” (Azarra, 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1321103X13486569">Sawyer, 2000</xref>) fostered by Angelica? What are practical challenges posed by teaching improvisation “as a practice of rupture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1321103X13486569">Wright &amp; Kanellopolous, 2010</xref>, p. 71)?</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1321103X13486569">Hebert (2009)</xref> noted the existence of exceptional, “visionary school teachers” who “eschew fundamentalist dogma to pioneer intuitive approaches” (p. 43). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1321103X13486569">Lehman (1995)</xref> recommended giving exceptional teachers “an opportunity to share their skills and knowledge” (p. 12). Angelica’s narrative provides readers with the story of one such teacher who, to paraphrase one of Angelica’s colleagues, broke away from the “traditional music education path.”</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1321103X13486569">Bartel and Radocy (2002)</xref> recommended choosing methodologies based on the complexity of the constructs one intends to study. I selected a qualitative methodology due to the subjective nature of participant responses, the need for interpretation of data that would illuminate the meanings and experiences of the participant, and also because of my involvement as an observer within this context. I sought to understand complex phenomena: teacher training, teacher experiences, teaching practices, student experiences, and belief systems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1321103X13486569">Denzin and Lincoln (2005)</xref> identified qualitative research as effective for the study of complex constructs in nuanced contexts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1321103X13486569">Szego (2002)</xref> noted the effective use of ethnographic techniques in qualitative research on music teacher practice. A number of larger precedent studies, similar to the study from which this case was derived, employed ethnographic techniques to document music teaching and learning in <italic>situ</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1321103X13486569">Goodrich, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1321103X13486569">Hebert, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1321103X13486569">Veblen, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>In undertaking the study, I took an interpretive, phenomenological approach. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1321103X13486569">Burnard (2000)</xref> observed that “teachers have their own personal and musical constructs that constitute improvising … which in turn influence the content and activities they employ” (p. 243). I sought to understand particularized approaches to teaching improvisation observable in the work of Angelica. Qualitative methods helped portray a socially constructed, complex, and changing reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1321103X13486569">Glesne, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>As previously stated, criteria for selecting participants included recognition as excellent teachers who taught improvisation in non-traditional, “trans-stylistic” ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1321103X13486569">Sarath, 2002</xref>, p. 197). Angelica was selected after considering consultant input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1321103X13486569">Stake, 1995</xref>) and after a period of discovery that afforded me understanding of what was occurring in this particular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1321103X13486569">Stake, 1995</xref>). Members of the New York State School Music Association (NYSSMA) identified Angelica as an “excellent” teacher doing “innovative work” with jam bands and free improvisation (Association member, personal communication, 18 January 2009).</p>
<sec id="section4-1321103X13486569">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Data collection included formal interviews, informal interviews, conversations, and observations. I created an interview protocol comprised of original questions and questions regarding improvisation in school music programs adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1321103X13486569">Reese (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1321103X13486569">Schopp (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1321103X13486569">Whitcomb (2005)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1321103X13486569">Bitz (1998)</xref>. In order to ensure consistent, systematized rigor, interview procedures followed guidelines in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1321103X13486569">Merriam (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1321103X13486569">Seidman (2006)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1321103X13486569">Spradley (1979)</xref>, and occurred on site or in locations convenient for Angelica (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1321103X13486569">Table 1</xref>). Interviews were recorded and transcribed within 48 hours. In order to capture the essence of Angelica’s speaking style, the characteristic utterances that comprise her voice, I transcribed Angelica’s words using suggestions in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1321103X13486569">MacLean, Mechthild, and Estable (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1321103X13486569">Oliver, Serovich, and Mason (2005)</xref>.</p>

<p>As documented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1321103X13486569">Table 1</xref>, I also interviewed those with whom Angelica interacted, including students, colleagues, and administrators who might refute or corroborate her statements, expressions, or my observations, or simply provide additional insight into Angelica’s relationships with the school community. All quotations are attributable to Angelica except as noted. As an outsider to the Auckland community, I chose to conduct non-participant observation following suggestions in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1321103X13486569">Lincoln and Guba (1985)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1321103X13486569">Creswell (2007)</xref>. Data collected were assessed for bias through comparison with data collected from other sources such as interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1321103X13486569">Merriam, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1321103X13486569">Yin, 2003</xref>). Over the course of an academic year, I observed Angelica teach a rock music instrumental methods program, conduct choral rehearsals, teach general music classes, and direct a summer music camp. I also observed Angelica as she went about her day and interacted with the school community (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1321103X13486569">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Informal conversations, commentary, or expressions occasionally represented additional data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1321103X13486569">Stake, 1995</xref>). Such data often became evident in review of audio recordings from interviews and observation sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1321103X13486569">Merriam, 1998</xref>). Additional data emerged in memos and field notes, in electronic mail exchanges, in phone calls, and in informal meetings with the participant.</p>

<sec id="section5-1321103X13486569">
<title>Data analysis and trustworthiness</title>
<p>Data analysis employed coding guided by a constant comparative approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1321103X13486569">Glaser &amp; Strauss, (2008)</xref>. To ensure purposeful, consistent application of the constant comparative approach, I applied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1321103X13486569">Boeije’s (2002)</xref> sequential, four-step process during data analysis. Initial comparisons were made among the data recorded in single interview or observation documents. Secondary comparisons were made among data in multiple interviews or observation documents from the same participant. Tertiary comparisons were made comparing data collected from all participants and all participant sites. Finally, comparison sessions were conducted revisiting each of the preceding steps. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1321103X13486569">Charmaz’s (2006)</xref> description of “significant events” informed and helped provide focus to the coding process.</p>
<p>I employed three techniques to maximize the likelihood that the findings would be worthwhile and verifiable: “prolonged engagement,” “persistent observation,” and “triangulation” in data collection and informant sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1321103X13486569">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>, p. 307). Frequent member checking provided additional means for confirming the “intentionality” of participant responses, a measure for identifying erroneous data, and an opportunity for additional data collection (p. 30). Participants provided factual corrections, contextualization, and other essential clarifying input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1321103X13486569">Maxwell, 2005</xref>).

<title>Findings</title>

<title>Angelica’s path</title>
<p>Angelica Dawson grew up in Ohio, “on a farm in a pretty abusive, dysfunctional home” in which “country music was everywhere; you couldn’t escape it.” Rock music, “blasting well into the night” from her stepfather’s stereo, convinced Angelica that she “would be a musician of some sort” (Interview 2). She even attempted to write songs using her mother’s 12-string guitar.</p>
<p>Ironically, as a means of “rebellion” against the “hillbilly” music favored by her father (Interview 1), Angelica pursued school band and orchestra programs. She played bassoon in the orchestra and flute in the marching and concert bands. Those experiences prompted her to pursue a career as a classical musician.</p>
<p>Upon graduating from high school, Angelica enrolled in the Army Bands program “because of the military band program, I thought I could get the training I needed to become a top-flight bassoonist” (Interview 2). The training the military provided did not include, in Angelica’s case, improvisation. Outside of the songwriting experiments she engaged in as a teenager, Angelica would have little experience with improvisation for years to come.</p>
<p>After leaving the Army and entering a conservatory, Angelica experienced an epiphany moment. Classical music, a life-long pursuit, became a source of stress, a repressive agent holding back “my musical self” (Interview 1):<disp-quote>
<p>[I] just decided that classical music, you know, playing my bassoon four to six hours a day was not really what, what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I found it really limiting and wanted something more inclusive. (Interview 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Angelica “swore off a career as a classical musician,” and began “playing rock and roll” launching a series of forays into improvised music (Interview 2). Angelica shifted from aspiring concert bassoonist to burgeoning rock musician. In 2001, the allure of performing rock music drew her to New York City.</p>
<p>New York provided Angelica with unique opportunities and formative teaching experiences. She quickly connected with a cadre of New York musicians including Arlen Johns, a blind blues musician. Arlen became a mentor:<disp-quote>
<p>Arlen just played totally by ear. He didn’t know any of the actual formal theory behind it but he began teaching me blues form and I started improvising more on blues form on the piano… . That’s when I started to really think about what it means to improvise and what it means to learn improvisation. (Interview 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Angelica sought out other improvisers. She darted around town sitting in with musicians:<disp-quote>
<p>That time was probably my biggest growth in improvisation. I took my flute all over the City, to every after hours place, to every open mic, to every jam session I could find. I really started to do things … I started trading licks with the guitarists … and using my ear to emulate what they were doing. That’s really when I became an improviser. Improvisation became my primary way of thinking about music. (Interview 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Though musically rich, the after-hours jam sessions did not produce enough income for Angelica to survive. To make ends meet, Angelica began teaching at a for-profit tutoring and test preparation center. She quickly became Director of one of the company’s facilities just outside New York City, in New Jersey. Despite taking time from her musical aspirations, the work provided Angelica with experiences in teaching, curriculum design, and classroom management.</p>
<p>An associate recommended Angelica for another teaching position at a nearby cultural center. She began working with area children directing arts workshops and music camps. Angelica thought, “you know, I might want to do something like this for a living” (Interview 1). That moment was “a kind of turning point” (Interview 1). Angelica began to view teaching and her musical pursuits as “parts of the same whole” (Interview 2).</p>
<p>In 2005, Angelica moved to Auckland, New York to take a teaching position that ultimately fell through. The move to Auckland proved fortuitous. Angelica met and married Jared Farnsworth, an Auckland musician without “a lot of formal music training” (Interview 2). Jared led Mountain Junction, a popular area jam band. Joining the band liberated Angelica:<disp-quote>
<p>I think real freedom came when I met Jared … Jared’s not formally trained. He did all this improvisational music; whereas my training was more formal, classical, you know, I did do the blues in New York City, but then I came up here and I was finally in my first real jam band … I could actually improvise; experiment. It was a real growth period. (Interview 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the summer of 2007, a local arts organization advertised positions for teachers to conduct afterschool workshops and Angelica applied. Unbeknownst to Angelica, the organization forwarded her application to Dr. Molly Lubner, Superintendent of the Auckland Unified School District. The district had experienced “a lot of turnover for some time” in the elementary music position (Board member, personal communication, 25 October, 2009). Shortly thereafter, Angelica received an unanticipated offer to take a full-time general music position at Auckland:<disp-quote>
<p>As luck would have it, they happened to be losing their last music teacher at the time. They called me up on a Thursday and said can you start Monday? I mean school had already started. I had no lesson plans or anything. I just basically stepped into this. (Interview 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Stories of looking for one thing and finding another weave throughout Angelica’s narrative on the threads of music, improvisation, and education. Angelica explained:<disp-quote>
<p>I really had no intention on becoming, you know, a music teacher at that given time. I had actually applied for a part-time position … totally out of the blue, but then again, I guess some of the best stuff happens that way … it all just came together. (Interview 2)</p>

<title>Improvisation and Angelica’s teaching</title>
<p>Angelica taught kindergarten through sixth-grade general music at Auckland. She directed the elementary, middle, and high school choirs and offered afterschool lessons on guitar, piano, flute, percussion, and voice. Lorraine, a student teacher, described the prevalence of improvisation in Angelica’s teaching:<disp-quote>
<p>When I came to Auckland, one of my professors knew Angelica. He told me she does improvisation but in a really unusual way. I must admit though to being surprised because nearly every class includes improvisation, even if it’s a little bit of experimentation, free improv, or musical conversations. There’s always something. (Interview, 28 September, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Improvisation in Angelica’s teaching manifested in a few very specific ways: (a) free unstructured improvisation; (b) wordless vocal improvisations; and (c) instrumental improvisations constrained by varying degrees of structure ranging from sounding instruments freely in response to cues to more complex constraints such as soloing over chord progressions or along with computer-generated loops.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1321103X13486569">
<title>A typical moment in Angelica’s classroom</title>
<p>Angelica directed choral students in a routine typical of the group’s rehearsals (Observation, 28 September 2009). An eighth-grade student suggested doing an “opera” style improvisation like they did “last time.” Another student called out, “how about we add the commercial improvs too?” His suggestion proved popular. Angelica fetched a bodhrán and provided a steady rhythm. Two students joined in with conga drums.</p>
<p>Three female students started singing “I’m lovin’ it,” a ubiquitous jingle that accompanies television advertisements for the McDonalds restaurant chain. The drumming continued. Angelica added a 3 / 2 clave to the pattern. Students clapped the same. The rest of the choir joined in singing variations on the basic melody. One of the original singers then stepped forward and began rapping variations on the “I’m lovin’ it” theme. The other members, amused by the rap, began laughing and the improvisation broke down.</p>
<p>Students expressed the need for additional ideas. They began thinking of other possible jingles. Angelica began drumming with the two conga players. The choir listened for a few short measures, discussed parts, and began riffing on a number of commercial jingles in light-hearted call and response.</p>
<p>A subset of the choir, about four students, remained quiet. Angelica asked what they might like to improvise. One student responded, “nothing.” From my perspective, this seemed like an affront to Angelica. In actuality, the student meant the word “nothing” and the use of silence. In between the jingles, the group inserted, in a quasi whisper, “nothing” and the entire chorus rested for a beat.</p>
<p>The girl who earlier asked about singing “opera” began improvising in a mock operatic soprano style. Another student, following her lead, began singing a descending line in an exaggerated rhythm and blues fashion. Others began improvising similarly creating an amusing juxtaposition of competing commercial jingles, Latin American percussion, and rhythm and blues.</p>
<p>The group broke out in laughter and applause. Fun, humor, and creative idiosyncratic expression played noticeable roles in the activity. Angelica later commented, “no real expectation of outcome, just get them doing, expressing, creating, with some structure, but not too much, not the typical structures anyway. It goes where they want to take it” (Personal communication, 30 September 2009).</p>

<title>Student experiences</title>
<p>Students spoke about Angelica’s classes. Tobin, a sixth-grade student, explained:<disp-quote>
<p>Mrs. Dawson’s class is definitely out of the ordinary. In my other school, we did a lot of stuff from the book, we learned a lot of notes and we sort of learned to play but with Mrs. Dawson, it’s different. At my old school all my old teachers taught us how other people made music. Ms. Dawson teaches us how to do it ourselves. (Interview, 15 December, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Amanda, a high school student explained, “we’re learning at the same time as doing something we want to do, something that’s our own” (Interview, 15 December, 2009). Thomas declared, “I get to use my mind, to make something like a beat or a composition or an improvisation. I never had to use my mind in music before” (Interview, 15 December, 2009). Jesse reported profound experiences in Angelica’s classroom, “It’s like improvising gets me to open up. If I can’t open up, Mrs. Dawson helps me get down in there and get to the spirit. She gets my spirit out” (Interview, 15 December, 2009).</p>
<p>Angelica also taught improvisation in a variety of community programs associated with the school. In 2006, Angelica founded a non-profit organization that runs a popular youth group, the Auckland Music and Arts Collective (AMAC). The group offers members opportunities to “jam, hang out with other musicians, and be creative” (Interview 1). For three summers, AMAC sponsored Mountain Rock, a music camp for “kids to jam, improvise, and rock out” (Interview 1). Angelica, along with a volunteer staff member, offered a two-week intensive course in rock performance, improvisation, and composition.</p>

<title>Angelica’s belief systems</title>
<sec id="section12-1321103X13486569">
<title>Epiphany and transformation</title>
<p>Swearing off classical music launched an odyssey, affording Angelica experiences in improvised music thus transforming her views on music and music education. Angelica described extended periods of self-evaluation, experimentation, and, ultimately, transformation:<disp-quote>
<p>I came to believe improvisation is necessary to ensure students perform musically, joyfully, successfully—to ensure they develop that kind of ear that allows them to take control of what they play, be it on the written page or something from their own spirit. (Observation, 28 September 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Angelica sought to facilitate the development of musicians with more comprehensive senses of “their own humanity, to help them become exceptional human beings” (Interview 2). She explained:<disp-quote>
<p>Improvisation is an everyday experience. People need to improvise in their social lives, in families, in their childrearing; they need to with their friends and closest relations. I got to Auckland because I improvise as a musician but also because I improvise my life to a degree. (Interview 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1321103X13486569">Campbell (2009)</xref> distinguished between studying improvisation and “improvising to learn music:”<disp-quote>
<p>when the act of improvisation is embraced—or adapted, modified and reshaped—by educators at various levels and contexts, from preschool to post graduate studies in music. Improvising to learn music means incorporating improvisation within the musical education and training, in settings where Western European art music and Western European-based pedagogical systems reign supreme. In these venues, improvisation is a means to an end, the outcome of which is the development of musicians with a more comprehensive sense of music. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1321103X13486569">Campbell, 2009</xref>, p. 120)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Angelica embraced improvisation in this manner. She described a definitive epiphany moment in her personal narrative in which she “swore off” classical music while at conservatory, jettisoning previous knowledge and values for opportunities to improvise (Interview 2).</p>
<p>Angelica began teaching music through improvisation after years of personal metamorphosis informed by deeply held convictions and particularized worldviews. Upon arriving at Auckland, Angelica’s eclectic experiences coalesced, almost instantaneously. She became, in the words of student teacher Lorraine, “an individual by choice” (Interview, 11 November, 2009). Angelica understood the implications of being “an individual by choice:”<disp-quote>
<p>I arrived at Auckland thinking, I am going to have to be a good communicator, let people know what I’m doing, or I’m going to get resistance. I’ll probably get resistance anyway but I can minimize it, address it early on, maybe put people at ease. (Interview 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Consequently, Angelica engaged the school music community, “the world around” her, in ongoing dialogs about her teaching, her curricula, and the value of improvisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1321103X13486569">Schwandt, 2007</xref>, p. 156).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1321103X13486569">
<title>Intentionality</title>
<p>Angelica exhibited marked “intentionality” in her statements, actions, and in the engagement of the Auckland community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1321103X13486569">Jacob, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1321103X13486569">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1321103X13486569">Schwandt, 2007</xref>). Intentionality springs from the nexus of inner mental processes and outward engagement of the world. It guides “motivated actors” as they relate to the contexts surrounding them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1321103X13486569">Tilly, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1321103X13486569">Jacob (2008)</xref> explained:<disp-quote>
<p>Perceptions, beliefs, desires, and intentions and many other “propositional attitudes” are mental states with intentionality. They are about or represent objects and states of affairs under a particular psychological mode or format. Perceptions, beliefs, desires, and intentions illustrate a basic duality of the intentionality of the mental: the duality between mind-to-world and world-to-mind directions of fit. (Section 10, para. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Purposeful expressions resulted from dialogic relationships between Angelica and her environs. Such expressions illuminated Angelica’s dispositions to or “state[s] of engagement with the world around” her (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1321103X13486569">Schwandt, 2007</xref>, p. 156).</p>
<p>Ongoing “mind-to-world and world-to-mind directions of fit” augmented Angelica’s personal beliefs and intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1321103X13486569">Jacob, 2008</xref>, Section 10, para. 1). A unifying theme, that improvisation is essential to music education, informed Angelica’s ways of engaging colleagues, supervisors, administrators, and the Auckland community.</p>
<p>In discussing challenges posed by teaching improvisation at Auckland, Angelica frequently made statements reflecting her conviction “to teach, the way I want to. The way I believe is right” (Interview 2). From the first weeks at Auckland, Angelica knew:<disp-quote>
<p>I would have to hold my ground, not in a combative way but I knew I couldn’t be shaken by other teachers asking me, “you’re playing what?” I realized that if I came across as insecure in what I do, or if it seemed like I was unsure about how, when, and where kids should improvise, my colleagues would be insecure too. In fact, the kids would be, parents would be, the whole of Auckland really. So it was like, if I didn’t believe, forcefully and make that known, I didn’t stand a chance. (Interview 1)</p>

<title>Practical challenges</title>
<sec id="section15-1321103X13486569">
<title>Teaching in a small, under-resourced rural district</title>
<p>In 2009, the greater Auckland area ranked among the poorest in New York. The State Education Department identified Auckland as a “High Needs” district (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1321103X13486569">New York State Education Department, 2009</xref>). Consequently, with few exceptions, funding for anything beyond necessary expenditures remained scarce.</p>
<p>Teaching improvisation, particularly rock improvisation, required Angelica to purchase new instruments. She lamented, “there’s basically no money for anything other than, you know, science, math, and sports” (Interview 2). More than scarcity, Angelica believed the spending priorities reflected an implicit assumption that the types of music emphasized in her teaching “are not really academically important” (Interview 2).</p>
<p>Angelica’s quest for funding complicated her relationship with the school community. The negligible budget prompted her to consider alternative sources such as local, state, and national granting agencies. To work around restrictions preventing direct grants to public schools, Angelica applied for grants on behalf of the Auckland Music and Arts Collective, the community youth group she founded. Angelica listed Auckland Unified as an agency willing to host AMAC programs; “I saw potential for symbiosis, AMAC and Auckland [are] parts of the same thing, why not find a way to make them work together” (Interview 3).</p>
<p>Angelica’s efforts yielded nearly $12,000. She used the proceeds to purchase equipment and to fund AMAC’s initiatives for 3 years, including the afterschool lessons program, the summer camp, and a series of community music programs. As “host site,” Auckland Unified benefited. The school hosted the afterschool program, which served primarily Auckland students at no cost to the district. Auckland teachers regularly made use of AMAC’s instruments and public address system.</p>
<p>The Auckland administration, though delighted by the success of Angelica’s efforts, viewed the grants as “an administratively gray area” (School administrator, personal communication, 8 October 2009). Concerned with legal and fiscal entanglements that might result from comingling school and AMAC monies, the administration required Angelica to methodically separate the two. At one point, the afterschool program, entirely AMAC-funded, came under scrutiny. Ultimately, the school board worked out an agreement ensuring that the program could continue and AMAC’s equipment remained available to the Auckland faculty.</p>
<p>Fiscally disassociating AMAC from Auckland reinforced a lingering impression within the school community that the organization “was my personal interest. It didn’t have anything to do with the school” (Interview 2). Angelica understood the administration’s rationale for separating the two but struggled with “fitting into an institutional framework” (Interview 2).</p>
<p>In addition to competing for budget, Angelica found herself competing for limited student access. In one particularly contentious episode, Angelica coordinated the music calendar in conjunction with the Athletic Department. Unfortunately, the negotiated calendar provided no provisions for games called due to inclement weather. The volatile mountain climate decimated the year’s athletic schedule, prompting rescheduling and considerable controversy.</p>
<p>When the Auckland coaching staff rescheduled games, they failed to account for students participating in both sports and music. Otherwise reliable students began missing rehearsals and the afterschool program. According to Angelica, the coaching staff gave the students an untenable choice, “go to the rescheduled practices and games or go to music and run laps” (Interview 2). Angelica staged a protest:<disp-quote>
<p>I went to the athletic field with a sign saying, “coaches support corporal punishment.” I called the coaches out. I told them, and the administration, it’s like corporal punishment. I felt they were coercing students to go to rescheduled games as opposed to music obligations that were already on the calendar, already scheduled, and agreed to. (Interview 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Pervasive perceptions about Angelica’s pedagogical approach, particularly her reliance on improvisation seemed to compound such conflicts, as explored in the following section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1321103X13486569">
<title>Conflicts with tradition</title>
<p>The unorthodox nature of Angelica’s training, curricular materials, and teaching methodologies often confounded the expectations of colleagues, parents, students, and administrators. After observing her teaching, administrators sometimes responded with confusion or expressed concern about the “controlled chaos” caused by free improvisation (Observation, 28 September 2009; Interview with Lorraine). Some expressed trepidation that students were simply “playing” rather than learning. At least one administrator suggested the cacophony of jam sessions might be symptomatic of poor classroom management.</p>
<p>Angelica confronted similar misconceptions prevalent among the regular classroom teachers. Some colleagues misconstrued the “controlled cacophony” of free improvisation with “pastimes” or “diversions” (Observation, 28 September 2009). Such misconceptions resulted in the most pressing challenge Angelica faced, “the belittlement of what I’m trying to do” (Interview 2). Even Angelica’s most ardent supporters sometimes felt perplexed by her methods or viewed her as one to buck the system. Comments from a member of the school board typified such reactions, “Angelica, well she’s an artist is what she is, a bit of a maverick, but good for the kids of Auckland” (Board member, personal communication, 23 October 2009).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1321103X13486569">Allsup (2008)</xref> noted, “to outside observers, music teachers who apply informal processes in informal settings may appear to be doing very little” (p. 4). A colleague escorting children back to regular classrooms commented, “it’s time to return to learning mode now that music class is over” (Observation, 28 September 2009). Another declared, “enough fun, now we have to get back to work” (Observation, 28 September 2009). For Angelica, such comments reflected insidious misconceptions that “kids don’t learn anything in music. They just play, just make it up as they go along” (Interview 2).</p>
<p>Auckland offered fairly traditional school music programs prior to Angelica’s arrival. Improvisation and musics such as rock, pop, hip hop, and the blues were new to the school’s culture. At times, Angelica “will be playing rock or hip hop and people will come in and ask, ‘Why are you playing that?’” (Interview 2). Similar cultural and aesthetic clashes commonly occurred.</p>
<p>Angelica’s middle school general music students spent a week studying the music of Frank Zappa. Angelica posted images of Zappa around the school. The posters generated controversy:<disp-quote>
<p>I had pictures of Frank Zappa all over the school. You know, the picture with him twisting his moustache and smiling? I came into school and noticed people kept ripping down the posters. At first, I thought it might be kids but then the kids were upset by it. The superintendent came to me laughing. Scuttlebutt had gotten back to her office that some teachers thought I put up posters of Zappa smoking a joint … it comes down to a combination of things. You know, part of it is their judgment call on what they think I should and should not be teaching. Part of it is a cultural thing. Like, if I would have done the same thing in a more progressive community or a city school, it probably would have been embraced, you know, “oh wow, that’s so cool, Zappa.” (Interview 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ron Frommer, the high school band director and Angelica’s lone music colleague, supported her in the wake of the Zappa affair. In the past, however, Ron had also raised questions about Angelica’s pedagogy.</p>
<p>At times, Ron, with the support of a least one administrator, questioned how well Angelica’s teaching prepared students for his band program. Lorraine, Angelica’s student teacher, recalled:<disp-quote>
<p>I know there have been some deep concerns about the actual music foundation of her program, even from Ron. Maybe because she has a nontraditional background and didn’t have methods classes, there are questions about how much music kids actually learn and whether or not they can read music. (Interview, 11 November, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such concerns stem from Angelica’s emphasis on aural experience as much as from her nontraditional background. Angelica regularly told students:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s important to learn how to read music, but at the same time, you do not have to know how to read music in order to play music. Some of the greatest improvising rock, blues, and jazz musicians couldn’t read a note. (Interview 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Angelica feared the emphasis on aural experience in her classroom put her at odds with colleagues and “the stuff New York State says I have to teach” (Interview 2). At times, Angelica’s own insecurities echoed the concerns of Ron and the administration:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s hard because I do have these two backgrounds. On the one hand, I have my training from music school and from the Army—very traditional. On the other, I have all this experience improvising … Sometimes I feel a bit insecure. I worry, am I doing enough to support Ron? Am I doing enough to balance playing by ear and learning to read? (Interview 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Angelica felt implicit pressure to justify her methods. “It’s been very difficult to not get caught in their concept that the kids have to read notes, because that’s really the pressure I get from colleagues, kids, and from the administration” (Interview 2).</p>

<title>Discussion and implications</title>
<p>Despite recognition by many that improvisation is an essential part of music learning, improvisation-based programs like Angelica’s remain exceedingly rare in the United States. They exist as isolated outposts in a larger sea of product-focused music education practices. Classrooms that feature improvisatory learning, and the teachers who develop them, are vulnerable to challenges posed by being exceptional; by standing apart from the “traditional music education path” everyone around them follows (Interview with Angelica’s teaching colleague, 10 November, 2009). Despite extraordinary efforts to “massage the process” and foster institutional, administrative, and community support, Angelica Dawson remained somewhat isolated from her district and from other music teachers in New York (Interview with Angelica’s teaching colleague, 10 November, 2009).</p>
<p>Colleagues teaching different curricula, with more widely practiced approaches, surrounded Angelica. She had to regularly account for and adapt to byproducts of the more traditional music education practices of peers. Angelica expressed frustrations about “starting from scratch” acclimating students transferring in from other districts where they experienced more traditional instruction. One transfer student explained, “I didn’t like it when I came here. I thought it was really stupid, I kind of thought it was weird that we had to improvise and make stuff up” (Interview, Tobin, 15 December, 2009). In the most trying instances, new students rebelled, wondering aloud, “what do we have to do this for? It’s weird” (Interview, Thomas, 15 December, 2009). Some refused to participate altogether. Conversely, Angelica had to prepare students for middle and high school music programs reliant on notated musical traditions and comprised of large ensembles such as concert bands, orchestras, and instrumental and vocal jazz ensembles. Her middle and high school colleagues expected students to arrive “prepared for the school band program” (Interview 2).</p>
<p>The sense of isolation extended beyond Auckland. Lorraine, Angelica’s student teacher, recalled being “warned” by one of her music education professors, “to expect the unexpected” (Interview, 28 September 2009). Angelica remains “notorious” among members of the local school music association (Association member, personal communication, 19 April 2009.)</p>
<p>Although Angelica represents one exceptional case, her experiences epitomized those of others in the larger study from which this article was derived. Angelica had to work mightily to counter pervasive “culture-based assumptions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1321103X13486569">Lewis, 2000</xref>, p. 97) about teaching, learning, and music engrained in students, parents, colleagues, administrators, and the community of Auckland, New York.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1321103X13486569">Hebert (2009)</xref> noted “an array of political factors currently stands in the way of those who would teach music for the purpose of musically empowering their students” (p. 40). Teachers like Angelica empower their students in ways that ultimately challenge the sanctity of established product-focused practices. Product-focused educational approaches, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1321103X13486569">Regelski (2002)</xref> noted, deny “the subjective, interpretative, intentional aspects of human agency” (p. 108). Transformative improvisational teaching approaches, like those employed by Angelica, are dependent on such things.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1321103X13486569">Kanellopoulos (2007)</xref> noted the role played by teachers, “in the creation of an interpretative community where children’s thoughts are taken seriously” (p. 124). The challenges Angelica faced regularly inhibited her efforts to create such community. As long as the factors that inhibited Angelica remain prevalent, teachers with the capacity to “get the spirit out” might simply get out of teaching altogether, never get in to start with, or worse. In the year after this study, the Superintendent at Auckland Unified retired. Within a month of arriving at Auckland, the new Superintendant released Angelica from her contract indicating that he could not, “for the life of me, figure out where Angelica’s teaching fit in with New York State or National Standards” (Personal communication, 14 September 2011).</p>
<p>In the wake of Auckland, Angelica relocated to a nearby community. Circumventing institutionalized schooling, she started the fledgling “Community Music Education Center” (CMEC). CMEC, too far away for Auckland area students to participate, offers programs like those Angelica started at Auckland Unified, private lessons, afterschool music programs, and a summer rock music camp. Free from institutional constraints, Angelica gets the spirit out for those fortunate enough to learn about and participate in CMEC programs.</p>
