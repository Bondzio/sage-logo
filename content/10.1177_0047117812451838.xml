<abstract>
<p>Pre-publicity for the final volume of Harold Macmillan’s memoirs, <italic>At the End of the Day</italic>, stressed that it would provide the British side of the Cuban missile crisis for the first time. The Churchillian model chosen, changes required by the Cabinet Office and Macmillan’s desire to rebuke those political opponents who claimed that the crisis demonstrated a lack of British influence in Washington, however ensured a focus on his personal relationship with President Kennedy. His larding the text with contemporary observations from his diaries also skewed Macmillan’s account and, in particular, underplayed the significance of British moves at the United Nations in New York to secure a credible United Nations inspection regime and a US guarantee of the inviolability of Cuba. Careful reconstruction of Macmillan’s real-time experience of the Cuban missile crisis demonstrates the limitations of his own account of this event.</p>

<p>In October 1962, Harold Macmillan had been Prime Minister for nearly six years. His account of those momentous days appeared almost 11 years later when <italic>At the End of the Day</italic>, the sixth and final volume of his memoirs covering the period from 1961 to 1963 was published on 26 September 1973 in Britain and on 9 January 1974 in the United States. By this time, Macmillan, 68 at the time of the Cuban missile crisis, was nearing his 80th birthday. Although the physical infirmities of age were exacerbated by his Great War wounds, he nevertheless remained mentally robust. Indeed, by turns with his son Maurice, he continued to chair the family publishing firm that also published his memoirs until 1980.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0047117812451838">1</xref></sup> This might help to explain how the autobiography of ‘Mr Harold’ eventually ran to 3763 pages and some 1.5 million words.</p>
<p>Macmillan was active in the publishing business before he was first elected to Parliament in 1924. However, unlike his elder brother Daniel, a political career was always his priority. Publishing was a sideline undertaken when on the backbenches or out of Parliament and certainly something he had little time for during his long continuous stint in Cabinet from the return of the Tories to government on 26 October 1951 to his health-induced resignation as Prime Minister on 18 October 1963. Nevertheless, he was pleased to be one of the few in Cabinet who had practical experience in business<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0047117812451838">2</xref></sup> and always knew that he would return to publishing when his political career was over. He attended his first Board meeting on 31 October 1963 and had, by the end of that year, assumed the company chairmanship.</p>
<p>Physical recovery, however, was not swift. It was not until the New Year that he felt well enough to set about addressing the managerial and financial problems inherited from Daniel’s long and idiosyncratic reign as chairman.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0047117812451838">3</xref></sup> On 12 January 1964, he noted in his diary:<disp-quote>
<p>The truth is that I am still in a kind of daze – like a man who has had concussion. I can just manage to concentrate on a limited range of problems (e.g. those of M&amp;Co) but all the flexibility and resilience of my mind (wh. I think was considerable) has gone. However, I suppose this is the result partly of the operation but partly (and perh[aps] principally) of 10 years and more of tremendous work at tremendous pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0047117812451838">4</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The first brief mention of the memoirs project in Macmillan’s diary was not until a month later, when he discussed the idea with one of Churchill’s former research assistants, Bill Deakin of St Antony’s College, Oxford.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0047117812451838">5</xref></sup> Exhaustion and publishing demands were not the only reasons for avoiding haste in such matters. Macmillan was acutely conscious of the damage done to the efforts of his successor, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, to secure a Conservative re-election that year by the rush into print in early 1964 of disgruntled former ministers, Iain Macleod and Lord Kilmuir.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0047117812451838">6</xref></sup> Of Kilmuir, whom Macmillan had sacked in the massive Cabinet reshuffle of July 1962 (christened the ‘Night of the Long Knives’), he observed: ‘The fact that he criticised <italic>all</italic> his colleagues so freely and so soon (there is a decent interval to be observed in memoirs of this kind) has angered the Party’. He went on to note: ‘What makes it so sad is that I am told he sold the rights of his book (or at least the serial rights) for a very modest sum – £2000 or so – hardly enough to justify such a breach of decorum’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0047117812451838">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Macmillan’s serialisation agreement was signed with the same newspaper, the <italic>Sunday Times</italic>, but was far more lucrative. A book trust had been established as the owner of Macmillan’s literary estate, and it contracted with the Thomson Organisation a fee of £360,000, ‘of which £34,000 is to be paid to me in 4 annual instalments to write the book and pay the assistants etc’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0047117812451838">8</xref></sup> Thomson in turn contracted the American rights with Harper and Row. By then, Douglas-Home had narrowly lost the October 1964 elections and Harold Wilson’s Labour Party had taken charge: it was now safe for Macmillan to produce his memoirs.</p>
<p>He had already started work on them, significantly choosing 4 August 1964, the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War, to do so. He later noted, ‘What I set out to try to do was to write the history of what I call the revolution of fifty years’. In this, he consciously aped Churchill’s technique, borrowed from Daniel Defoe’s <italic>Memoirs of a Cavalier</italic>, of a chronicle of events linked by his own role as witness or participant; an approach ‘suited to somebody who cannot aspire to be a historian but who is striving to describe and communicate through one’s own experiences the[se] events’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0047117812451838">9</xref></sup>Macmillan also aped Churchill’s tendency to pack his pages with contemporary documents, including in his case liberal quotation from his own diaries. He went through the manuscript diaries selecting around 50 per cent of the total for this purpose. This seems to have reflected Macmillan’s own preferences in historical writing: shortly before the Cuban crisis broke, he noted, ‘I much prefer the sources of history to the facile comments of clever young men. From letters, memoranda and other documents you can form your own judgement’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0047117812451838">10</xref></sup> The view that his work was this type of history rather than a memoir was certainly held by his publishing director, while press notices observed that these many words revealed little of their author.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0047117812451838">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Macmillan set out with some trepidation on his task, commenting ‘I am beginning to be rather concerned as to whether I can do this or shall have to fall back (like Eden) on allowing someone else … to write it for me’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0047117812451838">12</xref></sup> David Dilks, who had been Anthony Eden’s ghost-writer, provided advice initially. On visiting Macmillan’s Sussex home, Birch Grove, Dilks was apparently ‘impressed by the size of the collection [of Macmillan’s papers] and the good arrangement’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0047117812451838">13</xref></sup> Macmillan had taken care to again copy Churchill, in this case by taking away duplicates of all possible documents for his private archive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0047117812451838">14</xref></sup> These and related background reading were sorted for him by Anne Glynn-Jones into subjects corresponding to the thematic chapters through which he structured the volumes. Macmillan then dictated to two secretaries who created a rough draft to be amended.</p>
<p>By the start of September 1964, he had completed some 35,000 to 40,000 words as a sketch of the entirety. At that stage, only three volumes, as with Eden’s memoirs, seem to have been contemplated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0047117812451838">15</xref></sup> Macmillan noted of the process:<disp-quote>
<p>I have been reading all sorts of books of reminiscences … I cull a few points, here and there, for my own book. I have now finished the synopsis of the 50 years – 1914–64 … It is hard to see how this enterprise is going to succeed. I feel rather frightened about it sometimes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0047117812451838">16</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However frightening, it was at least an opportunity to indulge Macmillan’s favourite habit of reading. Trained by publishing, he was both a voluminous and reflective reader, usually noting his views in pithy comments in his diaries. Sometimes he would use these comments to assess issues he was currently dealing with. Interestingly, not least in light of his attitudes towards the Cuban missile crisis, what emerges from analysis of his reading is a stress on the interplay between character and circumstance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0047117812451838">17</xref></sup> Occasionally, he would also deliberately read on subjects relevant to his present dilemmas: thus, he read up about the 1846 split in the Conservative Party when seemingly risking something similar over Europe in September 1962.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0047117812451838">18</xref></sup> This, however, did not happen the following month. Instead, he spent part of Sunday 21 October 1962 reading an old life of the Young Pretender<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0047117812451838">19</xref></sup> he had found in the library at Chequers before a message arrived from President Kennedy at 10.00 p.m. that evening warning of the developing stand-off over Cuba. This was his first reference to this emergency in his diaries, though in <italic>At the End of the Day</italic> he refers obliquely to the guarded warnings given to British intelligence officials in Washington two days earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0047117812451838">20</xref></sup> Thereafter, the pressure of the crisis that ensued was such that even Macmillan was unable to keep up his reading, though the one work he did finish during this time – Sir James Mackintosh’s writing on the ‘Glorious’ Revolution – saw him continuing to read about the problems of the Stuarts rather than the present.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0047117812451838">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Macmillan does not seem to have been reading much else during the crisis itself. One striking aspect of the PREM11 files (held at the National Archives at Kew in London) is the hiatus that occurs in many areas of business from 22 October 1962 to the formal end of the crisis on 28 October 1962 and thereafter. This was despite the distractions that nevertheless found their way into the Prime Ministerial diaries: the unemployment figures, difficulties in the European entry negotiations which Macmillan presciently anticipated presaged ‘a let down’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0047117812451838">22</xref></sup> the Indo-Chinese war and the implications of the coup in Yemen on 27 September 1962. It was not until Monday 5 November that correspondence began significantly to accumulate again in the files.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0047117812451838">23</xref></sup> Perhaps, this was the result of the nervous energy expended on the crisis itself, Macmillan noting on Sunday 28 October: <italic>‘</italic>I am writing this in a state of exhaustion, after being up all Friday and Saturday nights – to about 4am. (The difference of hours in America and England is the cause)’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0047117812451838">24</xref></sup> There were to be no further diary entries in the following week until on Sunday 4 November he took up his pen to scrawl a lengthy first attempt to assess the recent crisis.</p>
<p>Macmillan accordingly wrote down his thoughts on the Cuban Missile Crisis three times: contemporaneously, on 4 November 1962, and in the account that more or less completely reproduced those initial thoughts in the chapter ‘On the Brink’ in <italic>At the End of the Day</italic> 10 years later. There was also a fourth iteration: it became the pattern for these volumes for BBC1 to broadcast on the day of each publication an hour-long interview with Macmillan conducted by the Canadian psephologist R. T. McKenzie. Transcripts of these were then published in <italic>The Listener</italic>. With this final volume, however, the BBC decided that they had so much good material that they needed to do two programmes, one looking at policy issues such as Cuba broadcast on 19 September 1973, and the other covering security and scandal matters transmitted on the day of publication.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0047117812451838">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Cuban crisis did not come to Macmillan out of a clear blue sky. In June 1960, he noted that the Castro regime that seized power in Cuba the previous year was ‘confiscating all the American properties and threatening to seize the oil refineries … The Americans are pained and uncertain. (what a pity they never understood “Colonialism” and “Imperialism” till too late!)’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0047117812451838">26</xref></sup> Cuba, however, hardly seems to have featured in his first talks with President Kennedy in April 1961 just a couple of weeks before the Bay of Pigs fiasco.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0047117812451838">27</xref></sup> Macmillan had been aware of the planning for this under Eisenhower and discussed the idea with Kennedy,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0047117812451838">28</xref></sup> but does not seem to have considered it likely to succeed. Nor were the British very inclined to share the Administration’s anxiety to lance the Cuban boil. One of Macmillan’s constant refrains was the need for trade expansion, not least as a means of tying in countries to the West. The embargo of all trade with Cuba except medical supplies announced by Kennedy on 3 February 1962 therefore did not win much support in London. They had earlier refused Castro’s request for jet fighters under American pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0047117812451838">29</xref></sup> This new intervention, however, in their view would not change the regime, only counterproductively drive it closer to the Russians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0047117812451838">30</xref></sup> Indeed, it appears that a combination of US trade pressure and military exercises suggesting imminent invasion of Cuba helped, as this view might have predicted, to create the circumstances in which Khrushchev decided to send missiles to Castro in May 1962 .<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0047117812451838">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>The British had not warmed to similar American pressure previously to interdict trade with China.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0047117812451838">32</xref></sup> Sanctions were seen as slow and ineffective. Nor was it good for an economy that, as Macmillan reminded the Secretary of State, Rusk, in June 1962, was much more heavily dependent on trade than that of America. He was therefore apt to react angrily to what he saw as sharp American practice in arms trade, as over the sale of Hawk missiles to Israel in August 1962. Furthermore, Kennedy’s urging of British support for the embargo to Lord Home, the Foreign Secretary, during the latter’s Washington visit in late September 1962, as the President moved towards difficult mid-term elections, met with observations that British shipping interests could only be coerced by new legislation difficult to justify in peacetime. Macmillan concluded therefore in a note to Home on 1 October, ‘there is no reason for us to help the Americans on Cuba’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0047117812451838">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>He was more interested in making progress on reducing Cold War tensions: US Ambassador David Bruce noted, ‘I believe problems of nuclear tests and disarmament have almost become an obsession with PM’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0047117812451838">34</xref></sup> This was for practical reasons – Macmillan told the American journalist Robert Estabrook that the difficulties of creating anti-missile missile defences were a ‘compelling reason to get together with the Russians’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0047117812451838">35</xref></sup> – as well as because of the political need to respond to the rise of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament since 1958 and the support of significant elements within the Labour Party for its unilateralist stance. An important factor in such developments was the growing public concern about nuclear testing. Accordingly, while Macmillan’s diaries for 1962 are full of his efforts to promote a test ban to both the Americans and Russians, Cuba did not trouble the Prime Minister until Kennedy’s fateful message arrived. The brief exception was when Home returned from Washington, prompting Macmillan to reiterate in his diary his objections to a trade embargo. He also noted, ‘The Russians are clearly using <italic>Cuba</italic> as a counter-irritant to <italic>Berlin</italic>’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0047117812451838">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>This suggestion was put to Home by Kennedy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0047117812451838">37</xref></sup> Throughout the crisis, it was invariably Kennedy, rather than Macmillan, who raised Berlin in their telephone conversations. This is despite the fact that Berlin, like nuclear tests, was rarely far from Macmillan’s thoughts from when Khrushchev demanded the withdrawal of allied troops from the city on 10 November 1958. In contrast, that Cuba had a political significance well beyond that of a pawn in the Cold War for his ally does not seem to have been at the forefront of the Prime Minister’s mind in the run-up to the crisis. Nor does Macmillan note at the time or subsequently the growing pressure on Kennedy from senior Republicans, particularly Senator Kenneth Keating, claiming that the Russians were deploying missiles in Cuba,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0047117812451838">38</xref></sup> even though he hints in <italic>At the End of the Day</italic> that British intelligence was also suggesting a build-up there.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0047117812451838">39</xref></sup> This claim was publicly denied by Kennedy on 4 September 1962, but was confirmed by Dutch and French intelligence by the time the missiles arrived mid-month.</p>
<p>From August, Kennedy began to receive daily intelligence reports on Cuba. Conclusive proof both of missiles and Ilyushin (IL)-28 bombers being assembled was provided by a U2 over-flight on 14 October and presented to the President in Washington at 8.45 a.m. on 16 October.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0047117812451838">40</xref></sup> Neither the British ambassador to Washington, David Ormsby-Gore, nor the American ambassador to London, Bruce, was told of this until 21 October,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0047117812451838">41</xref></sup> before Macmillan, as Kennedy’s hastily convened Executive Committee (ExComm) debated what to do.</p>
<p>Apparently, one reason why Kennedy decided initially not to consult the British about military action was because he felt ‘They’ll just object’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0047117812451838">42</xref></sup> Nevertheless, Macmillan’s initial reaction on 22 October was very similar to Kennedy’s own a week earlier, arguing that the President ought ‘to seize Cuba and have done with it’. This was not least because he was doubtful both about a blockade’s legality and it speedily achieving its objectives; in which case Kennedy might find that ‘he may <italic>never</italic> get rid of Cuban rockets except by trading them for Turkish, Italian or other bases’. Indeed, early in his first telephone call of the crisis with Kennedy at 12.30 a.m. (London time) on 23 October he asked, ‘What are you going to do with the blockade? Are you going to occupy Cuba and have done with it or is it going to just drag on?’ Kennedy, however, did not want to pursue that option because it ‘invites him so directly into Berlin’. Furthermore, such action would require seven days to mobilise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0047117812451838">43</xref></sup> What it did not require was a similar build-up of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces; Macmillan therefore responded to hints from Washington of the need for heightened alert levels by telling General Norstad – the retiring Supreme Allied Commander, Europe – at a dinner in Norstad’s honour that evening ‘that “mobilisation” had sometimes caused war. Here it was absurd, since the additional forces made available by “Alert” had <italic>no</italic> military significance’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0047117812451838">44</xref></sup> Norstad agreed, assuring Macmillan the following day that these representations had been successful with Washington. Apart from noting ‘certain precautions affecting the Royal Air Force’ – an oblique way of referring to the 15-minute readiness introduced for Britain’s V-Force bombers armed with nuclear warheads at the height of the crisis on 27 October, a state of alert that persisted until 5 November – Macmillan had nothing further to say on the subject in ‘On the Brink’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0047117812451838">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>Part of Macmillan’s concern for speedy action seemingly was that otherwise demand for a peace conference could grow, fed by European public opinion sceptical about being brought to the brink of nuclear war over the Americans now having to live, as they themselves had long done, under the Russian nuclear shadow.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0047117812451838">46</xref></sup> Such calls for a conference were also later issued by Commonwealth figures such as President Nkrumah of Ghana and his friends in the non-aligned movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0047117812451838">47</xref></sup> The risk that Acting UN Secretary-General, U Thant’s, appeal for mutual restraint would exacerbate the problems of managing febrile world opinion may also explain why Macmillan described this as a ‘very dangerous message’ to Kennedy in conversation on 24 October,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0047117812451838">48</xref></sup> also commenting in his diary, ‘Now that [the] Russians have been proved blatant liars, no <italic>unpoliced</italic> agreement with them is possible’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0047117812451838">49</xref></sup> A conference, which as he noted to Ormsby-Gore on 22 October would also be an opportunity for the Russians to broach issues like Berlin,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0047117812451838">50</xref></sup> was therefore full of risk. As he told Kennedy in the conversation of 22 October, ‘If we are forced to a conference all the cards are in this man’s hands’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0047117812451838">51</xref></sup> Indeed, Macmillan’s notes in preparation for this conversation include the observation: ‘If you aim at a conference would it not be better to have a fait accompli first?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0047117812451838">52</xref></sup> His Foreign Secretary, however, was more sanguine about the benefits of a conference. On 24 October, Home raised with Ormsby-Gore the possibility that a general conference on disarmament, with Cuba as a preliminary, might be a way forward, and certainly preferable to a bases swop, with all that entailed for Berlin. The ambassador, however, decided not to raise this with the President, instead replying that ‘for the Americans this is a clear challenge by the Soviet Union and … Castro is a mere cypher in the game’. Home’s idea was therefore a non-starter;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0047117812451838">53</xref></sup> thereafter, discussion of a conference dropped from British contributions to the crisis.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on 23 October, there were no further conversations with Kennedy. Macmillan did meet a Labour delegation who asked if he would go to Washington,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0047117812451838">54</xref></sup> as Attlee had done at a similar juncture during the Korean War. Though he raised this possibility with Kennedy the following evening, in his diary the Prime Minister merely noted, ‘They hadn’t much to say’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0047117812451838">55</xref></sup> Nor did his diary entry refer to the related problems of managing the press and public opinion, despite a note from his private secretary, Tim Bligh, warning that lobby correspondents were asking if Britain had been consulted on the developing crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0047117812451838">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>At around 11.30 p.m.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0047117812451838">57</xref></sup> (London time) on 24 October, Macmillan again spoke to Kennedy. Apart from the U Thant proposals and Kennedy’s concern, to make sure that Macmillan had the arguments needed to counter the Opposition in the Commons debate scheduled for the following day,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0047117812451838">58</xref></sup> the main item was a question from Kennedy on whether or not, if work continued on the missiles, ‘Do we then tell them that if they don’t get the missiles out, that we’re going to invade Cuba?’ Notwithstanding his earlier belligerence, Macmillan now asked for time to think about this, though he was glad to hear that US plans for an invasion were continuing. At the time of the conversation, it is not clear whether he was aware that Russian ships were already starting to turn round. By the time he came to write his diary entry for 24 October, presumably at some point the following day, this had been confirmed for him from both British and American intelligence sources. This, and the soft answer Khrushchev gave to U Thant, may have determined how the Prime Minister replied to Kennedy’s question. In his response, sent on 25 October, he concluded that ‘events have gone too far’. Instead, he advised that UN inspection of the sites, to ensure their immobilisation, would remove the threat they posed, without the need for military action.</p>
<p>It is not clear from this document at what time it was despatched, but a hand-written note by Macmillan’s foreign policy private secretary, Philip de Zulueta, suggests that it was at 10.25 a.m. (London time).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0047117812451838">59</xref></sup> Later that day in New York, the American academic and former UN Under-Secretary, Andrew Cordier, put forward proposals for such an inspection regime for both Cuba and Turkey, reported back to London in a telegram from the British ambassador to the United Nations, Sir Patrick Dean, sent at 5.48 p.m. (New York time).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0047117812451838">60</xref></sup> This would have been just before Macmillan and Kennedy spoke at 11.00 p.m. (London time).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0047117812451838">61</xref></sup> It is unlikely that Macmillan would have been apprised of this before then and uncertain whether he was ever aware of it since no copy of this particular Dean telegram appears in the PREM files. Any ideas of an inspection regime were not discussed by the two leaders that evening.</p>
<p>The Americans, however, knew that the Russians were still pushing on apace with the missile bases on Cuba, hence Kennedy’s observation to ExComm the following morning (26 October) – confirmed to Macmillan that evening – that additional action was needed to remove these weapons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0047117812451838">62</xref></sup> This left the options of negotiating away or forcibly removing them. The latter option was put to the British, French and West German ambassadors in Washington that evening. At the same meeting, the ambassadors were told of the American estimation that the Russians had intended a showdown over Berlin on completion of the Cuban bases, to coincide with Khrushchev’s upcoming visit to the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0047117812451838">63</xref></sup> That, of course, depended on completion without detection, no longer a possibility. Khrushchev also plainly failed to consult his ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Dobrynin, either about the missile deployment or the likely American reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0047117812451838">64</xref></sup> Towards the end of the crisis, Britain’s ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Frank Roberts, acutely recalled ‘Khrushchev’s well-known proclivity for setting out courses of action without knowing where they could lead him, coupled with his undoubted talent for making the best of the resulting situation’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0047117812451838">65</xref></sup> Whether his improvisation on 26 October turned out best for him is another matter. Khrushchev suggested to Kennedy the possibility of dismantling the missiles in Cuba, first in return for a guarantee that Cuba would not be invaded, tightened in a second message (on 27 October) by linkage with the <italic>quid pro quo</italic> of American withdrawal of the 15 Jupiter Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBMs) installed in Turkey in 1961.</p>
<p>Neither Macmillan nor Kennedy was aware of this when they spoke that evening at 11.15 p.m. (London time),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0047117812451838">66</xref></sup> though the latter mentioned some unofficial hints along similar lines from Russian officials. This was, however, sufficient to pique the Prime Minister’s interest in an analogy with pre-1914 Belgian neutrality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0047117812451838">67</xref></sup> He then returned to the idea of U Thant leading a team to ‘ensure that these missiles were made inoperable during the period of any conference or discussion’, before dropping into the conversation about his own swop proposal, the immobilisation of the 60 Thor IRBMs deployed in Britain in 1958–1959.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0047117812451838">68</xref></sup> This would have been a significant gesture as normally 65 per cent of this force (39 missiles) was on 30 minutes readiness. Indeed, at 11.00 a.m. on 27 October (London time), the Prime Minister agreed a move to Alert Condition 3 for Bomber Command, which meant that 59 of the Thors were at 15 minutes readiness, remaining so until 5 November.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0047117812451838">69</xref></sup> None of this, however, was mentioned at the time in Macmillan’s diary, or subsequently in <italic>At the End of the Day</italic>. Nor was the fact that, despite the President’s non-committal response, particularly to the Thor swop, these three schemes were then reiterated in a message to Kennedy in the early hours of 27 October (London time).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0047117812451838">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are, indeed, no diary entries at all for Saturday 27 October. Macmillan and Home had cancelled all their weekend engagements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0047117812451838">71</xref></sup> From the diary of Macmillan’s press secretary, Harold Evans, it is clear that the day was spent in great anxiety that Kennedy might have decided that there was no other way and ‘was hell-bent on destroying the missile sites. This carried the strong possibility of Soviet retaliation in Berlin or elsewhere, with the prospect of escalation into nuclear war’. In these circumstances, Macmillan ‘felt he must intervene’ in ways that would achieve the immobilisation of the weapons without resort to US military action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0047117812451838">72</xref></sup> These anxieties would not have been assuaged by Ormsby-Gore’s telegram received at 4.00 a.m. that morning. Reporting the meeting with Rusk and his fellow ambassadors from France and West Germany the previous evening (Washington time), he noted that the Secretary of State, ‘When asked what further action the United States might take if they failed to obtain a satisfactory outcome in the talks with U Thant, he indicated that they would have to consider destroying the sites by bombing’. At least, Rusk confirmed that the three principal European allies would be consulted before any such eventuality occurred.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0047117812451838">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now began the tensest phase of the crisis, on 27 October. ExComm began to meet that day at around 10.00 a.m. (Washington time), by which time it was already 3.00 p.m. in London. For Macmillan, much of the day had passed. It is therefore difficult to endorse the claim of scholars such as May and Zelikow that both Macmillan and Ormsby-Gore became <italic>de facto</italic> members of ExComm for the duration of the crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0047117812451838">74</xref></sup> The fact that the former was not physically present, sometimes only received limited reports on what was transpiring in Washington from Ormsby-Gore and often had to wait for hours for detailed telegrams to come through necessarily limited Macmillan’s direct knowledge of events across the Atlantic. One example is the news of the shooting down of the US U2 surveillance aeroplane over Cuba, which very much exercised ExComm that afternoon and apparently helped to decide Khrushchev that a climb down was required.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0047117812451838">75</xref></sup> A telegram from the British embassy in Cuba bearing this news did not arrive until 6.38 a.m. on 28 October, having seemingly been nine hours in transmission.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0047117812451838">76</xref></sup> Another example is that, in the ExComm discussions earlier that day, the text arrived of Khrushchev’s latest message to Kennedy. In contrast, the copy of this broadcast message in the Prime Minister’s files is from the news agency Reuters. In ExComm, this message was regarded as further moving the goalposts, by linking not only removal of weapons from Cuba with analogous weapons in Turkey, but also agreement about the inviolability of both countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0047117812451838">77</xref></sup> From the hand-written notes by Home on the British copy of the message, Khrushchev’s latest communication appears to also have caused alarm, but in a somewhat different manner. The build-up, he observed, goes on – a point made by Kennedy in his noon (Washington time) broadcast – while the United States had rejected the Turkey linkage. Home’s comments ended, ‘Still trying to keep it to this hemisphere’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0047117812451838">78</xref></sup> This kind of language no doubt reflected British attempts to respond to American sensitivities, tutored by the 1823 Monroe doctrine, about outside interference in their part of the world.</p>
<p>From the file, it is not clear at what point in the day Home made these notes. However, it is apparent from the despatch Home sent to Dean at 3.00 p.m. (London time) that day that various British schemes for UN involvement in immobilisation were indeed designed to keep the issue in the Western hemisphere, avoiding ‘reciprocity in the European area’. Home’s suggestions therefore focused on Cuban inviolability and/or of a nuclear-free zone in Latin America. The reciprocity in the European area that the Thor offer undoubtedly constituted was additional, something to be used ‘if it would make all the difference’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0047117812451838">79</xref></sup> A telegram sent to the Washington embassy at 2.30 p.m. asked that Rusk also be informed of these instructions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0047117812451838">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was not until 8.07 p.m. that Kennedy’s response to Macmillan’s memorandum of their previous evening’s conversation arrived in London. This message is not mentioned in Harold Evans’ diary, but it seems to have been the cause of the anxiety he notes. It gave Kennedy’s reaction to Khrushchev’s broadcast, concluding as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>This morning I authorised a release restating our position that work on the Cuban bases, which is still continuing, must stop before we can consider other proposals.</p>
<p>I do not feel that this country should allow itself to become engaged in negotiations affecting the individual security interests of our NATO allies. Any initiatives in this respect, it seems to me, should appropriately come from Europe.</p>
<p>I would appreciate your views on the current situation as it develops. In the meantime, I continue to believe that we must secure the actual dismantling of the missiles currently in Cuba as the first order of business.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0047117812451838">81</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In his response – which seems to have been despatched an hour or so later following discussions with Home, Rab Butler, Ted Heath, Peter Thorneycroft and the permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office (and former ambassador to the United States) Sir Harold Caccia<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0047117812451838">82</xref></sup> – Macmillan immediately indicated, ‘I am in full agreement with your last two paragraphs’. In particular, the penultimate paragraph seems to have been interpreted as an invitation for an initiative along the lines already broached with the President. The Prime Minister accordingly put forward a draft message to be sent to Khrushchev suggesting a standstill for negotiations during which:</p>
<list id="list1-0047117812451838" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The Soviet Government would agree to the following:<list id="list2-0047117812451838" list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>No further work on the missile sites in Cuba,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>No imports of ballistic missiles into the island, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The existing missiles in Cuba being made inoperable (which can be done without any breach of military security),</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>all these under UN authority.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>At the same time the US Government would agree to the following:<list id="list3-0047117812451838" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Lift the quarantine, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Not take any physical action against Cuba during the standstill.</p>
<p>In a final paragraph, the Thor offer was then reiterated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0047117812451838">83</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Seemingly, it was not until after this point that a telegram from Dean arrived at 9.31 p.m. (London time) indicating U Thant’s response to the British proposals. Dean reported that in the conversation he had with U Thant at 1.00 p.m. (New York time), it was clear that the idea of following in the footsteps of his late predecessor, Dag Hammarskjöld, and actually going into the field to address problems had not occurred to the Acting UN Secretary-General. U Thant, however, considered the idea of leading an inspection team, but treated it as separate from issues such as Turkey or the inviolability of Cuba.</p>
<p>Dean did not pass on to his American counterparts the Thor offer idea.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0047117812451838">84</xref></sup> From his telegram received at 11.22 p.m. (London time), it is not clear whether Ormsby-Gore mentioned this to the President either when he saw him that morning (Washington time). The only part of the British proposals the President appears to have responded to, from this account, is the U Thant mission idea, which Kennedy said ‘could be a useful initiative’, depending on the timing. The rest of Ormsby-Gore’s telegram was taken up with how the Americans were responding to the Khrushchev broadcast and with Kennedy’s thoughts about Turkey. The President’s view was reported as ‘that there was little military value to be attached to the missiles in Turkey’. The issue allegedly was how the Turks would react.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0047117812451838">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Turkish ambassador to the United Nations made the displeasure of his government at this suggestion apparent to his American counterpart, Adlai Stevenson, at a meeting that evening.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0047117812451838">86</xref></sup> However, in fact, the problem was how the Americans should react to Khrushchev’s linkage of Cuba and Turkey; a major theme of the ExComm discussions that day. As the President’s brother, Bobby Kennedy, put it that afternoon, the Soviet offer ‘is very reasonable, and we just turned it down. And people are going to start thinking about the two things: Turkey and the bases in Cuba … and suddenly we drop a bomb on Cuba’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0047117812451838">87</xref></sup> The dilemma, as the President put it a little earlier, was that they were quite happy to discuss Turkey, but they wanted to secure a standstill from Khrushchev first. Kennedy may, by this time, have received Macmillan’s message and picked up the term standstill from there. Attempts to clarify whether this was the case are not helped by the almost total absence on this vital date from their reconstruction of events in Washington by May and Zelikow of communications between the President and Prime Minister. In any case, as Macmillan was in no position to know, those around Kennedy were concentrating on the Turkish issue, rather than any idea of a standstill.</p>
<p>From a military perspective, the issue was largely symbolic. As Robert McNamara, the US Secretary of Defense, pointed out: the Jupiters in Turkey were ‘more obsolete than the Thor missile. The British have recognised the obsolescence of the Thor and have decided to take it out and replace it with other systems’. By this, he meant that the facilities for US Polaris submarines agreed with the Eisenhower Administration at Holy Loch in 1960 as replacement for the phasing-out of the Thors due to start on 1 April 1963. Clearly, as George Ball noted, similar arrangements could be made with the Turks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0047117812451838">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>The problem, as Ball had observed earlier in the discussion, is that once such matters were broached with the Turks they ‘will be all over Western Europe, and our position would have been undermined’. As Kennedy noted, this was made more problematic because the Turkey/Cuba swop had been raised publicly by Khrushchev. His approach to ExComm that day was therefore about how to respond without appearing to cave in, not least to his NATO allies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0047117812451838">89</xref></sup> US ambassadors were therefore told to avoid any Cuba/Turkey linkage. Bruce was certainly under the impression that the Turkey option had been rejected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0047117812451838">90</xref></sup> Furthermore, after much discussion of how this might be approached, ExComm agreed that Thomas Finletter, the US permanent representative, should brief a NATO Council in Paris on Monday 29 October. His briefing notes were passed on to the British government at some time on 28 October. Significantly, they claimed that hopes of a solution were diminished by Khrushchev’s letter of 27 October ‘linking Cuban settlement to withdrawal of NATO Jupiters from Turkey, but we continue to press for solution in Cuban framework alone’. Instead, the build-up of the missile sites continued, and ships were still heading to the quarantine zone. The NATO Council was therefore warned that ‘In these circumstances, the US Government may find it necessary within a short time in its own interest and that of its fellow nations in the Western hemisphere to take whatever military action may be necessary to remove this growing threat to the hemisphere’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0047117812451838">91</xref></sup> The note concluded on the risk of collateral actions against NATO, though the advice the British had received earlier from Roberts in Moscow at 1.59 a.m. (London time) was that this seemed unlikely.</p>
<p>The US message to its allies was therefore that military action, for which a build-up throughout the crisis had been taking place, may be imminent and that missile trades were not on the table. As noted in Ormsby-Gore’s telegram received at 3.38 a.m. (London time) on 28 October, their line on the Thor offer was therefore that ‘this w[oul]d look as though the US w[oul]d be prepared to trade the security of European nations for US security in the Western hemisphere’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0047117812451838">92</xref></sup> A similar line had already been taken by the President’s National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy in a call to Philip de Zulueta at 1.30 a.m. (London time).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0047117812451838">93</xref></sup> They had a further conversation at 4.00 a.m. (London time) in which Bundy conveyed the essence of the Finletter briefing to the British, played down progress at the United Nation and suggested that the Prime Minister’s proposal ‘is not yet right and what we would much rather have is active participation … in the North Atlantic Council’ set for 10.00 a.m. on 28 October (Paris time).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0047117812451838">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>This does not seem to have reassured the Prime Minister much. Nor, at the time, did the President’s public reply to Khrushchev, responding to his offer on Cuba and ignoring Turkey, which was received in London at 1.30 a.m.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0047117812451838">95</xref></sup> Subsequently, in <italic>At the End of the Day</italic>, Macmillan was to credit this with successfully solving the crisis without resort to conflict.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0047117812451838">96</xref></sup> Yet, on that Sunday morning, he clearly remained concerned to avoid such a denouement. Despite the fact that news had arrived from New York at 5.28 a.m. (London time) that Castro had broadly accepted the UN inspection proposals,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0047117812451838">97</xref></sup> a draft message to Kennedy spoke of his concern that U Thant was not getting anywhere. It also stressed a continuing wish to send his message to Khrushchev ‘when it is apparent that he is not giving way and before you are forced by his stubbornness or by the local situation to take drastic action. Can you help me on timing?’ The text as actually transmitted, seemingly at 9.52 a.m. (London time), was rather more anodyne, but still contained the timing question.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0047117812451838">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>In <italic>At the End of the Day</italic>, Macmillan says that he then decided the timing issue for himself in the absence of further communications from an early morning Washington.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0047117812451838">99</xref></sup> There is certainly no evidence of an American response. The message transmitted to Moscow at around noon (and delivered by Roberts at 2.35 p.m. (Moscow time)), however, was rather different from the draft he had sent to Kennedy the previous day. By then, he seems to have seen Dean’s telegram: accordingly, this message to Khrushchev briefly touches on dealing with the missiles in Cuba through the United Nations,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0047117812451838">100</xref></sup> before moving on to responding positively to the Soviet leader’s own olive branch on a nuclear test ban agreement in his message to Kennedy on 27 October.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0047117812451838">101</xref></sup> Evans described this as ‘a mouselike message’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0047117812451838">102</xref></sup> In the absence of American approval of any other message, it however picked up on the one aspect of Khrushchev’s communication that Macmillan, who had long been seeking such a test ban agreement, could legitimately address. Bruce’s view was that it was ‘designed to impress [Khrushchev] with British solidarity on US Cuban policy’. Certainly, there was nothing in it the United States could object to. Macmillan’s main regret, he told Bruce, was that he had not sent in it ‘several hours earlier’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0047117812451838">103</xref></sup> As it was, little time had elapsed when, towards the end of lunch, the message came through that Khrushchev had said to Kennedy ‘that the equipment on Cuba “which you call offensive” would be dismantled packed up and returned to the Soviet Union’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0047117812451838">104</xref></sup> After all the tension, the reaction of Macmillan and Home was, Bruce noted, ‘mildly euphoric. Now, perhaps, a number of people immobilized during this emergency can devote future weekends to depleting the game-birds who are ravaging British agriculture’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0047117812451838">105</xref></sup></p>
<p>There was the potential problem that the British message, not given to the press until 4.15 p.m. (London time), appeared to be sent ‘backing the horse <italic>after</italic> the race’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0047117812451838">106</xref></sup> Nevertheless, this may not have been a bad thing: as Ormsby-Gore pointed out that evening to Rusk in Washington, rather than allowing the Russians to seize the initiative, the West must get in first with their proposals for peace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0047117812451838">107</xref></sup> From Macmillan’s point of view, it certainly gave a fillip to his efforts for a test ban agreement and a reduction in Cold War tensions. It was therefore appropriate that he ended the Cuban chapter of <italic>At the End of the Day</italic> with a quote from a letter he received from the Russian leader on 27 November 1962: ‘I fully share your view, as well as that of President Kennedy, that the Cuban crisis has led to a better understanding of the need for a prompt settlement of acute international problems’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0047117812451838">108</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the time Macmillan wrote up this chapter in 1972, both Khrushchev and Kennedy were dead. Khrushchev published some expurgated memoirs in 1971, the year of his death. However, the untimely death of John Kennedy in 1963 ensured that the other Western principal in the crisis had not published memoirs. There was at the time, only Robert Kennedy’s posthumously published account, ghost-written for him by Theodore Sorensen,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0047117812451838">109</xref></sup> to which Macmillan obliquely refers briefly in his own book.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0047117812451838">110</xref></sup></p>
<p>Macmillan had some trouble settling on a title for this final volume covering 1961–1963. Initially, he suggested ‘The Grand Design’, a phrase he had repeatedly used to title policy documents since the 1920s. However, he noted, ‘since most of my plans failed it might seem rather ridiculous’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-0047117812451838">111</xref></sup> Instead, <italic>At the End of the Day</italic> was chosen to match the reflective nature of the photograph by Lord Snowdon selected for the dust jacket.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-0047117812451838">112</xref></sup></p>
<p>He had even more trouble getting his text past the Cabinet Office. The then Cabinet Secretary, Sir Burke Trend, wrote ‘you have perhaps given yourself rather more of a free rein … than in the earlier volumes’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-0047117812451838">113</xref></sup> There was particular concern about verbatim quotes from classified letters, minutes and transcripts of telephone conversations. This reflected that Macmillan had indeed taken a Churchillian approach to this work. Parts of Churchill’s <italic>The World Crisis</italic> and <italic>The Second World War</italic> rely on such documents for more than 40 per cent of the text.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-0047117812451838">114</xref></sup></p>
<p>Trend asked if these extensive extracts could be paraphrased as ‘it would be particularly embarrassing for us if verbatim quotations from American sources (mainly President Kennedy’s messages) were published in this country’. A total of 44 changes were suggested by the Cabinet Office,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-0047117812451838">115</xref></sup> 17 of these relating to ‘On the Brink’. One was merely a correction to Macmillan’s account of Cuban history. Four were deletions advised to avoid giving offence to foreign governments who might have objected, for instance, to a diary quotation referring to the French as contemptuous, the Germans as very frightened, the Italians as windy and the Scandinavians as sour as well as windy. This was not only undiplomatic but, certainly as far as the French were concerned, incorrect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn116-0047117812451838">116</xref></sup></p>
<p>The only deletion recommended that Macmillan gibed at – writing ‘why?’ in the margin – was any reference to the Thors. He nevertheless complied with these requests, with the exception of one oblique mention of the Thor offer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn117-0047117812451838">117</xref></sup> The other 11 changes recommended were to summarise the extracts. This, however, clearly had limited effect on their preponderance in the chapter; in contrast to Churchill, in ‘On the Brink’, the percentage of original documents in the text is probably nearer to 70–80 per cent. It is likely that this reflected publisher reluctance to comply when already close to publication with changes that ‘would spoil the book and entail very expensive correction if we were to paraphrase them’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn118-0047117812451838">118</xref></sup></p>
<p>The company certainly thought the Cuba section an important part of the book. The second paragraph of the dust jacket text proclaimed: ‘The British side of the Cuba crisis is told here for the first time. The continuous contact that took place, sometimes several times a day, between Prime Minister and President reveals the closeness of their personal relationship and shows how strong was British influence and support’. A similar line was also central to the pre-publication publicity.</p>
<p>The object was not just to puff the book but also to engage with media and Opposition allegations at the time of the Cuban crisis that the British influence on the United States had been negligible. According to Labour frontbencher Richard Crossman writing in <italic>The Guardian</italic> on 26 October 1962, these events exploded the myth of British influence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn119-0047117812451838">119</xref></sup> This theme of lack of consultation was taken up by his party leader, Hugh Gaitskell, in the Commons debate on the Queen’s Speech on 30 October 1962.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn120-0047117812451838">120</xref></sup> Among the Opposition, there are hints from other leading figures such as Harold Wilson that this line was taken so as to justify their then argument that nuclear weapons did not buy Britain’s influence and therefore ought to be abandoned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn121-0047117812451838">121</xref></sup></p>
<p>Macmillan’s attempts to counter this in the House on 30 October 1962 had been unconvincing, not least because he was unable to go into detail on the substance of his talks with Kennedy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn122-0047117812451838">122</xref></sup> But extensive Anglo-American discussion was reproduced 10 years later in ‘On the Brink’. These included Kennedy’s message of 22 October, suggesting that the two men ‘discuss the situation between ourselves by means of our private channel of communication’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn123-0047117812451838">123</xref></sup> This channel was the KY-9 scrambler telephone, installed on 6 September 1961, supplemented by the KW-26 teleprinter. Macmillan commented in his diary on 4 November – reproduced in ‘On the Brink’ – that these worked without a hitch. However, the scrambler phone distorted voices. The President also apparently kept on forgetting that he had to take his finger off the button to allow Macmillan to speak.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn124-0047117812451838">124</xref></sup> This may account for the apparently unenlightening nature of the transcripts. But then, as anyone who has tried to recapture the fire of a Lloyd George from the reproduction in Hansard would know, transcripts convey only a part of orality. In a passage Macmillan drafted to add to the chapter but which was not in the end included, he noted, ‘We used flat and commonplace phrases of everyday life and humdrum affairs. Nevertheless, we both knew we were discussing the future, and perhaps the survival of the civilised world’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn125-0047117812451838">125</xref></sup> In a talk between two men who clearly trusted and liked each other, there are always likely to be unspoken assumptions and understandings that a transcript may not capture, such as the somewhat hesitant way in which Macmillan introduced the Thor offer on 26 October. Nevertheless, Kennedy’s message of 22 October warmly observed: ‘It is a source of great personal satisfaction to me that you and I can keep in close touch with each other by rapid and secure means at a time like this, and I intend to keep you fully informed of my thinking as the situation evolves’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn126-0047117812451838">126</xref></sup></p>
<p>Being informed, however, is not necessarily consultation. From the initial reviews onwards, these passages have instead been taken to demonstrate that Macmillan served as ‘a sounding board’ for Kennedy to test out his ideas. Some, such as the question about invasion asked on 25 October, have nevertheless been seen very definitely as consultation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn127-0047117812451838">127</xref></sup> Less noticed, though probably no less significant, were the discussions about how to approach the United Nations.</p>
<p>In the past, it has often been thought that the main British contribution to the management of the Cuban crisis was advice from Ormsby-Gore about the breadth of the quarantine and the publication of the photographs of the missile sites. Macmillan no doubt believed that his ambassador did make a significant contribution to the first of these.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn128-0047117812451838">128</xref></sup> Curiously, he does not mention the second in ‘On the Brink’, though de Zulueta’s warnings to senior American intelligence officer Chet Cooper of the likely scepticism of the British press seem to have been the significant factor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn129-0047117812451838">129</xref></sup></p>
<p>What has been less explored is the British approach to the UN side of the crisis. In the historiography, Macmillan’s interest in this has been overshadowed by the Thor offer. However, in the same conversation that he raised this with Kennedy, on 26 October, he also reiterated the idea of a UN mission to ensure the missiles were inoperable. Once the ships were no longer arriving, this was the crucial issue for Macmillan, hence his change of mind over the merits of military action. Indeed, getting a credible UN inspection regime in place was a key means of avoiding such military action, with all the risks that implied. British experts believed this could be achieved by preventing the use of the ramps and placing the missiles elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn130-0047117812451838">130</xref></sup> A credible inspection regime was also, incidentally, a way of making progress on the test ban issue. The Thor offer was thus a backup; its minor role in ‘On the Brink’ is accordingly appropriate.</p>
<p>Like Kennedy, Macmillan responded to the offers Khrushchev made around Cuba in his message of 26 October concerning dismantling in return for Cuban inviolability and ignored the Turkey element. Swopping missiles in Turkey he indeed regarded as ‘very dangerous’. In his subsequent comments, he makes it clear that he did not regard the Turkey missiles as particularly important – except for the Turks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn131-0047117812451838">131</xref></sup> The danger lay, as documents at the time make clear but his diaries and ‘On the Brink’ do not, in expanding the ambit of the crisis beyond the Western hemisphere, hence Macmillan’s anxieties about lack of UN progress on 27–28 October. He and Home wanted to keep the Turkey issue out of play and resolve matters through the United Nations, and hence the instructions to Dean.</p>
<p>As Kennedy said in ExComm on the morning (Washington time) of 26 October, the missiles could only be removed by negotiation, trade or invasion. The British line was that they could be negotiated away through a combination of assuring the territorial inviolability of Cuba and inspection to render the missiles inoperable. It is clear that when Adlai Stevenson raised these points for the first time in ExComm a few moments later, he had already been talking to Dean about them. There was some initial scepticism, particularly from John McCone, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director. However, the idea of a mission – using British, French and other European inspectors – gained traction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn132-0047117812451838">132</xref></sup> Stevenson raised such issues with U Thant in New York that afternoon and the two key elements of this line – UN inspection and US agreement not to invade Cuba – formed the core of Kennedy’s message to Moscow, transmitted at 8.00 p.m. (Washington time) on 27 October.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn133-0047117812451838">133</xref></sup> This was the message that Macmillan in ‘On the Brink’ saw as solving the crisis. He probably also believed this, both at the time and when this chapter was written.</p>
<p>In his account, however, he largely left out the UN element. Indeed, both this and the course of 27 October are underplayed in ‘On the Brink’. The absence of a diary entry for that date is probably a factor, given how important the diaries proved as a mainstay of his text, particularly in Macmillan’s later volumes of memoirs. Nevertheless, it seems remarkable that Dean is only mentioned once in the whole of <italic>At the End of the Day</italic>, as having played a useful supporting role to Stevenson.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn134-0047117812451838">134</xref></sup> Given Macmillan’s habitual antipathy to the latter, this was an unusual,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn135-0047117812451838">135</xref></sup> and probably unwarranted, act of generosity to Stevenson while equally ungenerous to Dean. This seemingly reflects a compositional focus on demonstrating communications with the President: Ormsby-Gore in Washington therefore gets much more attention in ‘On the Brink’ than Dean in New York. Incidentally, this focus and the Cabinet Office stipulation not to offend foreign governments also means that the very considerable efforts expended by the British on inter-Allied and inter-Commonwealth relations during the crisis to maintain solidarity with the Americans are also largely overlooked in his account.</p>
<p>There is, however, another reason for the occlusion of the UN dimension. Macmillan’s line on the United Nations developed out of his communications with Kennedy. He probably assumed that they were thinking along similar lines, as indeed they were, though with subtle nuances in terms of tone and timing.</p>
<p>He does not go into much more detail in ‘On the Brink’ on a second of the three ways Kennedy instanced in ExComm of getting the missiles out of Cuba, that of invasion. Instead, he briefly sketches over the tentative approaches the British had received from the Russian embassy in London alternatively to propose a Summit, both because they were largely irrelevant but also because of the embarrassing linkage to the (unnamed here) Yevgeny Ivanov, who was also to feature subsequently among the lurid details surrounding the 1963 Profumo scandal. The plan for invasion, scheduled for 29 October, is only mentioned later as Macmillan’s explanation for why the Russians caved in rather than pursuing the trade with Turkey that they had demanded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn136-0047117812451838">136</xref></sup> Parenthetically, it might be noted that this suggests that Macmillan, unaware of the President’s dovish response to the U2 shooting on 27 October, remained convinced that Kennedy intended to go through with the invasion of Cuba and that the threat of this bellicosity was significant in resolving the crisis.</p>
<p>This third option, the trade, was not to be placed in the public domain until 1978 and only fully declassified in 1991,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn137-0047117812451838">137</xref></sup> long after Macmillan’s death in 1986. In his comments, in ExComm, Kennedy implied that these options were alternative strategies. In practice, they were all pursued simultaneously. All, indeed, played various roles in the resolution of the crisis. But the British did not know that Bobby Kennedy had indicated to Anatoly Dobrynin, the Russian ambassador to Washington, that the Jupiters could quietly be withdrawn from Turkey within four to five months should a satisfactory arrangement on Cuba be reached.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn138-0047117812451838">138</xref></sup> In part, this was because they discounted such a possibility as being outside the Western hemisphere. But it was also because the Americans deliberately misled them, their Allies and indeed their own ambassadors on this point. Roberts noted in his despatch on 29 October that his American colleague, Llewellyn Thompson, fully shared his surprise at the rapid and complete Soviet climbdown. His attempt to rationalise this, suggesting it was the looming threat of American military action that prompted Khrushchev’s move,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn139-0047117812451838">139</xref></sup> was nevertheless astute.</p>
<p>Deliberate American dissimulation both distracted from the Turkey offer and ramped up as far as their allies were concerned the risk of warfare. In order not to be seen to be letting down their allies, they instead misled them. The worse example of lack of consultation from the Americans was thus not one Macmillan could try to downplay in ‘On the Brink’ because he did not know about it. Ironically, however, neither did those complaining at the time about lack of consultation.</p>
<p>When this story did eventually come out, Macmillan’s account had at least scotched the idea of lack of information, even if it was now apparent that it was not always complete. However, it also reinforced notions of lack of British influence. Macmillan’s government was seen as pursuing a Thor trade that would never shape Washington’s thinking, because the Americans were already moving to the Turkey swop instead. The Thor offer was thus easily dismissed merely as reflecting, as Macmillan’s own diary reference on 4 November put it, ‘the frightful desire to <italic>do</italic> something’. This is despite the fact that the same sentence went on to acknowledge that ‘<italic>not</italic> to do anything (except to talk to the President and keep Europe and the Commonwealth calm and firm) was prob[ably] the right answer’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn140-0047117812451838">140</xref></sup> Indeed, the British did not do anything that they considered out of keeping with the American line. The Thor offer went unpursued. More important were their efforts to promote the UN-managed solution.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it should be noted that the effect of the Turkey swop revelation was to further downgrade the significance of this UN element of the solution of the crisis. This is not to say that it was central to the actual decision of Khrushchev to withdraw. The threat of invasion and the Turkey deal, in that order, seem to have been the drivers there. But the UN inspection regime underpinned the solution. So, while it did not play the primary importance in the immobilisation of the missiles that the British had envisaged, it was certainly not insignificant.</p>
<p>Before publication, <italic>The Spectator</italic> referred to <italic>At the End of the Day</italic> as the most eagerly awaited book in the series.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn141-0047117812451838">141</xref></sup> This, though, was because it expected revelations not about October 1962 but about the end of Macmillan’s premiership in October 1963. Cuba was not as central to the reception of the book as the pre-publicity had assumed. Nor did it sell as well as <italic>The Spectator</italic> might have envisaged. At a time, when respectable fiction sales were around 5000 copies, the figure reported of 20,326 non-US sales by the end of 1979 was certainly good. However, it was still way behind the sales figures for the first two volumes of the autobiography.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn142-0047117812451838">142</xref></sup> Furthermore, ‘On the Brink’ does not seem to have helped sales in the United States. Just over two years after publication, Harper and Row wrote that sales had been very slow and ‘we must let the book go out of print’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn143-0047117812451838">143</xref></sup></p>
<p>At least one American reviewer seems to have spotted the Churchillian approach, writing of a work ‘laid out on the grand scale of a Gibbon or a Macaulay, though lacking their stylistic eloquence and organ tone’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn144-0047117812451838">144</xref></sup> Like Churchill’s works, it arrived freighted with passages from contemporary documents. As has been observed, in Churchill’s volumes, these gave a sometimes spurious authenticity to his accounts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn145-0047117812451838">145</xref></sup> In Macmillan’s works, such passages present his view of the Cuban missile crisis largely in terms of his relationship to Kennedy. This does not make them inauthentic. However, it does mean that the same American reviewer was inaccurate in describing <italic>At the End of the Day</italic> as offering ‘a vivid picture of the anxiety [the crisis] stirred in Britain’. Public responses, such as the demonstrations outside the American embassy organised by the anti-nuclear Committee of 100,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn146-0047117812451838">146</xref></sup> are conspicuously absent in Macmillan’s account. Instead, not least because of Macmillan’s focus on his relations to Kennedy, his portrayal of the Cuban missile crisis conceals as much as it reveals about the British experience of that event.</p>
