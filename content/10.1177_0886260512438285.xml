<abstract>
<p>There are numerous examples in the homicide literature of a presumed connection between the victim–offender relationship and the manner, extent, and body location of wounds inflicted in homicides. The current study examined variations in wounding patterns according to the intimacy of the victim–offender relationship in a sample of urban homicides to explore the investigative utility of this information in an average homicide event. The findings demonstrated that victims who had a current or former intimate relationship with their offender were more likely to receive wounds to the face and be injured with a weapon from the scene compared with all other relationship groups, whereas injury to the head and use of manual violence were more likely among intimates and family/friends compared with acquaintances or strangers. However, the groups did not significantly differ in terms of the overall amount of wounds inflicted. Implications of the findings and suggested areas of future research are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Homicide is a social event playing out between at least two individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512438285">Silverman &amp; Mukherjee, 1987</xref>) and the nature of the relationship between the victim and offender may be key to understanding the violence inflicted during this transaction. Early works in the field of offender profiling that aimed to provide direct investigative assistance assumed that wounding patterns present in a homicide could be useful in predicting the victim–offender relationship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512438285">Douglas &amp; Olshaker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512438285">Ressler, Douglas, &amp; Burgess, 1995</xref>). The goal of the current study was to empirically examine several of these assumptions.</p>
<p>One of the more specific connections proposed by some in the early behavioral profiling literature involved wounding to the face of the victim as indicative of a more intimate relationship between the offender and victim. For instance, when analyzing the unsolved homicide of Mary Ann Nichols, one of five victims killed by Jack the Ripper, former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) profiler John Douglas states that the fact that the victim’s face did not receive more significant wounds beyond some bruising indicates that the victim was a stranger to the offender: “If this had been a more personally direct attack, I would have expected to see more obliterating wounds to the face” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512438285">Douglas &amp; Olshaker, 2000</xref>, p. 11). Similarly, he later states in reference to another case that excessive violence concentrated about the face of a victim is a frequent occurrence in domestic homicide cases. The expression of such wounding in homicide is “not only a manifestation of deep-seated and often long-standing anger by the offender against the victim, but also an attempt to depersonalize him or her . . . the facial battery indicates an attempt to strip the victim of actual identity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512438285">Douglas &amp; Olshaker, 2000</xref>, p. 127). This idea has also been suggested by others. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512438285">Salfati and Canter (1999)</xref> extend <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512438285">Feshbach’s (1964)</xref> conceptualization of interpersonal violence as hostile or expressive (an affective/impulsive attack on the victim) or instrumental (driven by an ulterior goal) and suggest that the face may be targeted in homicide due to the emotional meaning that the victim held to the offender. As discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512438285">Meloy (2006)</xref>, most, if not all, aggressive behavior is goal directed. However, expressive or affective violence reflects the goal of inflicting direct harm to the victim in a more emotion-based attack, whereas instrumental or predatory violence is predatory in nature involving the offender’s attempt to satisfy an externally recognizable need or goal, such as sex or theft. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512438285">Salfati and Canter (1999)</xref> suggest that the former is at work in homicides displaying facial wounding, as the face is reflective of a person’s individual identity and may be wounded as an act of depersonalization of the victim within the context of an overall expressive or impulsive attack on him or her (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512438285">Salfati &amp; Canter, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the logical consistency of this connection, other authors have introduced a potential confounding factor pertaining to facial wounding that may weaken its link to victim/offender relationship, that of displacement. In a typology of rape-murder, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512438285">Keppel and Walter (1999)</xref> included violence directed at the face of the victim as characteristic of an “anger-retaliatory” murderer. Although not explicitly linking this behavior to the relationship between the homicide victim and offender, the authors acknowledge that facial wounding may be part of an overall violent attack in which the victim is a substitute for the true source of the offender’s anger and frustration, such as a female acquaintance, intimate partner, or female family member. In this case, the psychological meaning of the behavior remains intact—the behavior is an attempt to depersonalize an individual—but the actual victim may be an opportunistically chosen stranger because the desired target is unavailable. This possibility could weaken the investigative utility of the information and even lead investigators down the wrong path.</p>
<p>Though the early profiling literature assumes a link between wounding behaviors and victim–offender relationship, these assumptions have received little direct empirical examination in relation to the “average” or typical homicide. It is far more common for the link between wounding in homicide and the victim–offender relationship to be discussed in the behavioral profiling literature within the context of specific homicide subtypes, such as serial (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512438285">Douglas &amp; Olshaker, 2000</xref>) and sexual homicide (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512438285">Keppel &amp; Walter, 1999</xref>). Although reliable estimates of the prevalence of either subtype of homicide are difficult to determine, both serial and sexual homicide are rare occurrences, each comprising approximately 1% of homicides nationwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512438285">FBI, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512438285">Meloy, 2000</xref>). The utility of relying on how the victim was wounded to predict the relationship to their offender in more typical homicide investigations is not as well established but clearly could be of use to investigators across a greater majority of their cases. The current study sought to provide empirical evidence for the presence or absence of the link between wounding behaviors, including facial wounding, and the victim–offender relationship in a typical homicide event.</p>

<sec id="section2-0886260512438285">
<title>Victim Injury in Homicide</title>
<p>Several studies have uncovered patterns of injury based on the relationship of the victim to the offender in homicides and other violent crimes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512438285">Tjaden and Thoennes (2000)</xref> found that in cases of assault, if the crime was committed by an intimate, the victim sustained greater physical injury. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512438285">Sheridan and Nash (2007)</xref> completed a literature review of injury in intimate partner violence (IPV) cases. Although not specifically examining homicide cases, they concluded that the head, neck, and face are the most common injury sites during an IPV assault. This is in accordance with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512438285">Le, Dierks, Ueeck, Homer, and Potter (2001)</xref> who examined domestic violence victims receiving hospital treatment and found that 81% suffered facial wounding; 30% of these wounds were serious enough to cause facial fractures. The drawback to each of these studies is the focus on assault rather than homicide.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512438285">Heller, Ehrlich, and Lester (1983)</xref> found that in cases of assault, up to and including those resulting in death, the severity of the injury increased as the closeness of the relationship between the victim and offender increased. Serious injury or death was more common when the victim was related to the offender or was an intimate partner and minor injury was more likely associated with a more distant relationship, such as an acquaintance or stranger relationship. Moreover, this trend did not deviate when subgroups were examined, such as when the offender did or did not have a psychiatric diagnosis, was or was not above 30 years old, whether the victim was male or female, or whether the victim was an adult or child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512438285">Heller et al., 1983</xref>). In an examination of attempted homicide, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512438285">Fritzon and Ridgway (2001)</xref> found that offenders varied the frequency or intensity of an attack on victims who resisted, with injury to the face more common among those who did resist (93%) compared with those who did not (66%). The authors suggest that this finding logically follows the psychological principles laid out by others that offenders may be “intent on harming not only the victim’s face, but also the person that the face represented” (p. 686). However, homicide is the most violent act and it is possible that any interpersonal transaction rising to the level of lethality may involve a heightened degree of violence that masks the predictive utility specifically of injury to the face. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512438285">Fritzon and Ridgway (2001)</xref> state that victims who resisted their attacker were more likely to receive wounds over several body areas—the face, head, torso, and limbs. Again, this could suggest that wounding to the face is part of an overall violent assault on the victim due to an expressive motivation.</p>
<p>In relation specifically to homicide cases, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512438285">Safarik and Jarvis (2005)</xref> did not find a significant difference in injury severity between victims and offenders who were known to one another compared with those that were not. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438285">Last and Fritzon (2005)</xref> examined homicides in the United Kingdom using a sample of offenders gleaned from a psychiatric facility and compared several crime scene variables across relationship categories—familial, stranger, and acquaintance. Their results showed that where excessive wounding was present in a homicide, the victim was also likely to suffer wounds to the face. In addition, highly expressive homicides characterized by the use of manual violence, using a weapon available at the scene, excessive wounding to the victim, multiple wounds distributed over several body areas, and facial wounding were more likely to indicate a familial relationship as opposed to a more distant relationship. Also examining homicide in the United Kingdom, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512438285">Salfati (2003)</xref> found that facial wounding is not a rare behavior and occurred in 36% of cases in her sample. Moreover, and in accordance with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438285">Last and Fritzon (2005)</xref>, facial wounding tended to co-occur with other crime scene behaviors aimed at inflicting harm to the victim, as opposed to a more instrumental motive, and indicated a greater level of reactive violence and/or a more impulsive attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512438285">Salfati, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438285">Last and Fritzon (2005)</xref> point out, however, that facial wounding by itself was <italic>not</italic> able to distinguish between the three relationship groups and in fact was likely to occur nearly equally among strangers and family members; the quantity of wounds inflicted, rather than location of the wound, was the most predictive in identifying a familial relationship.</p>
<p>Given that the nature of affective or expressive violence as an attack on the victim as a person and the findings cited here that the frequency or intensity of wounding may increase as the intimacy of the victim–offender relationship increases, one could expect to see overkill more often in these cases. For this reason, the authors of the current study had intended to include a measure of overkill in the analysis of wounding behaviors, yet this proved to be highly problematic due to the lack of an objective definition in the relevant literature. Most commonly, the term is defined as involving the infliction of wounds beyond what was necessary to kill the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512438285">Douglas, Burgess, Burgess, &amp; Ressler, 1992</xref>). However, the exact method for determining if and how this manifests in a given case through the use of medical examiner’s reports or crime scene photos is conspicuously absent. The lack of a precise definition of “overkill” and method for its identification translates into substantial problems of operationalization and reliable measurement across studies. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512438285">Bell and Vila (1996)</xref> explain overkill is easily appreciable when there is a remarkably high number of wounds, yet it is difficult to identify a specific boundary between what is or is not necessary to kill the victim and the offender’s subjective awareness of it as the number of wounds decreases; in other words, any sort of an objective and quantitative cutoff point has not been put forth. In short, the literature thus far has treated the phenomenon of overkill according to the axiom of “we’ll know it when we see it,” a standard that falls short of acceptable in empirical studies. To avoid adding to the confusion on this topic, the current study simply looked at the degree of wounding according to how many wounds were inflicted. Before the concept of overkill can be of practical use to either researchers or investigators, a more precise definition and methodology for its identification is necessary.</p>

<title>Weapon Use in Homicide</title>
<p>Authors have suggested that in addition to variations in homicide wounding, the weapon used to inflict the wounds may vary according to the victim–offender relationship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438285">Johnson &amp; Hotton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438285">Last &amp; Fritzon, 2005</xref>). Although firearms are the most commonly used weapon in homicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438285">FBI, 2009</xref>), strangulation, suffocation, or asphyxiation are more likely among female homicide victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512438285">Karch, Lubell, Friday, Patel, &amp; Williams, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512438285">Thomas, Dichter, and Matejkowski (2011)</xref> also found firearms were less likely to be used in intimate partner compared with nonintimate partner homicides. A review of Canadian studies showed that stabbing, beating, and strangulation are more personal forms of violence than shooting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512438285">Silverman &amp; Mukherjee, 1987</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512438285">Johnson and Hotton (2003)</xref> examined cases of domestic homicide and found that “beating” was the cause of death in approximately 13% of the sample, with a difference in the prevalence rate for female-victim cases (15%) and male-victim cases (8%).</p>
<p>These patterns reflect the use of weapons in IPV cases, with objects handy in the violent situation more commonly used than firearms or knives. Manual strangulation or other forms of contact violence are also particularly common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512438285">Sheridan &amp; Nash, 2007</xref>). Others have found that firearms are more often used by former intimates compared with those in stable intimate relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512438285">Silverman &amp; Mukherjee, 1987</xref>). Taking this into consideration, similar weapon use patterns should be present in homicide cases where the victim and offender were known to one another and involved in a closer interpersonal relationship compared with being strangers. The former group may be more likely to kill the victim using manual violence or weapons available at the scene and less likely to use firearms, which in turn could affect wounding patterns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886260512438285">
<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>The literature suggests that there is sufficient basis to assume that offenders with a closer affinity to their victim will inflict wounds differently than those who are not intimately related. Studies in the IPV literature have established that injury to the face in particular is remarkably common, yet the weight of this particular variable in identifying the victim–offender relationship in any given homicide case deserves closer scrutiny. The studies summarized above have examined variations in where on the body a victim is wounded, the degree of wounding, and how the wounds are inflicted in cases of domestic or intimate partner violence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512438285">Le et al., 2001</xref>), attempted homicide (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512438285">Fritzon &amp; Ridgway, 2001</xref>), or have examined these behaviors in relation to specific special populations such as psychiatric patients (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438285">Last &amp; Fritzon, 2005</xref>) or rape/murderers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512438285">Keppel &amp; Walter, 1999</xref>). Infliction of wounds to the victim’s face and other variations in wounding patterns and how these behaviors relate to the relationship between the victim and offender in a <italic>typical</italic> homicide has not been extensively examined.</p>
<p>Examining the connection between wounding and the victim–offender relationship in homicide in this context could eventually improve its investigative utility if the connection holds or, conversely, suggests that investigators should not give serious weight to how a victim is wounded. The current study sought to directly address this question and if the exploratory analyses fail to show any predictive utility of wounding patterns and weapon use across a sample of average urban homicides, this would be a significant finding and would caution against reliance on a potentially mistaken assumption in such homicide investigations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0886260512438285">
<title>Aims</title>
<p>Broadly stated, the aim of the current study was to explore variations in the body locations and extent of injuries sustained by a victim during a homicide event and how those injuries were inflicted. Drawing from the existing literature, it was hypothesized that variation in the overall frequency of wounds and location of wounds on the victim’s body would exist according to the intimacy of the relationship between the victim and offender. Specifically, it was expected that those with a closer relationship would inflict a greater number of wounds overall and be more likely to wound the face, head, and neck of the victim. It was also hypothesized that variation would exist according to the weapon used in that those with a closer relationship would be more likely to use a weapon from the scene and inflict wounds manually or through the use of a blunt instrument or by stabbing the victim, whereas those with a more distant relationship would be more likely to shoot the victim. No specific predictions were made for the remaining variables examined, as there is less to guide a specific directional hypothesis in the available literature (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512438285">Table 1</xref> for a complete listing of variables).</p>

<title>Data and Sample</title>
<p>The current study used a comprehensive data set compiled by the first author. The data contained therein were originally collected from homicide case files belonging to the Cincinnati Police Department and includes all solved single-victim, single-offender homicides occurring between 1997 and 2006. Of the original 137 homicides contained in the data set, the current study necessitated the exclusion of 14 cases. The authors felt it appropriate to exclude cases involving the death of a very young child. Twelve victims in the original data set were aged three or younger. Their deaths were largely the result of unintentional serious bodily harm stemming from abuse and the cause of death typically resulted from underlying injury, without obvious visible wounding. Given the lack of overt wounding, the inclusion of these cases would add little to the investigative utility of the study’s intent. An additional two cases were excluded due to the absence of a complete medical examiner’s report resulting in substantial missing information pertaining to victim wounding. The final sample suitable for analyses consisted of 123 homicide cases. This sample size is similar to other studies which use detailed medical examiner records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512438285">Jordan, Pritchard, Duckett, Wilcox, Corey, &amp; Combest, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512438285">Safarik &amp; Jarvis, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Data Coding and Variables</title>
<p>Data were collected using the Homicide Profiling Index<sup>©</sup> version 3 (HPIv3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512438285">Salfati, 2005</xref>). The HPI is a coding dictionary explicitly developed for use with homicide case files and contains detailed variable definitions and coding guidelines designed to ensure reliable data collection. Interrater reliability ratings for the HPI have been demonstrated at 89% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512438285">Salfati, 2005</xref>). The protocol outlined in the HPI converts information extracted from case files into a dichotomous or categorical format using numeric values to ensure complete confidentiality of the information recorded. Personal or identifying information is never extracted from the files or recorded in any manner.</p>
<p>The HPI contains more than 200 variables pertaining to victim and offender characteristics, the relationship between the victim and offender, nature of the homicide, offender crime scene behaviors, and motivation. The variables used in the current study pertained to the relationship between the victim and offender and the wounds inflicted on the victim in terms of body location, extent of injury, and how wounds were inflicted. The central relationship variable was categorical and specified the victim–offender relationship as stranger/just met, acquaintance, family/friend, and current/former intimate partner. Variable selection and inclusion of variables beyond the physical wounds (e.g., weapon from scene, manner of death) was guided by relevant research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438285">Last &amp; Fritzon, 2005</xref>).

<p>Comparing the significant results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260512438285">Table 2</xref> to the wounding and weapon variables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512438285">Table 1</xref>, it is clear that the majority of items did not distinguish between homicides committed by the four relationship groups. The relationship groups only differed significantly when wounds were inflicted to the head or face; when it was either manual violence or the weapon involved was a blunt instrument; when the victim was shot; when the victim was stabbed; and when the weapon was taken from, as opposed to being brought to, the crime scene. In accordance with the existing literature and the hypotheses of the current study, wounds to the face were more prevalent as the intimacy of the relationship increased. Similarly, wounds to the head and the use of manual violence were more characteristic of the family/friend and intimate relationship groups, whereas the use of a weapon from the scene was much more likely to be present among intimates compared with all other relationship groups. Intimates were slightly more likely than other relational groups to have been stabbed but were much less likely than all other relational groups to have been shot partially supporting the hypothesis. Neither did the results support the hypotheses that the relationship groups would be differentiated according to the overall degree of wounding, either inflicting three or more wounds (χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.764, <italic>p</italic> = .124) or more than five wounds (χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.831, <italic>p</italic> = .120), nor were there significant differences in wounds inflicted to the neck (χ<sup>2</sup> = 3.328, <italic>p</italic> = .344). The fact that the four relationship groups did not differ in terms of the number of wounds inflicted on the victim was surprising given the liberal definition of excessive wounding used here.</p>
<p>Additional chi-square analyses were undertaken to determine if any of these behaviors could distinguish more basic relational groups, specifically whether they could distinguish between offenders known or unknown to the victim or between intimates and nonintimates (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260512438285">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>For homicides not involving a stranger relationship, the only variable demonstrating significance was the use of a weapon from the scene; offenders who used a weapon from the scene were significantly more likely to be known to the victim (34.1%) compared with strangers (13.3%). However, when comparing the six variables according to whether the victim and offenders were intimates or nonintimates, all demonstrated statistical significance in the expected direction. Manual violence was present in only 7.7% of nonintimate homicides compared with 26.3% of intimate homicides. Among the intimate relationship group, the victim was much less likely to have been shot (26.3%) and more likely to have been stabbed (36.8%) compared with the nonintimate relationship group (78.8% and 12.5%, respectively). A weapon from the scene was used in 21.4% of nonintimate homicides compared with 72.2% of intimate homicides and wounds were inflicted to the head in 20.2% of nonintimate homicides and 47.4% of intimate homicides. Finally, wounds to the face were inflicted 19.2% of nonintimate homicides but were inflicted in 52.6% of intimate homicides.</p>
<p>Perhaps most relevant to the current study given the assumptions summarized previously regarding wounding to the face as an indication of a closer interpersonal relationship, the authors decided to explore this single crime scene variable further. Previous research has suggested that wounds inflicted to the face could indicate depersonalization of the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512438285">Douglas &amp; Olshaker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512438285">Safarik &amp; Jarvis, 2005</xref>) or could be part of a less controlled violent attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512438285">Salfati &amp; Canter, 1999</xref>). To consider these possibilities, more detailed chi-square analyses were conducted using several control variables: inflicting multiple wounds to one body location, inflicting multiple wounds to several body areas, inflicting a single wound, and inflicting three or more wounds overall. If victims with a closer relationship to the offender who suffered multiple wounds to one body area or only a single wound also displayed facial wounding, it could indicate depersonalization. In addition, those with a closer relationship who suffered multiple wounds to more than one body area or a higher number of wounds overall, as well as facial wounding, it could indicate a more expressive homicide in which the face was part of a less controlled attack on the victim. The results of the tabular analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0886260512438285">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0886260512438285">Table 4</xref>, when multiple wounds were inflicted to a single body area and facial wounding was present, it was more likely to occur among the intimate victim and offender group, though it did not reach statistical significance. As expected, the remaining results did reach statistical significance suggesting that facial wounding could indicate an expressive attack on a person who was not only known to the offender but also intimately involved with them. Surprisingly, however, the percentage distribution for the presence of these variable combinations demonstrated that three of the four control variables were also quite prevalent among strangers. These results should warrant caution when considering the investigative implications of these findings, pending more in-depth analyses using expanded samples.</p>
<p>Although the central aim of this study was to explore variations in wounding patterns according to the victim–offender relationship, given the significant findings pertaining to the intimate partner homicides, the authors felt it appropriate to explore the possibility that these homicides were the culminating event in an already violent interpersonal relationship as opposed to an impulsive reaction to an isolated situation. In accordance with this possibility, chi-square analyses demonstrated that offenders who killed an intimate partner were more likely to have been arrested for domestic violence prior to the homicide (57.9%) compared with strangers (25.8%), acquaintances (38.8%), and family/friends (20.8%; χ<sup>2</sup> = 7.958, <italic>p</italic> = .047) regardless of whether the domestic violence arrest was connected to the current homicide victim. Future studies should focus on other offender background variables and their potential interaction with homicide crime scene behaviors among intimately related victims and offenders to develop more salient predictors given the potentially powerful preventative implications of such findings.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The goal of the current study was to examine variations in wounding according to the intimacy of the relationship between the victim and offender in homicide events. As stated at the outset, a central aim of the current study was to directly examine the link between facial wounding and the victim/offender relationship in homicide that has been evident in the offender profiling literature for some time but heretofore has received only limited examination in the empirical crime scene analysis literature. In accordance with the literature that <italic>has</italic> suggested this link exists (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512438285">Douglas &amp; Olshaker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512438285">Fritzon &amp; Ridgway, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512438285">Le et al., 2001</xref>), the victims in the current study were more likely to suffer wounds to the face if they had a closer relationship to the offender. In fact, the prevalence of facial wounding among intimates was nearly twice that of the next most intimate relational group, family/friend. Taken collectively, the results provide some support for the hypothesis that facial wounding may be an attempt to depersonalize the victim during an expressive, emotion-based attack. These findings help to build a stronger foundation for what has previously relied primarily on anecdotal accounts or more subjective clinically based interpretations of the meaning of facial wounding and relationship intimacy in interpersonal violence.</p>
<p>Other results of the current study also lend support to the concept that homicides with a closer relationship between the victim and offender is likely to reflect an expressive, as opposed to instrumental, goal. Those with an intimate relationship to the offender were much more likely to be injured with a weapon handy at the crime scene than all other relationship groups and less likely to have been shot, with this latter finding reaffirming those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512438285">Thomas et al. (2011)</xref>. Moreover, this was the only variable able to statistically differentiate between the basic relationship variable of whether the offender knew their victim. As stated previously, the assumption in the early profiling literature suggested that if a homicide victim received wounds to the face, it could indicate that the offender knew the victim in some capacity and the facial wounding was a direct attack on the victim as a person. The results of the current study warrant caution in making this highly simplistic link in homicide investigations. In accordance with the suggestion made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438285">Last and Fritzon (2005)</xref>, considering the variable in isolation may be problematic. This was further supported by the analyses comparing those with an intimate relationship versus those not intimately related to the victim, where the totality of the findings show that consideration of several variables collectively, including wounds to the face, could be more indicative of relationship status. Similarly, injury to the head and the use of manual violence showed that the intimate and family/friend relational groups were both likely to engage in these behaviors, showing that these particular behaviors may be less able to differentiate these groups from each other but on the whole do seem to differentiate them from the more distant relationship groups—acquaintance and stranger.</p>
<p>The overall frequency and intensity of wounding, however, did not significantly differentiate the relationship groups, which is not in accordance with the findings of other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438285">Last &amp; Fritzon, 2005</xref>). Thus far, it has been suggested that facial wounding could be part of an overall expressive/emotion-based attack on the victim as a person. The fact that intimates did not differ from the other relational groups in the overall frequency of wounding, even using a low threshold, or inflicting wounds over several body areas is somewhat surprising, as these behaviors were expected to co-occur given the findings of previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512438285">Last &amp; Fritzon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512438285">Salfati, 2003</xref>). Yet in accordance with our own findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512438285">Safarik and Jarvis (2005)</xref> found no relationship between injury severity in homicide and the intensity of the victim–offender relationship. At best, it appears the true role of frequency of wounding in homicides is yet to be fully determined. This variation in findings could be simply due to the nature of samples used across studies or it could again be due to problems inherent in quantifying injuries in homicide. Taking this final point into consideration, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512438285">Meloy (2006)</xref> suggests that affective/expressive and predatory/instrumental aggression are not discrete either–or categories but instead are better conceptualized as opposing ends of a continuum. Rarely will a violent event fall entirely under one theme but instead demonstrate varying degrees of expressive or instrumental violence. Given the relative lack of studies directly examining wounding and intimacy in homicide at a basic level, it is beyond the scope of the current study to undertake the challenge of identifying the finer points along such a continuum and how wounding behaviors affect the placement of a given homicide within this spectrum of violence. However, future studies should continue to explore how homicides demonstrate varying degrees of affective/expressive violence in terms of wounding frequency, and other wounding behaviors, across victim–offender relationship groups to enhance both the theoretical understanding of interpersonal violence and the resulting practical applications to homicide investigations.</p>
<sec id="section11-0886260512438285">
<title>Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research</title>
<p>The findings presented here should take several limitations into consideration, particularly in relation to the sample used. The logic guiding the current study was to examine wounding variations in the context of a typical homicide event. Therefore, the data were considered appropriate as it was drawn directly from case files belonging to a medium-sized Midwestern police department, without restricting the sample to specific motivational subtypes (e.g., felony-related, domestic, etc.). However, the sample contained only a small number of intimate partner homicides and homicides occurring between family members. This is not particularly surprising given that homicides involving a close relationship between victims and offenders are not extremely common, with only about 8% of homicides including a familial relationship and 10% involving intimate partners nationwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438285">FBI, 2009</xref>). Ideally, the study should be replicated in several localities or using a nationwide sample, but given the need to access full medical examiner reports, such an undertaking would prove exceedingly difficult.</p>
<p>In a related sense, caution is warranted in generalizing the results of the present examination to other homicides involving more complex circumstances, such as those involving multiple victims and/or offenders or those believed to be sexually motivated. The current sample, for obvious reasons, only included solved homicides but with the additional requirement that the homicide involve a single victim and single offender, which represent approximately 70% of solved homicides reported in national statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512438285">FBI, 2009</xref>). It would be inappropriate to extend the current findings to multiple offender/victim homicides or those with more unusual motivations, particularly given what is known about the nature of serial and sexual homicide. Serial homicide is much less likely to involve the use of a firearm, with victims more commonly killed using less impersonal, close-contact weapons. For example, 55% of a sample of serial offenders provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512438285">Godwin (2000)</xref> killed their victim using strangulation or through manual violence. The degree to which weapon use and victim injury vary among these individuals compared with average homicide offenders is compounded by the more frequent targeting of strangers by both serial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512438285">Hickey, 2006</xref>) and sexual homicide offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512438285">Warren, Hazelwood, &amp; Dietz, 1996</xref>). Moreover, and as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512438285">Keppel and Walter (1999)</xref>, the predictive utility of facial wounding could be eliminated in these cases due to the role of displacement in which the victim—likely a stranger in both serial and sexual homicide—is a substitute for the true target of the offender’s aggression. The possible psychological mechanisms at work in such cases should be explored separately before drawing any conclusions regarding wounding and the victim–offender relationship. For these reasons, investigators are strongly cautioned in extending the current findings to either sexual homicide or serial homicide until wounding patterns in such cases are more directly compared with more typical single-victim, single-offender homicides to determine if they show similar patterns of wounding variation found here in relation to the intimacy of the victim–offender relationship.</p>
<p>The current study also examined intimate partner homicide by collapsing current and former relationships into a single category. This was necessitated by the small number of available intimate partner cases but does not allow for the identification of important differences between these groups. It is possible that the degree, severity, and location of wounds inflicted on current intimate partners may differ from those inflicted on former intimate partners. Previous research has found firearms to be more commonly used in estranged intimate relationships compared with intact relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512438285">Block &amp; Christakos, 1995</xref>), which may indicate a higher degree of premeditation and less impulsive attack on the victim. Given such a possibility, former intimate partners may receive fewer wounds overall and a more controlled attack may be evident at the crime scene. Though beyond the immediate scope of the current study, potential differences in wounding patterns among current versus former intimate partners is clearly an important avenue for future studies.</p>
<p>Taken together, the findings of the current study suggest that wounding patterns and the manner in which they are inflicted in the typical homicide do show some variation according to the relationship between the victim and offender. However, at no point should the findings of the current study be interpreted as a suggestion that investigators rely solely on victim wounding to the exclusion of other evidence that may be present in any given homicide case. Investigators should and do consider the totality of the circumstances and evidence available to them in homicide investigations. Yet if a case displays no apparent motive, no forensic evidence, and no eyewitnesses, the nature of the wounds sustained by the victim could provide at least some investigative assistance.</p>
