<abstract>
<p>Language sometimes creates confusion when teaching music concepts to children. Incorporating children’s literature may further enhance children’s comprehension of music vocabulary when preceded by listening and moving experiences, as well as singing and playing instruments. <italic>The Quiet Book</italic>, and its companion, <italic>The Loud Book!</italic> both authored by Deborah Underwood and illustrated by Renata Liwska provide reading experiences for exploring the basic dual nature of dynamics. Reading these books provides children with practice of music-specific vocabulary that aids in laying a foundation for later, and more complex, verbal music descriptions.</p>

<p>Music elements, as a group, possess a duality of expressive (i.e., tempo, dynamics, articulation, and timbre) and structured elements (i.e., pitch, rhythm, and texture). Among the music elements, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048371312453843">Andress (1998)</xref> categorized dynamics as part of a group of expressive controls along with tempo, timbre, and articulation. With structured musical responses of melody and rhythm, children must understand the internalized structure of the underlying beat to perform rhythms correctly, and they must perceive and order specific pitches to perform melodies. The curricular aims for each music element in early childhood can be summarized by using the following dualities: upward or downward (melody), fast or slow (tempo), high or low (pitch), short or long sounds (rhythm), thick or thin (texture), and loud or soft (dynamics).</p>
<p>Expressive elements differ from the structured musical responses of melody and rhythm as they can be used to alter and “express” those structured musical responses. “This means that an idea such as a given melody may be enhanced or better expressed by altering its speed, volume, quality, or way in which the sound is ‘packaged’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048371312453843">Andress, 1998</xref>, p. 46). Expressive elements allow for “wider latitude of what is acceptable or unacceptable as children apply such contrasts to their performances” (p. 46). For example, when a child explores sounds on a drum, an adult can aid him or her in further exploring and expressing the performances with prompts such as “Try playing it loud.” “Now play it softly.” “What would it sound like fast?” “What if you played it slowly?” Music teachers also easily apply these types of prompts for expressive music elements to known chants or songs that require structured rhythmic and melodic elements. In this way, prompting for expressive elements provides children with meaningful repetition with other elements—meaningful repetition that is playful, or as this author labels it “a child-reason to do it again.”</p>
<p>The best way for children to understand music dynamics is to experience them through listening, music making, and creating. The second movement of Haydn’s Symphony no. 94 in G Major, the Surprise Symphony, lends itself nicely for children to demonstrate their understanding of dynamics through movement by feigning sleepiness and then jumping when they hear the “surprise chord.” Teachers can direct children to sing known songs loudly and then quietly.</p>
<p>Young children do not readily perceive differences in dynamics or other music elements, unless those differences are extreme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1048371312453843">Gordon, 2003</xref>). Sounds must be very loud or very soft for children to perceive differences in dynamics and label them as <italic>loud</italic> or <italic>quiet</italic>. Children encounter these expressive controls in everyday life; loud is loud whether it is a musical sound or another kind of sound. In addition, perceptions of dynamics, are relative and situational. A loud sound is not always loud, and quiet sound is not always quiet. For example, the quiet sound of a cricket can be deafeningly loud when all else is silent and one is trying to sleep. The expressive nature of music dynamics allows children to easily perform and manipulate loud and quiet. The subtleties of how we sometimes label and perceive dynamics, however, can confuse children and impede their effective use of music-specific vocabulary.</p>
<p>A multimodal approach to music learning that includes aural, kinesthetic, and verbal experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048371312453843">Barbe &amp; Swassing, 1979</xref>) helps children refine their knowledge of dynamics. Children readily respond to lessons that explore dynamics through listening and movement. In contrast, a verbal approach presents unique problems. Music teachers aim to use music-specific vocabulary, yet achieving that goal remains challenging because, in everyday life, children and others use the same words associated with music for different meanings. For example, <italic>up</italic> and <italic>down</italic> may be used to refer to pitch; however, children frequently use <italic>up</italic> and <italic>down</italic> when describing a sound that gets louder or softer, respectively. Also, <italic>volume</italic>, rather than <italic>dynamics</italic>, is the common word used to refer to the loudness or softness of musical sounds. The words, <italic>loud</italic> and <italic>soft</italic>, have unique meanings in music, and in the “regular” world children and adults use the terms <italic>up</italic> and <italic>down</italic> interchangeably with <italic>louder</italic> and <italic>softer</italic> (e.g., “Turn the music up” means “Make the music louder.”). Furthermore, <italic>soft</italic>, as an alternative musical term for quiet dynamics, may connote a kinesthetic quality rather than an aural one. Children may be just as likely to label baby chicks, kittens, cotton, and ice cream as soft, along with soft sounds such as whispers and lullabies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1048371312453843">Flowers (1998)</xref> found that children likely use modifiers of <italic>loud</italic> and <italic>soft</italic> more frequently when describing general life experiences than when describing musical sounds. Thus, music teachers must be cautious when determining a child’s success in perceiving musical sounds based solely on his or her verbal descriptions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1048371312453843">Flowers (2002)</xref> suggested that music teachers give special attention to polysemous words through direct instruction. Addressing the challenge of these words with coexistent possible meanings in music instruction requires that children receive repeated and varied experiences using music-specific vocabulary. Exploring the dual and relative nature of <italic>loud</italic> and <italic>quiet</italic> through reading books provides a focused opportunity for consistent use of labels for dynamics.</p>
<p><italic>The Quiet Book</italic> (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $12.95, 2010, ISBN 9-780547-215679-51295) and <italic>The Loud Book!</italic> (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $12.99, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1048371312453843">2011</xref>, ISBN 9-780547-390086-51299) by Deborah Underwood and Renata Liwska provide music teachers a playful way to explore dynamics through children’s literature. The text of Underwood’s books provides examples of <italic>loud</italic> and <italic>quiet</italic> in ways that connect with children’s everyday lives. In addition, her text addresses the relative perceptions of loud and quiet with situations that are frequently humorous and sweet.</p>
<p>Liwska illustrated the concepts with forest animals (i.e., rabbits, porcupines, storks, lizards, owls, and bears) doing the things children and families do. The animals eat, sleep, play, and attend school, concerts, and other events. With soft colored pencil, Liwska imbued the text with whimsy and humor, and expertly captured the experiences of the forest creatures with facial expressions and creative use of perspective. For example, for “fireworks loud” she illustrated from the reader’s perspective of looking down on the faces of a crowd of forest creatures looking up in awe at a fireworks display. In a blog post, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1048371312453843">Liwska (2012)</xref> described her approach to illustrating, “I try to show the emotions behind a picture, what the characters feel as well as what they are doing.” Readers see the chagrined face of the one who spilled the marbles in the library and the delighted faces of those who receive thunderous applause following their performance.</p>
<p>“There are many kinds of quiet” and “There are many kinds of loud,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1048371312453843">Underwood and Liwska (2010)</xref> explain to readers on each book’s first pages, and the following pages provide many different types of quiet or loud. The examples enjoyably and exhaustively explore the meaning of dynamics with nuances from “sleeping sister quiet” to “top of the roller coaster quiet.” The musical pages “before the concert starts quiet” and “trying not to hiccup quiet” teach audience expectations of silence before and during a musical performance. The loud musical examples include parades and “Aunt Tillie’s banjo band loud.” The quiet book is written with upper and lower case text, but the loud book is written with all text in capital letters, which seems to fit with today’s way of using uppercase text to depict “yelling.”</p>
<p>The real-life situations encourage children’s critical thinking skills. The images and text examples prompt children to explore the concepts visually and aurally as they listen to the story read aloud. Teachers can further engage children verbally by inviting them to explain what they see and then to connect it to their own experiences. After children hear the text and study the pictures, teachers may ask questions that encourage more complex thinking about the examples. What kind of quiet is a “best friends don’t need to talk quiet”? What does the “top of the roller coaster quiet” feel like? and, Why might there be quiet after the “first look at your new hairstyle”? “CRICKETS LOUD” is a perfect example of the relativity of loud and quiet. If asked, “Do crickets make loud or quiet sounds?” the correct answer seemingly would be “quiet.” But, when teachers ask children, “How can the sound of crickets be loud?” they engage children’s critical thinking. One anticipated answer might be, “When you are outside and the world is quiet with no cars driving and people talking, cricket sounds can be loud.” Children need practice in using the terms <italic>quiet</italic> and <italic>loud</italic> for the concept of dynamics, and these books provide that practice in a way that is consistent with standard music-specific vocabulary.</p>
<p>When using a multimodal approach (i.e., aural, kinesthetic, and verbal) during musical experiences, teachers aid young children in building a solid foundation for understanding the dual nature of music elements. As children progress through their music education, this foundation provides necessary scaffolding as each duality gives way to a continuum consisting of more subtle and complex musical concepts. When teachers carefully select music with clear dynamic contrasts and invite children to respond through movement, children readily demonstrate their understanding of loud and quiet. Language, however, remains the medium through which we express to others how we hear and experience music. Yet “listeners cannot reliably describe their perceptions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1048371312453843">Flowers, 2002</xref>), and success in articulating to others what we experience requires consistent and reliable language use. Reading children’s literature—specifically the <italic>The Quiet Book</italic> and <italic>The Loud Book!—</italic>provides direct, yet playful, instruction in using music-specific vocabulary.</p>
