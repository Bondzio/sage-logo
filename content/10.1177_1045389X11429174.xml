<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In structure-reversed fluids based on dispersed phase (magnetoelectrorheological fluids (MERF)) that are sensitive to electric and magnetic fields, one can perform separate or simultaneous electrical or magnetic structurization of particles by applying independent fields. In prospect, this will allow changing the character of particle interaction, controlling the structure more flexibly, and broadening the range of regulation of the mechanical properties of a material. It means that the induced increase in the shear stress at two fields is higher than the sum of increments of the intensities, induced separately by the electric and magnetic fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X11429174">Gorodkin et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045389X11429174">Kordonsky et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045389X11429174">Koyama, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045389X11429174">Minagawa et al., 1994</xref>). As the index characterizing the value of the synergistic effect, we will use ξ = Δτ<sub><italic>EH</italic></sub>/(Δτ<sub><italic>E</italic></sub> + Δτ<sub><italic>H</italic></sub>), which is the ratio of the shear stress increment on simultaneous application of electric and magnetic fields Δτ<sub><italic>EH</italic></sub> to the sum of increments on separate application of the electric Δτ<sub><italic>E</italic></sub> and on separate application the magnetic Δτ<sub><italic>H</italic></sub> fields.</p>
<p>In our recent article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045389X11429174">Korobko et al., 2009</xref>), the rheological behavior of MERF with a complex dispersed phase based on two components was investigated. It was found that on simultaneous application of two fields, the synergistic effect also appeared, and that its characteristics surpassed the results obtained earlier by other authors for fluids based on a single component dispersed phase.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study is to perform a more detailed study of the characteristic peculiarities of a two-field impact on MERF with a complex (two-component) dispersed phase. This investigation related not only to the study of rheological response, but also to the dielectric and magnetic properties of fluids for determination of the influence of these parameters on the appearance of synergistic effect.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>We have investigated MERF with compositions consisting of such fillers as carbonyl iron (CI or flake-shaped CI (F-CI)), which is sensitive only to a magnetic field; Aerosil<sup>TM</sup> activated by some additives (F-Si), which is sensitive only to an electric field; and oxides α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (F-α) and γ-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (F-γ), which are sensitive to both fields in different degrees. Mineral oil was used as a dispersion medium. Fluids with a concentration <italic>C</italic> of a dispersed phase of 5 vol.% and 10 vol.% with only one filler and MERF with a complex filler, consisting of 5 vol.% CI and 5 vol.% SiO<sub>2</sub> (F-CI/Si) or 5 vol.% α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (F-CI/α) or 5 vol.% γ-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (F-CI/γ) have been investigated. It was earlier stated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045389X11429174">Kordonski et al., 1998</xref>) that the biggest increment of rheological characteristics in the magnetic field is given exactly by CI, which was chosen by us as a constant component of the dispersed phase of all complex compounds.</p>
<p>The rheological properties were carried out using rotational viscometer modified for measurements under two fields. The dielectric properties of MERF were determined in the range of frequencies from 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> Hz at a temperature of 20° C. The magnetic properties of MERF were determined by means of the standard technique for measuring magnetization with two Hall sensors.</p>

<title>Dielectric Properties and Electrorheological Effect</title>
<p>To evaluate the capability of dispersed phase particles to be polarized in an external electric field and to form rigid structural bridges in a dielectric dispersion medium, we have measured the components of the complex dielectric permittivity (ε′,ε″) for fluids with single and complex fillers. For the chosen fillers SiO<sub>2</sub>, γ-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, like for other oxides, the interphase polarization mechanism is most characteristic. It is known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045389X11429174">Hao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045389X11429174">Ikazaki et al., 1998</xref>) that for fluids with such fillers, if the difference between ε′ at frequencies 10<sup>2</sup> and 10<sup>5</sup> Hz (Δϵ′) is large and the relaxation frequency <italic>f<sub>r</sub></italic> at which the value of ε″ is maximal lies in the range 10<sup>2</sup>–10<sup>5</sup> Hz, then such fluids display a high electrorheological activity.</p>
<p>From the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X11429174">Figure 1</xref>, it is seen that fluids consisting of one filler F-Si and F-γ have the strongest interphase polarization. With increase in the filler concentration of one type, the values of ε′, ε″ also increase without a qualitative change in the frequency dependencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X11429174">Figure 1</xref>, curve 6).</p>

<p>The fluid F-α has a small value of Δε′, and the value of <italic>f<sub>r</sub></italic> does not fall within the area of interphase polarization, thus indicating the absence of relaxational interphase polarization, and one cannot expect a high electrorheological response for such a fluid.</p>
<p>If we compare the electrorheological effect for these three fluids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X11429174">Figure 2(b)</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X11429174">(d)</xref>), then it is seen that the MERF F-α is least sensitive to an electric field. The function τ (<italic>E</italic>) changes a little bit more strongly in fluid with F-γ. F-Si has the strongest electrorheological response.</p>

<p>When using a complex dispersed phase in F-CI/α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X11429174">Figure 3</xref>, curve 7), saturation magnetization <italic>J<sub>s</sub></italic> is increased substantially (above 70 kA/m), and the threshold value of the magnetic field at which the saturation occurs (<italic>H<sub>s</sub></italic> = 380 kA/m) also increases. It should be noted that all compositions of MERF containing 5 vol.% of CI have similar magnetization curves that differ little when using different oxide fillers. Their saturation magnetization varies in the range of <italic>J<sub>s</sub></italic> = 60–70 kA/m in a magnetic field with <italic>H</italic> &gt; 350 kA/m.</p>
<p>Comparing the magnetic characteristics of MERF with single dispersed phase with the magnitude of the magnetorheological effect has shown that the largest magnetorheological effect is in the fluid with CI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X11429174">Figure 2(a)</xref>). By increasing the intensity up to <italic>H</italic> = 60 kA/m, that is, up to reaching the saturation magnetization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X11429174">Figure 3</xref>), one can also note the growth in the rheological characteristics of the F-α and F-γ fluids.</p>
<p>Comparing the values of magnetization and magnetorheological response MERF with complex dispersed phase with analogous characteristics for a fluid F-CI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X11429174">Figure 3</xref>, curve 5) allows us to assume that the growth of τ is due to the high sensitivity of CI to the magnetic field. In using a complex dispersed phase, a maximum magnetorheological effect was revealed in F-CI/γ. The values of increments in the shear stress in a magnetic field are smaller and differ slightly for fluids F-CI/α or F-CI/Si. Thus, a magnetic field forms weaker structures in F-CI/α in contrast to its influence on F-CI/γ, since the intensity of magnetization of the α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particles is much lesser.</p>
<p>Due to the high magnetorheological activity of CI, the fluid F-CI/Si displays an increase in τ (<italic>H</italic>) in a magnetic field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X11429174">Figure 4(c)</xref>). However, its magnitude is not so much larger than the increment in τ (<italic>E</italic>) in contrast to other fluids in which this difference is more appreciable.</p>

<title>Rheological Characteristics in Two Fields</title>
<p>The rheological response to the electric and magnetic fields of fluid F-α is very weak, and maximal values of τ reach only 20 Pa. For fluids with F-γ, they are several times higher; moreover, the shear stress grows substantially. In the case of the influence of two fields, the rheological response in the range of shear rates γ  &gt; 10 s<sup>−1</sup> for fluid F-γ appears to be lower than that under the impact of only a magnetic field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X11429174">Figure 2(d)</xref>, curve 4).</p>
<p>Addition of 5 vol.% CI to the composition leads to a change in the rheological characteristics of MERF in a magnetic field and two fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X11429174">Figure 4(a)</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X11429174">(c)</xref>).</p>
<p>The presence of one component insensitive (SiO<sub>2</sub>) or slightly sensitive (α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) to magnetic effect enhances the rheological response MERF in the two fields. Possibly, this occurs because of the action of electric field and creation of the most beneficial polarization conditions for maximum structuring of each of the dispersed phase components separately. The magnetosensitive γ-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particles depending on the relationship between the intensities of the two fields form agglomerates with CI particles, which are stronger than those formed only by the magnetic field, since having united structures, they are capable of being attached to the electrodes.</p>
<p>These peculiarities of structuring for MERF with different fillers create a peculiar nature for every composition that displays the synergistic effect as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X11429174">Figure 5</xref>.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1045389X11429174-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>For fluid F-CI/α, synergistic effect is increased continuously. For F-CI/γ only when <italic>H</italic> &gt; 60 kA/m, at <italic>H</italic> &lt; 20 kA/m, the synergistic effect is most attributable to the electric field. F-CI/Si displays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X11429174">Figure 5(c)</xref>) the highest synergistic effect under all intensities of electric and magnetic fields. It was found that for MERFs with α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or γ-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, the decrease in Δτ<italic>
<sub>EH</sub></italic> in comparison with Δ τ<italic><sub>H</sub></italic> occurs at higher shear rates. On increasing the shear rate, the transformations in the electrorheological structures and magnetorheological structures are intensified differently depending on the relationship between the electric and magnetic forces, as well as on the number of particles involved in the aggregates. It appears possible to not only increase but also lower the induced stress by varying the level of intensities and hydrodynamic regimes. Probably this occurs because part of ferromagnetic particles from these structures are entrained into the common, with-CI magnetic structures increasing their strength not only due to their own magnetic properties, but also because of their attachment to the electrodes, just as in the case of the electrorheological effect.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Investigations have shown that an MERF containing a complex dispersed phase in which one of the components is highly sensitive only to the impact of an electric field (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and the other one, that is, CI, is highly sensitive only to the impact of a magnetic field, shows the strong synergistic effect in the entire investigated range of intensities of electric and magnetic fields. For such types of fluids, the formation of separate strong electric and magnetic structures is typical.</p>
<p>An MERF containing ferromagnetic particles sensitive to the impact of an electric field displays an increasing synergistic effect while reaching saturation magnetization. The second region of the synergistic effect in such fluids is created by fields due to the appearance of strong electrostructures from γ-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> particles in weak magnetic fields. It disappears on increase in the magnetic field strength. The MERFs containing a complex dispersed phase in which one component is weakly sensitive to the actions of both electric and magnetic fields (α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and the other component is CI have only one zone of synergistic effect. For such types of fluids, the formation of structures that are identical for the particles of the two fillers is also typical.</p>
