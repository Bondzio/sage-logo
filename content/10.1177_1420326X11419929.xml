<abstract>
<p>Creating comfortable indoor climates is one of fundamental functions of buildings and buildings use a large amount of energy to fulfill their function. Therefore, it is important to understand how and under what thermal environments, the occupants can achieve their comfort in their normal lives. This paper reports the results from a longitudinal field investigation, which has been conducted to reveal the comfort temperatures of occupants in open plan offices in summer, autumn and winter in Seoul, Korea and to identify the environmental factors that could affect comfort temperatures. The survey results confirm that comfort temperature would vary with seasons. This research provides the evidence to link the indoor and outdoor temperatures along with past thermal experience with comfort temperatures. An adaptive comfort model has been developed by this study for building occupants in Seoul, Korea based on the field investigation. Comparisons between the new adaptive comfort model and existing models have been also made. The establishment of an adaptive thermal comfort model for Seoul would have a significant impact on energy saving and for setting of thermal comfort standard for office buildings in Korea.</p></abstract>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11419929" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>One fundamental function of a building is to create comfortable indoor climates and a large amount of energy is consumed in this process. Fanger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11419929">1</xref>] defines the following conditions for thermal comfort: (1) heat balance between a body and the environment is achieved; (2) both sweat rate and skin temperature are within comfort limits.</p>
<p>From the extensive climate chamber experiment, Fanger proposed an equation for the predicted mean vote (PMV), which has been accepted as standard by American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11419929">2</xref>] and the International Standard, ISO 7730:2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11419929">3</xref>]. The inputs for this equation are: air temperature; relative humidity; mean radiant temperature; air speed; the level of clothing and the metabolic rate.</p>
<p>However, recent studies show that thermal perception of occupants is related with factors beyond fundamental physics of the body’s heat exchange with the environment. Field investigations revealed that comfort temperatures are not fixed as in a heat balance model of thermal comfort, but could be attained by occupants under an environment that would provide possibilities for adjustment and adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11419929">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11419929">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Thus, it is significant to understand how and under what thermal environments occupants could achieve their comfort in their normal lives. This study has an aim to establish what the comfort temperatures in open plan offices are in the summer, autumn and winter in Seoul, Korea and to propose an adaptive comfort model suitable for the office workers in Korea.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-1420326X11419929"><title>Investigated Offices</title>
<p>The J office building in Seoul; the Republic of Korea was selected in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11419929">Figure 1</xref>). The building has its long axis running east-west and contains six stories of cellular and open plan offices. The J building is within a busy commercial district area, surrounded by commercial buildings and low-rise apartment buildings of single-family homes. The second and sixth floors were selected for the field monitoring. The field data obtained from open plan offices were analysed for this study.

<sec id="sec4-1420326X11419929"><title>Monitoring Method</title>
<p>A field investigation was conducted to reveal occupants’ perception and responses to indoor thermal environments and to monitor the use of heating and cooling systems. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11419929">Table 1</xref> shows the details of the monitoring parameters and specifications of the monitoring equipment employed in this investigation.

<p>The questionnaire survey was conducted from 20 July to 28 August 2009 in the summer, from 19 October to 20 November 2009 in the autumn and from 18 January to 19 February 2010 in the winter. Occupants filled in the questionnaire form five times a day (two times in the morning, two times in the afternoon and one time at night). Sixty occupants participated in the questionnaire survey. There were 22 participants on the second floor and 38 participants on the sixth floor. The questionnaire included the subjective evaluation of the indoor thermal environment and the use of heating and cooling systems.</p></sec></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11419929">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the indoor and outdoor temperature distributions for summer, autumn and winter. There was a clear seasonal effect on indoor and outdoor temperature distribution. The seasonal mean indoor temperature ranged from 23.01°C in winter and to 26.14°C in summer (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2,6913)</sub> = 1890<italic>, p&lt;</italic>0.001). In summer, indoor temperature in most cases was over 25°C while outdoor temperature ranged from 21°C to 35°C. There were wide variations in indoor temperatures in the autumn and the lowest temperature recorded was 15°C and the highest temperature was 27°C. On the other hand, indoor winter temperature was mostly over 20°C due to the use of heating systems.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11419929">Figure 3</xref> demonstrates the relationships between indoor and outdoor temperatures for summer, autumn and winter. The determinant of coefficient (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) that measured strength between indoor and outdoor temperatures was 0.27 during autumn (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,4730)</sub> = 1865, <italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001). However, a <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value was the lowest in winter and the indoor temperature was not related to outdoor temperature in winter (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,4548)</sub> = 0, <italic>p</italic> = 1). For the entire monitoring period, there was a close relationship between the two temperatures. The <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value was 0.39 (<italic>F</italic><sub>(2,13826)</sub> = 2488, <italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001). This indicates that the indoor temperatures roughly followed the outdoor temperatures.

<sec id="sec8-1420326X11419929"><title>Adaptive Comfort Model</title>
<p>The adaptive comfort model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11419929">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11419929">9</xref>] correlates comfort temperature with outdoor temperature. In the early models of adaptive comfort temperatures, such as ASHRASE standard 55-2004, the monthly mean of the outdoor temperature was used as a measure of outdoor temperature. Later, Nicol and Humphreys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11419929">9</xref>] proposed exponentially weighted running mean of the daily mean air temperature, which was an improvement on the use of monthly mean temperature. Thus, this study used the running mean outdoor temperatures to calculate daily comfort temperatures. The basic equation, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1420326X11419929">Equation (1)</xref>, for the adaptive comfort model is as follows:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1420326X11419929"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11419929-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>where <italic>T<sub>c</sub></italic>(<italic>n</italic>) is the comfort temperature for a day <italic>n</italic>, and <italic>T<sub>rm</sub></italic><sub>(</sub><italic><sub>n</sub></italic><sub>)</sub> exponentially weighted running mean temperature for a day <italic>n</italic>.</p>
<p>Running mean temperature is given by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1420326X11419929">Equation (2)</xref>:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-1420326X11419929"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11419929-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>where <italic>T</italic><sub>out(</sub><italic><sub>n</sub></italic><sub>–1)</sub> is the mean outdoor temperature for a day <italic>n</italic>−1 and α is constant between 0 and 1; α defines the responsiveness of the running mean to changes in the outdoor temperature and in this way the running mean temperature would reflect the fact that people’s thermal perception would depend on their past thermal experiences. McKartney and Nicol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11419929">8</xref>] show that the <italic>α</italic>-value of 0.8 would give a best fit between running mean temperature and comfort temperature. Thus, the <italic>α</italic>-value of 0.8 is chosen in this study.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11419929">Figure 4</xref> shows a relationship between comfort temperature and running mean temperature. Each dot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11419929">Figure 4</xref> indicates a daily average value. The daily comfort temperatures show wide variations with running mean temperatures. The range of the daily comfort temperatures was from 21.9°C in winter to 27.8°C in summer.

<p><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1420326X11419929">Equation 3</xref> gives the adaptive comfort model, which is obtained from regression analysis using the monitored data in this study:

<p>The <italic>F</italic>-test was used to examine the significance of an overall model. The <italic>F</italic>-test indicates that the model was statistically significant (<italic>F</italic>(1,72) = 107.941, <italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001). The <italic>t</italic>-test was applied to evaluate the significance of an indicator used in this model. The result indicates that a running mean temperature has a significant relationship with the comfort temperature (<italic>t</italic> = 120.533, <italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001). A correlation between the comfort temperature and running mean temperature was considered to be high and the determinant of coefficient, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>, was 0.600. According to Cohen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11419929">10</xref>], a <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value greater than 0.5 would indicate that the size of a correlation is large in social and behavioural research.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1420326X11419929" sec-type="discussion and conclusions"><title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>This study has developed an adaptive comfort model of mechanically cooled offices in Korea based on the longitudinal field surveys of offices located in Seoul, Korea and shows that it is possible to derive statistically significant relationships between comfort temperature and outdoor temperature. The analysis results indicate that the use of exponentially weighed running mean temperature was useful to reflect changes in the thermal perception of occupants as a result of past thermal experiences even in the offices with air-conditioning systems for summer cooling.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11419929">Table 2</xref> compares new adaptive comfort model obtained from this study with the existing two models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11419929">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11419929">11</xref>]. The coefficient of the running mean temperature for the adaptive comfort model by Bouden and Ghrab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11419929">11</xref>] based on field studies in Tunisia was shown to be the highest. With an increase of 1°C in running mean temperature, the comfort temperature in Tunisia would increase by about 0.5°C, but the change in comfort temperatures would be only about 0.1°C according to the new model. This implies that people in Tunisia might have a greater adaptive capacity to changes in outdoor conditions, compared to the adaptive potentials of occupants participated in this study.

<p>Large variations in coefficient values of running mean temperature for three models also suggest that the prevailing indoor conditions that the building occupants experienced are a key factor affecting their adaptive capacity. In Bouden and Ghrab’ study, indoor temperatures measured ranged from 4.8°C to 39.2°C, while the range of indoor temperatures during the occupied period was from 16.5°C to 28.5°C in this study. It seems that the thresholds for comfort temperatures would become greater as occupants are exposed to the wider range of indoor temperatures.</p>
<p>One finding of this study was that daily comfort temperatures in winter were within a very narrow range and changed very little with outdoor temperatures. This is in line with the finding of the early study by Humphreys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11419929">7</xref>]. Humphreys’ analysis indicates that comfort temperatures could remain almost constant when the outdoor temperature falls to below 10°C. Thus, the use of the new adaptive comfort model for winter conditions is not recommended.</p>
<p>The current building standard of Korea specifies the lower limit for the setting of temperature for cooling equipment, which is 26°C in summer. However, our study reveals that occupants feel comfortable even at over 28°C depending on the previous running mean temperature of outdoors. Thus, the developed model can provide necessary data on a scientific basis to set dynamic setting temperatures for cooling systems in summer. This will have a large energy saving potentials as the energy consumption of mechanical cooling systems would be closely linked to setting of temperatures.</p>
<p>The adaptive comfort model in this study relates comfort temperatures with outdoor temperature only. However, the previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11419929">12</xref>] found that the degree of perceived controllability by occupants over their thermal environments could have a significant effect on comfort temperatures. Also, Haldi and Robinson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11419929">13</xref>] showed that the average comfort temperature of occupants in summer would become higher with the use of environmental controls by occupants, and thus actual control has a positive effect on comfort conditions in summer. Future studies should investigate how occupants use their environmental controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11419929">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11419929">15</xref>] and what are the potential relationships between the occupant use of controls and the perception of thermal comfort.</p>
<p>The adaptive comfort model developed in this study was based on longitudinal field investigations of 60 workers. Further studies with a large number of subjects are required to validate and improve the developed model. In particular, potential effects of humidity and air movement on thermal sensation should be carefully examined, as high levels of absolute humidity are common during summer in Korea.</p></sec></body>
