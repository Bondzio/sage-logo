<p>Kim, Losen, and Hewitt’s book introduces the reader to the concept of the school-to-prison pipeline. The school-to-prison-pipeline refers to the convergence of inadequate educational policies in insufficiently funded public schools and a largely punitive juvenile justice system that does little to provide the most at-risk students with educational or mental health services both of which dramatically increase the likelihood that these students will end up with a criminal record rather than a high school diploma. The authors offer disturbing empirical evidence that minorities (e.g., children of color, students with disabilities, English language learners, undocumented and homeless youth, and children in foster care) are most likely to be funneled through the school-to-prison pipeline. They also offer suggestions and legal strategies for advocates to employ to disrupt the pipeline.</p>
<p>The book presents evidence that discriminatory school disciplinary policies are often the first juncture where minority children are channeled through the pipeline. The authors begin by offering some startling statistics regarding the suspension rates of minority students. For instance, suspension rates for African American students have more than doubled over the last 30 years. African Americans are three times as likely to be suspended as White students. In addition, African American students are more likely to be suspended than White students for the same types of offenses. Children who are suspended often fall behind in their school work and find it difficult, if not impossible, to catch up. These children are more likely to drop out of school and have higher arrest and incarceration rates. Kim and her colleagues recommend challenging the imposition of discriminatory school discipline on the basis of race, especially for students who are “similarly situated.” In other words, students who commit like disciplinary infractions should be punished in a similar manner. Differential treatment is a clear violation of the Equal Protection Clause, and the authors note that this is the most common type of litigation related to educational settings. Although they encourage legal advocates to file on the grounds of equal protection, they admit that these cases have produced mixed results.</p>
<p>According to the book, a more disconcerting trend is that minority students are more likely to be filtered into the pipeline as a result of the criminalization of school misconduct. That is, schools have increasingly relied on law enforcement officers to resolve minor school misconduct that was once addressed and resolved by teachers and administrators. Zero tolerance policies have been the number one contributing factor to increased arrests in high schools across the country, especially among children of color and students with disabilities. Some studies show that African American students represent about one quarter of the juvenile population, but they account for almost half of the school-based delinquency referrals. Additionally, disabled or special needs students account for approximately one quarter of all school-based delinquency referrals. Students of color are more likely to be arrested at school than White students who have committed a similar disciplinary infraction. The authors argue that many of these arrests are improper because either law enforcement officers or school officials fail to follow constitutional mandates when investigating school-based infractions and/or alleged criminal behavior. For example, some law enforcement officers may fail to properly advise juveniles of their constitutional right to counsel and their right against self-incrimination. And although school officials are not subject to the same legal standards as law enforcement officers who conduct interrogations, school officials must advise juveniles of their constitutional right against self-incrimination because school officials are considered government agents.</p>
<p>The authors also point out that the criminalization of school misconduct has increased the number of school-based arrests and referrals to law enforcement, which has had a devastating impact on children. School-based arrests have been shown to double the odds that students will of drop out of school, and when coupled with a court appearance, nearly quadruple the odds of dropping out. School-based arrests also lower job prospects for these individuals and increase the likelihood of future contacts with the criminal justice system. As a result, the authors view the criminalization of school misconduct as an ineffective policy that threatens to further burden the juvenile justice system and perpetuate criminal offending among juveniles.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the most troubling allegation made by Kim and her colleagues is that some school officials engage in “push out” policies. The authors make the argument that federal legislation as well as some state policies create a situation whereby school officials feel pressured to “push out” academically underperforming students. As evidence, the authors point to the No Child Left Behind Act, which utilizes standardized test scores to determine the overall performance of a school or district. If racial or ethnic minorities, students with disabilities, English language learners, or economically disadvantaged students consistently fail to meet the established academic proficiency thresholds, accountability measures may be triggered and result in the state taking over the school or district. To avoid this possibility, school administrators may resort to suspending or expelling (pushing out) underperforming minority subgroups. Similarly, states that require senior exit examinations that are intended to improve school performance may have inadvertently created a situation by which school administrators feel compelled to eliminate underperforming students from the testing pool. The empirical evidence bolsters the claims of the authors that poor performing students are often pushed out. One study found that for similar offenses, school officials meted out longer suspensions for on students who performed poorly than students who performed better. Additionally, the “punishment gap” grew significantly during the test administration period, providing evidence that school officials sometimes resort to “selective discipline” to “reshape” the testing pool by excluding low-performing students from the testing pool. The authors note that such practices are a clear violation of the U.S. Constitution that protects students from being denied access to education based on their minority status and that such lawsuits are usually successful. They also claim that attorneys have been successful in litigating such lawsuits because push out practices represent a clear violation of equal protection.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, this is the first book to systematically identify the structural inequalities that exacerbate the educational divide between minority and majority students, and it serves as a serious indictment of school systems that implement and perpetuate discriminatory practices and policies. Minority students and parents of minority students are strongly encouraged to read this book to familiarize themselves with practices and policies that are not only discriminatory, but in many cases, unconstitutional. Educators and school administrators should read this book in an effort to identify and avoid discriminatory policies and practices that may leave them vulnerable to civil liability. This work is also a must read for criminal justice practitioners, especially law enforcement officers employed in schools across the country. It is an eye-opening account of how school administrators have shifted the onus of responsibility for disciplining students to law enforcement, often with devastating consequences. This book will undoubtedly serve as an invaluable resource for legal advocates working in educational and criminal justice settings who are interested in learning about effective litigation strategies that can be used as a basis for disrupting and dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline.</p>
