<p>How to work with people with personality disorder within secure settings is a subject that has often been debated and, until recently, the literature has lacked evidence on the best way to treat people within these settings. However, recent changes to the Mental Health Act in England, together with recent government initiatives, have produced notable developments. In this book, Willmott and Gordon have provided us with a timely account of the field to date, summarizing key areas in service development and treatment, and addressing targets for future direction.</p>
<p>The chapter and author compilation largely focuses the book from the perspective of the clinician, but it should also be read by managers and researchers alike. This is because it delivers a well-rounded perspective of the area in question, examining the point of view of the clinician as well as the service user, before looking, to a lesser extent, to the scope and practicalities of research within these settings. It is a useful source of information to those new to the field as well as those more familiar as it covers a range of topic areas, from staff support mechanisms to the question of validity in research.</p>
<p>Willmott and Gordon have divided the book into five main sections. Section 1 sets out the context of the personality disorder service and some of the difficulties encountered when working in this environment. Section 2 moves on to an overview of what programmes and treatment approaches have been tried to date and a neat overview of the evidence for ‘what works’ with this population. Section 3 deals with the therapeutic relationship, highlighting some of the difficulties encountered in this arena, such as the ‘grey area’ of boundaries. This section also gives a clear service user perspective of the therapeutic journey, voiced by the service user and matched with the viewpoint of the clinician.</p>
<p>Section 4 moves on to focus on the staff, highlighting difficulties in the work and suggesting ways in which the workforce can be developed and supported. Schema theory is used to highlight some of the dynamics encountered and how this can influence the therapist, patient and service as a whole. The section brings the reader back to discuss ways in which these difficulties could be overcome and how staff members can be trained to help them work within the complexities of the environment, including supervision and training strategies.</p>
<p>Section 5 returns to address the research question, including how change can be measured within this environment and dealing with issues such as repeated measures and validity. The final chapter concludes by summarizing and highlighting key areas that have been covered and reiterating the importance of the service user voice.</p>
<p>Overall this is a helpful and insightful text, highlighting key areas from the point of view of those delivering, receiving and evaluating treatment. It offers an easy-to-digest guide to working with people with personality disorder in secure settings, before leading the reader into a thoughtful section on how we can advance and develop treatment and research in this interesting area.</p>
