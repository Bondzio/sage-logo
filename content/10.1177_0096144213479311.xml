<abstract>
<p>Since the death of Jane Jacobs in 2006 there has been a long list of tributes and retrospective evaluations of her work. This essay joins in the retrospection and questions the influence of Jacobs on actual metropolitan development as opposed to writing and talking about metropolitan development. The essay argues that most metropolitan residents have not shared Jacobs’s enthusiasm for diverse, dense, eyes-on-the-street, sidewalk-oriented residential life but instead have gravitated to suburbs, high-rise condominiums, or bland gentrified neighborhoods. Residents have preferred peace and tranquility over vitality and have zoned their lives, maintaining separate physical spheres for home, work, and amusement. The fascination of the great cosmopolitan metropolis is not the diversity and vitality that exists within each block and within walking distance of each residence. Instead, the greatness of the cosmopolitan metropolis is that it encompasses the full range of diverse zones of endeavor and life, all linked by modern means of transportation.</p>

<p>The death of Jane Jacobs in 2006 followed by the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of <italic>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</italic> in 2011 elicited a long list of tributes and retrospective evaluations of Jacobs and her work. Though most commentators lauded her work, some dared to be critical. But no matter the opinions, virtually everyone proclaimed Jacobs one of the most, if not the most, influential thinker about cities of the second half of the twentieth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144213479311">1</xref></sup> Her influential work had changed ideas about cities and left an indelible impression on the thinking of all of us.</p>
<p>Certainly, this proclamation of her great influence was true for urbanists. Throughout the thirty-four years of my teaching urban history, I consistently assigned <italic>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</italic> and just as consistently to sometimes doubting students I lauded it as one of my favorite books. For me and for most students of cities, it was a revelation to be enjoyed with every reading. Also the book influenced shifts in policy. Jacobs was one of a number of critics of urban renewal emerging in the late 1950s and early 1960s who successfully bashed federal urban redevelopment efforts. In addition, her sharp and effective blows aimed at professional planners forced a reexamination of planning dogma. Most importantly, she enthusiastically presented an urban alternative to the supposed American dream of low-density suburban living or Manhattan penthouse luxury that was assumed to be the goal of any sane person. She showed us there was another vital way of life along the traditional city streets.</p>
<p>This evening I am going to join in the retrospection regarding Jacobs and <italic>Death and Life</italic> but question the influence of Jacobs and her thinking on actual metropolitan development and the attitudes of the millions of the metropolitan residents who in fact played the dominant role in determining the course of the metropolis. I would contend that Jacobs’s influence on actual metropolitan development, as opposed to writing and talking about metropolitan development, was quite limited, with only a minority accepting her alternative vision. Fifty years after the publication of <italic>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</italic>, we do not live in a Jane Jacobs world because most metropolitan dwellers have in fact rejected the option and lifestyle Jane Jacobs offered. Though Jacobs was famous for her keen observations of human behavior in cities, she missed some points that were key to the future development of great metropolises. The world consequently has not turned out the way Jacobs hoped. Moreover, Jacobs agreed with me. Her last book <italic>Dark Age Ahead</italic> is an admission that the world had not conformed to her ideas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144213479311">2</xref></sup> Latter-day Attila the Huns were leading the world to a new dark age, a social abyss that Jacobs viewed with trepidation.</p>
<p>The most notable sign of Jacobs’s limited influence on metropolitan development was the continuous pace of suburbanization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0096144213479311">Figure 1</xref>). In <italic>Death and Life</italic>, she largely ignores suburbanization, including a few snide remarks about suburbia typical of 1950s commentators. In her mind, it seems to be a behavioral aberration that she does not seek to understand. Yet the most notable sign of the impending death of the city that she confronts, and the underlying justification for the urban renewal she deplores, was the outward movement of people from the central cities. Massive suburbanization was the preeminent cause and symptom of the apparently approaching death that motivated renewal schemes and the flurry of literature on cities from a wide range of writers, including Jacobs. Even a not very keen observer of the urban world would have noted the moving vans lining the city sidewalks. And despite her appealing account of urban life, the outward flow continued during the remainder of her life until a majority of all Americans lived in suburban areas of the type Jacobs rejected. Even though for the past four decades we have talked about the back to the city movement, each census reveals that the dominant trend has been just the opposite, away from the city streets Jacobs loved.</p>

<p>Similarly, in her adopted hometown of Toronto, the movement to outlying communities has been unremitting. Despite the amalgamation of the old central city of Toronto with its inner suburbs in the 1990s, by the close of the first decade of the twenty-first century, a majority of people in the Toronto metropolitan area lived beyond Toronto’s city limits in fast-growing communities such as Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan, and Markham. The ring municipalities were good examples of what Robert Lang has dubbed boomburbs; with more than 700,000 residents, Mississauga, a municipality that was not even incorporated as a city until 1974, ranked as the sixth largest city in Canada at the time of Jacobs’s death.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144213479311">3</xref></sup> All this has led to the description of the Toronto metropolitan area as Vienna surrounded by Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles part was the area that had attracted the most people in the late twentieth century and continued to do so in the first decade of the twenty-first century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144213479311">4</xref></sup> If people were voting with their feet, Jane Jacobs’s alternative was losing the election.</p>
<p>There has been, of course, a reverse flow, as some have embraced the inner city alternative and eschewed suburbia. But even within the central cities much of the new development attracting residents was antithetical to the preferences of Jane Jacobs. The urban skylines of the early twenty-first century owe more to Le Corbusier than to Jacobs as glass towers predominate, many of them high-rise condominiums set in plazas or parks and housing thousands of central city residents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0096144213479311">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig2-0096144213479311" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0096144213479311-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>This again was especially true of Toronto, a city transformed by a high-rise condominium boom so that by 2011 it ranked first in North America in new construction of high-rise buildings and second only to New York City in total number of skyscrapers. There has been a healthy increase in the downtown Toronto population, but 84% of the people living in downtown residences built from 2001 through 2006 lived in buildings of five stories or more (elevator buildings) and more than a quarter lived in buildings of more than thirty stories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144213479311">5</xref></sup> In other words, most of the new inner city migrants have not moved into Jane Jacobs’s low-rise, eyes-on-the street housing but have been stacked up in the high rises she criticized. For example, a major development of the last decade has been City Place, a series of residential skyscrapers set in a park reminiscent of Le Corbusier. A forty-four-acre waterfront housing project with an anticipated 7,500 dwelling units in soaring glass towers, City Place realized the vision of Le Corbusier in the very heart of Jane Jacobs’s hometown. Without a high-power telescope, most residents could not have eyes on the sidewalk, and the ballet of the sidewalk, if it existed, would be only a distant movement of ant-like figures to the many residents of the thirty-ninth, fortieth, or forty-first floors.</p>
<p>Even low-rise gentrified inner city areas have deviated from the Jacobs vision as they attracted a relatively narrow slice of metropolitan life rather than the diversity of Jacobs’s West Village of the 1950s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0096144213479311">Figure 3</xref>). They have attracted a certain type of affluent people with businesses catering to this narrow segment of society. In most gentrified areas, high rents have precluded a diversity of start-up businesses and a diversity of residents. Glitzy retailers such as Michael Kors and Ralph Lauren line the streets of present-day West Village, displacing the mom-and-pop stores of the past. In 2009, Jane Jacobs’s former townhouse was for sale for $3.5 million, a price that certainly precluded social diversity.</p>

<p>Most notably, neither gentrified low-rise nor glass-encased high-rise residences have appealed to or been within the price range of most families with children. Jacobs devoted a chapter of her book to the advantages of city life for children and notably wrote: “Suburbs must be a difficult place to bring up children.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144213479311">6</xref></sup> Generations of parents have resoundingly rejected this last statement of Jacobs as inner cities have become increasingly childless. By the early twenty-first century, Manhattan was predominantly the domain of childless persons between ages twenty-five and fifty-five. The Manhattan lifestyle was not that of the American family; it was a lifestyle primarily for working-age persons unencumbered with children. In 2000, only 8 percent of the population of the community district containing Jacobs’s West Village was under 18 years of age as compared with 24 percent for New York City as a whole. Forty-five percent of the community district residents were twenty to thirty-nine years old.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144213479311">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, Toronto’s downtown waterfront district increased in population by nearly 25,000 or 133.6 percent between 2001 and 2011, but the number of children 5 to 9 years of age in the area actually dropped 2.6 percent. By the latter date, more than half the residents were 25 through 39 years old.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144213479311">8</xref></sup> Central Toronto, including the Annex neighborhood where Jane Jacobs had lived, fell far below the metropolitan average in proportion of children. Contrary to Jacobs’s views, millions of parents in both the United States and Canada deemed the urban core as an undesirable place to bring up their offspring.</p>
<p>What I am saying is that we do not live in a Jane Jacobs world. Jacobs pointed the way to an alternative way of life but the majority of people headed in the other direction. Jacobs did not divert the prevalent flows of population, did not create a world where most people chose to live in the environment that Jacobs envisioned as necessary for vitality, for life, in the city. She had a marked influence on the people in this room, but there is a big world outside of this room where Jane Jacobs’s imprint is relatively faint.</p>
<p>I would contend that the great bulk of people did not pursue Jane Jacobs’s path because Jacobs was mistaken in her basic vision. When choosing a place of residence (where to live), most people are not seeking vitality, a lively environment, they are instead in search of peace, quiet, tranquility, a deadly environment. In his review of <italic>Death and Life</italic> in 1962, Herbert Gans, a more perceptive observer of the metropolitan scene than Jane Jacobs, correctly noted that “middle-class people, especially those raising children, do not want working-class—or even bohemian—neighborhoods. They do not want the visible vitality of a North End, but rather the quiet and the privacy obtainable in low-density neighborhoods and elevator apartment houses.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144213479311">9</xref></sup> Despite what some planners seem to think, most residents seek a sense of peace rather than a sense of place; tourists not residents seek a sense of place. One’s home is a retreat, a place of comfort and refuge. Hence the large-scale movement to what are perceived as more tranquil suburbs. The earliest planned suburbs copied the curving roadways of cemeteries because like cemeteries they were to be places of quiet contemplation. The suburbs were modeled on cities of death not life, and generations of people moving outward from the city opted for the image of peace and tranquility rather than vitality and twenty-four-hour activity. They sought a deadly quiet community where they could roll up the sidewalks at night, where no one would be outside their home twenty-four hours a day. They were not fans of the ballet of the sidewalk in their neighborhoods. Had the Bolshoi shown up in their front yard, they would have probably called the police. Jane Jacobs’s vision of the ideal place to live simply was not shared by the great majority of people and that is why in 1961 they were moving to the suburbs and would continue to do so for the remainder of the twentieth century. A smaller-than-average home over a candy store in a somewhat rickety old building on a busy city street near a working-class bar was not the prevailing American dream or the prevailing Canadian dream.</p>
<p>Similarly, the dwellers of high-rise inner-city apartments and condos retreated from the street and sidewalk. A doorman and security door ensured that no ballet of strangers would enliven the hallways of their vertical neighborhood. Moreover, the highest-price condos were in the upper floors, farthest and most removed from the life of the street and the sidewalk. The prime location was distant from the street life of the city. Especially prized was a water view, basically a view looking out over nothing, where one could avoid the hubbub of the city and instead enjoy the peace and tranquility of an expanse of nothingness. Residents paid a premium for an unobstructed view; they did not want to see their neighbors, and they certainly did not want their neighbors to see them. In the lofty gated community of the high-rise apartment, one’s home was once again a retreat.</p>
<p>The fact that most people sought a residence removed from the life of the street and sidewalk did not mean that suburbanites or high-rise dwellers necessarily lived dull, empty lives and failed to experience the diverse vitality of the city as Jacobs sometimes seems to imply. Instead, it reflects the fact that people zone their lives. They establish a zone for residence in the suburbs or in a gated high-rise and a zone for work away from their home. In their free time they frequent zones for amusement, once again removed from their home. They may lead a lively existence attending sporting events, cultural attractions, and tourist meccas even though these attractions are not in proximity to their residences. There is a time and place for everything; one might enjoy Mardi Gras and Disney World but not want drunken revelers on their cul-de-sac and Cinderella’s castle and Mickey Mouse impersonators on the lot next door to one’s home. Municipal zoning ordinances are not imposed on an unwilling public by tyrannical officials. Instead, they have been adopted to reinforce the prevailing preference for separate zones of endeavor and to create the type of metropolis most people have wanted.</p>
<p>For most people, the great advantage of the modern cosmopolitan metropolis was not the jumble of diversity and vitality that exists on every block and within walking distance of every home. Instead, the cosmopolitan metropolis is a great and marvelous conglomeration because it offers zones of diversity and vitality as well as zones of peace and tranquility. It offers lively streets and the deadly quiet of cul-de-sacs.</p>
<p>It can accommodate the varied zones of existence because of modern means of transportation. Jane Jacobs emphasizes sidewalks and walking, yet the cosmopolitan metropolis long ago moved beyond the walking city by embracing both public and private transit and the mobility that buses, trains, subways, and autos afford. Freed from reliance on one’s feet, the makers of the cosmopolitan metropolis have been able to create a world that accommodates every niche of society and allows some to live in suburban retreats, others in gentrified townhouses, and still others in high-rise glass towers. With modern means of transit, one has access to all the diverse pleasures of the metropolis with everything in its separate space as deemed desirable by the majority of people.</p>
<p>Jane Jacobs’s great contribution was her contagious enthusiasm for the urban environment in which she lived. She looked around her and recognized the complexity and oft-ignored excitement of the everyday world of the city. She told us to use our eyes and ignore the dogmas of planners. But I think she did not look broadly enough with eyes open to the desires of people she could not comprehend. As students of the cosmopolitan metropolis, I think we should understand the possibility of the good life, not simply in Jacobs’s West Village and its ilk, but in all the varied zones that accommodate the diverse needs and desires of the millions of metropolitan residents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0096144213479311">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>The fascination of the cosmopolitan metropolis is that it is cosmopolitan, a physical manifestation of a broad range of lifestyles and cultures. It bears the imprint not only of Jane Jacobs but also of Ebenezer Howard in Forest Hills and the influence of Le Corbusier in the scores of soaring glass high rises (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0096144213479311">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<p>And yes, it also bears the mark of Robert Moses in the bridges and highways that enable so many to move among the zones of the metropolis. It includes McMansions in New Jersey and McDonalds in Manhattan. It is the site of suburban Asian shopping malls, like the Pacific Mall in Markham outside Toronto advertised as the largest indoor Asian mall in North America. And it offers sidewalk cafes such as the White Horse Tavern near Jane Jacobs’s former home for those fashionable, affluent people who frequent the West Village. It includes the exotic vitality of a suburban mall and the bland gentility of a Manhattan sidewalk. The cosmopolitan metropolis is not the product of one person’s vision; it is not the product of all-knowing planners.</p>
<p>Instead, it is a mélange, a rich mix of the good, the bad, and the ugly, of what Jane Jacobs loved and what Jane Jacobs hated. There is no one type of authentic urban place in the cosmopolitan metropolis, but a vast array of authentic urban places. There are new authentic urban places, old authentic urban places, glamorous authentic urban places, and gritty authentic urban places; Park Avenue is as much a part of the traditional urban fabric, as much an element of the authentic urban heritage, as is the Lower East Side. The authentic (real) city includes low rise and high rise, densely populated and sparsely populated; Staten Island is as much an authentic part of New York City as Manhattan. Great metropolises incorporate the multitude of real, authentic lifestyles of their highly diverse populations.</p>
<p>The cosmopolitan metropolis includes what we like and what we abhor. But one of its fascinations is that many of its residents love what we hate. In other words, it is adapted not only to planners and members of the Urban History Association; it is the fascinating and perhaps incomprehensible creation of both us and all the people different from us. It accommodates those who embrace urban vitality and revel in the ballet of the sidewalk as well as those who yearn for a retreat from their work life and all the noisy, obnoxious people on the sidewalks. It is, then, in its massive breadth and expansive reality, culturally, socially, and physically truly cosmopolitan.</p>
<p>Perhaps someday more urbanists will have as much tolerance, appreciation, and understanding for the diversity of the built environment and the diversity of lifestyles in the cosmopolitan metropolis as they do for the diversity of ethnic groups. If we apply the sharp eyes of a Jane Jacobs, as well as her iconoclastic skepticism of fashionable opinion, to the metropolis as a whole, that day may soon be realized.</p>
