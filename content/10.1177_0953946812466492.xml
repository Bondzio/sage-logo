<abstract>
<p>Søren Kierkegaard and Dietrich Bonhoeffer provide provocatively individualistic, liturgical, Jesus-centered perspectives on anthropology that accentuate the neo-Hegelian, amoral, collectivist perspectives of geneticist Francis Collins, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, and entomologist/political philosopher E. O. Wilson. In the mix of the vagaries of scientific developments, the offense of Jesus Christ does not change, and it seems vital for Christians to testify explicitly against any worldview (economic and/or scientific) that presents human lives (whether self-given sacrificially or taken involuntarily) as the dross of a refined future. It is through the repetitive practice of Holy Communion that Christians consume the gift to see the world <italic>as gift</italic>, not for our own winning or saving.</p>

<body>
<p>For my prior Society for the Study of Christian Ethics (SSCE) keynote, I presented Joanna Jepson’s case for the sanctity of each life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0953946812466492">1</xref></sup> At that occasion, I spoke on selective abortion for disability, but my current research on muscular Christianity more explicitly meddles with the matters of men. Historian Amy Kaplan coined the phrase ‘manifest domesticity’ to describe how procreative practices and mothering norms overlap with the macro-economic ideologies of nation states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0953946812466492">2</xref></sup> I am now working on the macro-side of this overlap, describing the rhetoric of social Darwinism as it naturalizes hierarchy in the US. Here, in my second keynote address to the SSCE, I contrast the anthropology of three men of science to that of two men of theology. To state the contrast bluntly, Kierkegaard and Bonhoeffer provide provocatively individualistic, liturgical, Jesus-centered perspectives on anthropology that accentuate the neo-Hegelian, amoral, collectivist perspectives of geneticist Francis Collins, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, and entomologist/ political philosopher E. O. Wilson.</p>
<p>As public intellectuals, Collins, Haidt, and Wilson draw from different forms of science, and they have more to less appreciation for religion. Haidt has a functional account of religion as patriotic glue; Collins speaks from a heart-felt love for Jesus; and Wilson harkens romantically to a pre-Western, non-organized ‘spirituality’. Despite their differences, both Haidt and Wilson explicitly apply evolutionary biology to social norms, losing the individual in their account of the collective and describing ethics in terms of description. Each defines goodness in terms of obedience to one’s rationally defined role, to ensure organized progress, within an existing order, toward a telos of civilized tranquility.</p>
<p>Kara Slade and I also wish to make a methodological statement regarding the contentious category of ‘science and religion’. In <italic>Conceiving Parenthood</italic>, I suggested that genetics does not raise new ethical questions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0953946812466492">3</xref></sup> Rather, this new anthropological science raises the same old questions for Christians: ‘Who is my neighbor?’ for example, and ‘Who do you say that I am?’ We suggest that the way to circumvent the perpetual cycle of ‘science and religion’ questions is through an unapologetic focus on Christology. A focus on Jesus is the way through the seemingly irreconcilable tension and fruitless conversation in which <italic>science</italic> and <italic>religion</italic> become reified categories. Although I can merely mention this issue here, one of the problems with much of this conversation is the failure to reckon with science itself as a cultural production of neo-liberal, corporate capitalism. (To name one example, Haidt’s research on ‘the hive mind’ moves swiftly to the ‘science’ of worker management.) We believe that <italic>science</italic> and <italic>religion</italic> do not offer variously overlapping perspectives to be appreciated, narrowed, or expanded. Rather, Jesus is the way Christians even begin to see the natural world <italic>as</italic> a world, as apart from our making and taking. And that world includes the matter of Christian anthropology: that is, the stranger in the mirror, the enemy sitting on the bus next to you, or the beloved across the table from me.</p>
<sec id="section1-0953946812466492">
<title>Francis Collins: One Coherent Steady Flow</title>
<p>Cutting to the chase, I believe that Michel Foucault, with his thoroughgoing interrogation of the relation of power, coercion, and science, is a more reliable guide for the faithful than public evangelical and Director of the National Institutes of Health, Francis Collins. As Jenny Reardon notes in her Foucauldian study of the Human Genome Project, ‘this modern age witnessed the entanglement of rules that govern what can count as knowledge with rules that determine which human lives can be lived’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0953946812466492">4</xref></sup> Collins’s naïveté on the historical-cultural construction of genetics as a field leads him to present a blithe account of genetic inquiry and Christian discipleship. His 2007 presentation at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC offers a concise example of his account. There, he mourns the ‘increasingly shrill voices around us who argue that the scientific and spiritual worldviews are incompatible’. Rather, he offers that science and spirituality are ‘not only compatible, but … wondrously complementary’. He recommends ‘a bit of effort on each side to understand each other’, and asks whether those who see ‘science as a threat to faith’ to truly ‘trust in the Almighty, who could hardly be threatened by the efforts of our puny minds to understand his creation’. This creation, he continues, is ‘majestic, awesome, intricate and beautiful—and it cannot contradict itself’. Collins proposes that ‘if we put our trust in God, and resolve to put love above all else, we are promised ultimate victory over all these trials’, and he calls all of his ‘brothers and sisters from every creed and nation’ to ‘love one another’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0953946812466492">5</xref></sup> At the end of his speech at the Prayer Breakfast, Collins pulled out his guitar and asked everyone to sing a hymn entitled ‘Praise the Source of Faith and Learning’ (to the tune <italic>Hyfrydol</italic>, not inconsequentially the tune to which Christians in the US sing ‘Come, Thou Long Expected Jesus’):<disp-quote>
<p>Praise the source of faith and learning who has sparked and stoked the mind</p>
<p>With a passion for discerning how the world has been designed.</p>
<p>Let the sense of wonder flowing from the wonders we survey</p>
<p>Keep our faith forever growing and renew our need to pray.</p>
<p>God of wisdom, we acknowledge that our science and our art</p>
<p>And the breadth of human knowledge only partial truth impart.</p>
<p>Far beyond our calculation lies a depth we cannot sound</p>
<p>Where Your purpose for creation and the pulse of life are found.</p>
<p>As two currents in a river fight each other’s undertow</p>
<p>Till converging they deliver one coherent steady flow,</p>
<p>Blend O God our faith and learning till they carve a single course</p>
<p>Till they join as one, returning praise and thanks to You, their Source.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0953946812466492">6</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Frankly, I cannot read Collins without hearing Tennyson’s ‘In Memoriam A.H.H. Canto 56’:<disp-quote><p>Man, her last work, who seem’d so fair,</p>
<p>Such splendid purpose in his eyes,</p>
<p>Who roll’d the psalm to wintry skies,</p>
<p>Who built him fanes of fruitless prayer,</p>
<p>Who trusted God was love indeed</p>
<p>And love Creation’s final law?</p>
<p>Tho’ Nature, red in tooth and claw</p>
<p>With ravine, shriek’d against his creed?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0953946812466492">7</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Francis Collins’s answer to the cruelty of nature is threefold. First, a rule of competitive struggle may underscore the inexplicable miracle of altruism. On the website of <italic>BioLogos</italic>, the organization Collins founded in 2007, a staff writer put this point succinctly, ‘Radical altruism is currently somewhat mysterious.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0953946812466492">8</xref></sup> Second, if altruism turns out to be scientifically predictable, then such studies may reinforce his case for theism. Third, and most characteristically, Collins uses suffering to magnify his call to redouble efforts in the genetic sciences: ‘Though there are legitimate concerns about setting appropriate boundaries for this research, we also have a strong ethical mandate to proceed as quickly as possible, so long as a sick child lives somewhere in the world who could be helped.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0953946812466492">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Christian faith has more to deal with regarding genomics than the technique of boundary-keeping. It seems to me incumbent on an evangelical Christian at least to reckon with the legacy of religion and genetics in history. From Charles Kingsley’s attempt to write a Darwinian natural theology serviceable to Queen Victoria to Harry Emerson Fosdick’s endorsement of coerced sterilization, leading men of Protestantism have baptized social programs of inequality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0953946812466492">10</xref></sup> To change this pattern would require Collins to make his Jesus-centered pietism political. In his affirmation of the good coherence of creation, and in his avowals that we are ‘clearly all part of one big worldwide family’, Collins exhibits his amiability and his optimism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0953946812466492">11</xref></sup> But he does not take readers into the heart of redefined kinship through Baptism or through the profligate grace of Holy Communion. Neither does he move outward from either liturgy toward a prophetic politic of solidarity. Should Collins eventually do so, he may counter the new eugenics and witness for the dignity of life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0953946812466492">
<title>Jonathan Haidt: Bringing Out Our ‘Inner Bee’</title>
<p>It is incumbent on a Christian geneticist to give such a witness during a time when public intellectuals are wielding human biology to defend inequality as a natural state of affairs. One such public intellectual is Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist whose books are ostensibly about ‘Great Ideas’ (capital G, capital I, according to his website) and who has become a popular commentator on political instincts in the US.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0953946812466492">12</xref></sup> Since winning the Templeton Prize in Positive Psychology in 2001, Haidt has sought to speak with scientific authority on happiness, civic virtue, and the functional value of religion. By his account, organized religion is useful inasmuch as it binds individuals toward a clear goal; the celebration of violence is functional inasmuch as it allows disparate groups to identify themselves as a nation-state; and patriotism is natural, and conducive to overall human flourishing, because it channels biological instincts toward a common good. Group-thinking helps ‘suppress our inner chimp and bring out our inner bee’, allowing for a ‘hive’ mentality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0953946812466492">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In his book <italic>The Righteous Mind</italic>, Haidt succinctly applies these basics to organizational management:<disp-quote>
<p>[A]n organization that takes advantage of our hivish nature can activate pride, loyalty and enthusiasm amongst employees and then monitor them less closely. This approach to leadership (sometimes called transformational leadership) generates more social capital—the bonds of trust that help employees get more work done at a lower cost than employees at other firms. Hivish employees work harder, have more fun, and are less likely to quit or to sue the company. Unlike <italic>Homo economicus</italic>, they are truly team players.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0953946812466492">14</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Haidt’s emphasis on channelling human hive instincts to encourage team work is thoroughgoing. In another essay, ‘Doing Science as if Groups Existed’, he makes a case against the ‘spell’ of ‘methodological individualism’, a ‘belief system’ that limits an evolutionary perspective on ‘group level selection’ and downplays the benefits of living in ‘bee-like ways’. It is no wonder, Haidt explains, that many evolutionary scientists fail to appreciate the goods of organized religion: ‘Like fraternities, religions may generate many positive externalities, including charity, social capital (based on shared trust), and even team spirit (patriotism).’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0953946812466492">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Within Haidt’s stories of group cohesion, individualism often functions as a synonym for selfishness; he subtly equates altruism with social conformity. In his <italic>New York Times</italic> op-ed on the death of Osama bin Laden, ‘Why We Celebrate a Killing’, he explains that evolutionary biology is the key to understanding ‘all that was good, healthy and even altruistic about [those] celebrations’:<disp-quote>
<p>[H]umans, far more than other primates, were shaped by natural selection acting at two different levels simultaneously. There’s the lower level at which individuals compete relentlessly with other individuals within their own groups. This competition rewards selfishness. But there’s also a higher level at which groups compete with other groups. This competition favors groups that can best come together and act as one. Only a few species have found a way to do this. Bees, ants and termites are the best examples. Their brains and bodies are specialized for working as a team to accomplish nearly miraculous feats of cooperation like hive construction and group defense … We have all the old selfish programming of other primates, but we also have a more recent overlay that makes us able to become, briefly, hive creatures like bees … This two-layer psychology is the key to understanding religion, warfare, team sports and last week’s celebrations. [By way of Emil Durkheim’s theory of] ‘collective effervescence’: the passion and ecstasy . . . found in tribal religious rituals [that] dissolve the boundaries that separate them from each other [we can discern that the] celebrations were good and healthy … America achieved its goal—bravely and decisively—after 10 painful years. People who love their country sought out one another to share collective effervescence. They stepped out of their petty and partisan selves and became, briefly, just Americans rejoicing together.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0953946812466492">16</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This call for Americans to emerge from our ‘petty and partisan selves’ and join a joyful throng is also reflected in his summons to social psychologists to embrace ‘the bright future of post-partisan’ research. By loosening its commitment to ‘liberal values’, social psychology may ‘escape from some ruts’ that limit the field, leading to ‘better science and freer thinking’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0953946812466492">17</xref></sup> Haidt redefines authoritative, traditional group thought-processes as counter-cultural, while simultaneously narrating coherence as more natural than dissent. He also goes one step further, recommending that social scientists courageously reclaim race as relevant to a schema of evolution. By thwarting the liberal status quo, such prophetically conservative thinkers may reinvigorate the now limited field of social science.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0953946812466492">18</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section3-0953946812466492">
<title>E. O. Wilson: A Thorough Understanding of Scale in Time and Space</title>
<p>Although group cohesion is beneficial to human existence, Haidt explains, <italic>fundamentalism</italic> involves too much cohesion. He writes ‘If I could wave a magic wand and have all fundamentalists converted into non-fundamentalists overnight, I would do so and be confident the world would become a better place.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0953946812466492">19</xref></sup> The ability for individuals to shed their particular identities and join for common cause is useful, but they require a leader capable of directing them subtly and rationally, without transparent coercion or culturally arbitrary commitments. Entomologist E. O. Wilson makes the case for such robust, scientifically-based leadership in his books <italic>Consilience</italic> and <italic>The Social Conquest of Earth</italic>. What humans need is someone with a god’s-eye perspective, capable of understanding both temporality and geography—a master cartographer of human existence:<disp-quote>
<p>Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going? … these are in fact the central problems of religion and philosophy … Humanity today is like a waking dreamer, caught between the fantasies of sleep and the chaos of the real world. The mind seeks but cannot find the precise place and hour. We have created a Star Wars civilization, with Stone Age emotions, medieval institutions, and godlike technology. We thrash about. We are terribly confused by the mere fact of our existence, and a danger to ourselves and to the rest of life. Religion will never solve this great riddle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0953946812466492">20</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Wilson does not take the work of such sleuthing blithely, and he does not share Francis Collins’s optimism. Group-on-group agonism, he contends, is fundamental to human existence:<disp-quote>
<p>Our bloody nature, it can now be argued in the context of modern biology, is ingrained because group-versus-group was a principal driving force that made us what we are. In prehistory, group selection lifted the hominids that became territorial carnivores to heights of solidarity, to genius, to enterprise. And to <italic>fear</italic>. Each tribe knew with justification that if it was not armed and ready, its very existence was imperiled.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0953946812466492">21</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>His account of the history of war reflects what he sees as the need for evolved, hierarchical thinking. While the task of civilizing is arduous, it is also a basic impulse within groups. To paraphrase Haidt, to illumine Wilson’s entomological anthropology, bees need a queen to sort through and direct the drones.</p>
<p>Spencer Wells’s popular account of evolutionary genomics, <italic>Journey of Man</italic>, presents the trek out of Africa as a winnowing process toward European excellence, and Wilson follows this narrative, adding an explicitly political component.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0953946812466492">22</xref></sup> His account of the emergence of the state draws on the behavior of ants, wasps, and bees, as well as on genealogical studies such as Jared Diamond’s <italic>Guns, Germs, and Steel</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>With larger size and farther reach comes greater complexity. And as with complexity of any physical or biological system, the society, in order to achieve stability and survive and not quickly crumble, must add hierarchical control … Translated to the cultural evolution of simpler societies into states, [organizational psychologist Herbert] Simon’s principle suggests that hierarchies work better than unorganized assemblages and that they are easier for their rulers to understand and manage. Put another way, you cannot expect success if assembly-line workers vote at executive conferences or enlisted men plan military campaigns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0953946812466492">23</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Wilson’s narrative of social evolution naturalizes hierarchy within groups and between groups. Complex societies adapt to flourish by sorting individual participants by function, and such societies are, by definition, more evolved than ‘unorganized assemblages’. The ‘ancestors who achieved the breakout from Africa and conquered Earth’ moved spatially and temporally toward civilization, away from their origins in ‘small bands’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0953946812466492">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>As with Spencer Wells’s account, Wilson situates ‘modern-day Africans’ as atavistically sublime. They represent both a pristine, pre-historic past, and, correspondingly, a ‘reservoir’ for studying human heredity. Africans are, by Wilson’s telling, ‘a treasure house for all humanity’, inasmuch as their ‘genetic diversity’ is crucial ‘during an increasingly uncertain future’. For, he continues, ‘Humanity is strengthened by a broad portfolio of genes that can generate new talents, additional resistance to diseases, and perhaps even new ways of seeing reality.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0953946812466492">25</xref></sup> Wilson’s <italic>Social Conquest of Earth</italic> ends with his use of Gauguin’s use of Tahiti, in an unapologetically romantic summons to find truly rational answers by meditating on exoticized beauty.</p>
<p>When Daniel Dennett came to Duke University in 2006 to lecture on the ambitious topic of ‘Darwin, Meaning, and Truth’, he showed a slide of an indistinct item and asked the audience to guess what it was. After various people guessed incorrectly, he suggested we take a perspective from high above the earth and then explained that the image was a satellite photograph of ‘mammals gathered at the Ganges’, meaning, of course, people. I was reminded of Dennett’s lecture on reading a long section of E. O. Wilson’s similarly ambitious <italic>Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge</italic>. Wilson explains that ‘<italic>Consilience</italic> among the biological sciences is based on a thorough understanding of scale in time and space. Passing from one level to the next, say molecule to cell or organ to organism, requires the correct orchestration of changes in time and space.’ He calls for a shift in perspective that would allow humans to view the evolution of humanity within a moment and then to allow ourselves to be shaped accordingly. Here an excerpted (but, granted, still long) section of <italic>Consilience</italic> is necessary:<disp-quote>
<p>Five hundred miles southeast in Amazonian Peru lives Pablo Amaringo, mestizo shaman and artist. Drawing on the traditions of his Amerindian forebears … Amaringo conjures visions and depicts them in paintings … His dreams are populated with serpents in most of their Amazonian cultural roles … Imagine that we can speed or slow the time we spend with him, while expanding or shrinking the space we see in and around his person. So we enter his house, we shake his hand, and Amaringo shows us a painting. The actions consume seconds or minutes. An obvious fact, so why mention it? The question makes more sense when put in another form: Why did these familiar actions not consume millionths of seconds, or months, instead? The answer is that human beings are constructed of billions of cells that communicate across membranes by chemical surges and electrical impulses. To see and speak with Amaringo entails a sequence of these units covering seconds to minutes, not microseconds or months. We think of that span of time as normal and somehow standard for the world in which we live. It is not. Because it involves Amaringo and us, all of whom are organic machines, it is only organismic time. And because the full apparatus of our communication takes up from millimeters to meters of surface and volume, not nanometers or kilometers, our unaided minds dwell entirely in organismic space … Imagine now that with the best of our instruments (and his permission!) we can look into the brain of Pablo Amaringo. By magnifying the image, his smallest nerves come into view … We watch as a nerve cell discharges: Along the length of its membrane, the voltage drops as sodium ions flow inward. At each point on the shaft of the nerve cell, the events consume only several thousandths of a second … With our field of vision now brought to a space only one tenthousandth that of our original field, the events occur too swiftly to be seen. An electric discharge of the cell membrane crosses the field of vision faster than a rifle bullet. To see it—remember, as human observers we are still in organismic time—we must record and slow the action down enough to witness events that originally occurred in a few thousandths of a second or less. We are now in biochemical time, a necessity if we are to observe events in biochemical space … In the midst of this magic Amaringo keeps talking, but is scarcely aware of the changes that occurred as our own actions accelerated a thousandfold. Only enough of his time has elapsed for one or two words to be spoken. We turn the dials in the opposite direction, shift time and space until his full image reappears and his words flow through our minds at an audible pace. We turn the dials further. Amaringo shrinks in proportionate size and speed-walks jerkily out of the room, like an actor in an early silent film. Perhaps he does so in frustration because we are now frozen in position like marble statues. Our vision continues to expand. Let us rise in the air to gather more space. Our view grows to encompass the town of Pucallpa and then a large stretch of the Rio Ucayali valley. Houses disappear, new ones pop up. Day blends with night into continuous twilight as the flicker-fusion frequency of our organismic-time vision is exceeded. Amaringo grows old, he dies. His children grow old, they die. Nearby the rain forest is changing. Clearings appear as great trees fall, saplings spring up, the gaps close. We are now in ecological time. We turn the dials again, and space-time expands still more. Individual persons and other organisms are no longer distinguishable, only blurred populations—of anacondas, ayahuasca vines, the people of central Peru—and these can be seen across the passage of generations. A century of their time collapses into a minute of ours. Some of their genes are changing, in both kind and relative frequency. Detached from other human beings and shorn of their emotions, godlike at last, we witness the world in evolutionary time and space.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0953946812466492">26</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section4-0953946812466492">
<title>Not by Way of Necessity: Kierkegaard on Divine Love and Human Freedom</title>
<p>We turn now to the single individual in ordinary time. The character who pens Kierkegaard’s <italic>Philosophical Fragments</italic> is Johannes Climacus, John the Climber, named after a seventh-century monk who wrote the <italic>Ladder of Paradise</italic>. The Climacus who authors <italic>Philosophical Fragments</italic> also writes by way of concatenation, but the links or steps do not string or climb upward. They curve around, like a Möbius strip. As Howard and Edna Hong write in the introduction to their translation, this is ‘the most abstract of all Kierkegaard’s writings’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0953946812466492">27</xref></sup> Kierkegaard’s playful earnestness in the text is one way to address the all-encompassing, epistemological presumption of someone like Wilson. Climacus moves through basic, Augustinian doctrinal affirmations, not through proof (in fact he has a proof against proofs) but through the continual affirmation of a given premise: the moment that the eternal becomes temporal is of ultimate significance. The moment that is the incarnation is the presumption that creates the individual in ordinary time.</p>
<p>Kierkegaard’s main interlocutor in this pseudonymous fragment is Hegel, and one of his deleted sections makes his disagreement clear. It works as a scrap to tape onto Wilson’s attempt at <italic>Consilience</italic> and Haidt’s endorsement of the ‘hive mind’:<disp-quote>
<p>Too bad that Hegel lacked time; but if one is to dispose of all of world history, how does one get time for the little test as to whether the absolute method, which explains everything, is also able to explain the life of a single human being. In ancient times, one would have smiled at a method that can explain all of world history absolutely but cannot explain a single person even mediocrely.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0953946812466492">28</xref></sup></p>

<p>Kierkegaard did not edit out an epigraph to <italic>Fragments</italic>, which serves as a warning for Christians who answer Hegel’s summons to create an exhaustive, scientific system of knowledge: <italic>Better well hanged than ill wed</italic> (a paraphrase from <italic>Twelfth Night</italic>). In an explanation in the Preface to <italic>Concluding Unscientific Postscript</italic>, Kierkegaard writes, ‘better well hanged than by a hapless marriage to be brought into a systematic in-law relationship with the whole world’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0953946812466492">29</xref></sup> To make his whimsical case too bluntly, Kierkegaard displays that, unless a Christian begins, and begins again, with Jesus, she will find many alluringly legitimating methods of authority, many reasonable diversions toward a career in the world of reason. Unless she begins with Jesus, she will lose herself and her neighbor. Granted, a focus on ‘the savior’ may make a scholar into a fool, and Climacus acknowledges that ‘to write a pamphlet is frivolity—but to promise the system, that is seriousness and has made many a man a supremely serious man both in his own eyes and in the eyes of others’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0953946812466492">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>I read all of Kierkegaard’s texts, pseudonymous and signed, by way of <italic>Works of Love</italic>. Reading <italic>Fragments</italic> in this way highlights that, in being ill-wed, a neo-Hegelian loses ethics. In a succinct essay, the late Julia Watkin named the cost clearly:<disp-quote>
<p>Loss of contact with ethics occurs firstly through the thinker’s make-believe standpoint in which he or she takes some fantastical God’s-eye position outside the universe, that is, outside existence. Since objective thinking, in that it concerns description of the world, has no relation to the individual thinker’s personal life, daily life becomes an inconvenient appendage to the great work of System-building (CUP, 1:119, 122-23). Secondly, there is a loss of ethics in the Hegelian-style System because it contains ethics and morality as a necessary process. Yet in a necessary process there can be no freedom and hence no ethics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0953946812466492">31</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a section entitled ‘Interlude’, Climacus introduces the non-necessity (or gratuity) of existence as requisite for individuality and freedom. Climacus recommends this ‘Interlude’ as an intermission, to take up time between his discussion of the contemporary follower of the savior and the one who follows the savior many centuries after the savior’s death. Kierkegaard here plays a helpful, philosophical game with his readers, making an oblique case for God’s gracious love as the continued, sustaining <italic>given</italic> for life.</p>
<p>Climacus links necessity to a form of eternally occurring, unbroken, knowledge. He conjures up a system of notions he terms ‘the Socratic’, and, within this Socratic system of self-questioning, the individual ‘acquires’ truth ‘by himself’ in time, but not really <italic>in time</italic>. Because the germ of truth has been within all along, the ‘temporal point of departure’ for knowing oneself is meaningless. What is meaningful is the <italic>eternal</italic> truth, which exists outside of time. In this conjured, Socratic system, ‘there is no Here and no There’. There is only an ‘everywhere and nowhere’. Climacus suggests that this removes the ‘decisive significance’ of ‘the moment’ and makes discovery of ‘the truth’ inevitable. This system renders a ‘savior’ not only superfluous but insulting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0953946812466492">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a footnote, Kierkegaard, as the editor of <italic>Fragments</italic>, tells a meaningful joke. After Climacus has suggested ‘let us assume that we know what a human being is’, Kierkegaard plays around with the word ‘assume’, for, after all, does not ‘assume’ assume some sense of ‘doubt’? And, ‘in our theocentric age’ doesn’t everyone ‘<italic>know</italic> … what a human being is’? Kierkegaard then relates a story of skepticism whereby ‘man is what we all know’, and, because ‘we all know what a dog is’, it follows that ‘man is a dog’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0953946812466492">33</xref></sup> This is characteristic of Kierkegaard, to place a key point in a seemingly pointless footnote. It is precisely the case, he intimates, that I have no idea who I am, and that I am not in any sort of position to discover who I am. One character in <italic>Either/Or</italic> puts this beautifully: ‘When I consider its various epochs, my life is like the word <italic>Schnur</italic> in the dictionary, which first of all means a string, and second a daughter-in-law. All that is lacking is that in the third place the word <italic>Schnur</italic> means a camel, in the fourth a wisk broom.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0953946812466492">34</xref></sup> I have been accused of embracing ‘worm theology’ (meaning a theology that makes self-humiliation into a redemptive work) but note that a camel is not a worm, and neither is a daughter-in-law. The form of <italic>Fragments</italic> may read at some points like Anselm’s <italic>Cur Deus Homo</italic>, but Climacus does not focus on guilt. The conundrum of existence, at least in this text, is not a matter for humiliation or rectifying justice, but of love. Climacus backs the reader into the singular importance of Phil. 2.5-11. God came in time, as a servant, to seek, in love, nothing less than equality with each one of us. In his ‘fairy tale’ of a king and a beloved maiden, Climacus connects the existence of a true self not with our ascent upward out of untruth toward truth but with God’s descent toward us, in time, out of love. ‘If the moment is to have decisive significance’, so the refrain of <italic>Fragments</italic> goes, ‘the god’s love … must be not only an assisting love but also a procreative love by which he gives birth to the learner.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0953946812466492">35</xref></sup> It is within such a relation of love that I receive myself and a neighbor. What Kierkegaard spends hundreds of pages narrating in <italic>Works of Love</italic>, Climacus depicts briefly in a scene of philosophical sparring: the <italic>wonder</italic> of life is love, and God’s grace in Jesus creates both a lover and a beloved.</p>
<p><italic>Fragments</italic> is not only about grace, but about a very specific, embodied practice of grace, in which God becomes tangible, <italic>edible</italic>, in time. It was precisely the enchantment of transubstantiation that offended some of Hegel’s followers. Yet, by Kierkegaard’s reckoning, love is not naturally necessary. It is free, and more akin to magic, more conducive to fairy poetry, than to prosaic philosophy. The ‘Interlude’ dwells on the non-necessity of the actual, on the freely occurring present that exists because of the incarnation. And this section connects the situation of the contemporary follower, who sees the savior face to face, and the current follower, who seemingly follows at a distance of centuries. Climacus suggests that his own readers, by grace, may encounter the same presence of the savior as did the savior’s original followers, through the moment that is the eternal in ordinary time. This repetitious moment is not something to be ‘passed along like real estate’; it is ‘built upon the abyss’, and ‘the whole thing is in suspense’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0953946812466492">36</xref></sup> My response, in the real (but absolutely non-necessary) presence of the one who makes me actually, magically, present, is wonder. This is the individual in ordinary time—the individual created and sustained each moment by the grace-filled presence of Jesus Christ in Holy Communion.</p>

<title>All Other Ground Is Sinking Sand: Dietrich Bonhoeffer on Existence in Time and Space</title>
<p>Even in the midst of the most extraordinary and perilous of times, another theologian indebted to Kierkegaard pointed his readers toward the seemingly ordinary answer that is Jesus. In 1932 and 1933, as the Weimar Republic fell and the National Socialist regime came to power, Dietrich Bonhoeffer delivered two series of lectures that would later be published as <italic>Creation and Fall</italic> and <italic>Christ the Center</italic>. By reading these two texts closely together, we suggest that Bonhoeffer also provides a response to those who would create an all-encompassing and coherent system correctly to orchestrate the temporal and spatial scale of a well-defined human condition. To the extent that E. O. Wilson’s questions ‘Where did we come from? What are we? Where are we going?’ define sociobiology’s account of a scientifically legitimated anthropology, they may be the wrong questions entirely.</p>
<p>To ask ‘Where did we come from?’ is to reach for a story of humanity’s origins. For Wilson, this is explicitly central to his own project, and intrinsic to the human religious impulse. In his account, the ‘creation myth’ is ‘a Darwinian device for survival’ and the ‘essential bond that held the tribe together’, such that ‘no tribe could long survive without the meaning of its existence defined by a creation story’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0953946812466492">37</xref></sup> By contrast, in <italic>Creation and Fall</italic>, Bonhoeffer names the effort to grasp our own beginning and ground ourselves in it as contrary to rightly ordered human existence. It is instead a primary symptom of the fallen state, of humanity <italic>sicut deus</italic>—shorn of all connection to God and to neighbor and thus (in Wilson’s words) ‘godlike at last’:<disp-quote>
<p>Humankind no longer lives in the beginning; instead it has lost the beginning. Now it finds itself in the middle, knowing neither the end nor the beginning, and yet knowing that it is in the middle. It knows therefore that it comes from the beginning and is moving toward the end without knowing what that means. This makes it hate the beginning and rise up in pride against it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0953946812466492">38</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The inability to live from the temporal middle, and the consequent attempt to ‘take a gigantic leap back into the world of the lost beginning’ and to ‘seek to know for ourselves what humankind was like in its original state’, is neither rhetorically neutral nor morally innocuous. The re-presentation of a pristine or authentic prior human state can all too easily ‘identify our own ideal of humanity with what God actually created’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0953946812466492">39</xref></sup> As Bonhoeffer knew all too well, the answer to ‘Where did we come from?’ can be turned in favor of a particular vision of the present and of the future, painting it as the inevitable course of destiny. His alternative is potentially unsatisfying for those wishing to give an objective account of time from a vantage point outside of it, as he posits that ‘it is only from Christ that we can know about the original nature of humankind’ and thus ‘only in the middle, as those who live from Christ, do we know about the beginning’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0953946812466492">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>But the one who is unable to live from the middle is also the one who places themselves in the center, in the place of Christ who situates the single individual in time and in space. In our reading of Bonhoeffer, the re-telling of creation history also becomes a re-imagining of salvation history, in which Western, neo-Hegelian man takes the place of the God-Man in defiance of both the center and the boundaries of existence. The question of anthropology becomes a question of Christology:<disp-quote>
<p>Thus for their knowledge of God human beings renounce the word of God that approaches them again and again out of the inviolable center and boundary of life; they renounce the life that comes from this word and grab it for themselves. They themselves stand in the center. This is disobedience in the semblance of obedience, the desire to rule in the semblance of service, the will to be creator in the semblance of being a creature, being dead in the semblance of life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0953946812466492">41</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Wilson’s question ‘What are we?’ is the question of classification into this system. This is the act of the human <italic>logos</italic> that has usurped the center, as it extends itself ever outwards in its own explanatory, soteriological project:<disp-quote>
<p>All scientific questions can be reduced to two: What is the cause of X?, and What is the meaning of X? The first question embraces the realm of the exact sciences and the second the study of the arts; both belong together … Both are concerned with the question of classification. An unknown object can become known when it is possible to put it in an already existing classification. How does object X fit into the existing order? The question is directed towards the possibilities of the object, its ‘How?’ The object is determined, encompassed, and recognized by its ‘How?’, i.e. the immanent, human <italic>logos</italic> determines the ‘How’ of the object by its classification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0953946812466492">42</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The impulse to draw all that is unknown into the realm of the human <italic>logos</italic>—into the system—is also an impulse toward dominance. Sociobiology most often represents not the obvious, top-down hierarchy of colonialism, but a soft hierarchy that asserts its strength by drawing all claims to difference, all claims from a counter-<italic>logos</italic> against or outside the order into itself. Through the assertion of exhaustive, explanatory power, these public scientists serve in some ways as a new priesthood. Citizens eager for rationally secure answers to existentially grand questions read and repeat their findings on everything from religious awe to sexual identity to political dissent. And, by bringing all matters within their purview, this scientific project inspects and categorizes individuals and groups, giving order to seeming chaos and offering guidance toward a purportedly common goal.</p>
<p>How, then, might it be possible to introduce a counter-<italic>logos</italic>, a witness to <italic>otherwise</italic>? As Bonhoeffer suggests, as long as that counter-<italic>logos</italic> appears as an idea—even as a ‘Great Idea’—its contrary claim will itself be classified, negated, and assimilated through a relentless process of synthesis. It is only when the Counter-Logos appears as the Word-made-flesh, as a person in history, that the domination of an all-encompassing, self-legitimating system is truly challenged. Here, the human <italic>logos</italic> is confronted by the one who declares himself to be the way, the truth, and the life:<disp-quote>
<p>The only real question which now remains is ‘Who are you? Speak for yourself!’ The question, ‘Who are you?’, is the question of dethroned and distraught reason; but it is also the question of faith: ‘Who are you? Are you God himself?’ This is the question with which Christology is concerned. Christ is the Counter-Logos. Classification is no longer a possibility, because the existence of this Logos spells the end of the human logos. Only the question, ‘Who are you?’, will do. The phenomenon is opened up only by this. He answers only to the question, ‘Who?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0953946812466492">43</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is not ‘Where?’ or ‘What?’ that points to a way forward; it is only ‘Who?’ But ‘Who?’ is a dangerous question; indeed, it is <italic>the</italic> dangerous question. To ask ‘Who?’ is to reach the boundary of one’s own existence and to encounter the one who is wholly and completely other, the one who, as the risen Christ, impertinently turns the questioning of the human <italic>logos</italic> back on itself:<disp-quote>
<p>The question, ‘Who?’, is simply the religious question. It is the question about the other person and his claim, about the other being, about the other authority. It is the question of love for one’s neighbor. Questions about transcendence and existence become questions about the person.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0953946812466492">44</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>

<title>‘Creation Somewhat Aslant’</title>
<p>With these ‘questions about the person’, Bonhoeffer brings us back to conclude where we began: with ‘Who is my neighbor?’, and ‘Who do you say that I am?’ These seem to us to be the questions of Christian anthropology. How am I to perceive the firing of neurons and mass of vivified matter sitting before me? What am I to say about this plate full of bread, this cup full of wine, as it sits on a table before us? Is my task one of description and classification, or is it one of invitation?</p>
<p>Hegelian thought cannot tolerate the strangeness of unclassifiable particularity. Within the logic of the system, the prosaic ordinariness of each individual life must be redeemed through a larger theme, through a more beautiful idea. The eternal Word made gritty in ordinary time is yet more of the same problem, intensified. In <italic>Philosophical Fragments</italic>, Climacus further notes that the savior takes the form of a servant—not clothed in disguise, but <italic>as</italic> a servant. Within the hierarchy of Western thought, servitude marks the distance between those who think big, timeless thoughts and those who prepare the daily bread (and wash up the mess). We suggest that the offense of Jesus Christ does not change, and Western Christians still try to spin the scandal of a servant-savior. We believe that those ensnared in the tangle of theology and science must keep that scandal in the foreground—by confessing a foolhardy, creedal faith and by proclaiming that God’s grace carries a different logic than evolutionary progress.</p>
<p>We are increasingly certain that Jurgen Moltmann’s <italic>Nein!</italic> to Pierre Teilhard de Chardin’s <italic>Ja</italic> is a word that bears repeating, as social Darwinism reproduces itself today:<disp-quote>
<p>Evolution always means selection. Many living things are sacrificed in order that ‘the fittest’—which means the most effective and the most adaptable—may survive. In this way higher and increasingly complex life systems, which can react to changed environments, undoubtedly develop. But in the same process milliards of living things fall by the wayside and disappear into evolution’s rubbish bin. Evolution is not merely a constructive affair on nature’s part. It is a cruel one too. It is a kind of biological execution of the Last Judgment on the weak, the sick and the ‘unfit’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0953946812466492">45</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It seems vital for Christians to testify explicitly against any worldview that presents human lives (whether self-given sacrificially or taken involuntarily) as ‘fertilizers’ of a redeemed future.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0953946812466492">46</xref></sup> Christians do have a counter witness to Haidt’s organizational anthropology and Wilson’s anthropological conquest, but we must venture the Word made flesh in the form of a servant. More specifically, we need to return repeatedly to the qualitatively different, unproductive economy of the table and receive the Word made flesh, in liturgically ordinary time. There, we consume the gift to see the world <italic>as gift</italic>, not for our exhaustive accounting, or winning, or even our self-sacrificial saving.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0953946812466492">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Haidt and Wilson are keen to dissect anthills for clues to who we are, and Francis Collins offers a roadmap for closing the gap between is and ought—eliminating suffering by way of concerted team work. In closing, I offer for further meditation a poem from Vassar Miller, who lived with cerebral palsy and whose work offers an unsentimental, individually unique reckoning with vulnerability:<disp-quote>
<p>Become the friends of small things, I take</p>
<p>crickets and gnats for topic,</p>
<p>even the ant arched by my dog’s armpit,</p>
<p>for whom I will write an epic</p>
<p>and thereby give him a voice which none</p>
<p>ever did for the ant,</p>
<p>even the Lord who made vocal chords,</p>
<p>creation somewhat aslant.</p>
<p>But he shall surely speak through my verses,</p>
<p>(you can like it or lump it)</p>
<p>the ant no child hears with ears still magic.</p>
<p>My poem shall prove his trumpet.</p>
<p>For he earns it, he and every other</p>
<p>animated caprice,</p>
<p>to me even their limited warfare</p>
<p>being a gesture of peace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0953946812466492">48</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is my continued hope that we, who are also small things, animated by the caprice of the Triune God, may discover repeated gestures of peace in him who <italic>is</italic> our peace.</p>

<p>Wilson, <italic>The Social Conquest of Earth</italic>, pp. 98-99. Herbert Simon does suggest that hierarchies confer evolutionary advantage and are more mathematically tractable than other complex systems, but he qualifies that argument multiple times and reaches a very modest conclusion. He demurs from almost all discussion on the applicability of his models to the largest societal scales, since ‘[historians] prefer the validated particular fact over tendentious generalization’. Crucially, Simon also admits that <italic>if non-hierarchical complex systems exist</italic>, they may ‘escape our observation and our understanding’ indefinitely since they would require ‘knowledge and calculation of interactions beyond our memory or computation’ to study. See Herbert A. Simon, ‘The Architecture of Complexity’, <italic>Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society</italic> 106.6 (1962), pp. 467-82.</p>

<p>We chose the topic for this keynote well before learning that Sarah Coakley was traversing similar terrain in her 2012 Gifford Lectures, <italic>Sacrifice Regained: Evolution, Cooperation and God</italic>. At this point, I (Amy Laura Hall) find three potential problems with her project. First, while I appreciate very much that Coakley’s emphasis on Jesus is an improvement on the inchoate deism of many theologians (or scientists) who work on these questions, I believe that Coakley risks losing the unrepeatability of the cross in her emphasis on sacrificial participation. Participation in Jesus’ sacrifice seems dangerously close to a productive, and potentially necessary, repetition of cruciform sacrifice. This mistakes our work for God’s work, and could lead to an over-emphasis on human responsibility for collaborating in ventures presuming to mark evolutionary progress. Second, and relatedly, to pull within Christology a Western story of progress, the arc of which moves upward, toward an end of human history, seems potentially to write human time progressively rather than cyclically, that is, liturgically. The amillennial, liturgical emphasis within Anglicanism illumines ecumenical work on nature and faith, and I would hate for any conversation with sociobiology to lessen this light. Third, although Coakley takes sobering account of the ways that sociobiology has underwritten sexual essentialism, and offers a Christoform alternative, she has yet fully to note the ways that the field of evolutionary biology has underwritten the very colonialism with which the Anglican Communion must deal, with patience and repentance. I am hopeful that such work is to come, and that Coakley may then more fully and prophetically call for the economic recalibration she mentions at the conclusion of her Gifford Lectures.</p>
