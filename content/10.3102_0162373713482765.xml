<abstract>
<p>For at least two decades, studies have demonstrated that the least experienced and credentialed teachers are concentrated in poor, minority, and low-performing schools. Some blame provisions in collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) between teachers unions and school districts that favor senior teachers. Seniority preference rules, they say, exacerbate the “teacher quality gap” by allowing experienced teachers to transfer. Using data from Florida, the authors analyze whether and how CBAs influence the distribution of teacher quality within school districts, paying special attention to staffing rules that grant preferences to senior teachers. They find little evidence that the within-district variation in teacher quality between more and less disadvantaged schools in Florida is explained by the determinativeness of union contract rules.</p>

<p>F<sc>or</sc> at least two decades, studies have demonstrated that the least experienced and credentialed teachers are concentrated in poor, minority, and low-performing schools (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162373713482765">Darling-Hammond, 2003</xref>). Some blame provisions in CBAs between teachers unions and school districts that favor senior teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162373713482765">Ballou, 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162373713482765">2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162373713482765">Hess &amp; Kelly, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162373713482765">Johnson &amp; Donaldson, 2006</xref>). Seniority preference rules, they say, exacerbate the “teacher quality gap” by allowing experienced teachers to transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162373713482765">Ballou, 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162373713482765">Hess &amp; West, 2006</xref>). Overwhelmingly, teachers choose not to teach in schools with poor, minority, and low-performing students and seek transfers to schools with higher income and higher performing students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162373713482765">Cha &amp; Cohen Vogel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162373713482765">Cohen-Vogel &amp; Osborne-Lampkin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162373713482765">Cohen-Vogel, Osborne-Lampkin, &amp; Houck, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162373713482765">Esch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162373713482765">Hanushek, Kain, &amp; Rivkin, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Because transfer and assignment provisions in CBAs vary from district to district (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162373713482765">Cohen-Vogel &amp; Osborne-Lampkin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0162373713482765">Strunk &amp; Grissom, 2010</xref>), we can explore whether and how they influence the distribution of teacher quality within school districts. A few studies have examined whether seniority rules affect teacher distribution, but these have reached contrary conclusions. In attempting to help resolve the debate, we replicate and build upon a methodology used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski and Horng (2007)</xref> in California and modeled on a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162373713482765">Terry Moe (2005)</xref> to teacher quality and contract data in Florida. Specifically, by analyzing data on teacher qualifications in districts with varying seniority rules, we address the following questions: Do school districts with contract provisions that favor senior teachers have, on average, teachers with lower qualifications? Are differences in teacher qualifications among schools in Florida greater within school districts with more determinative transfer and seniority provisions? Compared with other districts, do those with more determinative transfer and seniority rules have larger teacher quality gaps between more and less disadvantaged schools?</p>
<p>In the remainder of this article, we discuss with whom teacher staffing decisions lie and catalog the various types of provisions in Florida’s CBAs that pertain to such decisions. We give special attention to staffing rules that grant preferences to senior teachers. Next, we examine the limited literature on teacher staffing practices and the ways seniority rules may limit principals’ abilities to control just who teaches at their schools. Before discussing the methodologies used, we consider the limited, conflicting evidence regarding whether preferences for senior teachers embedded in bargaining agreements result in an inequitable distribution of teacher qualifications. In the “Findings” section, we present the results of our analysis and find that schools located in districts with bargaining rules that give senior teachers preference for transfers and leaves employ, on average, lower quality teachers. However, there is little in our evidence that suggests that the variation in our measures of teacher quality between more and less disadvantaged schools is explained by the determinativeness of union contract rules.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section2-0162373713482765">
<title>CBAs and the Staffing Provisions Therein</title>
<p>The authority to hire teachers and assign them to schools rests with school principals, local school districts, and the CBAs their trustees negotiate with teachers unions. Such agreements typically consist of rules governing employment conditions (e.g., school calendar, length of work day, teaching loads), teacher evaluations and due process, and hiring, assignment, and dismissal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162373713482765">Kerchner, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162373713482765">Kerchner &amp; Mitchell, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0162373713482765">McDonnell &amp; Pascal, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0162373713482765">1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0162373713482765">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0162373713482765">Osborne-Lampkin &amp; Cohen-Vogel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0162373713482765">Simpkins, McCutcheon, &amp; Alec, 1979</xref>). Among provisions governing teacher hiring and assignment are rules granting senior teachers preference in filling vacancies in the district, maintaining their posts when schools reduce positions, and returning to their positions after leaves of absence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0162373713482765">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Florida, as in states around the nation, these transfer and leave provisions differ from district to district. A transfer is defined as a move from one school in the district to another and may be voluntary or involuntary. Elsewhere, we show that of the 65 agreements that describe procedures for voluntary transfers in Florida, 47 (72%) specify the criteria by which teachers’ transfer requests are approved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162373713482765">Cohen-Vogel &amp; Osborne-Lampkin, 2007</xref>). Among the criteria, seniority is the most common. In filling teacher vacancies, 89% of CBAs in Florida grant preferences to teachers currently employed by a school district (possessing seniority) over outside candidates. In approximately 9 of every 10 districts in Florida, agreements specify that a new teacher ought not be hired until (a) candidates in the school in which the vacancy exists have been considered; (b) candidates for voluntary and involuntary transfer in the district have been considered; (c) excessed candidates, or those laid off as the result of a prior reduction in force, have been considered; and/or (d) candidates who are current district employees have been considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162373713482765">Cohen-Vogel &amp; Osborne-Lampkin, 2007</xref>). Preference in some contracts may simply come in the form of advance notification of vacant positions or the scheduling of “transfer fairs” prior to open “teacher job fairs” in the spring. In other cases, agreements require that insiders be interviewed for a position, be selected if all else is equal, or be hired if they are qualified.</p>
<p>Involuntary transfer provisions govern the process for moving teachers between schools when teacher unit allocations are adjusted as the result of changes in school enrollments. Similarly, “reductions in force” refer to layoffs driven by declining enrollments, budgetary constraints, and reorganization. In Florida, provisions that specify criteria by which teachers are selected for involuntary transfer and reduction are nearly universal (in 97% of contracts). In nearly all of these, seniority plays a role in teacher selection. In nine districts, seniority is the sole criterion for selection. In other districts, it is the determining factor when all other criteria are equal. In still others, it is simply listed as one among a list of factors that principals need to weigh. Among Florida’s school districts, the definition of seniority varies as well. Ten CBAs define seniority in terms of the years of service in the subject area in which the reduction is to occur; that is, contracts specify that those with the least seniority in the subject area are reduced first. Others define seniority as the length of continuous service in the district; two consider length of service outside the district (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162373713482765">Cohen-Vogel &amp; Osborne-Lampkin, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A leave is permission for an employee to be absent from his or her duties for a specified period of time and includes the right and responsibility to return to work at the end of this time. In Florida, all 66 contracts describe procedures for teacher leaves. Of these, 11 (17%) guarantee teachers their prior assignments when they return from leaves of up to 1 year.</p>

<sec id="section3-0162373713482765">
<title>Contract Implementation: Seniority Provisions and Staffing Practices</title>
<p>But how do district and school administrators interpret and implement these provisions? Few studies have looked specifically at the processes by which school officials make teacher staffing decisions, and fewer still have examined how contract provisions may condition administrator practice.</p>
<p>References in the literature to teacher staffing show up predominantly in studies related to teacher supply. These studies focus on factors, such as salary, market conditions, and teacher preferences about where to teach, that lie largely outside the control of individual school administrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162373713482765">Levin, Mulhern, &amp; Schunck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0162373713482765">Levin &amp; Quinn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0162373713482765">Liu, Rosenstein, Swan, &amp; Khalil, 2007</xref>). Fewer studies have considered the demand side of the equation: the ways administrators make decisions about whom among the pool of applicants to hire, transfer, and reduce in times of declining enrollment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162373713482765">Cohen-Vogel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162373713482765">Cohen-Vogel &amp; Rutledge, 2009</xref>). Recently, scholarly attention to teacher hiring practices has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0162373713482765">Liu &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0162373713482765">Strauss, Bowes, Marks, &amp; Plesko, 2000</xref>). Overall, these studies have found that school principals appear to exercise substantial influence over teacher hiring and remain “the primary gatekeepers” for decisions about who will teach in their schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0162373713482765">Rutledge, Harris, Thompson, &amp; Ingle, 2008</xref>, p. 243). Studies about administrators’ transfer and reductions-in-force decisions are still mostly absent. In one exception, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162373713482765">Cohen-Vogel (2011)</xref> found that principals use test score data when approving transfer candidates or reassigning teachers to different grades or subject areas. The author concluded that “staffing, in the context of state accountability pressures, is at least in part ‘evidence-based’” (p. 498).</p>
<p>Research suggests that principal influence over teacher staffing is not without its limits. Recently, some (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162373713482765">Ellsasser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162373713482765">Hess &amp; West, 2006</xref>) have blamed seniority rules in teachers union contracts for forcing public school systems to hire “teachers in urban classrooms each year with little regard for the appropriateness of the match, the quality of the teacher, or the overall impact on schools” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0162373713482765">Levin et al., 2005</xref>, p. 7). According to this report, these staffing rules limit administrators’ selection of 4 of every 10 teachers hired. Teacher vacancies are filled instead by existing teachers who request transfers to the school or “excessed” teachers previously laid off as the result of budget cuts or declining enrollment.</p>
<p>If bargaining agreements were changed to reduce seniority preference rules, would teacher staffing practices look any different? One early study on the topic suggests not. Officials from districts in Florida where CBAs do not specify criteria for the approval of voluntary transfers interpret the omission as authorization to transfer applicants as they see fit. Nevertheless, in one midsized district, for example, where the contract does not specify the criteria for selection, 222 of the 300 teachers who transferred in 2005 were awarded transfers on the basis of seniority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162373713482765">Cohen-Vogel &amp; Osborne-Lampkin, 2007</xref>). Possible explanations for de facto preferences for senior teachers is that superintendents have often been teachers themselves and because some clauses stipulate that contract provisions should be interpreted in ways that are consistent with past practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162373713482765">Cohen-Vogel &amp; Osborne-Lampkin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0162373713482765">Hess &amp; Kelly, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0162373713482765">Lieberman, 2000</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-0162373713482765">
<title>Do Seniority Rules Perpetuate a “Teacher Quality Gap” Within School Districts?</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162373713482765">Hess and West (2006)</xref> argued that transfer provisions grant “senior teachers the plum assignments, with little regard for their skills, the needs of their students, or the implications for recruiting and retaining new teachers” (p. 27). As a result, they wrote, the most senior teachers in many cities are concentrated in the most desirable schools, while students in low-performing, predominantly minority, and high-poverty schools are taught by less experienced teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162373713482765">Cohen-Vogel &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162373713482765">Ellsasser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162373713482765">Feng, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162373713482765">Guin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162373713482765">Hess &amp; West, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162373713482765">Hill, 2006</xref>). In the first rigorous analysis of the effects of transfer provisions on teacher quality, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162373713482765">Moe (2005)</xref> showed that schools with higher percentages of minority students have more inexperienced and uncredentialed teachers than other schools in the same districts. He went on to find that strong seniority transfer rules more than double the negative effect minority composition has on the percentage of inexperienced and uncredentialed teachers in a school. In interpreting his coefficients, Moe reported that “the typical disadvantaged school” in districts with no transfer rules has about 7.43 low-quality teachers, compared with 5.22 in “the typical advantaged school.” But, when transfer rules are strong, “disadvantaged schools get a proportion of low quality teachers that is an extra .09 higher than that of advantaged schools—which translates into a difference of another 2.84 low quality teachers” (p. 26).</p>
<p>An American Federation of Teachers study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162373713482765">Nelson, 2006</xref>) came to a different conclusion. With data from the National Center for Education Statistics, the study showed that the transfer rates of teachers in high-poverty schools in which teachers do and do not work under CBAs (which, presumably, grant teachers transfer rights) are 7.5% and 11.3%, respectively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0162373713482765">Nelson (2006)</xref> also found that 1st-year teachers replace transferring (more senior) teachers in low- and high-poverty schools at about equal rates when the schools are located in districts that have CBAs. In districts without CBAs, however, high-poverty schools replace transferring teachers with 1st-year teachers about 3 times as often as do low-poverty schools. The study did not control for other factors that might affect transfer rates such as school size, class size, and school growth.</p>
<p>A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski and Horng (2007)</xref> addresses this limitation by including measures of school and class size. It also used hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) that nested schools within districts. One major argument for using a multilevel modeling technique such as HLM is to control for the intraclass correlations between schools within the same district. Provisions in CBAs operate at the district level. In their analysis of the within-district effects of seniority preference rules, the authors found no persuasive evidence that seniority preference rules have an independent effect on the distribution of teachers among schools or exacerbate the negative relationship between higher minority schools and inexperienced, uncredentialed teachers. They showed that the quality gap indeed exists but that it “exists regardless of the precise language of transfer provisions in CBAs” (p. 298).</p>
<p>Recently, states such as New Jersey and school systems in Los Angeles and New York have moved to eliminate seniority preference rules for teacher transfers. Last year, <italic>Vergara v. California</italic> was filed, claiming that teacher protections in the law violate students’ constitutional rights to an equal education. The lawsuit argues that state laws and district policies protect ineffective teachers who disproportionately teach in predominately poor Latino and African American neighborhoods by giving teachers permanent employment after a year and a half and laying them off starting with the least senior, not the least effective (see also <italic>Reed v. California</italic>). If, when we have completed our analysis, we conclude, as did <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski and Horng (2007)</xref>, that no association exists between seniority rules and the distribution of teacher quality, then such actions are unlikely to substantially address the problem. By helping identify or dismiss reasons for inequitable distribution patterns, the study will inform the courts and other policy makers about the likely impact of various reform ideas for closing the “teacher quality gap” and giving students in schools on “both sides of town” a more equal chance at future success.</p>

<sec id="section5-0162373713482765">
<title>An Analytic Approach</title>
<p>To answer whether Florida districts with more determinative transfer and leave provisions have lower quality teachers overall and larger teacher quality gaps among schools, we first applied a coding scheme from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski and Horng (2007)</xref> and an ordinary least squares model with school and district covariates. Second, we ran a district fixed-effects model similar to that used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162373713482765">Moe (2005)</xref>. Finally, we used the multilevel modeling approach used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski and Horng (2007)</xref>. We expanded Moe’s and Koski and Horng’s analyses to include additional outcome measures and additional variables to represent conditions we argue may help or impede a school’s ability to retain and recruit high-quality teachers.</p>
<p>To begin, we combined data from CBAs from the population of unionized school districts in Florida<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0162373713482765">2</xref></sup> with school and teacher data from the Florida Department of Education. Assignment provisions in the CBAs were coded, and each district was assigned two scores reflecting the cumulative strength—what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski and Horng (2007)</xref> referred to as the “determinativeness”—of their transfer and seniority provisions. We regressed the two CBA scores on three sets of teacher quality measures—experience, credentials, and college aptitude scores—to compare teacher quality in schools located in districts with more and less determinative CBA provisions. To assess whether more determinative CBA districts have larger teacher quality gaps between more and less disadvantaged schools, we then estimated additional models that included terms wherein transfer and seniority provisions were interacted with measures of school disadvantage. Before describing the data and model specifications, we unpack the state policy context in which collective bargaining between teachers unions and Florida’s school districts occurs.</p>
<sec id="section6-0162373713482765">
<title>Context of the Study</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162373713482765">Hess and West (2006)</xref> argued, state politics can influence the collective bargaining environment by establishing laws and regulations governing the bargaining process. One of 24 right-to-work states in the United States, Florida has statutes prohibiting unions from making membership a condition of employment. The constitutional amendment that established Florida as a right-to-work state in 1968 also forbids Florida’s public employees from striking. However, Florida is also among the few southern states with laws providing bargaining rights to teachers. In 2000, state affiliates of the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers merged to form the Florida Education Association. Teachers in 66 of Florida’s 67 school districts are unionized and operate under CBAs. Up by over 10,000 members in the past 2 years, the Florida Education Association reports a membership of 140,000 teachers and education staff professionals in the state.</p>
<p>Florida plays a prominent role in national policy discussions related to school improvement and teacher quality in particular. It is the fourth most populous state in the nation and an innovator in educational programming, with the first statewide voucher program, pay-for-performance system, and elimination of teacher tenure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162373713482765">Harrison &amp; Cohen-Vogel, 2012</xref>). Limiting our analysis to a single state allowed us to control for potentially different legislative and policy contexts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0162373713482765">
<title>Coding Florida’s CBAs</title>
<p>We gathered CBAs for all 66 school districts that have CBAs in Florida. The agreements ranged from 45 to 168 pages in length, and all covered the 2002–2003 academic year. Although provisions governing transfer and leave were normally set apart in separate sections, we analyzed the entirety of each contract to ensure the inclusion of isolated clauses and provisions-in-combination that were germane to transfers and leaves.</p>
<p>Transfer provisions in CBAs establish rules and procedures for voluntary and involuntary transfers. Voluntary transfer provisions in Florida, like those in California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski &amp; Horng, 2007</xref>), generally set out criteria for selecting from among transfer candidates to fill open positions. Transfer provisions in some Florida districts do not mention seniority; more frequently, however, provisions include seniority among a list of factors (e.g., certification type, commuting distance) in selecting among candidates. Seniority, in these instances, is not determinative. In Columbia County, for example, the agreement with the union states that in making decisions regarding voluntary transfers,<disp-quote>
<p>the principal will consider all eligible applications for the position, and, in arriving at a decision regarding the most qualified candidate, will base his/her decision on certification, experience applicable to the subject or grade level (including but not limited to teaching experience), length of service in the District, and other factors that he/she deems pertinent to the position.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other districts, seniority takes priority over all other criteria when two or more transfer candidates have equal credentials. We called teacher seniority in these contexts “determinative.” According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski and Horng (2007)</xref>, it is “the very rare case in California” that senior teachers have “bumping” rights (p. 269); the same is true in Florida. In fact, only one school district in Florida has a CBA that gives senior teachers who desire a transfer the right to displace another from an occupied position.</p>
<p>In filling vacant positions, bargaining agreements in Florida frequently give preference over “new hires” to teachers who are currently employed by a school district. Depending on the district, preference for current teachers can be in the form of advanced notification of an open position, requirements that all applicants for the vacancy who are currently teaching in the district be interviewed, or stipulations that all district employees be placed before any new teacher is hired. In Florida, as in California, many agreements require that reasons be provided either verbally or in writing to inside applicants who are not selected.</p>
<p>Teachers can also be transferred involuntarily. In Florida as in California, involuntary transfers generally fall into two categories. “Administrative transfers” are made at the discretion of district administrators when “the interest of the educational program will be better served.” Although over half of the state’s bargaining agreements provide for administrative transfers, they are reportedly very rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162373713482765">Cohen-Vogel &amp; Osborne-Lampkin, 2007</xref>). The second kind of transfers, those that are made when layoffs are necessary as the result of budget cuts or enrollment decreases, are typically governed by reduction-in-force provisions. In these cases, seniority can play a decisive role and in one district these provisions permit the displacement of less senior teachers by their more senior counterparts. According to the CBA between the teachers union and school district in Lee County,<disp-quote>
<p>If there is no vacancy [in the receiving school] in the teacher’s area of certification, the teacher shall be placed in the position of the least senior teacher with the appropriate area of certification and teaching assignment. In no event shall an involuntary transfer teacher replace a teacher who has greater seniority. The teacher of second seniority ranking in a certification area shall be placed next, and so on until the teacher is placed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, seniority does not always play a decisive role in involuntary transfers. According to the contract between the teachers union and the Citrus County School District on Florida’s gulf coast, for example, administrators use teacher performance and certification as the primary criteria for the selection of teachers for involuntary transfers out; seniority is considered only when all else is equal.</p>
<p>With regard to teacher leaves, CBAs in Florida, in accordance with Florida Statute 231.39, outline a variety of reasons (e.g., personal, professional, military, maternity, medical) for which teachers may take leave from work. Reasons for which teachers qualify for leaves are largely consistent across districts. Similar to California, teachers in virtually all school districts in the state are guaranteed their prior assignments upon returning from work from short-term leaves (personal days, bereavement leave, short-term medical and family leave). Also similar to California, by contract or by law (i.e., the Family Medical Leave Act), teachers taking longer leaves (personal, medical, professional) are guaranteed a position in the district. In Florida, these cases extend to leaves taken up to 1 year. But contracts differ in terms of whether teachers are entitled <italic>to their prior assignments</italic> upon return from long-term leave. Although some districts’ CBAs guarantee employees their prior positions, others only guarantee returning employees comparable or equivalent positions to the ones they left. In the contract between the union and the school board in Bay County, for example, teachers are returned to their former positions “if a vacancy exists”; otherwise, they are placed in a “substantially equivalent position” to the ones they left. Unlike in California, CBAs in Florida do not provide for paid leaves that extend beyond 1 year.</p>

<title>Transfer Scores</title>
<p>We coded the CBAs in all sampled districts using the coding framework used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski and Horng (2007)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0162373713482765">3</xref></sup> Specifically, we coded each CBA by answering six questions, reproduced here in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0162373713482765">Figure 1</xref>. Like Koski and Horng, we used the coded data to assign each district a score (TSCORE)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0162373713482765">4</xref></sup>—the sum of the six coding questions—to reflect the overall strength of its transfer and leave provisions. These scores ranged from 0 to 8, with most schools located in districts with transfer scores of three or four (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0162373713482765">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, as did Koski and Horng, we created a second score (TSENIOR) with the value for Question 1 only. They argued that the answer to Question 1, with its focus on voluntary transfers, likely has the greatest influence on teacher distribution. This score distinguishes districts with contracts that have no seniority language to guide transfer procedures, list seniority among a set of criteria that must be considered in selecting teachers for transfer, and require that seniority be determinative in these decisions. Schools in the state are equally split between districts that use seniority as a determinative factor for teacher transfers and using seniority as one of the factors considered, with another 20% of schools being located is districts that do not list seniority among the criteria for selecting teachers to fill vacant positions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0162373713482765">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p><sup>i</sup>Koski and Horng had a fourth possible code for this question. They assigned a code of 3 to contracts that allowed voluntarily transferred teachers to displace less senior teachers from currently occupied positions at the receiving school. There were no contracts in Florida that provided for this.</p>
<p><sup>ii</sup>Following the same logic used for coding the other questions, we coded Question 6 as a 0-or-1 dummy variable, not 1 or 2 as used by Koski and Horng. We argue that assigning 1 or 2 instead of 0 or 1 artificially inflates the weight of Question 6 in the overall transfer score.</p></caption>

<title>Outcome Variables</title>
<p>We combined scores created from the bargaining agreements with data from the Florida Education Data Warehouse, an integrated database with teacher- and student-level information. The data included detailed information on teacher demographic characteristics, certification status, experience, and aptitude as well as information about the schools and districts in which teachers are employed. Our teacher sample consisted of all full- and part-time teachers who taught courses in the 66 districts during the 2002–2003 school year, the year covered by all coded CBAs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0162373713482765">5</xref></sup> We excluded substitute teachers from our sample and others whose primary assignments were not teaching (e.g., administrators, counselors). The percentage of teachers in our sample with over 3 years of teaching experience was 76%. Eighty-nine percent were professionally certified, 2% held National Board Certification, and the average combined SAT score was 950 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0162373713482765">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>We used the Florida Education Data Warehouse data to construct two measures of teacher quality used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162373713482765">Moe (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski and Horng (2007)</xref>: (a) the percentage of professionally certified<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0162373713482765">6</xref></sup> teachers in a school (PER_CERT) and (b) the percentage of teachers in a school with at least 3 years of teaching experience<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0162373713482765">7</xref></sup> (PER_EXP). We added three additional measures used by others who study teacher quality: school average teaching experience, National Board Certification, and SAT scores. Specifically, we calculated (c) the average number of years that all teachers in a school have been teaching (AVG_EXP), (d) the percentage of teachers with National Board Certification in a school (PER_NBC), and (e) the average SAT scores of the teachers in a school (AVG_SAT).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0162373713482765">
<title>Additional Variables</title>
<p>In our analyses, we included the school-level controls that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski and Horng (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162373713482765">Moe (2005)</xref> included in theirs. The natural logarithm of student enrollment (ENROLL) was included because schools with large enrollments may be more likely to hire uncredentialed and inexperienced teachers “because teachers tend to prefer teaching in smaller schools with greater sense of community, less school bureaucracy, and stronger personal relationships” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski &amp; Horng, 2007</xref>, p. 281). We included school growth rate (GROWTH) because rapid growth in a school’s student population may lead some principals to hire brand-new teachers with little experience and incomplete credentials. Because teachers may be motivated to move to schools with smaller class sizes while schools with small class sizes also need more teachers and, consequently, may be more likely to hire less experienced and lower credentialed teachers, we included each school’s average pupil/teacher ratio as a proxy for class size (CSIZE) in the model. Finally, two measures of school minority enrollment, the percentage of black students and the percentage of Hispanic students, were included in the model. Prior research has suggested that teachers prefer working in schools with fewer minority, low-income, and/or low-performing students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162373713482765">Boyd, Lankford, Loeb, &amp; Wyckoff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162373713482765">Clotfelter, Ladd, &amp; Vigdor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162373713482765">Feng, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162373713482765">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162373713482765">Hanushek et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162373713482765">Imazeki, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0162373713482765">Scafidi, Sjoquist, &amp; Stinebrickner, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In our models, we included additional measures of the schooling environment, including academic needs, discipline, and family income. The school environment thus measured has been shown to be important in terms of retaining current teachers and recruiting new ones. We argued that not including these variables may pose omitted variable biases; to the extent that these additional variables measure the overall attractiveness of a school relative to other schools in the same district, omission of these controls may lead to spurious relationships between CBA scores and the teacher quality in a school. Academic needs included the percentage of a school’s population identified as gifted (PER_GIF), English-language learners (PER_ELL), and qualifying for exceptional student education (PER_ESE).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0162373713482765">8</xref></sup> Academic needs were included because reported shortages of teachers with certification in exceptional student education and educating English-language learners may lead some principals with large populations of English language learners and special-needs students to hire more inexperienced or otherwise less qualified teachers. Discipline, as measured by the number of disciplinary incidents reported per pupil (DISC), was included because teachers prefer to work in safe and orderly environments in which classroom behavior is conducive to learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162373713482765">Feng, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162373713482765">Figlio, 2006</xref>). Finally, family income was measured as the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-priced lunch (PER_FRPL). As a measure of student disadvantage, PER_FRPL along with the percentage of minority students in a school (PER_MIN) is important to include in the Florida context, where some ethnic minorities (e.g., Cubans) live in relative wealth and some rural Whites live in poverty. Descriptive statistics for the school-level variables are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0162373713482765">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162373713482765">Moe (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski and Horng (2007)</xref>, we also included district size (DSIZE) because districts with larger numbers of schools have more transfer options for teachers than districts with fewer. DSIZE was measured by the number of schools in a district.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0162373713482765">9</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0162373713482765">Rose and Sonstelie (2010)</xref> also pointed to the importance of accounting for district size, finding that teachers unions in larger districts have more bargaining power as measured in terms of premiums for teaching experience. We also included district poverty (D_FRPL) and racial composition (D_BLK and D_HSP) to account for the challenges faced by high poverty and high minority school districts in retaining their best teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162373713482765">Boyd, Lankford, Loeb, Rockoff, &amp; Wyckoff, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162373713482765">Feng, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162373713482765">Hanushek et al., 2004</xref>). D_FRPL, D_BLK, and D_HSP were measured by the proportion of students in the district who were free or reduced-priced lunch eligible, African American, and Hispanic, respectively.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Simple pairwise correlations were run to look at the relationships between the strength of CBA rules and measures of teacher quality. Then, to test the complex relationships between transfer or leave and seniority scores and variation in teacher quality, we used district covariate, district fixed-effects, and multilevel district random-effects models.</p>
<p>To begin, we estimated an ordinary least squares model that predicts teacher quality in school <italic>i</italic> in district <italic>j</italic> as a function of that school’s characteristics, the determinativeness of district CBA provisions, and interactions between school characteristics and the provisions. It also controls for district features that may be correlated with the determinativeness of their CBAs. In short, this district covariate model allowed us to disentangle whether any relationship between the determinativeness of the CBA provisions under which a school’s teachers operate and the distribution of teacher quality among schools is not due to features (i.e., size, minority enrollment, student poverty) that may also characterize districts that have more determinative CBAs:</p>

<p>The dependent variable, <italic>Y<sub>ij</sub></italic>, represented various teacher quality outcomes, namely, the percentage of professionally credentialed and nationally board certified teachers in a school, the percentage of teachers with over 3 years of experience, school average teaching experience, and a school’s average teacher SAT score. <italic>X<sub>ij</sub></italic> represented the school-level covariates. <italic>T<sub>j</sub></italic> represented the different scores, TSCORE and TSENIOR, assigned to each district on the basis of provisions in its CBA. Interaction terms (<italic>T<sub>j</sub></italic> × <italic>X<sub>ij</sub></italic>) were added to the model. Coefficients in front of these terms tested whether seniority and transfer provisions mediate the relationships that a school’s minority enrollment, family income, disciplinary incidents, and proportions of students requiring special services have with the distribution of teacher quality. <italic>D<sub>j</sub></italic> represented the district-level covariates. Coefficients in front of the interaction terms (<italic>D<sub>j</sub></italic> × <italic>X<sub>ij</sub></italic>) tested whether a district’s size, minority enrollment, and proportions of students qualifying for free or reduced-price lunch mediate the relationships that a school’s minority enrollment, family income, disciplinary incidents, and proportions of students requiring special services have with the distribution of teacher quality, allowing us to examine whether any observed school-to-school teacher quality gap was attributable to district characteristics other than their CBAs.</p>
<p>Although equation 1 asked whether schools, relative to others, have lower quality teachers when their districts have more determinative CBA provisions than when their districts do not, it compared schools across different districts. To examine the within-district distribution of teacher quality, we specified a district-level fixed-effects model as follows:</p>

<p>When α<sub>j</sub>, the district dummy variable, was included, the district-level covariates including transfer or leave score, seniority score, district size, district poverty, and racial composition were dropped from the estimation because these variables do not vary within a district. This specification closely followed a recent, unpublished study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162373713482765">Anzia and Moe (2011)</xref>.</p>
<p>Finally, we ran a hierarchical linear model. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski and Horng (2007)</xref> argued that HLM is the most appropriate technique to use because schools are nested within districts, and CBA rules operate at the district level. HLM accounts for the hierarchical structure of schools within districts. Our hierarchical linear model allowed the overall share of high-quality teachers to vary over different school districts (random intercept) and the effects of school-level variables to vary across districts (random slope), as follows:</p>

<p>The Level 1 equation in this model was a function of school level covariates, <italic>X<sub>ij</sub></italic>, where the intercept η<sub>1</sub> and slope η<sub>2</sub> were school-specific coefficients. Equations 2 and 3 in this model were Level 2 equations. These Level 2 or district covariates did not vary at Level 1 and were included in the Level 2 model as covariates. Like Koski and Horng, we included district size, <italic>D<sub>j</sub></italic>, and the CBA scores, <italic>T<sub>j</sub></italic>, as Level 2 controls. Poverty and racial composition were also added as Level 2 controls. Level 1 variables were group mean centered, and Level 2 variable were grand mean centered.</p>

<p>Across the three models, the results of our analyses support the well-documented finding that higher minority districts and schools have, on average, lower quality teachers. The proportion of a district’s students who are Hispanic is significantly and negatively related to the percentage of teachers with 3 or more years of teaching experience, teachers’ average number of years in the classroom, the proportion of teachers who are fully certified, and teachers’ average SAT scores. Teachers who teach in districts with higher proportions of African American students are less likely to be fully certified and more likely to have lower SAT scores. The proportion of districts’ populations that are eligible for free or reduced-priced lunch does not, however, predict lower teacher quality. In fact, districts with larger shares of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch appear to have, on average, more experienced and nationally board certified teachers relative to the sizes of their teaching staffs than do districts with smaller proportions of eligible students (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0162373713482765">Table 4</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0162373713482765">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Controlling for district demographics and size, the percentage of a school’s student population that is African American or eligible for free or reduced-price lunch does not, with one exception, predict the quality of its teachers. The school-level poverty finding may not be surprising in light of recent evidence from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162373713482765">Boyd et al. (2008)</xref> that documented “a remarkable narrowing of the gap in teacher qualifications between high poverty schools and low poverty schools” (p. 799). In their study in New York City, these authors found that, between 2000 and 2005, teacher qualifications in “high poverty schools improved considerably while the low poverty schools either did not improve, or did so only modestly” (p. 799).</p>
<p>The relative size of a school’s Hispanic population, on the other hand, does predict teacher quality. On average, as the share of Hispanic students in a school rises, teacher experience falls. In our hierarchical linear model, in which schools are clustered within districts, higher proportions of Hispanic students are also associated with lower shares of professionally certified teachers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0162373713482765">Table 4</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that higher minority school districts in Florida may be doing a better job of distributing teacher quality for African American students than for Hispanics. This may be either because African American students themselves are more equally distributed among schools in a district or because district policies or practices or the preferences of teachers themselves make it easier for schools with larger African American (compared with Hispanic) populations to attract and keep quality teachers.</p>
<p>Discipline problems also appear to negatively affect a school’s ability to attract and retain higher quality teachers. In all three models, the number of per pupil disciplinary incidents in a school is significantly and negatively associated with the percentage of teachers with 3 or more years of teaching experience and professional certification. Although schools with more behavioral problems have fewer experienced and fully certified teachers, schools with larger shares of English-language learners appear more likely to have professionally certified teachers. Schools with larger shares of English-language learners, along with shares of students qualifying for special education services, appear more likely, however, to employ teachers with lower SAT scores (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0162373713482765">Table 4</xref>). A 1-<italic>SD</italic> change in the percentage of exceptional students in a school is associated with a 60<sup>+</sup>-point decrease in teachers’ average SAT scores.</p>
<p>The first row of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0162373713482765">Table 4</xref> represents the relationship between the determinativeness of the CBA transfer and leave provisions to which teachers in a school are subject and our five measures of teacher quality. Results from Model 1 suggest that teachers’ average experience and the proportion of teachers with professional certification are lower, on average, in schools whose teachers have more seniority protections and transfer rights than schools whose teachers work under less determinative rules (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0162373713482765">Table 4</xref>). There is no relationship for the percentage of teachers with 3 or more years of teaching experience or average SAT scores. When, as in Model 3, schools are nested within their districts, the relationships remain significant and negative between the determinativeness of CBA provisions and teachers’ average experience and the proportion of teachers who are professional certified. Specifically, a school in a district with a TSCORE that is 1 <italic>SD</italic> above the average is likely to have teachers with 0.5 fewer years of teaching experience than schools in districts with average TSCOREs. Because the models account for district demographics that have in the past been shown to make attracting and keeping high-quality teachers difficult, we reduce the possibility that the relationship our analyses picks up between determinative CBA provisions and teacher quality is due to other district factors. In other words, by including the district controls, we can more confidently rule out the possibility that school districts with more determinative CBA provisions share other characteristics that make them more likely to have lower quality teachers regardless of the contract provisions under which they operate.</p>
<p>When we restrict our measure of CBAs to voluntary transfer provisions (TSENIOR) (with its potential to have, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski &amp; Horng, 2007</xref>, the greatest influence on teacher distribution), the relationship is significant only under Model 1’s assumptions for the percentage of professionally certified teachers. TSENIOR, as discussed above, distinguishes districts with contracts that have no seniority language guiding school-to-school transfers, list seniority among a set of criteria that must be considered in selecting teachers for transfer, and require that seniority be determinative in these decisions. Our findings indicate that the proportion of teachers with professional certification is lower, on average, in schools whose teachers work under transfer rules that grant senior teachers preference (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0162373713482765">Table 5</xref>). The relationship is not significant under Model 3.</p>

<p>Turning to the relationship between the CBA provisions and the teacher quality gap, our analysis does not provide consistent evidence that, in Florida, the strength of transfer and leave provisions or the role of seniority in voluntary transfer rules amplifies the relationship between teacher experience and “school disadvantage,” as measured either by race or socioeconomic status. Models 2 and 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0162373713482765">Table 4</xref> allow us to consider whether the determinativeness of CBA provisions condition the size of the within-district teacher quality gap among schools. The models regress three interaction terms, TSCORE × PER_BLK, TSCORE × PER_HSP, and TSCORE × PER_FRPL, on the teacher quality measures. The coefficients for TSCORE × PER_HSP are significant and positive, suggesting that the teacher experience and certification gap between schools with higher and lower percentages of Hispanic students may be smaller in more determinative CBA districts; the relationships are not significant for the proportion of teachers with National Board Certification or average SAT scores (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0162373713482765">Table 4</xref>). Although the teacher quality gap between schools with higher and lower percentages of African American students was not significant, we found statistically significant interaction effects for SAT score. It appears that any SAT gap between teachers in schools with higher and lower proportions of African American students may be smaller, on average, in districts with more determinative CBA rules (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0162373713482765">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0162373713482765">5</xref>). Although most of the significant interaction terms in Models 2 and 3 are positive, one, TSCORE × PER_FRPL, is not. Here, the relationship suggests that any benefit in average SAT score that accrues to schools with larger FRPL populations may potentially be lost when those schools are located in more determinative CBA contexts (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0162373713482765">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0162373713482765">5</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, results from these analyses support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162373713482765">Moe (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski and Horng (2007)</xref>, and prior studies showing that districts and schools with higher proportions of minority students seem to have more difficulty recruiting and keeping experienced, credentialed teachers. We find that the same is true for teachers with higher aptitude scores. Our analyses do not, however, consistently support both Koski and Horng’s findings and our conjectures that class size, school growth, and school size are negatively associated with teacher quality. Looking across the tables now, we find no evidence that schools with lower pupil/teacher ratios (CSIZE) have significantly larger proportions of high-quality teachers, as measured by experience, certification, and aptitude. The direction of the effect of ENROLL and GROWTH is positive for teachers’ credentials but negative for teacher SAT scores, suggesting that principals in larger schools and schools experiencing enrollment growth do not hire teachers with lower credentials to fill vacant positions, but they may, on average, hire them with less competitive college aptitude scores. We do find evidence that, on average, experience and certification measures of teacher quality are lower in districts with more determinative CBA provisions. With regard to the relationship between “school disadvantage” and CBA provisions, our findings hold close to Koski and Horng’s. Overall, we do not find support for the thesis that more determinative transfer and seniority rules “amplify” the teacher quality gap between higher and lower minority schools in a district. That is to say, schools with larger proportions of minority students do not appear, on average, to have a harder time staffing their schools with higher quality teachers when they are located in districts with more determinative CBA provisions.</p>
<p>For reasons discussed earlier, we believe that our model specifications are appropriate for the Florida context. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162373713482765">Moe (2005)</xref>, we used a district fixed-effects regression model, and like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski and Horng (2007)</xref>, we also used HLM. To check for robustness, we ran several variants of our three models, including several that were also undertaken by Moe and by Koski and Horng. Two variants used different combinations of questions to constitute TSCORE (e.g., Questions 1–3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0162373713482765">Figure 1</xref> only, as suggested by Moe), whereas others applied random-slope or random-coefficients models, as in Koski and Horng. The results of these models were highly consistent with those from our three main models and are available by request.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Findings from our work, the first statewide study outside of California, suggest that teacher quality, as measured by experience and certification, is lower, on average, in districts with more determinative CBA provisions. This is so even after controlling for district characteristics such as student poverty and race that have, in the past, been shown to predict teachers’ decisions about where to teach. Just why teacher experience and certification are generally lower in districts where senior teachers are given preferences for transfer and leaves is difficult to ascertain. Indeed, it would seem that priorities granted to experienced educators would encourage teachers, once hired in a district, to keep teaching there (effectively building their seniority benefits). Perhaps, however, the most committed and fully certified among beginning teachers are more likely than other beginning teachers to search for positions in districts where, they believe, they are least likely to lose their jobs or be involuntarily transferred early in their careers.</p>
<p>Despite evidence that teacher experience and certification may be lower in districts with more determinative CBA rules, we find little in our models and in replications of model specifications by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0162373713482765">Moe (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski and Horng (2007)</xref> to suggest that transfer and seniority provisions in CBAs worsen the teacher quality gap between more and less disadvantaged schools. Specifically, the quality gap that exists within Florida’s districts between schools with higher and lower proportions of Hispanic students, as measured by teacher experience, certification and college aptitude, does not appear to widen in the context of bargaining agreements that grant senior teachers more transfer and leave rights. In fact, compared with districts with less determinative transfer and leave rules, districts with more determinative provisions appear to have smaller gaps in teachers’ experience and certification between schools with higher and lower percentages of Hispanic students.</p>
<p>These results are consistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski and Horng (2007)</xref>, who looked closely at the intradistrict distribution of teacher quality in California. They found no evidence that seniority rules change the relationship between higher minority schools and inexperienced, uncredentialed teachers, deducing that “the teacher quality gap persists, in other words, regardless of the presence of seniority preferences” (p. 293). Recently, a working paper from the Center on Reinventing Public Education reached a similar conclusion. Taking advantage of a policy change in an urban midwestern district, the authors used an interrupted time-series design to look at what happens when a district replaces a system of seniority-based hiring preferences with one based on “mutual consent” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162373713482765">Gross, DeArmond, &amp; Goldhaber, 2010</xref>). In this instance, the policy shift appeared to lead to an initial increase in teacher turnover and the share of inexperienced teachers, particularly in the district’s high-minority schools. Although this initial “shock” appeared to moderate by the 4th year after the adoption of mutual consent system, the elimination of seniority preferences, according to the authors, “did nothing to change the distribution of experience in disadvantaged schools” (p. 19).</p>
<p>There are alternate specifications of the outcome variables that might help further advance our understanding of the relationship between CBAs and teacher quality. First, future research on this question might use value-added achievement scores instead of teacher certification, experience, and aptitude information as more direct indicators of teacher quality. Increasingly, states are developing data systems in which student test score data can be linked to teacher files; in some states, researchers have already begun to aggregate the value-added scores of students assigned to individual teachers’ classrooms to measure teacher quality. Moreover, it might be possible to track individual teachers (i.e., mobility) over time under different CBA contexts. Large-scale data systems now permit researchers to identify “movers” and, in some cases, determine whether moves were voluntary or involuntary in nature. Targeted interviews with teachers may help reveal the role that seniority preference rules play in teachers’ decisions to stay or go.</p>
<p>Another direction for future research should, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162373713482765">Gross et al. (2010)</xref>, take methodological advantage of any changes in transfer and seniority provisions in CBAs over time. As more unions, under pressure from state and local officials, agree to terms that add flexibility to transfer and seniority rules, studies with quasi-experimental designs may help shed further light on the role that teachers unions, and provisions embedded in their contracts with districts in particular, play in determining the distribution of high-quality teachers. Until then, policy makers should exercise caution and look beyond the elimination of transfer and seniority provisions in union-district contracts to solve the pressing problem of inequitable access to quality teachers.</p>

<p>In a working paper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162373713482765">Anzia and Moe (2011)</xref> contended that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162373713482765">Koski and Horng (2007)</xref> should have used lagged outcome variables (e.g., percentage credentialed teachers) instead of outcome variables that are contemporaneous with the contract year. Their argument was that contract provisions will influence future distributions of teachers in a district (because most teachers transfer, for example, during the summer). The CBAs we analyzed covered the 2002–2003 school year. The findings we present here use outcome data for 2002 to 2003. We also ran our models with outcome data for 2003 to 2004 and found no differences. Results for this alternative estimation are available by request.</p>

<p>To control for possible effects of tenure on teachers’ decisions to stay, we included the percentage of teachers with 3 or more years of experience because Florida keeps teachers on probation for 3 years (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162373713482765">Brunner &amp; Imazeki, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Authors</title>
<p>LORA COHEN-VOGEL is the Robena and Walter E. Hussman, Jr. Associate Professor of Policy and Education Reform at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She is particularly interested in identifying the programs, policies, and practices that are successfully raising schooling outcomes for traditionally underperforming student populations. Among other focuses, this work looks at teacher quality and how schools use data to help raise learning outcomes for low-income, minority, and English language learner students.</p>
<p>LI FENG is the Brandon Dee Roberts Assistant Professor of Economics at Texas State University-San Marcos. Her research centers on education policy issues related to teachers and on the impact of school accountability on teacher mobility and quality in particular. Currently, she is working on an Institute of Education Sciences–funded study on teacher quality in special education and students’ outcomes such as achievement on standardized tests, graduation rates, and college attendance rates.</p>
<p>LA’TARA OSBORNE-LAMPKIN is an Associate in Research with the Regional Educational Laboratory-Southeast at Florida State University. Over the past few years, her research has primarily focused on the collective bargaining process and its impact on educational decision making.
