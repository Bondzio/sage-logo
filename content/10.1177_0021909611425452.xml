<p>This article argues that the results of the Indian General Elections, 2009, emphasize continuity more than change. Regional political parties, local-level issues and identity-based politics remain significant. The verdict represents a confirmation of established patterns of electoral politics in India and not a break with the recent past.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During the 1990s, India transitioned from a dominant-party system under the Congress Party to a truly multi-party system and coalition politics, with the rise of regional parties and an alternative power center, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The trend towards regionalization of politics in India over the last two decades has led to the rise of several regional parties across the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611425452">Sridharan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611425452">Chakrabarty, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611425452">Nikolenyi, 2010</xref>). These parties successfully competed with the national parties in general elections. They used their numbers to effectively bargain with the Congress and the BJP for prioritizing state-specific agenda over national imperatives. The vote share of regional parties increased to such an extent that neither the Congress Party nor the BJP could hope to form a government on their own.</p>
<p>As in the past, the regional parties were expected to play a key role in government formation after the 2009 general elections. The predictions of a hung parliament only served to highlight the importance of the regional parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611425452">Chauhan and Sharma, 2009</xref>). However, the results of the five-phase general elections belied expectations of a fragmented mandate. Much to the surprise and delight of the Congress, the ruling alliance won a plurality of 262 out of a total of 543 seats. The Congress Party itself won 206 seats, the best performance by any party since 1991. Along with external support from other parties, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) now sits pretty with a comfortable majority of over 320 seats.</p>
<p>Some analysts have described the outcome of the elections as a vote in favor of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021909611425452">Khare, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611425452">Mukherjee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021909611425452">Varshney, 2009</xref>). The results have been interpreted as a triumph of national imperatives over narrow regional-level considerations. It has been seen as a vote for stability and better governance. In addition, major regional and identity-based parties appear to have been rejected by the electorate. Others have argued instead that that there is actually more continuity than it may seem on the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021909611425452">Kohli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021909611425452">Yadav, 2009a</xref>). They have claimed that a national trend does not mean a trend in favor of national parties. The Congress Party’s victory was as much a product of alliance politics and the single-member simple plurality electoral system as it was the result of increased support. This article presents arguments to support the latter position.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0021909611425452">
<title>Parties and Party Systems</title>
<p>The dominant-party system or ‘Congress System’ was held together by the towering personality of Nehru, the nationalist legacy of the Congress Party, mass mobilization, commitment to democratic ideology and an elaborate system of patronage politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021909611425452">Kothari, 1964</xref>). The decline of the party has been attributed to greater politicization and mobilization of the electorate, failure of Nehruvian socialism, organizational decline of the party and emphasis on personality politics during the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021909611425452">Mehta, 1997</xref>). The decline of the Congress led to regional parties becoming more influential not only at the state level but also at the national level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611425452">Hewitt, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611425452">Kohli, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021909611425452">Candland, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The rise of regional parties in India may be understood in light of the comparative literature on party systems. There are two broad classes of explanations for the configuration of party systems. On the one hand, the social cleavage theory posits that the party system reflects the primary cleavages within society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909611425452">Dahl, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021909611425452">La Palombara and Weiner, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611425452">Lipset and Rokan, 1967</xref>). Religious, ethnic, linguistic, class and regional differences appear to give rise to social cleavages around which political parties develop. Societies with sharp social divisions witness a strong correlation between social identity and party preference. The extent to which social cleavages influence party preference varies according to their significance to voters. Usually, in this kind of party system, a single group will represent the vast majority of a party’s supporters.</p>
<p>On the other hand, electoral-system theories posit that electoral rules, including the number of representatives elected from each constituency, the choice between proportional representation and single-member simple plurality electoral system and choosing between a party list and an individual candidate shape party systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021909611425452">Rae, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611425452">Taagepera and Shugart, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611425452">Lijphart, 1994</xref>). For example, the seat–vote distortion associated with single-member simple plurality system provides incentives for coalescing or splitting. This system can benefit parties that are popular in one geographical area but have little support in other parts of the country. It can also lead to the formation of a two-party system and fewer minority parties.</p>
<p>Still others argue instead that party systems are shaped by the authority granted to the different levels of governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611425452">Chibber and Kollman, 2004</xref>). According to them, since the 1980s, political and economic authority in India has rapidly devolved to the states and voters now look to the state, not the national government, to address their main concerns. Regional parties have thrived in India as state governments gain more authority relative to the national government and many are now represented in parliament. The party system has fragmented into several state-level party systems and the transition from the dominant-party system is now complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611425452">Yadav, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611425452">Jones and Mainwaring (2003)</xref> argue that federal countries are characterized by weakly nationalized party systems. In fragmented party systems, small (regional) parties win most of the votes. In a weakly nationalized party system like India, the vote share of major parties varies widely across states. Parties faring well in some states are minor electoral competitors in other states. Additionally, regional and local factors may be more salient in forging bonds between voters and parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021909611425452">Schattschneider, 1960</xref>). All three factors, viz. social cleavages, electoral rules and decentralization of authority, may be useful in understanding the rise of regional parties in India.</p>
<p>A brief note on national and regional parties in India is necessary. In India, the Election Commission classifies parties as ‘national’ and ‘state’ (regional) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611425452">Nikolenyi, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021909611425452">1</xref></sup> According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611425452">Jones and Mainwaring (2003)</xref>, a ‘national party’ is a party that receives similar levels of electoral support throughout the country, which is clearly not the case for all parties classified as ‘national’ by the Election Commission. As such, this article uses Verney’s criteria designating a national party as a party that contests elections in at least half the constituencies <italic>and</italic> wins at least 5% of the total votes and 5% of all the seats in a national election (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611425452">Verney, 2005</xref>: 145). The first requirement restricts the term ‘national party’ to those that have made a serious attempt to spread nationwide, while the second requirement reflects the levels of electoral support throughout the country. Using these criteria, only the Congress Party and the BJP qualify as national parties and are treated as such in this article.</p>

<title>Background of Elections</title>
<p>The polling schedule for the 15th general elections to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Indian parliament) was announced by the Election Commission on 2 March 2009. The largest democratic exercise in the world would be conducted in five phases on 16, 23 and 30 April and 7 and 13 May. It involved an electorate of approximately 714 million casting their ballots in 828,804 polling stations across 543 electoral constituencies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0021909611425452">2</xref></sup> The ruling Congress-led UPA had completed five years in office despite the withdrawal of support from the Left Front (LF) the previous year due to differences over the India–United States (US) nuclear deal. The UPA had come to power in 2004 after the stunning defeat of the incumbent National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by its main rival the BJP.</p>
<p>Although the competing alliances and parties were divided along communal–secular, national–regional and caste–caste lines, the current elections were remarkable for their virtual absence of a nationwide overarching theme. The opposition parties attempted to highlight pan-Indian issues like terrorism and the India–US nuclear deal as major concerns. However, pre-poll surveys conducted by the Center for Developing Societies (CSDS) indicated that these issues did not excite the people very much (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611425452">Yadav, 2009b</xref>). Local issues like drinking water supply, electricity, roads, hospitals, farmers’ suicide and unemployment were considered more important. The national verdict was expected to be an aggregate of state-specific outcomes.</p>
<p>An important feature of these elections was the redrawing of the boundaries of 499 of the 543 parliamentary constituencies, the first in three decades, by the Delimitation Commission. The commission was an independent body headed by the Chief Election Commissioner and senior officials of the judiciary. The delimitation process was considered necessary in view of India’s changing economy and society and the process was expected to affect the outcome of the elections. Following the exercise, the number of urban constituencies increased and there were new caste equations within several constituencies. The prospects of caste-based parties and the BJP, which has historically drawn the bulk of its support from urban constituencies, were expected to improve following the conclusion of the delimitation process.</p>
<p>There were four important alliances competing against each other. The ruling UPA was an electoral alliance headed by the country’s oldest national party, the Congress. It was formed in the aftermath of the 2004 elections with the solidification of the informal alliance between the Congress and its allies. This alliance had succeeded in dislodging the BJP-led NDA from power and had ruled the country for the past five years. In 2009, the UPA included regional parties from states like West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>The BJP-led NDA was the other national alliance. Earlier, the NDA had surprised everyone by becoming the first non-Congress coalition government to last for a full five-year term. The achievements of the NDA included high economic growth rates, political stability and peace talks with Pakistan. However, some of the worst anti-Muslim violence in India’s history took place in the BJP-ruled state of Gujarat, while the NDA was in power at the center.</p>
<p>Using the slogan ‘India Shining’, the NDA hoped to become the first non-Congress coalition to return to power. However, belying all predictions, the NDA was defeated by the Congress alliance in the 2004 elections. Even the Congress was surprised with the outcome of the voting process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021909611425452">Wilkinson, 2005</xref>). Since then the NDA has struggled to remain a credible alternative at the national level. Once composed of 14 regional parties, it was a mere shadow of itself by 2009 as only six regional parties remained in the alliance.</p>
<p>The Third Front, a motley group of regional parties, was propped up by the Left Front as a non-Congress, non-BJP electoral and policy alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021909611425452">Kapoor, 2009</xref>). It was formed under the initiative of the Left parties after they withdrew external support to the previous UPA government regarding differences over the India–US nuclear deal. The Third Front, launched a month before the elections, projected itself as pro-poor, pro-backward castes, and pro-minorities and opposed communal politics and economic liberalization which, it argued, favored only the rich.</p>
<p>The regional parties that made up the Third Front belonged to states like Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Haryana and Orissa. However, in the absence of a unifying ideology, some of these parties had conflicting agendas. For instance, the Dravidian parties of Tamil Nadu disagreed with each other regarding extension of support to the Tamil Tigers against the Sri Lankan military during the civil war.</p>
<p>The Third Front had many leaders, but no unifying statesman. Several leaders had prime ministerial aspirations and none wanted to support the other in this quest. The Third Front was nominally united in its opposition to the UPA and NDA but, in the run-up to the elections, some parties did not rule out the possibility of extending support to these alliances. Indeed, several Third Front parties had been formerly part of either the UPA or the NDA, or both. The Third Front was not an entirely new entity. It had previously been known by various names like the National Front (NF), the United Front (UF) and the United National Progressive Alliance (UNPA). The NF was in power from 1989–91, while the UF was in power from 1996–98. In both cases, the governments were unable to last the full term, leading to the perception that the Third Front was an unstable alliance composed of opportunistic leaders and parties.</p>
<p>Finally, the Fourth Front, formed by a few parties that were previously part of the UPA, was also a significant entity. These parties entered into seat adjustments with each other across 134 constituencies in the bellwether states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. They sought to boost their tally and gain leverage in a post-poll fragmented verdict scenario. The Fourth Front leaders attempted to mobilize the electorate on the basis of caste equations.</p>

<title>Election Results</title>
<p>The results of the 2009 election came as a complete surprise to most observers. The Congress-led UPA alliance secured 262 seats, only 10 short of a majority. This was an improvement of 80 seats over the previous elections. The UPA vote share increased by about 4%. The Congress itself secured 206 seats, the best performance by any party since 1991. The NDA performed poorly ending up with 159 seats, down 17 from the last elections. The vote share of the NDA dropped by almost 5%. The BJP itself suffered reverses in all regions of the country, ending up with 116 seats, 22 less than the 2004 elections. The Third Front finished third behind the UPA and NDA with 79 seats, 30 seats less than their tally the last time. Their combined vote share fell about a percentage point to 21%. The LF also performed below expectations suffering huge reverses in West Bengal and Kerala. Finally, the Fourth Front parties ended up with 27 seats, down 37 seats from the last time, while independent candidates and other parties won the remaining 16 seats (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021909611425452">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In the north, the Congress did well in Delhi, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021909611425452">Table 2</xref>). In the states of Delhi, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan, it was in a one-on-one contest with the BJP. In Jammu and Kashmir, its alliance partner won three seats, while in Punjab it managed to best NDA. The most stunning results from the north came from Uttar Pradesh, where the party made substantial gains to come in second with 21 seats. On the other hand, the BJP was decimated in its former strongholds in the north. Apart from Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, it performed poorly in all other states. In Uttar Pradesh, it barely reached double figures. The other casualty in the north was the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), an important constituent of Third Front, which won only 20 seats. The results put paid to BSP chief Mayawati’s hopes of becoming the country’s next prime minister, and also hurt the Third Front’s prospect of emerging as ‘kingmaker’.</p>

<p>In the east, the LF was the biggest loser (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021909611425452">Figure 1</xref>). The Left parties lost considerable ground to the Congress alliance in the state of West Bengal. Together the alliance secured 25 out of the 42 seats. The performance of the LF further dented the hopes of the Third Front. Conversely, it put the UPA in pole position. Elsewhere, in Bihar and Jharkhand, the NDA did well. In Bihar, the electoral strategy of emphasizing security, good governance and development paid rich dividends for the BJP’s regional ally, the Janata Dal (United), which ended up with 20 seats. In Chhattisgarh, the BJP emerged victorious in a one-on-one contest with the Congress. Finally, in Orissa, the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), which was part of the Third Front, was the clear winner securing 14 seats.</p>

<p>In the west, the BJP lost ground in Gujarat but still managed to secure more seats than the Congress (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021909611425452">Table 2</xref>). In Maharashtra, the NDA again came out second-best compared to the Congress-led alliance. A new party, Maharashtra Navanirman Sena (MNS), emerged in the state, which cut into the vote share of the NDA. In Goa, while the UPA won one seat, the BJP was victorious in the other.</p>
<p>The largest number of seats for the UPA came from the south. However, the results in the south reflect continuity more than change. The vote share of the Congress and Third Front parties remained almost the same in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, when compared to the 2004 elections. Except in Karnataka, where its performance was not much different compared to the last elections, the BJP performed poorly across the region. Its negligible presence in the south and the lack of regional partners resulted in a disastrous performance. The NDA was able to secure only 22 seats in the south compared to the UPA, which secured 85 seats. By virtue of this fact alone, the BJP was always playing catch-up with the Congress at the national level. The only change in the south was the result in Kerala, where the Left Front faced a heavy defeat at the hands of the Congress.</p>
<p>The delimitation exercise appears to have influenced the elections in several ways. The redrawing of constituencies altered the demographics within some constituencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611425452">Biswas, 2009</xref>). After the exercise, close to a dozen constituencies became reserved for candidates belonging to the scheduled castes or scheduled tribes and there were several new urban constituencies. This influenced the political parties’ choice of candidates in these altered constituencies. Delimitation also gave parties the opportunity to rework seat adjustments because past performances could no longer be leveraged in negotiations on seat sharing with partners. This was one of the reasons why the Congress spurned a national alliance and instead chose to enter into state-specific alliances with its UPA partners. Contrary to expectations, the delimitation process did not appear to significantly favor caste-based parties and the BJP at the expense of the Congress.</p>
<p>Instead of being tied down by its allies, delimitation provided the Congress with the opportunity to enhance its presence in states like Uttar Pradesh. The Congress contested several more seats on its own this time around (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909611425452">Kailash, 2009</xref>). Its improved performance in this election made it an attractive partner, thereby increasing its bargaining power relative to other parties. The results have also ensured that, in the future, it will not be at the receiving end of seat adjustments and electoral alliances in these states.</p>

<title>Understanding the Verdict</title>
<p>Several hypotheses have been put forward by commentators to explain the outcome of the elections and its future implications. That the verdict provides for greater political stability, eliminates the need for a UPA–Left coalition and reduces the bargaining (and blackmailing) capacity of smaller regional parties is not in dispute. However, some have also interpreted the verdict as a decisive mandate for the Congress, the return to national parties, the rejection of regional parties, the triumph of national over state-level issues and factors and the saturation of identity-based politics (caste, religion and region). Now that the dust and euphoria has settled, a closer scrutiny of each of these sweeping generalizations will help us understand the meaning of the verdict and its implications for India.</p>
<sec id="section6-0021909611425452">
<title>No Cakewalk for Congress</title>
<p>The results of the elections do not project a sweep for the Congress. While the Congress has improved its tally in the current elections by over 60 seats – that is, 206 in 2009 versus 145 in 2004 – its vote share increased only marginally by about 2%. This despite the fact that it was contesting 23 more seats this time around. It did well in states like Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Kerala, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, but performed poorly in others like Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The party’s good showing can be attributed to improved performances in the Hindi heartland states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, where it had lost considerable ground since the late-1980s, but its performance in other states in terms of vote share was not very different from the last elections.</p>
<p>The Congress’ success has been attributed to a variety of factors. The positive image of the incumbent Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, several pro-poor initiatives (like the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, a massive farm loan waiver and the Right to Information Act) and the decision to go it alone in Uttar Pradesh all contributed to the Congress success story. Manmohan Singh’s image as a soft-spoken, unassuming and responsible statesman among the electorate paid rich dividends for the Congress, which was able to project him as a leader who was not ‘power-hungry’ like other prime ministerial aspirants in the Third Front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021909611425452">Mukherjee, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The decision to spurn alliances with regional parties and go it alone in Uttar Pradesh was aimed at recovering lost ground in the state. It was taken upon the insistence of Rahul Gandhi, scion of the Gandhi family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909611425452">Tiwari, 2009</xref>). It was initially greeted with derision by most observers who pointed to the decision as a manifestation of Rahul Gandhi’s lack of political skill and maturity. Indeed, the Congress organization in the state had been in shambles for several years and Rahul Gandhi’s own assembly election campaign in the state a year back culminated in a disappointing verdict for the party. However, the success of 2009 appears to signal his arrival at the national stage.</p>
<p>The Congress party dominated national level elections in India until the late-1980s. The success of the Congress party was due to a variety of factors, including its leadership of the freedom struggle, the towering presence of Nehru, a strategy of building social coalitions of Brahmins, Dalits and Muslims and an extensive system of patronage-based politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021909611425452">Hasan, 2006</xref>). Increasing economic discontent, politicization of lower castes, the death of Nehru and later Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, increasing centralization of the party coupled with the development of personality cult, the rise of regional parties and an alternative national party (BJP) contributed to the decline of the Congress throughout the 1980s. During the 1990s, the dominant-party system was replaced by a truly multi-party system and coalition politics with the rise of regional parties and the BJP. The party’s weakness at the state level had been apparent even before the 1990s. The results of the 2009 elections did not signal a drastic change from the 1990s.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0021909611425452">
<title>National Parties Losing Ground</title>
<p>The verdict does not show a trend in favor of national parties. Although the combined seat share of the Congress and the BJP has increased from 283 in 2004 to 322 seats today, this was roughly the same the two parties had in 1998. In addition, their combined vote share this time was 47.3%, which actually represented a 1.4% drop from 2004. This is despite the two parties contesting more seats this time than they did in 2004 (873 versus 781). The seat–vote distortion may be primarily attributed to the single-member simple plurality electoral system, wherein even a small swing of in votes can affect a much larger swing in seats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611425452">Sridharan, 2005</xref>). A good example of this is Kerala. During the 2004 elections, the Congress failed to secure a single seat even as its vote share was 32%. However, in 2009 it was able to secure 13 seats with a vote share of just 40%.</p>
<p>Even in the bellwether states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the successes of the Congress were concentrated in specific areas. In some states like West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, the Congress still plays second-fiddle to regional parties. The success of the UPA in the east and south is largely due to the better-than-expected performances of the Congress’ regional partners. The BJP recorded its lowest vote share since 1989 and the NDA witnessed its second successive electoral defeat. The party saw a drop in vote share in almost every state, except Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka. In states like Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh, the national parties were bested by the regional parties.</p>
<p>The vote share of the two national parties in the general elections over the past two decades has fallen (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021909611425452">Figure 2</xref>). From a high of 56.47% in 1991, vote share for the two parties has dropped to 47.35% at the end of the 2009 elections. The BJP has suffered the most during this decade with the Congress performing only marginally better. However, the latter has also seen its vote share drop from 36.40% in 1991 to 28.55% in 2009. Therefore, any claim that the electorate voted for national parties in larger numbers is questionable.</p>

<sec id="section8-0021909611425452">
<title>Regional Parties Can Still Swing It</title>
<p>Regional parties continue to remain relevant in Indian politics. Their combined vote share (across all alliances) in these elections was about 47%. There has been a marked trend over the last two decades towards regionalization of politics as the results of successive general elections demonstrate. These regional parties have geographically concentrated support. Individually, they are not strong enough to challenge the Congress and BJP on a national scale, but together they form a formidable group. Their success depends on their appeal to regional sentiments and their ability to portray the national parties as distant from the local electorate. The regional concentration of support for certain parties and the weakness of the national parties in certain states has resulted in increasing fragmentation of the national legislature. These parties have little in common with each other except their desire to protect and advance the federal nature of the Indian political system.</p>
<p>In the past, regional parties have been accused of trying to subvert the national agenda in service of state-specific priorities. The perceived slowdown of the country’s economic liberalization process was blamed by some on the dependence of the UPA and NDA governments on regional parties. It was expected that the Third Front would play a key role in government formation in the event of a hung verdict. Those who were apprehensive about a hung parliament and its resultant impact on governance were pleased to see the Third Front end a distant third in the elections and posited the slow demise of regional parties. Although the results of the elections appear to indicate that the electorate rejected this impromptu Front, upon closer reflection, it is clear that the regional parties are not on their way out.</p>
<p>Even though the Third Front saw a reduction of 30 seats since the last elections, the combined vote share of all regional parties was a sizable 29.2%. The Third Front had recorded an almost identical vote share during the 2004 and 1999 elections as well. In each of the three competing alliances, there was more than one regional party that performed creditably at the polls. The All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) in West Bengal and the Dravida Munettra Kazhagam (DMK) are important regional partners of the UPA and without them a Congress-led government would not be possible. Elsewhere, parties like the BJD (part of the Third Front) and the Janata Dal (United) (part of the NDA) saw an increase in seats as well as vote share. National parties still need regional partners to form a government at the center. Therefore, the era of coalition politics in India is not likely to disappear anytime soon.</p>
<p>The failure of the Third Front can be primarily attributed to the disparate nature of the coalition and lack of ideological coherence. This led to serious differences among its constituents. The only glue that seemed to hold them together was their opposition to a Congress or BJP-led alliance. However, some Third Front constituents had sent out enough signals to indicate that they would not hesitate to switch sides. The Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) of Andhra Pradesh was one such party, which ditched the Third Front for the NDA on the eve of the elections. Several Third Front constituents had been part of the UPA and/or the NDA at some point during the past decade and a few were not averse to forming alliances with them in the future. It is no surprise therefore that the Third Front idea never really took-off.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0021909611425452">
<title>All Politics is Local</title>
<p>Some observers have seen the results of the elections as a reflection of the triumph of national over state-level issues and factors. However, post-poll surveys conducted by the CSDS found that issues like the Indo–US nuclear deal, which were supposed to have pan-Indian resonance, failed to excite the voters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611425452">Rai, 2009</xref>). Even terrorist attacks were not on top of the list of issues prioritized by voters. The absence of a nationwide overarching theme in elections did not, however, mean that there were no issues. In several states regional factors and issues played a major role. For example, in Tamil Nadu, the Sri Lankan civil war and plight of the Tamil refugees occupied center stage, in Bihar and Orissa it was a virtual referendum on the performance of the incumbent state administrations, in Maharashtra it was the influx of out-of-state migrants into Mumbai and in West Bengal it was the Left Front’s policies and actions relating to land acquisitions for industrial development in the state, which came under scrutiny. The people appear to have voted on issues like governance, economic livelihood and identity issues specific to each state. The focus on local development issues is along expected lines. As political and economic authority and the principal arena for political contestation has shifted from the national level to state level, so have the major issues in national elections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0021909611425452">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Congress Party’s success was actually an aggregation of state-level verdicts. The party exceeded expectations in Rajasthan, managed to repeat its performance in Andhra Pradesh, Delhi and Haryana, stemmed its losses in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, re-emerged as a key player in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Kerala and got hammered in Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka. While Rahul Gandhi’s strategy of going it alone worked marvelously in Uttar Pradesh, the same strategy did not work very well in Bihar. In Bihar, the opposition NDA prevailed on the back of popular support for the Janata Dal (United), under the leadership of the state’s chief minister Nitish Kumar. The support for the party was seen as an approval of the state administration’s performance.</p>
<p>The Congress performed well in Uttar Pradesh as minorities appeared to have voted for the party in larger numbers. In Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan, some of the pro-poor initiatives seemed to have yielded results, while in West Bengal, the heavy-handedness of the state machinery in responding to protests against the land acquisition process for industrialization, disillusionment of Muslims with the ruling Left coalition and the disapproval of actions of Left front cadres ensured a stunning result in favor of the UPA. In Kerala, factionalism within the Left Front, poor governance and anti-incumbency led to another UPA success story. In Tamil Nadu, the Congress’ alliance partner the DMK managed to prevail over other Dravidian parties on the back of populist schemes, while the MNS cut into the vote share of the NDA in Maharashtra, thereby helping the Congress alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611425452">Center for Developing Societies, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>For the BJP, there was good news from Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh, but precious little anywhere else. It performed poorly in the north, where it has been traditionally strong, and in the south. Even though the Congress organization in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh was demoralized, the BJP was unable to shut out the Congress. One of the primary reasons for the NDA’s poor national-level performance was the negligible presence of the BJP and absence of alliance partners in key states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. It was also clear that the successes of both the national parties was dependent on certain leaders like Narendra Modi, Sheila Dikshit, BS Yeddyurappa, Prem Kumar Dhumal and Bhupinder Hooda, who embodied regional aspirations within their respective national parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909611425452">Shastri, 2009</xref>). Therefore, it would be incorrect to claim that state-level issues and factors have been trumped by national considerations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0021909611425452">
<title>Persistence of Identity Politics</title>
<p>In India, the strategy of social coalitions under the Congress has declined over the years and has been replaced by parties that cater to individual segments of society, primarily on the basis of caste and religion. As the national party lost ground to the new identity-based parties (including regional parties), it led to increasing fragmentation of the legislature. Over time these parties have attempted to form alliances with each other at the national and state level but, due to lack of ideological cohesiveness, these alliances have been short-lived and unstable. Nevertheless, with increasing significance of caste, religion and region in Indian politics, identity-based parties have grown over the past two decades.</p>
<p>The results of the elections have been interpreted by some as an indication of the saturation of identity-based politics (caste, religion and region) in India. However, upon analysis, we find that the votes polled by some of the major identity-based parties have increased since the last elections. For example, the BSP recorded an increase in vote share (6.2% versus 5.3%) and number of seats (even though not to the same extent that it would have liked) since the last elections. The party emerged as runners-up in as many as forty-six seats, in which it lost by a margin of less than twenty-thousand votes. Nevertheless, there has been a decline in support for the BSP since its successes in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections in 2007 and its performance in the general elections thwarted its leader Mayawati’s prime ministerial aspirations.</p>
<p>The BSP emerged in Uttar Pradesh in the 1980s as a party that championed the cause of the Scheduled Castes or Dalits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021909611425452">Gupta, 2009</xref>). After the consolidation of its Dalit vote-bank, it attempted to bridge the divide between the Dalits and the upper caste Brahmins, Other Backward Castes (OBCs) and Muslims within the state. In essence, it attempted to replicate the successes of the Congress’s strategy of building social coalitions prior to the 1990s. Its attempts culminated in a landslide victory for the party in the 2007 Uttar Pradesh state assembly elections. Based on its previous success, it was expected that the party would perform well in the general elections and signal its arrival as a national player.</p>
<p>Since then a combination of half-hearted support from the upper caste Brahmins, allegations of corruption, poor governance, failure to maintain law and order and Mayawati’s megalomania (evidenced by the gigantic statutes of her built across the state’s capital) all led to reverses at the national polls. The BSP’s social coalition is beginning to unravel, forcing it to return to its roots and pay greater attention to its Dalit constituents. The party will thus continue to remain closely wedded to the Dalit cause. It continues to govern Uttar Pradesh, and remains an influential party at the national level with the fourth-largest number of seats in parliament.</p>
<p>In contrast, another important identity-based party, the BJP, has suffered more than a minor setback in these general elections. Although it was not expected to form a government without the support of defectors from the Third Front, the manner of defeat was hard to digest for its leaders. Even in its traditional strongholds of Delhi, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat, the party is now under threat.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the performance of the party should not come as a complete surprise. The party saw rapid rise in fortunes at the state and national level in the aftermath of the campaign in the early 1990s to build a temple, dedicated to the Hindu god Rama, on the site of a 16th-century century mosque. The destruction of the mosque by Hindu fundamentalists unleashed religious riots across the country and worsened relations between Hindus and Muslims. Over time, the BJP realized that its goal of attaining power at the national level would remain elusive so long as it remained wedded to the agenda of Hindu nationalism. Since the late 1990s, it has attempted to downplay the latter in an attempt to gain more allies, leading to the creation of the NDA. The 1999 elections brought the NDA to power and it was the first non-Congress coalition government to complete a full term in office. The NDA was, however, upstaged by the Congress alliance in the 2004 election (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021909611425452">Sridharan, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Since then, the NDA has hemorrhaged allies who have been uncomfortable with the BJP’s stance towards minorities. Several parties left citing a negative impact on their vote share due to their association with the BJP. The BJP will continue to be limited vis-à-vis the Congress simply because it has no allies and negligible presence in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, which together return 184 out of the 543 members of parliaments. This time the BJP was able to secure only 11 out of the 184 seats. It performed poorly not only in the south (except in Karnataka) but also in the north, which used to be its traditional stronghold.</p>
<p>Many have blamed its limited appeal and lower coalitionability as the key reason for its decline. If the situation persists then the party will not be able to expand its base or gain new allies, thereby handing over victory to the Congress. It will continue to remain part of the opposition: unable to implement its policies or national agenda. This will prevent the BJP from becoming a truly national alternative to the Congress.</p>
<p>The solution for the party may be to follow a more centrist and moderate agenda, build bridges with minorities and work in the interests of the lower castes, while retaining the support of its core constituents; that is, upper-caste and upper-class voters. However, this is easier said than done. The BJP is currently in a bind as to whether to re-orient its ideology in light of the election results or remain committed to its core ideals. The infighting among the party’s top leadership in the aftermath of the electoral setback has led to predictions of the BJP’s slow death.</p>
<p>However, it is too early to predict the demise of the party. Although the party was drubbed by the Congress in Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttarakhand, it did well in Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand and Karnataka, where it secured 67 out of the 123 seats available. It still commands a sizeable following in several states and possesses state leaders capable of revamping the party. Their organizational skills and credibility will continue to pose a serious challenge to the Congress, especially since state-level factors continue to determine voter choice. Identity-based parties, like the BSP and the BJP, appear to have suffered a setback in these elections but they continue to remain a potent force in Indian politics. The BJP remains the only national alternative to the Congress and a natural magnet for those disillusioned with the Congress. However, like the Congress, it will also need the support of regional parties.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>During the period between the 1980s and 1990s, India was witness to states emerging as the primary arena of political contestation and a reconfiguration of the party system. These trends were primarily the result of greater mobilization and participation of citizens belonging to the lower castes and lower classes. The Congress Party witnessed a sharp drop in seats, both at the national as well as state level, as these groups gravitated towards rival political parties promising transformative changes. However, the fragmentation of votes meant that no party was capable of securing a majority on its own in parliament thus making electoral alliances and coalition governments inevitable.</p>
<p>The BJP continues to perform poorly because of its inability to attract the underprivileged and minority constituents and failure to hold onto its core bloc: upper caste, upper class, educated, urban and male voters. Based on the results, the Congress appears to have benefited from the BJP’s shortcomings and also regained some of the lower caste and lower class votes that it lost during the earlier decades. Together, this has allowed the Congress to perform better vis-à-vis other parties. This trend was clear during the 2004 elections and explains why the Congress continues to do well. However, it is still unable to form a government on its own because it shares the OBC and Dalit vote (together, the majority in India) with several other regional parties.</p>
<p>The votes–seat relationship that is characteristic of the single-member simple plurality electoral system has amplified the small increase in vote share for the Congress into a substantial gain in number of seats. This led to declarations like ‘decisive verdict’. However, the elections of 2009 did not change the long-term patterns of electoral politics in India. It only confirmed established patterns and produced a slightly different outcome: that is, an increase in number of seats for the Congress. Although some regional parties performed poorly, others did very well. As such, there are more elements of continuity than change witnessed in the recent elections.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Congress was successful in establishing and maintaining the ‘right’ kind of alliances with regional parties in some key states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. This, coupled with its improved performance in states like Uttar Pradesh, allowed it to retain power. The results of the elections in 2009 demonstrate that regional parties, state-level factors/issues and questions of identity are still important elements in electoral politics in India. Social cleavages, electoral rules and continuing decentralization of political and economic authority in India will ensure that regional parties remain significant. In the future, voters will continue to make their choice at the level of states, thereby providing regional parties the opportunity to influence national politics for some time to come.</p>

<p>According to the Election Commission of India, a state party is one which has been involved in political activity for at least five years and wins either 4% of the seats in a general election or 3% of seats in a state election. In addition, they must have the support of 6% of the total votes cast. A party that is recognized as a state party in four states is treated as a ‘National Party’ in India.</p>
