<abstract>
<p>Turnout is a key indicator in European Parliament elections in the absence of a direct executive outcome. Forecasting turnout is an important exercise in requiring the identification of a parsimonious model with good lead time from the array of structural, demographic, and attitudinal variables employed in rich explanatory models of turnout, and simultaneously minimizing prediction error. Building on a series of regression models using aggregate data, this article explores the applicability of such an approach to turnout in the EU-27 countries and considers the explanatory added value that deriving such a forecast model can also provide.</p>

<p>While forecasting models of electoral outcomes have long been a staple of the psephological literature, forecasts of abstention have been less common. Interest has always lain principally in predicting the winner of an election and in accurately estimating their vote share. Forecasting the “losers’” vote share in multiparty systems is a more recent development requiring more sophisticated models. But forecasting abstention appears a somewhat esoteric aim, not least because these nonvotes do not ostensibly count. Turnout is, however, a key outcome of any election and deserves study as a forecast. First, turnout determines election results—it decidedly does count. The ability of a party or candidate to “get the vote out” has always been a key competitive indicator, as well as an obvious campaign objective.</p>
<p>Second, turnout is increasingly seen as an indicator of democratic performance. Early studies of abstention may have seen high turnout as evidence of ideological extremism, social conflict, and unstable democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912911421016">Gosnell 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1065912911421016">Tingsten 1937</xref>). However, in contemporary democracies, falling turnout has been seen as evidence of an apathetic and disconnected electorate, leading to a decline in the quality and effectiveness of political representation. Whether or not this partly normative analysis of changing turnout is accurate, the indicator does empirically show decreasing levels of participation at the ballot box. No ballot is more scrutinized for its turnout levels in this respect than elections to the European Parliament (EP). Without the distraction of a direct executive outcome resulting from the distribution of party families and coalitions across the assembly, turnout in Euroelections is seen as a poll of public mood toward the EU, a picture that is often complemented with the account of electoral performances by the more marginal populist or Euroskeptic forces on the European political stage.</p>
<p>As recalled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1065912911421016">Hix and Hagemann (2009)</xref>, the original idea in introducing direct elections to the EP was to reinforce the political linkage between the then European Community (EC) and its citizens. Contrary to these earlier hopes, the reality of persistently higher levels of voter indifference in EP elections has been regarded as one manifestation of the “democratic deficit” in the European Union (EU; see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1065912911421016">Føllesdal and Hix 2006</xref>). A monotonic decrease in overall European turnout since 1979 has variously been seen as a symptom of disenchantment with the EU, a disconnect between an obscure elite institution and mass publics, and evidence of the EP’s lack of policy teeth.</p>
<p>Such a decline in turnout has consequences, not least in the political makeup of the EP. Smaller parties and extremist parties tend to perform better in Euroelections than in first-order legislative elections anyway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912911421016">Marsh 1998</xref>), and where abstention among supporters of mainstream parties is disproportionately high, the peripheral parties win even bigger. The perceived impotence of the EP as a legislative arena has undoubtedly contributed to the lower rates of turnout. To a large extent the strengthening of the Parliament’s powers and legislative role under the institutional provisions of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009 can be considered yet another response to this deficit in political legitimacy following the many efforts to increase the powers of the Parliament since the mid-1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1065912911421016">Rittberger 2005</xref>). Yet it is still unclear that this will translate into greater participation in the next 2014 European ballot, whereas there might be concerns that enhanced extremist and Euroskeptic support will translate into greater influence.</p>
<p>However, this view of turnout in European elections may be excessively pessimistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1065912911421016">Schmitt and van der Eijk 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1065912911421016">Thomassen 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1065912911421016">Mair and Thomassen 2010</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1065912911421016">Moravcsik (2002</xref>, 615), the premise that “greater participation in European political institutions will generate . . . greater popular support for the EU” is itself questionable. At the very least, the deficit thesis might place too much responsibility for rising abstention in the Parliament and EU themselves. Without first identifying the causes of abstention, and in particular structural components to this, it is impossible to identify with any certainty the role of disenchantment with Europe per se. Furthermore, the accumulated experience of now seven waves of European elections shows that overall levels of participation in EP contests are indeed consistently lower than domestic ones in the vast majority of member states, including the “founding fathers” of the EU and some of the most integrated countries within the Eurozone. The question to ask here, then, should no longer be why a negative differential exists in turnout rates but rather the following: What are the factors of (in)stability in this undersized competitive space for electoral mobilization in European elections? While the process of deepening European integration has not fostered greater participation by citizens, it may well have contributed to stabilizing participation rates.</p>
<p>A model that proves able to forecast turnout on the basis of principally structural indicators, with good lead time and low error, would give an accurate baseline against which to assess those aspects of turnout that parties can at least hope to influence. This article, then, represents a first attempt to identify the degree to which a parsimonious forecast model can be identified for European abstention and the degree to which this presents better predictive value in comparison to the more extensive models in the explanatory literature. We start by detailing a forecasting approach to abstention, examining the value of fully specified models from the explanatory literature in performing as straight forecast instruments. We then suggest a simplified specification that best meets the key requirements of forecasting. Standard benchmarks are used to evaluate the quality of our final model and derive (<italic>quasi</italic>) <italic>ex ante</italic> forecasts for the 2009 and 2014 European ballots, respectively. Finally, we consider the issue of forecast heterogeneity in cross-national perspective and examine the extent to which stabilization in the margins for mobilization at EP ballots—as opposed to overall levels of turnout—is dependent on the degree of European integration across member states.</p>
<sec id="section1-1065912911421016">
<title>An Electoral Forecasting Approach to European Turnout</title>
<p>In deriving a cross-national forecast model in an area where we are unaware of any existing research that would provide a well-tested specification, a rich starting point is the expansive explanatory literature on turnout.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1065912911421016">1</xref></sup> This corpus of work is well rehearsed elsewhere, and for the moment we limit ourselves to identifying the two principal groups of variables—structural causes and demographic correlates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1065912911421016">Blais and Dobrzynska 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1065912911421016">Geys 2006</xref>)—normally used to explain turnout, as well as mainstays of the vote-popularity function literature, which explains government popularity using economic and political variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1065912911421016">Nannestad and Paldam 1994</xref>), and lastly attitudinal predictors of EU attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1065912911421016">Ray 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1065912911421016">Marks and Wilson 2000</xref>), which may also be useful in a forecast model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1065912911421016">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our main goal is to try to provide a common structural baseline that provides as accurate a prediction as possible of European election abstention as well as providing a potential root model on which to build social and attitudinal models of abstention at the European level. Equally, we accept that structural models can only go so far. Inevitably, there will be a degree of unexplained variance that requires going beyond the institutional framework to domestic context, which may or may not include variables such as levels of dissatisfaction, for example, as a possible factor.</p>
<p>From the literature, a large number of possible forecast models present themselves, and <italic>a priori</italic> no single model recommends itself more than others. All manner of combinations of the above variables are included and are often found to be significant in providing evidence of explanatory power. Generally, the models enjoy a less than inspiring <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>, and relatively little attention is paid to error terms. Election forecasting principles require a necessary shift in emphasis: while explanatory models tend to focus on the right-hand side of the equation—or more precisely a complex set of independent variables both in main and interaction effects—electoral forecasts are primarily concerned with the left (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1065912911421016">Lewis-Beck 2005</xref>, 147). Our quest is certainly not for the perfect <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>, but there is no getting around the need for a low model error, and within that as few outliers as possible—without these, the forecast venture is sunk.</p>
<p>Second, many explanatory models of European abstention are exogenous insofar as they use measures of turnout in adjacent national elections to account for variation in EP election participation. This can be seen in part as an operationalization of the second-order election paradigm that closely links the European and domestic arenas theoretically. National contexts may differ in terms of turnout beyond what simple institutional and election law structure suggest. Turnout at previous national elections is often included as an alternative to national dummies in a fixed-effects model to pick up national specificities that might be expected to affect both first- and second-order elections.</p>
<p>Forecasting models on the other hand favor an endogenous approach based on lagged electoral indicators as a baseline to predict future outcomes. In a small-<italic>n</italic> cross-national study such as this, the move toward an endogenous design entails a loss of cases with the removal of all first European elections from model estimates to allow the inclusion of the lagged endogenous variable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1065912911421016">3</xref></sup> Clearly, abandoning the first European contest has a stronger impact in all post-2004 member states, with only two waves of EP elections to date. Such a loss, although not negligible, should be compensated by the ability of a lagged endogenous variable to pick up a larger amount of variance and individual country specifics, thereby allowing for a simultaneous reduction in the number of predictors needed in the model. Where <italic>n</italic> is small, keeping <italic>k</italic> small to conserve degrees of freedom is important.</p>
<p>Last, and most important, one major difference between explanatory and forecasting endeavors lies with the standards employed for model evaluation. Turning again to the literature on election forecasting, the four main components of model quality—accuracy, parsimony, reproducibility, and lead time—are well known (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912911421016">Lewis-Beck 1985</xref>). In traditional models of election forecasts, <italic>ex post</italic> assessments can be routinely performed using standard indicators such as <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>, standard error of the estimate (SEE) and mean absolute error (MAE).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1065912911421016">4</xref></sup> Parsimony of competing models can also be evaluated with goodness-of-fit diagnostic measures such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC), its bias-corrected version for smaller samples (AIC<sub>c</sub>), or the Schwarz or Bayesian information criterion (BIC). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912911421016">Greene (2008</xref>, 142-43) suggests that the BIC is more appropriate for evaluating forecast models for the larger penalty it applies to overfitting. Here we employ the AIC<sub>c</sub>, which penalizes increased degrees of freedom more heavily, is applicable to nonnested models, and is preferable where the sample size is small relative to the number of parameters (usually <italic>n</italic> / <italic>k</italic> &lt; 40) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912911421016">Burnham and Anderson 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1065912911421016">5</xref></sup> Possible limitations on the use of information criteria in forecasting model selection are discussed later.</p>
<p><italic>In fine</italic>, the ability to predict the winner correctly remains a key benchmark for most forecasts of electoral outcomes. Here, the conceptual absence of a winner requires that we look for additional points of reference. In this particular context of comparative election forecasting, we would suggest a fifth dimension be considered in model quality assessment, namely, the homogeneity of forecasts. In cross-national design, the wide range of historical, political, and socioeconomic factors behind the contextual dynamics of EP election turnout will inevitably generate more heterogeneous forecasts than those that can be derived from single-country models. Besides accuracy, parsimony, lead, and reproducibility, it is important to take on board the model’s capacity to provide homogeneous predictions across groups of cases.</p>
<p>Clearly, the EU regional divide consecutive to the 2004 and 2007 waves of enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) countries features prominently here. We include all twenty-seven countries of the current EU rather than restricting ourselves to the Western European cases on which much of the comparative turnout literature is based. The most widely cited works use Western European countries up to the 2004 wave of enlargement to test individual and aggregate models. Few include CEE countries, no doubt in part because of the paucity of cases, but also because of the notion that CEE countries are somehow “different” from the Western member states in terms of party system implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912911421016">Bielasiak 2002</xref>), convergence in attitudes toward Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912911421016">Henderson 2008</xref>), and relationship between the domestic and European arenas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1065912911421016">Koepke and Ringe 2006</xref>). That is not to say that abstention in CEE countries has not been studied, however—for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1065912911421016">Fauvelle-Aymar and Stegmaier (2008)</xref> have precisely looked at differences in turnout across CEE countries, using common predictors such as unemployment and the electoral cycle. <italic>A priori</italic>, we see no reason to exclude CEE countries from the model, but we report differences between Western and CEE subsets of nations throughout.</p>

<title>Modeling European Turnout</title>
<p>For modeling purposes, the variables we employ are unconditional, to the extent that all of them are known well in advance—years, in some cases—of any European election.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1065912911421016">6</xref></sup> A number of the predictors are self-evident. Compulsory voting systems are clearly destined to predict higher levels of turnout than voluntary systems. Three of the EU members have sanctioned mandatory voting—Belgium, Cyprus, and Luxembourg. Greece ceased implementing mandatory voting in 2000. Similarly, in Italy, mandatory voting was abandoned in 1993. We therefore code Italy as mandatory for all elections up to and including 1994, where, with less than a year’s gap, we expect the previous mandatory rule to maintain an inertial effect. Some countries—the United Kingdom and Ireland, in particular, or previously the Netherlands—hold the elections on a weekday, rather than a Sunday. We control for this, expecting lower levels of turnout on a weekday.</p>
<p>As second-order elections, European turnout can be affected directly by the status of other elections at the country level as well as by location within the national election cycle. We tap this with two variables. First, we hypothesize that the level of turnout is conditioned by the proximity of the previous national election. A short space of time will result in lower turnout with a diminishing effect as time elapses. To reflect the diminishing lagged effect, we use the natural log of days since the last first-order election.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1065912911421016">7</xref></sup> Second, should another election be held simultaneously with the Eurovote, turnout is likely to rise, given the saliency of the ballot day across multiple votes, whether national or indeed nationwide local elections (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1065912911421016">Rallings and Thrasher 2005</xref>). We therefore include a simultaneous election variable.</p>
<p>We also include an indicator of the effective number of parties at the previous national election, as a proxy for national party system and the political competitive element. Given the complexity of relationships among party system, electoral system type, and district magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912911421016">Benoit 2001</xref>), we pick the effective number of parties as the causally subsequent outcome to tap effects of the domestic institutional system. The literature on party system format and turnout in national elections provides contradictory conclusions regarding the nature of the relationship between fragmentation in the party system and turnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1065912911421016">Wessels and Schmitt 2008</xref>). The assumption is that the differentiation in political supply inherent among a larger number of competitors is likely to increase participation in EP elections, as more voters with divergent views on Europe will be given the possibility to either express their true preferences or find in small protest parties a channel for political discontent. Last, acknowledging the possible economic component to the level of turnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1065912911421016">Lewis-Beck and Lockerbie 1989</xref>), we include a lagged measure of unemployment, six months prior to the European election in question.</p>
<p>Turning to fixed effects, because of the specific nature of European ballots, a strong model should reflect changes in the composition and institutional structure of the EU as supranational entity, which may well affect turnout. With the experience of now two waves of EP elections in the former communist bloc, we must look more closely at variation in turnout across the two main regions within the EU and control for lower average turnout in CEE countries in 2004 and 2009. This regional divide overlaps partly with the historical process of building the EU since the late 1970s. Considering the deepening of European integration consecutive to both the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties in 1993 and 1999, we control for the period effect, expecting turnout post-Amsterdam to drop. At the aggregate level, this effect is already apparent. The 1999 European elections were a first turning point: while participation had been stable at about 59 percent since the first set of EP elections in 1979, the 1999 ballot showed the first significant drop in overall turnout from 56.7 percent in 1994 down to less than 50 percent.</p>
<p>Other potential effects of the continuous change in the institutional structure of the EU can be tapped through a public opinion variable. We include one attitudinal indicator of Euroskepticism, namely, the percentage of the population that agrees with the statement “Membership of the EU is a bad thing” in the Eurobarometer survey carried out six months prior to the EP election. The addition of a variable of support to European integration is in line with the research conducted on the importance of EU-related matters in electoral choices made by voters in EP elections. However, we are wary even of a basic attitudinal indicator such as this, with the relationship between Euroskepticism and abstention an ambiguous one. At the individual level, choices are dependent on the range of political alternatives available to voters. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1065912911421016">Hobolt, Spoon, and Tilley (2009)</xref> show, for instance, that a greater distance between voters and their preferred national party on EU matters significantly increases the likelihood of defecting or abstaining in European elections.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to take into account the economic relationship between individual countries and the EU, even more so in the context of current and future European government debt crisis and EU or International Monetary Fund emergency measures. EU budgetary economics forms a third line of division relatively independent from both the historical and regional dimensions among all twenty-seven member states. Based on EU operational budgetary balances, one can distinguish between net contributors and net beneficiaries of EU membership. This helps identify countries whose attachment to the EU derives primarily from strong economic dependency from those that have borne most of the cost of building a common “house” over the years. From previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1065912911421016">Mattila 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1065912911421016">Studlar, Flickinger, and Bennett 2003</xref>), we would expect “grateful” net recipients of EU funds to turn out in greater numbers in EP elections.</p>

<title>Toward a Parsimonious Forecasting Model for European Turnout</title>
<p>We explore four possible models for forecasting European election turnout. These time series cross-section regression models are specified as a cross-combination of the dimensions discussed above, that is, exogenous versus endogenous and explanatory (complex) versus forecasting (simple). We first look at models with an extensively specified range of predictors, including structural, institutional, and EU-related indicators, period and regional controls, and attitudinal variables (models 1a and 1b). These contrast endogenous and exogenous baseline indicators, using European and national turnout, respectively. We then identify the two most parsimonious and accurate models obtainable from the same set of predictors and compare these (models 2a and 2b). To allow for valid model comparison, regressions based on national turnout are performed for the subset of cases excluding all first European elections. Implications of case selection are discussed in the next section. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1065912911421016">Beck and Katz (1995)</xref>, robust standard errors are employed in all models to deal with panel heteroscedasticity.</p>
<p>As might be expected, in strict explanatory terms, models 1a and 1b perform relatively well (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912911421016">Table 1</xref>). The variables are intuitive and intelligent. Adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> surpasses .90 in both cases, most parameters are significant at the 90 percent level, and all are in the expected direction, thereby providing yet another full picture of the complex dynamics behind participation in European ballots. At first glance, both models also seem to perform well as forecasting instruments, with similar and respectable MAE across all countries and all elections. Consideration of the corrected AIC points to a clear choice in favor of the exogenous model 1b.</p>

<p>Yet when we test these models more stringently in terms of their forecast potential, we need to be more wary of the performance. First, with respect to lead time, the inclusion of shorter-term economic, domestic electoral, and public opinion variables means future forecasts could be issued only a few months ahead of European elections. Second, these models are hardly parsimonious, with eleven predictors each. In terms of reducing forecast error, we need to be certain that each of these predictors provides a valuable contribution to the model. Last, considering regional asymmetry in forecasts in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912911421016">Table 1</xref>, differences in predictive homogeneity are perceivable. Both models work better for the old members and, more generally, Western European countries: errors are of the same magnitude irrespective of the baseline used. On the other hand, discrepancies are larger in the MAE of the exogenous model.</p>
<p>The exogenous approach that is customary in the literature is partly undermined here by the heterogeneity in the causal link that can be posited between the domestic and European arenas of electoral competition. In the context of the present study, the utility of an external measure of participatory trends across European nations is questionable. If we look at the relationship between national and European turnout, Western countries show evidence of an association between the two, as one would expect theoretically, but CEE countries show no such relationship (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1065912911421016">Figure 1</xref>). The evidence suggests that what in fact national turnout proxies is the implantation of the second-order elections into the national model and their temporal location in the first-order election cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1065912911421016">Schmitt 2005</xref>). For the East, the paucity of European elections means this has not happened yet.</p>

<p>In line with the traditional heuristics of electoral forecasting, we identify the best fitting and most parsimonious models based on both the endogenous and exogenous sets of predictors. These are selected on the basis of their overall predictive efficacy as measured through MAE, with a view to decreasing the number of predictors while simultaneously preserving each model’s performance in terms of error reduction. Given that the vast majority of variables reach a level of statistical significance, we proceed with a backward removal of variables based on the relative size of <italic>t</italic>-scores and monitoring the resultant change in MAE and AIC<sub>c</sub>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1065912911421016">Figures 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1065912911421016">2b</xref> show the changes in these two indices as each model drops variables in increasing size of <italic>t</italic>-value. While in the exogenous model, the change in AIC<sub>c</sub> and MAE is monotonic and begins to see significant degradation in predictive power after the removal of two variables, the same cannot be said of the endogenous model. The first two removals produce more striking improvements in both indices, subsequent to which AIC<sub>c</sub> increases—but MAE fluctuates when the six weakest predictors are removed and rises only slightly on the removal of the seventh. We return shortly to our rationale for removing this seventh predictor nonetheless. For the moment, let us note that methodological issues can be raised as to the capacity of even the corrected AIC<sub>c</sub> to effectively manage the trade-off between the number of predictors and the residual variance in cases where <italic>k</italic> is large relative to <italic>n</italic>. Here the <italic>k</italic> penalty may be smaller than the bias adjustment and therefore not sufficient to offset the additional effect of even a relatively weak predictor.</p>

<p>Returning to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912911421016">Table 1</xref>, models 2a and 2b report the final models after the removal of the redundant predictors. These parsimonious alternatives to both the endogenous and exogenous models can be obtained with no significant degradation in overall predictive accuracy. Compared with the original models, both have seen a loss of information, comparatively smaller in the endogenous model (AIC<sub>c</sub> from 751.6 to 753.8, as opposed to 730.6 up to 736.1 in its exogenous counterpart). A strict adherence to the corrected AIC in model selection would still enjoin us to favor the exogenous specification over its endogenous counterpart. However, we argue that a choice based exclusively on the information criterion is simplistic, inasmuch as it obliterates other crucial components to effective forecasting models.</p>
<p>While AIC<sub>c</sub> is a useful guide, other properties need to be considered, beginning with simplicity. Although this is clearly not a winning argument per se, it must be noted that the final endogenous model now has fewer than half the number of substantive predictors that are still needed in its exogenous counterpart to secure a similar level of overall accuracy. Moreover, these four are long-term structural indicators that profoundly shape the space for electoral mobilization in EP ballots. As anticipated, the lagged European turnout as a baseline absorbs a significant proportion of the variance accounted for by some of the shorter-term and region-specific indicators. While statistically significant as regression parameters, the latter simply become redundant in reducing forecast error.</p>
<p>More importantly, the structural endogenous model enjoys a substantial advantage in lead time. This motivates our removal of the seventh variable—effective number of parties—despite this raising the MAE given the requirement to know the outcome of the national election to calculate this. Institutional variables such as days since the last first-order election potentially have longer leads, especially where legislative terms are fixed—increasingly the norm in Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1065912911421016">8</xref></sup> For the exogenous model, national turnout, in contrast, has a shorter lead time than the election variables based on the electoral calendar—we may know at quite some distance when the next national elections are to be held, but not what their turnout will be.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1065912911421016">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of course, we should be cautious and consider some limitations inherent in the <italic>any other election</italic> variable. In future forecasts, it is not a given how well in advance we would be in a position to determine which member states will hold another election—either local or national—on the same day as the EP contest. That said, one can estimate for most countries whether an election is due in the same few weeks as the European election, in which case it is reasonable to assume that it will be scheduled to coincide with the European ballot.</p>
<p>Third, an increase in forecast heterogeneity is still present in the exogenous model that has significantly larger absolute errors on average in CEE member states, whereas the endogenous model still performs relatively better in the region. Beside this substantive element, a brief empirical point should be made here with regard to the case-selection process. Removing all first European ballots in the exogenous models for the sake of comparability with the endogenous model mechanically improves the fit by canceling a substantial amount of the additional variance inherent in the “novelty” effect—which translates into higher turnout—associated with all inaugural EP elections (particularly in the West, with an average bonus of ten points over the subsequent elections in the series, as compared with the East’s two points). Therefore, the exogenous model is confronted with a somewhat easier task of forecasting European turnout in its already stabilized phase. In contrast, the endogenous model does include all first European elections as a baseline and, in doing so, must account for their specific contribution to the total variance. This is perceptible in the significantly larger errors found across the seventeen second EP elections in the West (MAE = 6.8) as opposed to all subsequent ballots whose greater electoral stability is confirmed by smaller forecast errors (MAE = 4.1).</p>
<p>Last, model performances need to be evaluated with regard to their future forecast potential. In the absence of a correlation between national and European turnout in CEE countries, we would be concerned that the exogenous model suffers from persistently larger errors in this region in the next wave of EP elections. In this respect, and despite the strong theoretical argument attached to the use of a domestic turnout baseline, the endogenous approach appears to be a better choice prospectively.</p>
<p>Because of its higher degree of complexity in relation to a relatively small number of data points, reproducibility of the solution in the current exogenous model will also be more sensitive to changes that will occur in the data once new elections are added to the cross-national set, although the overall impact may be lessened in return by averaging across all variables. With a view to securing the smallest possible number of safe predictors, the inevitable risk of increased bias inherent in the endogenous model appears to be smaller.</p>

<title>Quasi Ex Ante 2009 and Ex Ante 2014 European Election Forecasts</title>
<p>With a final model to hand, accuracy can be further assessed in deriving quasi ex ante and ex ante forecasts for the 2009 and 2014 European elections, respectively. There are necessarily limitations to both exercises, yet such evaluations of predictive accuracy lie at the heart of every forecasting enterprise.</p>
<p>First, we test the predictive efficacy for the June 2009 European elections using the 1979–2004 turnout. Overall model fit is unchanged in terms of both parameter estimates and overall errors (Adj. <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .90, SEE = 6.37, MAE = 4.9, <italic>n</italic> = 64).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1065912911421016">10</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912911421016">Table 2</xref> has the detail of retrodictive forecasts against observed turnout rates across all EU-15 members in 2009. The model would have performed well in 2009, with an average forecast error of 3.1 percent, the largest discrepancies being found in Austria, Denmark, and the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Forecasts can also be derived for the future set of European elections to be held in June 2014. Obviously, there is some uncertainty as to the shape and boundaries of the EU-to-be, as Iceland and some “Western Balkan” countries such as Croatia move toward accession. The forecasts evidently cover only current members. Moreover, some terms in the equation are not fixed at the time of writing. Changes are likely to occur in the different national electoral calendars as currently established. Further iterations of the model can of course correct for this in due course. Also, it can only be assumed that a number of member states will make the decision to couple the 2014 European contest with domestic elections or referenda should the opportunity arise. Iterative corrections here are time dependent. Last, we need to consider the possibility of a renewed interest in European politics by citizens of the Union under the new Lisbon Treaty, not to mention a possible surge in Euroenthusiasm should European leaders manage to respond effectively and collectively to the current financial and economic crisis. This may lead to underestimation of turnout.</p>
<p>Still, the combination of relative simplicity and a strong structural component in the general design of the model permits ex ante conditional forecasts some three and a half years ahead of the EP ballot, something the exogenous model cannot do.

<p>At EU level, the model predicts that turnout will decrease again in 2014 albeit in limited fashion, as the overall rate of participation should reach 42.5 percent (as opposed to 43 percent in 2009). Looking at individual country forecasts shows that abstention will be on the rise in twelve member states, most prominently in Italy, Greece, Denmark, Hungary, Germany, and Latvia. Levels of engagement will remain relatively stable in another seven member states (Sweden, France, Ireland, Estonia, Finland, Belgium, and Luxembourg), while the model anticipates an increase in turnout across nine countries (Portugal, Cyprus, Slovenia, Romania, United Kingdom, Poland, Slovakia, Netherlands, and the Czech Republic). In the last three cases, a parliamentary election is due to coincide roughly with the date of the June 2014 EP elections; our working hypothesis here is that the two elections will be likely to be held simultaneously, as could also be the case in Belgium—and will be in Luxembourg—or in Ireland, where local elections are scheduled around the time of the European contest. Indeed, it would be strongly advisable to do this if the governments in those countries wish to encourage voters’ participation in the European ballot. If not, the general forecast for EU turnout in 2014 would be down to 41.8 percent across all member states, considering there will be no simultaneous elections beside the customary coupling of parliamentary and European contests in Luxembourg.</p>

<title>How Good a Forecasting Model Is This? Homo- versus Heterogeneous Model Fit</title>
<p>In spite of significant improvements, there are still a number of issues arising from the construction of our reduced model of European election turnout forecast. The first question is that of the overall added value of the model in comparison with other predictive instruments. Customarily, forecasting models can be contrasted against public opinion polls, naïve random walk models, and, where available, predictive markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912911421016">Campbell 2008</xref>). We do not have predictive markets, but we can compare our models with polls and naïve models. Considering, first, polling predictions from the Eurobarometer surveys, the forecasting models are superior—Eurobarometer surveys with only relatively short lag times still suffer from large error, which has left them with little forecasting value.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1065912911421016">11</xref></sup> Similarly, compared to a naïve random walk model—which is in fact a reduced version of our parsimonious endogenous model—our model outperforms all estimates across subsets of countries in terms of accuracy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1065912911421016">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>While a significant achievement in building a unitary model of forecasting European election turnout, reduction in regional heterogeneity should not conceal the fact that model performances still vary in quality across nations and time, in some cases across a substantial range. Yet such variability is not randomly distributed: there are grounds for suspecting that model <italic>stability</italic>—as opposed to model <italic>specification</italic>—across the twenty-seven nations may vary in a consistent manner under the influence of particular political and institutional determinants.</p>
<p>We have already noted the artificial inflation of first European election turnout levels, which settle down over time. Similarly, as discussed earlier in relation to the debate over the democratic deficit and issues of legitimacy, one important observation is that the deepening of European integration over the last decades has had very little effect on levels of voter mobilization in EP elections. Moreover, there is no evidence of any causal mechanism between integration and participation, with poor turnout rates observable in some of the most integrated member states. On the other hand, differences in forecast success between old and new members suggest that a distinct competitive space for voter mobilization in European elections may stabilize as integration broadly progresses.</p>
<p>Most studies of Europeanization focus on its consequences in terms of policies, political institutions, or change in national party system format and/or dynamics (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1065912911421016">Ladrech 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1065912911421016">Graziano and Vink 2006</xref>). Looking through the lens of European election turnout forecasting reveals significant differences in the model’s ability to correctly predict outcomes depending on the level of European integration. Ex post examination of MAE variation across all member states shows that the endogenous model performs significantly better in countries with a higher level of integration within the EU and that forecast errors are reduced as member states progress toward deeper integration.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, we calculate a simple cumulative index of European integration based on two dichotomous criteria—whether the country is one of the six founding members of the EC and whether it is a member of the Eurozone at the time of the European election.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1065912911421016">13</xref></sup> Average forecasting errors are smallest in the countries with the highest score on the index—that is, the six founding members of the EEC in the post-Amsterdam period after each of them has adopted the single currency (MAE = 2.4).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1065912911421016">14</xref></sup> In contrast, MAEs are notably larger in countries with the lowest value on the index (MAE = 6.7), with a medium level of European integration (those who have adopted the euro but are not founding members) giving an MAE of 4.3.</p>
<p>The most striking finding is that changes in the integration index determine model performance in a number of countries over time. Change in model performance is most visible in cases of second-wave member states that subsequently adopted the single currency. For instance, there is a substantial reduction in forecast error for the so-called “cohesion policy” member states—Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Ireland—in the post-Amsterdam period, nuancing our understanding of how the broad economic relationship between Europe and individual nations affects the European polity at national level. Beyond the clear beneficial impact of EU structural and cohesion funds on the economy of a number of member states, it might also help us better understand how public debates on Europe are structured.</p>
<p>A similar, albeit more partial, conclusion applies to the new CEE member states that joined in 2004. Compared with the whole group of postcommunist nations, the only two CEE countries with significantly smaller forecast errors are those in the Eurozone, namely, Slovenia and Slovakia, where turnout has proved far more consistent, albeit at very low levels, across the 2004 and 2009 waves of EP elections. Confronting forecast errors in the group of EU founders reveals an analogous impact from the European integration process. In five of the EC-6 member states a substantial reduction in MAE is found in the post-Amsterdam period, most significantly in Belgium, Germany, France, and Italy, the gain in accuracy being more modest in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>Overall, then, within a relatively strongly performing forecast model, the extent of integration into the EU, temporally and institutionally, accounts for stabilization of turnout and therefore predictability of individual country scores. The model works better for “more European” cases. Inevitably, other grouping variables might be found showing similar heterogeneity in performance. Equally, separate model specifications might improve forecasts for each group. However, this conceptually grounded differentiator clearly demonstrates a dynamic element to stability in, as well as bases to, turnout.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this article was to examine the possibility of deriving forecast models for turnout in European elections over the 1979–2009 period. In light of the wealth of existing comparative literature on both macro and micro factors of electoral participation, there were encouraging signs that a number of key institutional, political, and socioeconomic variables could be identified to form the core of a regression model of turnout applicable to the wide range of EU member states. Building on this accumulated knowledge, the article looked at the opportunity of such an approach to explore the Eurovote comparatively, based on conceptual underpinning and assumptions.</p>
<p>Overall, a number of conclusions can be reached. First, and most important, across all European countries, predictive efficacy is best achieved through an endogenous model of electoral turnout. Structural indicators added to the random walk model provide the best fit and lead time, and at a lesser cost. In strict forecasting terms, then, a relatively unsophisticated endogenous model outperforms rich and complex exogenous ones. Nevertheless, simplicity in the statistical design is not contradictory to the imperative that forecasting models be grounded in theory.</p>
<p>In the post-2004 enlarged EU, observed trends in domestic participation provide us with only partial information about levels of turnout that can be expected in subsequent European contests, and even this is true of only Western countries—CEE members find no such pattern. If a link exists, it is to be sought primarily in the strong effect of the EP election’s location within the electoral cycle measuring the distance to the preceding national election. The significance of this should not be overlooked: not only because it fits the general analytical framework traditionally derived for election cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1065912911421016">Tufte 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912911421016">Marsh 1998</xref>) but also because its statistical impact is similar in magnitude to that of well-identified predictors of greater turnout such as holding a simultaneous election. Interestingly, recent research shows the complexity of the connection that might exist between the national and European arenas and provides evidence that voter lethargy in European elections might in return depress turnout in national ballots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912911421016">Franklin and Hobolt 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The primacy of political and institutional factors in the approach should not be taken to mean that the model is therefore totally immune to shorter-term factors that are likely to affect the EU as a whole. One recent illustration is that of the economic downturn following the banking crisis. The credit crunch of 2009 might, for instance, have taken many badly hit countries’ voters minds off who their MEP should be, and even perhaps that there were MEPs to elect. The magnitude of the economic shock is apparent in some of the large errors in our model’s forecasts for 2009, albeit not in a consistent direction—take, for example, the opposing dynamics across the three Baltic states. Yet such cases are relatively few in number, which indicates the general predictability of turnout, even through a relatively unsophisticated cross-national model. We can never hope to anticipate their effect in modeling terms but can simply revise estimates accordingly.</p>
<p>Most notable is perhaps the significant impact of the European integration process on the stabilization of a distinct space for electoral mobilization in EP elections. The predictive efficacy of the model increases as one moves toward deeper integration, while there are greater levels of forecast instability in the more peripheral member states. Given the current tribulations of the Eurozone, that deeper integration occurs across the twenty-seven nations is not a given.</p>
<p>To conclude, we argue that, if explaining abstention in European elections and indeed all elections is an important exercise in understanding voting behavior, forecasting abstention raises the bar for what really matters. The identification of a small number of structural predictors added to an endogenous baseline is important for the EU and its leaders inasmuch as it illustrates the relatively low room to maneuver there is for altering turnout. If the democratic deficit is evidenced on this base, the scope for rectifying the deficit is minimal. In some senses, our finding is simple, in the best constitutional engineering sense: to raise participation, elections should be on weekends, preferably together with another election—any other—and voting should be made obligatory. This of course misses the point of voter mobilization entirely, argue the politicians and activists. But it is entirely the point. From our model’s findings, we would not criticize European opinion leaders in their efforts to mobilize voters, but rather encourage greater management of expectations in this respect.</p>
<p>In the final assessment, the strength and stability of the forecast model will be best evaluated by its performance in 2014. With a three-and-a-half-year lead time, the current forecast is relatively ambitious, and will almost certainly need emendation, for instance, if the national electoral calendar of certain countries change. However, such changes are easily made—and ad hoc tweaks to the model nudging it toward a better forecast are less easily disguised. In these respects, then, the components of reproducibility, lead time, and parsimony are all met. Only time will tell whether increased accuracy completes the set.</p>
