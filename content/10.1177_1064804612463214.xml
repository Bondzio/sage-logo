<p>Task analysis for the development of a virtual reality (VR) training system requires analysis and identification of the operator’s interactions with the real-world system and of the objectives of training and the trainee’s skill acquisition requirements. A task analysis approach for developing VR training simulators is presented that is based on analyzing the technology and training requirements concurrently. This approach is compared with traditional approaches for system development, with examples provided from the development of a VR training simulator for industrial maintenance and assembly tasks.</p>

<p>Where traditional task analysis methods fall short, this new approach can lead to more effective training simulators.</p>
<p>In the past decades, technological advances have enabled the development of increasingly realistic virtual and simulated worlds that are intended to support skill acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1064804612463214">Kneebone, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1064804612463214">Weller, 2004</xref>). Virtual reality (VR) training simulators can be defined as interactive systems that represent the real world through the artificial duplication or replication of the system, including its equipment, environment, and capabilities (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1064804612463214">Jones, Hennessey, &amp; Deutsch, 1985</xref>), with the goal of facilitating the acquisition of new skills or improving existing ones.</p>
<p>VR training simulators can be used to assist skill acquisition by providing trainees with realistic work environments in which they can practice their problem-solving and technical skills in a safe and guided setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1064804612463214">Gaba &amp; DeAnda, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1064804612463214">Weller, 2004</xref>). Developing VR training simulators is difficult not only because of the technical challenges but also because of the required integration of the trainees’ skill acquisition needs into the simulator’s functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1064804612463214">Michelson, 2006</xref>). The importance of incorporating training needs into the technological development of training simulators was identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1064804612463214">Kneebone (2003)</xref>, who said, “The emphasis is now shifting from the technology of simulation towards partnership with education and clinical practice” (p. 267).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1064804612463214">Wickens, Lee, Liu, and Gordon Becker (2004)</xref> suggested that when developing a new product or system, the first step should include a front-end analysis in order to understand the system, users, and environment. This analysis can be completed through the use of task analysis (TA) methods. In this article, we describe and recommend the adoption of a new task analysis approach for developing VR training simulators.</p>
<sec id="section1-1064804612463214">
<title>VR Training Simulators and Task Analysis</title>
<p>The TA method we present was developed in response to our efforts to design VR-based training simulators to support skill acquisition for tasks involving both complex cognitive and sensorimotor components. In general, sensorimotor skills relate to the relationship between perceptual and motor components, and cognitive skills relate to higher-level mental activities that orient, formulate, and monitor performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1064804612463214">Gopher, Krupenia, &amp; Gavish, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The development of this TA approach was conducted within the scope of the European Commission’s 6th Framework Integrated Project, SKILLS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.skills-ip.eu">www.skills-ip.eu</ext-link>). This is an interdisciplinary project of 15 partners from nine countries and includes predominantly engineering and design laboratories. The SKILLS project has addressed the development of new methodologies for enactive (learning by doing) skill acquisition and transfer of skills using multimodal interfaces in a VR environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1064804612463214">SKILLS Consortium, 2008</xref>). Six training platforms are being developed in three application domains: medicine (maxillo-facial surgery, upper-limb rehabilitation), industrial work (industrial maintenance and assembly [IMA], programming by demonstration), and sport (rowing, juggling). Common to all is that the training simulators are intended to support sensorimotor and cognitive skills acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1064804612463214">Gopher et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1064804612463214">
<title>IMA Training Simulators</title>
<p>One of six training platforms being developed is a VR training simulator to support IMA skill acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1064804612463214">Casado, Gavish, RodrÌguez, Tecchia, &amp; Webel, 2009</xref>). IMA tasks are performed by skilled technicians in factories and can include repairing broken machines, replacing parts, or performing regular maintenance. Such IMA tasks are challenging because they require knowledge of specific procedures and techniques for each machine.</p>
<p>Although the general components of IMA tasks may be well known by the technician (e.g., substituting an electronic board), the unique instantiation of each component in a given machine and the unique combination between components in a given task make IMA tasks cognitively demanding. Several attempts have been made to develop VR training simulators for IMA tasks (Adams, Klowden, &amp; Hannaford, 1999; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1064804612463214">Li, Knoo, &amp; Tor, 2003</xref>). However, the development of these systems was not supported by a methodological TA process.</p>
<p>During the SKILLS project, two platforms were developed for training IMA tasks, one based on VR technologies and the other on augmented reality (AR). In the VR system, trainees have the ability to interact with the virtual machine and tools in a multimodal way, combining haptic, audio, and visual feedback (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1064804612463214">Figure 1</xref>). In the AR system, trainees interact with the real machine and tools using a tablet PC that acts as an interactive see-through device whereby virtual objects are superimposed on the live camera image (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1064804612463214">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1064804612463214">Gavish, Gutierrez, Webel, Rodriguez, &amp; Techia, 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>In this work, we demonstrate how we have used our TA approach to develop the SKILLS IMA simulators. The approach we present includes a concurrent analysis of the technical (system) and training requirements that focuses on both the real-world IMA task and on the to-be-developed VR system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1064804612463214">
<title>Advantages in the Presented Ta Approach</title>
<p>Consistent with the front-end analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1064804612463214">Wickens et al., 2004</xref>) as well as with a user-centered design approach to complex systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1064804612463214">Norman &amp; Draper, 1986</xref>), we attempted to conduct a TA to identify the design requirements for the to-be-developed system that would maximally support skill acquisition. To select the most appropriate TA method, we first reviewed a range of existing methods but found that none of these traditional methods was sufficient for our requirements.</p>
<p>In general, traditional approaches to TA for the development of technical systems include a set of guidelines and an iterative design process to support product development. These guidelines usually include several primary <italic>phases</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1064804612463214">Kirwan &amp; Ainsworth, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1064804612463214">Wickens et al., 2004</xref>). In Phase 1, potential system users are identified and characterized according to demographics, cognitive and physical abilities, previous experience, and so on. In Phase 2, the environmental features and constraints are described (e.g., noise, lighting, weather). In Phase 3, information about the intended operator tasks is collected. In Phase 4, this information is summarized and, in Phase 5, analyzed. Finally, in Phase 6, a set of system design recommendations is provided.</p>
<p>When attempting to apply this traditional TA approach to the development of VR training simulators, we identified two gaps. First, developers who use traditional approaches considered only the real-world system and did not consider the future VR system. Second, the ultimate goal of a VR training simulator is to support skill acquisition for real-world tasks; hence analysis of the real and virtual systems should involve consideration of both technological requirements and the trainee’s skill acquisition requirements.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>To define the global task, it is useful to consider the general objectives of the real-world system, the main performance criteria, the tasks involved, and the main difficulties and challenges.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Consequently, we identified a need for a new TA approach, one specifically oriented for developing VR training simulators. A TA approach that is based on analyzing the technology and training requirements concurrently was developed and is presented in this article.</p>
<p>The approach has two main advantages compared with the traditional approach. First, the concurrent analysis of the technical and training requirements affords an evaluation of the interaction between these sets of requirements on the overall (predicted) efficacy of the to-be-developed training simulator. Second, with a focus on both the real-world system and the to-be-developed VR training simulator, it becomes possible to define which real-world components to represent in VR and to define the linkages between the real world and virtual systems.</p>
<p>We suggest that the approach presented here can be successfully implemented by the developers of VR training simulators even if those developers have only limited experience with human factors/ergonomics and TA methods. A comparison of the presented approach to traditional approaches of TA for system design follows (see summary on <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1064804612463214">Table 1</xref>), together with a step-by-step guide on how to conduct the approach (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1064804612463214">Krupenia, Gavish, &amp; Gopher, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Presenting the TA Approach for VR Training Simulators</title>
<sec id="section5-1064804612463214">
<title>Step 1: General definition</title>
<p>The first step is to identify the global task environment for which the training simulator is intended and the primary components of the real-world task. Defining the global task provides broad boundaries and a frame of reference for the following stages of analysis.</p>
<p>To define the global task, it is useful to consider the general objectives of the real-world system, the main performance criteria, the tasks involved, and the main difficulties and challenges. Step 1 is similar to the phases of user definition and environment definition employed in traditional TA approaches.</p>
<p>The purpose of Step 1 is twofold: to create boundaries for the VR representation of the real-world system and to acquire an understanding of the tasks to be included within the simulator. Establishing boundaries is important because it is not necessarily true that all aspects of the real world must be virtually represented (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1064804612463214">Krupenia, Hoffman, Zalmanov, &amp; Krupenia, 2011</xref>). The differentiation between components to be, and not to be, represented in the VR is not necessarily considered within traditional TA approaches.</p>
<p>The IMA domain includes many tasks and expertise. For the purposes of SKILLS, it was decided to focus on the task of substituting worn-out parts of the electronic actuator of a motorized modulating valve. The general objective and mission to be achieved by interacting with the real-world system was to successfully perform several specific maintenance tasks in the shortest amount of time and without errors; other possible IMA tasks (e.g., diagnostic, calibration) were excluded from the VR development (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1064804612463214">Casado et al., 2009</xref>). Choosing a specific task enables the development of a more focused simulator.</p>
<p>Although such a simulator addresses only part of the task domain, the development process will require fewer resources compared with developing a more complete simulator with arguably equal (or better) gains, because training will be more focused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1064804612463214">Gavish, Gutierrez, et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1064804612463214">
<title>Step 2: Selecting subtasks</title>
<p>In Step 2, the definition of the general task and environment is used to identify the subtasks for which the VR training simulator will be implemented. Complex tasks typically involve multiple subtasks. The successful completion of some subtasks may be more vital than of other subtasks to the successful completion of the overall task.</p>
<p>The key subtasks should be identified to focus simulator development on the critical skills required to complete the task. The selected subtasks will serve as the basis for the VR training simulator development and should be comprehensive, with significant importance within the task but also with clear boundaries: they should be sufficiently defined to be distinguishable from other subtasks.</p>
<p>A hierarchical TA of the selected IMA task demonstrated that the task consisted of more than 150 steps with complex interconnections. It was decided to focus on the subtask disassembly and assembly of the cover, the clamp, and the electronic board. This subtask is comprehensive and has significant importance within the overall task. Hence, developing a VR simulator that focuses on this subtask was predicted, and found, to be valuable; we observed a decrease in the number of unsolved errors in this subtask compared with training in the traditional methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1064804612463214">Gavish, Gutierrez Seco, etal., 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1064804612463214">
<title>Step 3: Define technological requirements for critical subtask elements</title>
<p>In Step 3, we propose that the critical components of the subtasks should be identified. To identify these critical subtask elements, common analysis methods, such as hierarchical task analysis (or HTA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1064804612463214">Annett &amp; Duncan, 1967</xref>), applied cognitive task analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1064804612463214">Militello &amp; Hutton, 2000</xref>), or others (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1064804612463214">Stanton, Salmon, Walker, Baber, &amp; Jenkins, 2005</xref>) are recommended.</p>
<p>Step 3 is composed of two processes. First, information about the critical subtask elements should be collected, analyzed, and summarized with the use of methods similar to those used in traditional approaches. Second, the technological requirements necessary to sufficiently represent the critical subtask elements in the training simulator should be defined. This last process is similar to the phase of defining system recommendations of the traditional approaches (Phase 6). However, whereas the definition of system recommendations is the endpoint of traditional analysis, it is a midpoint of the presented approach.</p>
<p>Part of the HTA for the selected IMA subtask (disassembly and assembly of the cover, the clamp, and the electronic board) is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1064804612463214">Figure 3</xref>. This figure demonstrates the complexity of the selected subtask; each step is composed of several steps in a hierarchical structure, and all must be completed for successful performance. The critical subtasks’ elements were identified as the representation of the inner parts of the actuator used by the trainee to comprehend task complexity. Thus, within the simulator, there was a need to capture, measure, and represent the inner working parts in high resolution. This requirement was implemented in both VR and AR IMA simulators. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1064804612463214">Figure 4</xref> (page 17) shows the representation of the inner parts of the actuator and the tools within the AR IMA simulator that are intended to help the trainee enhance his or her knowledge of actuator assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1064804612463214">Engelke, Webel, Bockholt, Wuest, &amp; Gavish, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1064804612463214">Webel, Bockholt, Engelke, Gavish, &amp; Tecchia, 2011</xref>).</p>

By examining the relationships between skills and subtask elements, one can associate existing skill acquisition knowledge with the subtask element.</p>

<p>Step 4 is not included in traditional TA approaches but is critical for the presented approach. Here, the skills required for successful subtask completion are identified and linked to existing theories on skill acquisition; thus a matrix can be created that matches the critical subtasks’ elements.</p>
<p>Because of the comprehensive workflows of assembly and maintenance steps commonly required in IMA tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1064804612463214">Casado et al., 2009</xref>), procedural skills are of primary importance (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1064804612463214">Table 2</xref>). Procedures are sequences of ordered activities that must be completed during the task. Every task can be subdivided into a large number of procedures, and training should support competence in performing each of them in the specified order. The skills-subtask matrix provides a means of applying existing learning theories to each real-world subtask. Hence, after procedural skills were identified as important for IMA tasks, the training recommendations were constructed on the basis of existing literature that defined how to support procedural skills acquisition. Because most researchers agree that procedural skills develop via repeated exposure to certain tasks, “training by doing” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1064804612463214">Gupta &amp; Cohen, 2002</xref>) in the VR platform, a haptic 3-D virtual environment that maximally preserved the motor hand movement components of the task was implemented (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1064804612463214">Figure 5</xref>; the VR environment includes 3-D vision and haptic manipulators to enable haptic feedback).</p>

<title>Step 5: Define training requirements</title>
<p>In Step 5, the trainees’ characteristics are identified and the building blocks of a training system proposed. We suggest that the proposed simulator be reexamined from a training perspective to define the requirements needed to achieve the training goals. All prospective users of the training simulator should be identified and their characteristics defined; knowledge of a trainee’s existing skill enables the training system to be designed to support instructional scaffolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1064804612463214">Wood, Bruner, &amp; Ross, 1978</xref>). Using this information, a full training program can be developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1064804612463214">Gopher et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Step 5 is somewhat similar to the identification of potential users in traditional approaches. It is important to note that in traditional approaches, the focus is on understanding users of the real-world system, whereas in Step 5, the focus is on users of the training simulator. Another difference between the presented and traditional approaches is that in Step 5, guidelines for the training systems are created; this is unique to the presented approach because of the specific needs of a VR training simulator.</p>
<p>For the IMA training simulator, two groups of trainees were identified: novice and intermediate experienced technicians. Novices were defined as technicians with some expertise in maintenance and assembly tasks but without experience on the specific machine of interest. Intermediate experts were defined as technicians with some experience in assembly and maintenance tasks using this specific machine but without knowledge of the specific subtask of disassembling and assembling the cover, clamp, and electronic board. We identified the characteristics and competencies of each group by interviewing trainers, reviewing training materials, and observing technicians from each group perform the task, followed by one-on-one interviews (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1064804612463214">Casado et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Several training requirements that support procedural skills acquisition in this complex psychomotor task were implemented within the IMA simulator. One requirement was to use special visual aids, such as “device display,” to enhance trainees’ mental model of the task (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1064804612463214">Figure 6</xref>; the entire actuator with its inner parts disassembled is presented in the upper-right side of the screen; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1064804612463214">Engelke, Webel, &amp; Gavish, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Step 6: Integrate technology and training requirements</title>
<p>In this final stage, we propose that the results of the technology requirements should be compared with the results of the training development analysis (Step 5) to identify the implications of different design options. It is likely that the results of the training analysis will have implications for the technology requirements that were not identified during the technology analysis. At this point, it is valuable to evaluate the overall priorities of development efforts to consider the cost-effectiveness of various training and technical solutions.</p>
<p>This step, in which technological and training requirements are considered side by side and combined into an integrated set of design recommendations, is similar to the <italic>define design recommendation</italic> phase of traditional approaches. However, it is more complex, because both technological and training aspects of the VR training simulator should be considered. Within the IMA simulator, an integrated set of design recommendations was created and implemented in the training platforms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1064804612463214">Gavish, Gutierrez, et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Here we argued that TA for the design of VR training simulators should be different from traditional approaches to TA for system design. We then presented and recommended a new TA approach for the development of VR training simulators.</p>
<p>Two main advantages of the presented approach are missing from traditional analyses. First, focusing on both the real-world system and the planned VR system supported the process of identifying the real-world system components to represent in VR and how. Second, the concurrent analysis of technical and training requirements forces an interaction between these two potentially different sets of requirements to define a single training system.</p>
<p>However, there are two potential risks in the presented approach. First, this approach is more complex than traditional approaches, and additional work is required to make the method accessible to system designers. Second, focusing on three domains concurrently (real system, VR system, skill acquisition) introduces the danger that some issues will be analyzed more superficially than would be the case if using traditional approaches.</p>
<p>During the SKILLS integrated project, we encountered these imitations and have learned that providing developers with a well-defined, step-by-step approach can be beneficial. The work reported here can serve as part of the effort to develop a more streamlined procedural approach and to avoid the two potential risks identified.</p>
