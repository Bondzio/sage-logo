<abstract>
<p>Transforming managerial competencies and mindsets is one of the most significant challenges facing contemporary Indian and Malaysian economies. This article provides empirical evidence demonstrating how managers in India and Malaysia are navigating the challenge of acquiring talented personnel to better facilitate central business activities in contemporary economic and cultural contexts. A salient theme of the article is that Indian and Malaysian managers are pursuing notions of human capital accumulation within a premise that the better deployment of resources is linked to an improvement in management systems and practices. The article posits that companies in the South East Asian landscapes are focusing on designing better selection and recruitment strategies to engage in continuous and innovative reform to cope with the demanding pressures of globalization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The rise of India as a significant economic force in the recent decades has drawn wide scholarly attention. The ‘opening up’ of the contemporary economy after a long period of strong control and the entry of global capital, technology as well as human resource ideas have fundamentally transformed the managerial mindsets in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0972262912483525">Chatterjee and Pearson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0972262912483525">Elegbe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0972262912483525">Evans et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0972262912483525">Pearson and Chatterjee, 2001</xref>). Today, Indian companies are being recognized for their ability to generate a new breed of managers, who are able to combine the global imperatives with their rich cultural traditions and dynamic entrepreneurial ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0972262912483525">Khandelkar and Sharma, 2005</xref>) and some of these innovations in management thinking amongst Indian managers may be of relevance to neighbouring countries like Malaysia. Indeed, global forces are compelling Malaysian managers to reframe their mindsets as critical thinkers and social agents, especially in human resource (HR) practices in skill acquisition and workforce needs, when transforming their institutional architectures to gain greater leverage in the commercial contexts with foreign and internal competitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0972262912483525">Chatterjee and Nankervis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0972262912483525">Ismail and Abidin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0972262912483525">Pearson and Entrekin, 2001</xref>). Collectively, the Asian way of holistic engagement of employees has been a hallmark of the emerging economies over the past decades in spite of prominent variations observed in the economic journey of Japan, China and Korea, as suggested in a recent comment.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Previous economic miracles in east Asia—Japan in the 1960s and South Korea in the 1980s—were built in past on corporate loyalty. Workers from top to bottom stayed put, and companies tried for decades to more or less guarantee a job for life. In China it could not be more different. Except in the most hidebound state owned enterprises, corporate loyalty barely exists. A job-hopping melee—for the best and the brightest—does. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0972262912483525">Powell, 2012</xref>, p. 12)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As this new mental–model develops amongst the managers in leading Asian economies, the so-called talent war spreads. A quest for managerial talents has been exacerbated by the phenomenon of job hopping in South East Asian countries, which has led to serious staff shortages as contemporary employees demand greater flexibility, more meaningful jobs, heightened professional freedoms and a better work–life balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0972262912483525">Guthridge et al., 2008</xref>). These pressures have onset a dramatic change in the composition of managerial cadres, which in turn is permeating the global mindset of Indian managers who have termed these new work related circumstances as the ‘India way’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0972262912483525">Cappelli, et al., 2010</xref>). Earlier, Chew (2005) identified a growing concern of the Malaysian labour market as companies operating in that country were experiencing high job mobility across the workforce compelling these corporations to implement a variety of strategies to acquire, motivate and retain talented cadres. Despite these endeavours, Wan (2008) contended that a shortage of skilled staff was still being experienced by Asian firms and particularly Malaysian multinational corporations and the challenge still persists. An increasing mobility in the managerial labour force is compelling Indian and Malaysian organizations to proactively address issues of employer loyalty and commitment with lucrative remuneration and benefit plans designed to attract and sustain a transient labour pool. The reorientation of HR policies and practices to keep pace with intense global engagement has become a particular challenge for developing economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0972262912483525">Festing and Eidens, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0972262912483525">Osman et al., 2011</xref>) and thus, the search for new policies and practices of talent acquisition, retention and development is fast becoming a central concern at the corporate level in a number of countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0972262912483525">Murphy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0972262912483525">Sharma and Bhatnagar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0972262912483525">Tahir and Abu Baker, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The acquisition and retention of managerial talents in Indian and Malaysian corporations is magnified by managers who are still stuck in the past. The point is made by Dhanaraj and Khanna (2011), who argued: ‘However, we find this insight has barely been applied to building a generation that must manage in the new global economy with its significant “power shift” towards emerging markets’ (p. 684). As the global economy and particularly the South East Asian globalized business environment, continues to dramatically expand, business leaders and human resource management practitioners will be continuously worried about the intensified international competition for managerial talent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0972262912483525">Beechler and Woodward, 2009</xref>). The position was clearly stated in the special address by Tan Sri Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Chairman and Governor of Bank Negara Malaysia of the crises affecting countries in terms of changes occurring in the human capital development in the new financial global landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0972262912483525">Asian Link, 2011</xref>). The worrying factor of talent shortage in Indian institutions has also become a prominent topic inciting Indian academics and practitioners to boldly argue that managers around the world can learn from newly emerging management models and this article adds to that announcement with findings of a comparative study of Indian and Malaysian managers. Acknowledging embracing global opportunities to bring about economic transformations compels reorientation of managerial mindsets is a notion likely to be of considerable interest to managerial executives and HRM practitioners of Indian and Malaysian corporations.</p>
<p>The transformation of global mindset essentially underpins a transition from a problem-solving paradigm to an opportunistic experiential framework. Ascendancy of economic liberation of India and Malaysia to reposition their economies in the international arena onsets requirement for a local context centred organizational architecture to be remodelled to incorporate very different sets of knowledge. This study is an opportunity to investigate the osmosis of Indian and Malaysian managerial mindset reorientation as both have a similar heritage of the British colonial mindset, but with different religious, languages, ethnicities and governance regimes, while both nations are pursuing global ambitions. Hence, the study allows a scholarly scrutiny of shifting models of perspectives held by managers in India and Malaysia as they pursue the search for managerial talents to encapsulate fundamental business transformations in an increasing globalized competitive environment.</p>

<title>Global Competency Development in Asia</title>
<p>Although globalization signals the advent of a ‘no-border’ managerial mindset, the specific and fundamental cultural foundations moderate the key aspects of managerial perspectives. Contentions have been made that contemporary globalization may create more convergence in terms of structures, technological and managerial processes as the competencies and values of managers remain substantially embedded in the cultural context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0972262912483525">Adler and Gundersen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0972262912483525">Dorfman et al., 1997</xref>). In support of this perspective, the emergence of India as a global economic force has drawn widespread interest and in particular, the global reach of many Indian companies has challenged the competency and global mindset of Indian managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0972262912483525">Nankervis and Chatterjee, 2011</xref>). Today more than 100 companies in India have market capitalization of over one billion dollars, while around 150 companies from the world’s top 500 companies on the Fortune Magazine list have research and development hubs in India signalling the values placed on the quality of managers in India, but this managerial quality is not uniformly shared. In research designed to examine the relationship between the strategic orientation of the managers and their ability to undertake learning capability, it was suggested that HR managers displayed more strategic awareness than other line managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0972262912483525">Bhatnagar and Sharma, 2005</xref>). Interestingly, such strategic orientation of the human resource management (HRM) managers can also be found in cultures like Malaysia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0972262912483525">Yusoff et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Until 1997 South East Asia was at the centre of global attention as the most dynamic model of economic success. Malaysia was a significant force in the rise of the South East Asian success, but the economic meltdown that followed raised fundamental questions about the Malaysian model. As Malaysia re-emerges from the decade of crisis and re-enters the global arena with renewed vigour, the managerial competencies and mindsets have become critical. Nevertheless, researchers have consistently argued that in spite of their global interface, Malaysian managers are still governed by their traditional cultural and religious values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0972262912483525">Kennedy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0972262912483525">Lo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0972262912483525">Subramaniam et al., 2010</xref>). Tempering this perspective is the evidence of a recent comparative study of Japanese, Chinese and Malaysian managers suggesting that Malaysian managers tend to become more active learners as they advance in the organizational hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0972262912483525">Yamazaki and Kayes, 2010</xref>) and display behaviours to demonstrate they are keen to bridge the gap between their strategic ambitions and held general competencies. This position was recently highlighted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0972262912483525">Rees and Johari, 2010</xref>, p. 529).</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… the majority of respondents expressed the view that the HRM function was too concerned with operational matters such as recruitment and selection. As such, the findings revealed more of the potential inconsistency between trying to be strategic and being perceived by senior managers as actively operational efficiency.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Balancing of ongoing performance concerns with long-term global ambitions, is the key challenge facing major Asian organizations. The imperatives of survival in the near term by ensuring operational efficiency cannot be allowed to distract managers from positioning for fast changing global opportunity. Exploiting traditional advantages and harnessing of current capabilities needs to be complemented by investment in new explorations in the global arena. Interestingly, Indian and Malaysian organizations are responding very differently to this search outside their current operational focus. Lessons from theory and practice suggest that the promotion of global competency will oblige major shifts in managerial attention to alternative futures and organizational capability development. Recently, eminent HRM experts commented leading global companies from India are being compelled to accept recruitment of staff with relevant expertise and knowledge is crucial to achieve competitive advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0972262912483525">Cappelli et al., 2010</xref>). A number of prominent social scientists have suggested the increased levels of international competition are obliging Malaysian managers to employ similar paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0972262912483525">Tan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0972262912483525">Tan and Nasurdin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0972262912483525">Wan, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>The Importance of Selection and Recruitment: Key Issues</title>
<p>The importance of selection and recruitment as major HRM practices has intensified the need for sourcing talent in increasingly globalizing organizations. The traditional Asian methods of selection and recruitment often relied on face to face contexts with paper systems, but today many Asian organizations have moved away from the traditional arrangements to embrace technology assisted systems. Claims have been made that the selection and recruitment practices have become dominant in corporate operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0972262912483525">Hsiao, 2009</xref>) as they have the potential to facilitate the identification of the better and more appropriate human input for an organization’s international operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0972262912483525">Lawler, 2002</xref>). As Wu (2008) argued, ‘An appropriate selection mechanism strategically supports business activities by developing a group of managerial staff and setting a high company recruitment standard, which consequently gain a good reputation’ (p. 173). Given Indian and Malaysian MNCs are in highly competitive business environments and would have a strong interest in acquiring talented employees, it is reasonable to assume that selection and recruitment practices will play a significant role in the development of global business systems within their organizations.</p>
<p>Emerging global influences require organizations to comprehensively examine their value chain, which incorporates the three main generic components/activities of (<italic>a</italic>) innovative activities, (<italic>b</italic>) productive activities and (<italic>c</italic>) stakeholder relationship activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0972262912483525">Lasserre, 2007</xref>). Innovative activities of firms can take many forms and as a business strategy innovation has the potential to improve organizational flexibility, competitive position as well as performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0972262912483525">Nooteboom, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0972262912483525">Tanner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0972262912483525">Utterback, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0972262912483525">Van de Ven, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0972262912483525">Wolfe, 1994</xref>). Institutional advantage is accrued from ‘A productive activity is viewed as a chain of many parts ranging from design to use by the final stakeholder’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0972262912483525">Bradley and O’Reágáin, 2001</xref>, p. 23). According to Lasserre (2007), productive activities include procurement, manufacturing, back office, operations and logistics and these activities as parts of the value chain can have a significant impact on the competitiveness of a company. Furthermore, understanding and managing stakeholder relationships has become an important activity within organizations. Indeed, more firms have realized stakeholder relationship activities contribute to different economic value to the companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0972262912483525">Anvari and Amin, 2010</xref>). To undertake stakeholder relationship activities employees play a significant role, because stakeholder relationships are more likely to be formed with individuals, who represent the organizations rather than the produced goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0972262912483525">Berry, 1995</xref>). Along a value chain, these activities are employed by an organization in order to design, produce and deliver the value added products or services to the external stakeholders and often organizations deploy resources, assets as well as competencies to facilitate these activities.</p>
<sec id="section4">
<title>Hypotheses Generation</title>
<p>A number of studies have indicated that HRM is an important factor in building successful organizational innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0972262912483525">Galbraith, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0972262912483525">Jiménez-Jiménez and Sanz-Valle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0972262912483525">Vrakking, 1990</xref>). In fact, Vrakking (1990) stated that successful innovation is driven by competent HRM functions. There is a general consensus that an innovation strategy could be achieved when HRM practices such as external sources of recruitment were utilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0972262912483525">Gómez-Mejía et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0972262912483525">Miles and Snow, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0972262912483525">Olian and Rynes, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0972262912483525">Schuler and Jackson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0972262912483525">Sonnenfeld and Peiperl, 1988</xref>). Furthermore, based on 106 Spanish industrial firms, Perdomo-Ortiz et al. (2009) observed innovation is positively associated with HRM. More recently, Tan and Nasurdin (2010) studied firms that were located in six states of Peninsular Malaysia and found HRM practices contribute significantly to innovation. More specifically, the selection of managers or employees based on their polyvalent skills is likely to have a positive contribution towards innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0972262912483525">Gupta and Singhal, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0972262912483525">Jiménez-Jiménez and Sanz-Valle, 2008</xref>). Based on these arguments it is reasonable to assume that selection and recruitment practices are likely to have a positive impact on an organization’s innovative activities.</p>
<p>Recently, considerable interest has been shown for the managerial practices of international corporations operating in the ever developing industrial and economic landscapes of India and Malaysia. The rapid business sector growth has focused attention on the generalization of management operations and specifically the selection and recruitment processes for acquiring new talent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0972262912483525">Wharton, 2009</xref>). Available to those responsible for administering systematic and rationalized employment systems are an array of Western practices, but there is less evidence how selection and recruitment is undertaken in Indian and Malaysian firms and their relativity with valued institutional achievements. Arguably, different skillsets are required for unique managerial challenges. Consequently, there is considerable impetus for understanding the HRM systems of the successful international firms, and in particular the personnel function of selection/recruitment processes and practices that are likely to lend to superior administrative practices and institutional aspects, such as organizational innovation.</p>
<p>Despite the extensive rapid liberalization of the Indian and Malaysian economies heritage is still likely to be engrained in the selection and recruitment practices. Although the leading corporations in these two countries have opportunity to adopt and adapt sophisticated Western culture techniques for recruiting new managerial talent, there is always potential for flavouring the process with family connections, or links to patronage, nepotism or cronyism. Recruiters employing contemporary probing process, designed to identify innovative personality traits, are more likely to recruit personnel with the designed skillsets for developing the unique fundamental organizational valued structures and processes. Based on the preceding literature and current trends, it is expected Indian and Malaysian corporations will exhibit the following predicted relationships between the selection method and innovative activities.</p>

<p><italic>H2. Contemporary selection processes are likely to be significantly associated with innovative activities.</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Recruitment can be undertaken through a prognostic process of professional affiliation. In addition to university qualification, registration with corporate professional institutions (e.g., architectural, business, engineering, medical) requires a member to demonstrate the attainment of achievements independently recognized by a fraternity of auditors. Employers can make comparisons between applications in the recruitment process by the extent of their career experience. Based on this knowledge, H3 is presented for examination.</p>

<p><italic>H3. Professional recruitment practices are likely to be correlated with innovative activities.</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Acquisition of managerial talent through external agencies is a recognized HRM strategy of outsourcing. External agencies can be a preferred recruiter because of their expertise in professionally conducting the process, their extensive knowledge of potential personnel, often they hold a fuller understanding of the country labour law and these recruiting agencies use formal process that when applied minimizes the adverse influence of social context and personalized relationships. The usual practice is for the recruiting company to supply a short list of recruitees to the employing corporation. When considering this information, H4 is predicted</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>H4. External recruitment practices will be substantially associated with innovative activities.</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The productive activities within firms can be treated as a part of an organization’s global business system development. Hughes and Rog (2008) concluded effective HRM is an essential aspect that influences an organization’s success of acquiring talents in their development of a global business system. Furthermore, Koch and McGrath (1996) stated organizations, that systematically evaluate their policies of selection and recruitment, are likely to benefit with improved productivity, competitiveness of operations and strengthened valued outcomes. In addition, logistics often play a significant role in an organization’s productive activities. The inadequate assessments devoted to the selection and recruitment are likely to have a negative impact on the productive activities and in turn affect the global business system development of an organization. Accordingly, it is reasonable to assume that selection and recruitment activities are likely to affect productive activities of the organization.</p>
<p>In spite of the importance shown for the connection between HRM practices and institutional performance empirical assessments of these links are sparse. Some attention has been given to the power of reward systems to elicit behaviours that will accrue the development of productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0972262912483525">Connell and Congiu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0972262912483525">Longnecker and Shanklin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0972262912483525">Ludlow and Farrell, 2010</xref>). More fundamental has been recognition of the need to choose the ‘right’ corporate personnel before engaging them with evolutionary development. In fact, the importance of selection and appraisal of potential recruits has resonated with a number of social scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0972262912483525">Ali et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0972262912483525">Devanna and Tichy, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0972262912483525">Hassan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0972262912483525">Marvin, 2007</xref>). Grounded in their theoretical conceptions is the resource based perspectives a workforce with particular attributes is a strategic asset. Consequently, the primary purpose of the HRM function is to recruit personnel who can be subsequently developed to enhance the competitive position of the corporation. Evidence supporting this notion was provided by Koch and McGrath (1996). In their study with 319 businesses it was found firms that employed more contemporary and sophisticated screening processes in the recruitment practices enjoyed better organizational performance. Clearly, investment in modern HRM hiring practices was positively associated with labour productivity. When coupled with the two divisions of selection process and the two categories of recruitment practices speculation is given for hypotheses five to eight, inclusive.</p>

<p>Selection and recruitment play an important role in corporate operations and often these HRM practices can have potential impacts on stakeholder relationship activities. An effective selection system may assist an organization in selecting and allocating competent and qualified workforce to do the required tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0972262912483525">Chen and Huang, 2009</xref>). More specifically, selection practices may enable organizations to choose individuals with appropriate skills and attitudes and in turn, these individuals could potentially integrate knowledge from diverse sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0972262912483525">Martinsons, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0972262912483525">Scarbrough, 2003</xref>). Subsequently, selecting the right incumbents for a particular job enables organizations to effectively undertake stakeholder relationship connections, which are important activities in marketing and sales. In addition, recruitment has been determined as an organizational function with potential to entice job applicants with desirable attitudes and decision behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0972262912483525">Barber, 1998</xref>) and, therefore, effective recruitment practices are vital for attracting and hiring talents. Often, talents are internal stakeholders, who have strategic implications in delivering value added products or services to external stakeholders. Ultimately, stakeholder relationship activities are built on the selection and recruitment of competent talents.</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of customer relationships (internal and external) has accentuated the value of human resources. Several researchers have promoted arguments relevant to human resources are rare, inimitable and non substitutable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0972262912483525">Conner and Prahalad, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0972262912483525">Hajro and Pudelko, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0972262912483525">Peteraf, 1993</xref>), which Storbacka and Nenonen (2009) claim in particular configurations are of strategic relevance to provide the organization with sustainable competitive advantage. Thus, while business strategy can play a central role in social and economic exchange relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0972262912483525">Cheng and Lee, 2011</xref>) and indeed, the created relationships are valuable firm resources, their effectiveness is primarily centred in the people component. Creating capabilities to influence those customer relationships that realize firm performance is reliant on the actors, who are the human resources. Thus, the focus is how the company searches and obtains those skills likely to manifest the desirable stakeholder relationship activities. Those selection and recruitment procedures that better analyze applicant competencies to develop appropriate talent behaviours have potential to facilitate the customer relationship activities. Recently, Staniewski (2011) summarized some of the prominent selection/recruitment research for the past decade only to suggest confirmation of the value of external recruitment sources is equivocal. However, based on conventional wisdom embedded in the selection/recruitment mechanisms available to Indian and Malaysian HRM partitions hypotheses nine to 12 are predicted.</p>

<title>Research Model</title>
<p>The study of conceptual framework, which is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0972262912483525">Figure 1</xref>, was derived from a comprehensive review, interpretation and integration of the relevant literature. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0972262912483525">Figure 1</xref> contains both independent variables (i.e., HRM practices) and dependent variables (i.e., global business system). It is forecasted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0972262912483525">Figure 1</xref> that the HRM practices of selection and recruitment are likely to have an impact on the global business system development of MNCs from Malaysia and India. More specifically, a feature of the conceptual framework is the presentation of the study hypotheses. Specifically, it is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0972262912483525">Figure 1</xref> that the dark arrow headed line encapsulates 12 hypotheses between HRM practices and global business system development.

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section7-0972262912483525">
<title>Respondents and Site</title>
<p>The respondents were 120 executives of international corporations. There were 69 senior managers enrolled in Asia e-University in Malaysia and 51 Indian study participants, who were enrolled in the executive diploma in post graduate management at the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta. Key objectives of the programmes were reshaping managerial perceptions of work value, the ethos of corporate social responsibility and ethical orientations within business practices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0972262912483525" sec-type="methods">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The questionnaires were administered in India by a senior academic of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Calcutta, who has a strong scholarly link with the Australian university, where this research was conducted. The Malaysian questionnaires were personally administered by the first author before he taught a module for the Asia e-University. Prior to administering the questionnaire all participants were briefed to explain how their responses were related to the programme content, while ensuring participation was voluntary and that respondent anonymity was ensured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0972262912483525">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The questionnaire was designed to capture two types of data (<italic>a</italic>) demographics and (<italic>b</italic>) perceptual. Demographic data were in two main categories (<italic>a</italic>) personal (i.e., gender, age, education) and (<italic>b</italic>) affiliation (i.e., company size and type, length of career, time in current position). The perceptual component of the questionnaire mainly employed seven point Likert scales to assess responses to topics of social values, company human resource practices and global strategic ambitions as well as states of progress. There were three open questions that invited comments in terms of managerial perspectives about the global marketplace. The questionnaire is extensive in scope. Hence, only the demographic responses and responses to the human resource practices of selection and recruitment as well as the global strategy activities of (<italic>a</italic>) Innovation, (<italic>b</italic>) Production and (<italic>c</italic>) Stakeholder relationships, are presented in this article.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0972262912483525">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>Information for traditional personnel attributes were evaluated with data obtained with four questions. Greater delineation was sought from the respondents about their corporate affiliation. The categories reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0972262912483525">Table 1</xref> reveal the nature of the sought information.</p>
<sec id="section11-0972262912483525">
<title>Perceptual</title>
<p>Data for five constructs were obtained with seven point Likert scales with responses that ranged from strongly agree (7) to strongly disagree (1).</p>
<p><bold><italic>Selection</italic></bold> was assessed with four items. The initial eight item scale was adapted from an extensive literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0972262912483525">Hsu and Leat, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0972262912483525">Kersley et al., 2005</xref>) that reveals despite a plethora of selection techniques being employed by contemporary organizations they can be coalesced into two categories (<italic>a</italic>) Traditional and (<italic>b</italic>) Contemporary. When the responses of the eight items were factor analyzed two factors were displayed, which were (i) Traditional (reference and medical examination) and (ii) Contemporary (psychometric tests, interview). As four items had substantial leakage across the two factors they were deleted to provide a four item scale. The reliability coefficient for Traditional was 0.67 and the reliability assessed for Contemporary was 0.50, indicating a variety of different techniques were employed. Although these reliabilities values may be considered as relatively low they are deemed acceptable for exploratory empirical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0972262912483525">Guildford, 1965</xref>).</p>
<p><bold><italic>Recruitment</italic></bold> was assessed with a nine item scale. A large body of literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0972262912483525">Han and Han, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0972262912483525">Jauhari, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0972262912483525">Pattnaik and Elango, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0972262912483525">Zhu and Dowling, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0972262912483525">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>) demonstrates corporations employ a range of recruitment practices. By adapting/employing the items that have been previously used to test the importance of these practices a scale was constructed for evaluating nine of the more commonly employed practices. A factor analysis of the study responses realized two sets of factors with item correlations greater than 0.50. There were two identified factors of Professional (i.e., not traditional recruitment channels) and External (e.g., recruitment agency, networking and job centre). The reliability assessment of Professional was 0.78 and the reliability value for External was 0.73.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Innovative Activities</italic></bold> was evaluated with three items that were developed from the work of Lasserre (2007). This construct had a coefficient alpha of 0.77.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Productive Activities</italic></bold> was assessed with a three item scale. This instrument was developed from a stack of conceptual literature that has been developing for over two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0972262912483525">Bradley and O’Reágáin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0972262912483525">Stock et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0972262912483525">Thomas and Griffin, 1996</xref>). This variable had a reliability assessment of 0.88.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Stakeholder Relationship Activities</italic></bold> was assessed with a five item scale. This instrument was generated from the relevant literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0972262912483525">Berry, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0972262912483525">Kandampully, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0972262912483525">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>).

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0972262912483525">Table 1</xref>, which summarizes the demographic characteristics of the study respondents, has several key features. Notably, a high proportion of the sample is males, the majority of the respondent’s age in the age group of 30 to 50 years, most held a university degree and over half of them have been in their current position for less than six years. These values provide a unique profile of contemporary global managers, which is quite different to the managerial attributes of the early 1990s. The content of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0972262912483525">Table 1</xref> also reveals the executives were from both large and small organizations, but with a common focus on international engagement and global market orientation. These findings reflect the shift in both organizational personal architectures as well as a greater participation in global trade, associated with large flows of outward foreign direct investment and the surge in cross border mergers and acquisition activities.</p>

<p>The correlations of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0972262912483525">Table 2</xref> provide reasonable support for the forecasted relationships. In linear order support is given to H1 (r = 0.163, p &gt; 0.05), H2 (r = 0.216, p &lt; 0.05), H3 (r = 0.196, p &lt; 0.05), H4 (r = 0.202, p &lt; 0.05), H8 (r = 0.196, p &lt; 0.05), H9 (r = 0.179, p &gt; 0.05), H10 (r = 0.196, p &lt; 0.05) and H12 (r = 0.216, p &lt; 0.05). However, these findings need to be accepted with caution as there could be type 1 or type 2 errors (i.e., a reported significant result when the test is non-significant, or a non-significant finding when the relationship is significant). Moreover, the correlation results can be affected by multi-collinarity. Therefore, the correlation results have potential only to be indicative and more powerful analyses were undertaken with the regression technique.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0972262912483525">Table 3</xref> presents the results of the regression assessments for the HRM practices of selection and recruitment, with the dependent construct of the global business activities of innovation, production and stakeholder relationship. Although external recruitment was a significant predictor of all examined global influences and the variable of traditional selection was substantially linked to production, most of the connections are nonsignificant. Three of these linkages were predicted (i.e., H2, H6 and H10). Consequently, the more discerning regression analysis provided overall support for H2, H4, H6, H8, H10 and H12. Nevertheless, what the results also infer is there is foundation for an intervening variable between the independent and the dependent variables of the research model presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0972262912483525">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>A key to understanding these results is presented as the low adjusted R<sup>2</sup> values, which imply the models are incomplete. This observation, which was exposed in the correlations, conclusively reveals the importance of supporting and developing organizational climates that contribute to the creation of functional strategies to enable the fulfilment of corporate global ambitions. Manifestation of supporting and developing institutional climates is a major challenge facing contemporary organizations, which encourages senior executive to invest company resources in managerial development programmes. For instance, the empirical evidence in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0972262912483525">Table 3</xref> demonstrates the study respondents acknowledged selection and recruitment were non-significantly connected to HRM practices that facilitate engagement with a plethora of stakeholders at local, national and global levels.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This exploratory research signals that despite the global recognition of a new wave of management called, ‘India way’, sufficient attention to the talent pipeline has not been given. This is a perplexing loss as many Asian counties ‘look up’ to the innovative policies and practices that Indian managers are demonstrating in the global arena. This research, though exploratory, builds upon a conceptual frame that links recruitment and selection practices to global success. As pointed out in earlier sections, data on India was gathered through senior managers enrolled in IIM, Calcutta Post Graduate Diploma Programmes and data on Malaysia was obtained in the Asia e-University Kuala Lumpur Executive MBA Programme. The aim of the study was to emphasize a deeper contextualization of ground level challenges in global transformation in Asia. The uniqueness of the respondents as being middle level managers, who are undertaking post graduate executive courses, provide a compelling empirical pattern in spite of the small sample size. It is expected other social scientists will be encouraged to evaluate more complex designs with similar constructs to embrace different managerial arrangements.</p>
<p>A notable aspect of the reported research is the managers have not been separated along the traditional dimension of the size and nature of the companies. Nevertheless, it is likely that substantial variations in attitudes, mindsets and practices across different organizations and industries will be experienced in the study sites. Indeed, managers working for top companies are likely to display a more fully developed global orientation while others may be typically less globally oriented. For example, excellent human resource practices are noted in industries such as information technology, but India also has a large trail of very badly managed firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0972262912483525">Bloom et al., 2012</xref>). These achievements have been influenced by variables such as level of education of managers, organizational types in terms of government and private sector placement as well as the labour market culture of monetary and non-monetary incentives. This array of elements is likely to determine choices about the basis of competitive advantage and management style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0972262912483525">Marchington and Parker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0972262912483525">Sett, 2004</xref>). More recently, the demographic dimension of gender was found to be a predictor of the shaping of human resource culture specifically in developing economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0972262912483525">Sackey and Sanda, 2011</xref>). It is recognized that in the changing business landscape of India and Malaysia, these types of constructs are likely to have an impact on the transformation of the HRM philosophies. However, rather than employing these variables as mediating or predictor effects, assessments were undertaken with primary data to evaluate managerial perceptions of linkages between determinants and institutional outcomes.</p>
<p>The future success of many organizations relies primarily on the ability to attract, retain and develop a diverse body of talent that can contribute to innovative ideas and creative commitment. As has been pointed out,
<disp-quote>
<p>The practices that constitute the India way clearly reflect the country’s culture and history, yet the India way is not a simple application of that culture. Indian business leaders learned a great deal from Anglo-American practices, but they assimilated those lessons in a unique way. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0972262912483525">Cappelli et al., 2010</xref>, p. 283)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the same vein, the Malaysian journey will be rooted in the history and rich culture of national heritage facilitating breath taking transformations attracting scholarly attention.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It is important to remember that Malaysia had adapted a pragmatic global perspective long before the reform movement in India. The ‘look east’ policy spearheaded by Malaysia’s former Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir aimed to learn from Japan and Korea a decade before India adapted similar policies. On the one hand, the Asian financial crisis of 1997–1998 set ‘the clock’ back considerably while the requirement of active legislative preference to the locals (Bumiputra) in recruitment had a negative effect on bolstering the human capital strength. On the other hand, India had benefited from a later entry to the international arena as well as the attribute of global leadership established from a foundation of knowledge based service industries strengthened by a well known demographic dividend, which has given a special advantage.</p>
<p>This article provides empirical evidence in regard to the shift in managerial mindscape in the global arena. A central argument of the article is the global trajectory of India has a special relevance to other Asian countries and especially to Malaysia. The institutional similarities of India and Malaysia were created through a shared British administrative heritage, which provides a common foundation for the new required paradigm, and when this feature is coupled with the significant population base of Indian ethnicity an interesting managerial context for the present research emerged. A further common influence was the Asian Financial meltdown leading to a disruption in the human resource mobilization and this threat highlighted the need for organizations to be proactive in endeavours to formulate effective policies and improving HRM interventions in the progression to become strategically aligned with national and organizational goals. An important message being learned by Indian and Malaysian institutional stakeholders is traditional mechanistic mindsets are more suited to stable and predictable environment, but the complex and dynamic global business environment calls for different strategic mindsets.</p>
