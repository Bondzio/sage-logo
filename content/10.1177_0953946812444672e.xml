<p>In <italic>The Link between Animal Abuse and Human Violence</italic>, the animal theologian Andrew Linzey brings together a wide range of contributors each of whom seeks to examine the possible links between abuse against animals, and harm towards humans. Through eight parts, comprising 27 chapters (plus introduction), with 37 contributing authors, the book covers a wide range of related topics addressing the link between animal abuse and human violence. Through these eight parts, the reader is engaged with a ‘holistic perspective’, including a wide range of topics, such as overviews of existing research, the relation between animal abuse and serial murder, the abuse of children, women and the elderly, etc., as well as various methods of studying this, including related psychological studies, ethical questions related to human/animal relations, and legal policies and punishments.</p>
<p>Part 1 provides an overview of relevant existing research. These three chapters discuss methods and instruments for measuring and understanding animal cruelty (such as using human aggression studies to understand human aggression towards animals), and the various types of cruelty towards humans and animals (such as childhood cruelty towards animals, domestic violence, and child and elderly abuse). They note both that the connection between animal abuse and psychological pathologies has rarely been studied, and in those cases in which it was, often the studies were methodologically poor. The authors also make clear that there is growing proof showing a relation between violence against animals and domestic violence towards humans. These chapters were largely psychological in nature, with various animal cruelty checklists, and explanatory theories as to the cause and nature of cruelty to animals discussed.</p>
<p>The next three parts each examine the abuse and harm directed towards fellow humans, and the links between such actions and animal abuse. Part 2 has a psychological focus, examining the links between attachment to companion animals, and the development of empathy, as well as examining the link between emotional abuse in children and animals. Part 3 looks at the relationship between animal abuse, child abuse and family violence. Here, various studies are described linking abuse towards family members and abuse towards animals and it is emphasized that welfare workers need to understand the associations of violence and incorporate such understandings in policy assessments. Finally, Part 4 examines the links between animal abuse and later serial murder. Here, it is suggested that there is a strong link between childhood violence to animals, and subsequent human violence. In seeking to improve accuracy in such claims, there is a chapter describing more accurate means of assessment, seeking to reduce false positives by looking for such measures as inflicting pain for pleasure, and choosing socially valued creatures (such as cats and dogs), rather than less valued ones (such as reptiles).</p>
<p>Part 5 is a collection of five papers on the ethical perspectives of the relation between human and animal. These chapters address a range of ethical issues, ranging from whether, given the decline in the view of human uniqueness, human rights are inherently speciesist, to descriptions of the nature and structure of evil. Beyond such specific topics, however, is a general push to present a case for animals as worthy of care and protection, be it for understanding animals legally as subjects, or noting the similarity of human and animal suffering. These chapters seem to push the boundary slightly as to the justifications for human priority, and then follow this up by describing possible results. For example Conor Gearty in chapter 12 describes the historical case made for human rights based on human uniqueness, and notes that the decline in the view of human uniqueness opens up opportunity for non-species-specific rights. Likewise Elizabeth Clawson in chapter 14 not only calls for the need to view non-human animals as inherently valuable, but also discusses the political and legal consequences of doing so, e.g. legally viewing animals as victims of crimes.</p>
<p>The next two parts of the book address the role which humans have in dealing with both those who are perpetrators of violence, and those who assist with the victims. Part 6 addresses law enforcement and legislation and the relevant aspects of human/animal abuse, such as FBI use of animal abuse as an warning indicator of further dangerousness, legislative suggestions for recognising and treating abusive relationships, and highlighting the high number of illegal activities based around animal abuse that still occur. Part 7 addresses the place for those who regularly encounter animals in their professional duties in identifying and reporting animal abuse, and the purpose this can serve as an indicator of further human violence. Here the importance of inter-agency communication is repeatedly highlighted. Within these two sections as a whole, there is a shift from the psychological and ethical discussions, to more legal and practical aspects.</p>
<p>The final section addresses abuse that is put upon wild animals, through such legal and generally socially accepted human activities as hunting. While continually referring to the harm that is placed upon animals, the main thrust of the section is not to detail the abuse of wild animals (though this is certainly described in detail), but to question the role such actions have upon those perpetrating them. Potential links between hunting and anti-social behaviour or a lack of empathy were addressed, with continued calls for a need for further studies. The four chapters that comprise this section are varied in their approaches, ranging from an overview of the current research, to various descriptions of the cruelty of hunting, to an application of a Socratic dictum that vice harms the doer in relation to dolphin drive hunts.</p>
<p><italic>The Link between Animal Abuse and Human Violence</italic> has a number of strengths. Firstly, this is a book that deals with the subject of links between human and animal abuse in a fairly thorough way, involving not only a wide range of related topics, but also a wide range of methods for studying them. In doing so it highlights an important topic and provides a good overview of existing research, while drawing attention to areas where further research is needed. In the cases where it is appropriate, it discusses what the implications would be for changing the way in which humans understand the human/animal relation, both for those who would come across humans and animals in their work (e.g. child welfare workers or veterinarians), as well as the implications of changing the legal status of animals (e.g. such that they could be legally viewed as victims in a crime). Finally, it emphasises the various ways in which abusing animals harms not only the animal, but a wide variety of people.</p>
<p>Such strengths make for an interesting and engaging read. Given the nature of the book, and its wide range of subjects and methods, there is a risk that its wide range could be off-putting to some. Since the book discusses the links between animal abuse and human violence in such a wide range of sub-topics (such as psychology, law, ethics), there are bound to be sections that are less comprehensible than if the book had had a single focus. A final point, though not a critique, is that this is a book that deals with the subject of human and animal abuse, and as it addresses this topic it does not shy away from often being quite descriptive in its detailing of such abuse.</p>
<p>Through drawing together a wide range of fields and topics related to human violence and animal abuse, Linzey and his contributors have put together a significant and useful collection. This collection not only draws together a wide area of research but also repeatedly highlights the need for more. This is a useful text in not only calling attention to the growing evidence of such links, but also in calling its readers to better comprehend the need for greater understanding and change in the way in which humans interact, both individually and socially, with their fellow creatures. As such it would be a useful book for anyone interested in such links in human violence and animal abuse and for those looking not only more fully to appreciate the depth to which current research points, but also the direction towards which the current research calls for further study.</p>
