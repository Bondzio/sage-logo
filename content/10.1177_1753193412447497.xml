<body>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>A 48-year-old man attended our hospital with a 2 week history of inability to extend the thumb of his left (nondominant) hand. He had no history of repetitive movement with the left hand or previous wrist trauma. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure had been diagnosed 8 years before, and progressive diabetic nephropathy necessitated starting haemodialysis 2 years later. He was not taking steroids.</p>
<p>A physical examination revealed diminished extensor power at the interphalangeal joints of the thumb and tenderness to palpation around Lister’s tubercle of the left wrist. The extensor pollicis longus (EPL) tendon could not be palpated. A permanent arteriovenous fistula had been positioned in his left distal forearm.</p>
<p>Laboratory tests revealed the following values: serum β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin, 24.9 mg/L (normal &lt; 1.9 mg/L) and serum whole parathyroid hormone (PTH), 318 pg/mL (normal range 9–39 pg/mL). Serum PTH had become elevated over the past 2 years.</p>
<p>X-ray of the left thumb and wrist revealed no signs of significant osteoarthritis at either location. Chest X-ray demonstrated resorption of the distal end of the right clavicle.</p>
<p>These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of left spontaneous EPL tendon rupture. Exploration revealed that the rupture site was around Lister’s tubercle and that the tendon attenuation was not apparently caused by synovitis or bone exposure. We performed tendon transfer using the extensor indicis proprius. The wrist was then immobilized in a slightly extended position, with extended metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal thumb joints. After 4 weeks of immobilization, the patient started range-of-motion exercises. Full thumb mobility was regained 2 months after surgery.</p>
<p>Histological assessment showed degenerate collagen fibres at the ruptured end of the tendon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412447497">Figure 1</xref>). Although chronic acidosis is sometimes associated with elastic changes in tendons, this patient had no elastic fibres. Congo-red staining and immunohistochemical staining for β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin of ruptured tendon specimens were negative.</p>

<p>Rupture of the EPL tendon is usually a result of a prior distal radial fracture or rheumatoid arthritis. A literature search did not uncover any reports describing spontaneous rupture of the EPL tendon in patients with chronic renal failure.</p>
<p>The musculoskeletal manifestations of chronic renal failure are osteoporosis, osteomalacia, aluminium deposition, amyloid deposition, destructive spondyloarthropathy, tendon rupture, crystal deposition, infection, and avascular necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412447497">Murphey et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Spontaneous rupture of tendons other than the EPL tendon in patients on chronic haemodialysis has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412447497">Petersen and Kang, 1994</xref>). Spontaneous rupture in chronic renal failure occurs mostly in weight-bearing tendons, such as the quadriceps and patellar tendons. The triceps brachii is most commonly involved in the upper extremities. Reports describing an association between spontaneous rupture of the finger extensor or flexor tendons and chronic haemodialysis are scant.</p>
<p>The reported factors involved in spontaneous tendon rupture in patients on haemodialysis are elastic changes in collagen fibres due to chronic acidosis, amyloidosis associated with long-term dialysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412447497">Petersen and Kang, 1994</xref>), and secondary hyperparathyroidism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412447497">Franco et al, 1994</xref>). Levels of intact PTH &gt; 500 pg/mL are associated with histological evidence of severe osteitis fibrosa due to secondary hyperparathyroidism among patients on haemodialysis. The whole PTH value of 318 pg/mL in our patient can be converted to an intact PTH value of 540 pg/mL.</p>
<p>The features of tendon rupture due to secondary hyperparathyroidism are progressive secondary hyperparathyroidism comprising rapidly increasing levels of serum PTH, inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase and a higher concentration of serum calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412447497">Jones and Kjellstrand, 1996</xref>). Our patient also had progressive secondary hyperparathyroidism.</p>
<p>Two theories have emerged to explain the cause of spontaneous tendon rupture associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Osteoclastic cortical bone resorption at the tendon insertion site due to secondary hyperparathyroidism might result in repeated minor avulsion fractures of the bone cortex, ultimately leading to scarring and weakening of the tendon attachment site and total rupture of the tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412447497">Petersen and Kang, 1994</xref>). In addition, depolymerization of glycoproteins by excess PTH weakens bone and tendon matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412447497">Jones and Kjellstrand, 1996</xref>). The rupture site was not around the bone-tendon junction in our patient, so the latter explanation might be appropriate.</p>
