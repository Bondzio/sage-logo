<abstract>
<p>This paper investigates the effect of hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) addition on the exhaust emissions of a 1999 Cummins ISM370 heavy-duty diesel engine with H<sub>2</sub> continuously supplemented to intake air. Using the 13-mode European Stationary Cycle (ESC), the addition of 2 per cent H<sub>2</sub> by volume increased the emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), but reduced nitric oxide (NO) emissions. The addition of 4 per cent H<sub>2</sub> increased the emissions of NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. When examined under constant load, the addition of H<sub>2</sub> reduced the emissions of particulate matter (PM) and carbon monoxide (CO), but had very mild effects on hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. It was also shown that the reduction in PM emissions was due to the reduced diesel fuel flowrate rather than the improvement to the combustion efficiency of diesel fuel. However, the addition of a relatively large amount of H<sub>2</sub> at medium to high (30–70 per cent) load substantially increased the emissions of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. This was due to an increase in maximum local combustion temperature resulting from the enhanced heat release rate, advanced combustion phasing, and reduced combustion duration. In comparison, the addition of a small amount of H<sub>2</sub> had a very mild effect on NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions. However, a substantial reduction in NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions was observed with the addition of large amounts of H<sub>2</sub> at 10–15 per cent load, which was due to deteriorated peak heat release rate observed at premixed combustion process and elongated diffusion combustion process, which reduced the peak local combustion temperature and retarded the combustion phasing. It was also noted that the addition of H<sub>2</sub> substantially increased the emissions of NO<sub>2</sub>, indicating the significant effect of H<sub>2</sub> addition in enhancing the conversion of NO to NO<sub>2</sub>. When measured using the 13-mode ESC, the addition of 2 per cent and 4 per cent H<sub>2</sub> increased NO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 300 per cent and 221 per cent, respectively. When measured under constant load, a maximum NO<sub>2</sub>/NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> ratio of 62.2 per cent was obtained with the addition of 4 per cent H<sub>2</sub> at 10 per cent load.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) has long been recognized as an attractive fuel having excellent combustion and emissions characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087411435049">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087411435049">2</xref>]. The proper burning of H<sub>2</sub> in air produces mainly water (H<sub>2</sub>O), with a small amount of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>), but without fuel-sourced emissions of particulate matter (PM), hydrocarbon (HC), and carbon monoxide (CO). The absence of certain criteria pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) makes H<sub>2</sub> a desirable fuel for internal combustion (IC) engines and fuel cells. Positive features of H<sub>2</sub> as a fuel and the lingering issues blocking the wide application of H<sub>2</sub> have been discussed in numerous publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087411435049">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468087411435049">4</xref>]. For example, H<sub>2</sub> has been recognized as a fuel having desirable combustion characteristics when burned in spark ignition (SI) engines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468087411435049">4</xref>]. These include low ignition energy, very fast flame propagation speed, and wide lean operational range, which make H<sub>2</sub> a desirable alternative fuel for SI engines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468087411435049">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468087411435049">6</xref>]. Past research on H<sub>2</sub> as a fuel has focused on its burning in SI engines, either as a supplemental fuel to enhance the combustion process of traditional fuels such as gasoline and natural gas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087411435049">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468087411435049">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468087411435049">6</xref>], or as the sole fuel of dedicated lean-burn SI H<sub>2</sub> engines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087411435049">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468087411435049">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087411435049">9</xref>]. Hydrogen can also be burned in compression ignition (CI) engines using a H<sub>2</sub>–diesel dual fuel combustion mode, with H<sub>2</sub> added into the intake air. At the end of the compression stroke, the compressed, hot H<sub>2</sub>–air mixture is ignited by a small diesel pilot. Such a dual fuel combustion mode has been considered as a reliable method of burning H<sub>2</sub> in CI engines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087411435049">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468087411435049">17</xref>]. The burning of H<sub>2</sub> as the sole fuel in CI engines was demonstrated as technically infeasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468087411435049">18</xref>] due to the extremely high temperature needed for H<sub>2</sub> to ignite through compression only.</p>
<p>Extensive research has been conducted to investigate the effects of H<sub>2</sub> addition on the performance, combustion, and exhaust emissions of diesel engines. In the early decades, most of the research was conducted using small, single-cylinder diesel engines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087411435049">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087411435049">11</xref>]. For example, Varde and Frame[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087411435049">11</xref>] investigated the effects of H<sub>2</sub> addition on the exhaust emissions of a single-cylinder direct injection diesel engine. The emissions of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> were measured using a chemiluminescence analyser and reported as concentrations. The emissions of PM were inferred using a smoke meter and reported as Bosch Smoke Number (BSN). The addition of H<sub>2</sub> was found to increase NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions for the range of experiments reported by Varde and Frame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087411435049">11</xref>]. In comparison, the addition of a relatively small amount of H<sub>2</sub> reduced the emissions of PM until its minimum value was observed. Further increasing the addition of H<sub>2</sub> was found to increase PM emissions. Tomita <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the effects of H<sub>2</sub> addition on NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and PM emissions using a 0.64 l, single-cylinder diesel engine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468087411435049">12</xref>]. The addition of H<sub>2</sub> substantially reduced the emissions of PM measured using a smoke meter. However, the substitution of up to 70 per cent diesel by H<sub>2</sub> had a negligible effect on NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions when the engine was operated at low to medium loads with an overall equivalence ratio below 0.4. When the engine was operated at 60 per cent load with an overall equivalence ratio of 0.5, the addition of H<sub>2</sub> increased the emissions of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. Saravanan and Nagarajan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468087411435049">13</xref>] reported a different NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emission trend using a single-cylinder diesel engine. The substitution of 10 per cent and 20 per cent diesel with H<sub>2</sub> increased the emissions of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> for the overall load range examined. However, the substitution of over 30 per cent diesel by H<sub>2</sub> reduced the emissions of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. This was inconsistent with the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions trend reported by other researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087411435049">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468087411435049">12</xref>], and suggests that the dual fuel combustion process may be complex.</p>
<p>Recently, the effect of H<sub>2</sub> addition on the exhaust emissions has been investigated using light-duty, multi-cylinder, diesel engines with advanced diesel engine technologies including cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and common-rail fuel injection. For example, Bika <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468087411435049">14</xref>] examined the effects of H<sub>2</sub> addition on NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and PM emissions of a 1999 Volkswagen turbo-charged, four-cylinder, direct injection (DI) diesel engine. The substitution of up to 40 per cent diesel with H<sub>2</sub> was reported to have only a mild effect on NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions, but enhanced the conversion of nitric oxide (NO) to nitric dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>). When measured using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer™ (SMPS™) spectrometer, the addition of H<sub>2</sub> reduced both the total mass and total number of PM particles. Shirk <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468087411435049">15</xref>] examined the effects of H<sub>2</sub> addition on the exhaust emissions of a 1.3 l, turbo-charged, four-cylinder diesel engine with a common-rail fuel system. The addition of a small amount of H<sub>2</sub>, equivalent to 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the total fuel energy, was shown to slightly reduce the emissions of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, while its effect on the brake thermal efficiency was small.</p>
<p>Following the requirements of the emissions regulations, there is increasing interest to quantify the effects of H<sub>2</sub> addition to diesel engines with respect to total engine output, reporting the brake-specific emissions (g/bhp-hr) of HC, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, with the PM emissions measured using the gravimetric method. For example, Saravanan and Nagarajan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468087411435049">13</xref>] investigated the effects of H<sub>2</sub> addition on PM emissions, which were reported both as a BSN and quantitatively in g/kW-hr. However, the approach used to convert PM emissions from BSN to g/kW-hr was not reported. McWilliam <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468087411435049">16</xref>] examined the effects of H<sub>2</sub> addition, engine load, and the rate of cooled EGR on the brake-specific emissions (g/kW-hr) of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> using a light-duty, four-cylinder diesel engine. When operated at a brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) of 2.7 bar without EGR, the addition of 6 per cent H<sub>2</sub> (volume per cent in intake mixture) increased NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions from 6.2 g/kW-hr to 19.2 g/kW-hr. With the application of 10 per cent EGR, the addition of 6 per cent H<sub>2</sub> produced NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions at a rate of 12 g/kW-hr. Compared to the addition of 6 per cent H<sub>2</sub> without EGR, the application of 10 per cent EGR reduced NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions by 37.5 per cent. Masood <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468087411435049">17</xref>] examined the effect of H<sub>2</sub> addition on PM emissions of a single-cylinder diesel engine. The PM emissions were reported in g/m<sup>3</sup>. When operated at full load, the substitution of 90 per cent diesel with H<sub>2</sub> was shown to reduce the PM emissions by 92.7 per cent.</p>
<p>Past research of H<sub>2</sub>–diesel dual fuel engines was conducted using small single-cylinder diesel engines and light-duty, multi-cylinder diesel engines. However, research of the effects of H<sub>2</sub> addition on the exhaust emissions of heavy-duty diesel engines was not reported. The present research investigates the impact of H<sub>2</sub> addition on the exhaust emissions of a heavy-duty diesel engine.</p>

<title>2.1 Engine and dynamometer</title>
<p>The engine used was a 1999 Cummins ISM370 diesel engine. This turbo-charged, in-line, six-cylinder, heavy-duty diesel engine has been widely used in Class-8 heavy-duty trucks and certified by the United States (US) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as having emissions at or below 4.0 g/bhp-hr NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and 0.10 g/bhp-hr PM. Detailed specifications of the test engine are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468087411435049">Table 1</xref>. The test engine was coupled to a 550 g/kW-hr hp General Electric direct current dynamometer used to absorb the engine load and control engine speed. In this research, the torque of the engine was controlled by supplying an electronic throttle signal to the engine. With increasing addition of H<sub>2</sub>, the engine load was maintained constant by gradually reducing the amount of diesel fuel injected.</p>

<title>2.2 Hydrogen fuel system</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087411435049">Fig. 1</xref>, the hydrogen fuel system consisted of the following subsystems: (a) a high-pressure H<sub>2</sub> storage and pressure regulation system used to provide H<sub>2</sub> flow to the low-pressure H<sub>2</sub> fuel system; (b) a low-pressure H<sub>2</sub> flow control, metering, and delivery system designed to control and measure the flowrate of H<sub>2</sub> and deliver it to the main stream of the intake air; and (c) a H<sub>2</sub> safety system developed to protect the engine intake system in the event of backfire (flame arrestor shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087411435049">Fig. 1</xref>) and minimize the leak of H<sub>2</sub> into the engine laboratory (emergency shut-down valve B shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087411435049">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The high-pressure H<sub>2</sub> fuel system consisted of two sets of pressure regulators, each connected to six high-pressure (150 bar) H<sub>2</sub> cylinders. This system was used to provide H<sub>2</sub> flow at a gauge pressure of approximately 3.2 bar. The low-pressure H<sub>2</sub> fuel system consisted of a H<sub>2</sub> filter, a mass flow controller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087411435049">Fig. 1</xref>) for controlling and measuring the mass flowrate of H<sub>2</sub>, and a H<sub>2</sub>–air mixer manufactured in-house and used to deliver H<sub>2</sub> continuously into the main stream of the intake air. To improve mixing of the H<sub>2</sub> with air, the H<sub>2</sub> mixer was installed about 2 m prior to the intake manifold and about 0.3 m prior to the flame arrestor.</p>
<p>The safety system consisted of a stainless steel flame arrester (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087411435049">Fig. 1</xref>) located between the charge air cooler and the engine intake manifold, a pressure relief valve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087411435049">Fig. 1</xref>) installed between the intake manifold and the flame arrester, and two emergency shut-down valves used to completely shut down the flow of low-pressure H<sub>2</sub> when needed. In case of backfire, the flame arrester could quench the propagation of the flame into the intake system beyond the flame arrester while the pressure relief valve could rapidly relieve the excessive pressure resulting from the burning of the H<sub>2</sub>–air mixture in the intake system. There were two emergency shut-down valves, each driven by a pneumatic actuator. The one installed after the pressure regulator was used to shut down the H<sub>2</sub> flow from the pressure regulator to the low-pressure H<sub>2</sub> line. The one installed prior to the H<sub>2</sub> filter was designed to shut down the H<sub>2</sub> flow from the low-pressure H<sub>2</sub> line to the mass flow controller.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1468087411435049">
<title>2.3 Safety operation procedures</title>
<p>A series of H<sub>2</sub> system safety operation procedures were developed and implemented in this research. These included the following. (1) A leak-free H<sub>2</sub>–fuel system designed to deliver H<sub>2</sub> fuel to the test engine. This was achieved by a leakage inspection of the high-pressure H<sub>2</sub> fuel system (using H<sub>2</sub>) after installation of the H<sub>2</sub> tank, and a leakage inspection of the low-pressure H<sub>2</sub> fuel system conducted prior to (using pressurised N<sub>2</sub>) and after the charging of the system with regulated H<sub>2</sub> fuel. (2) The elimination of the excess H<sub>2</sub> flowrate at the start of H<sub>2</sub> addition. This was achieved by the control strategy of not allowing the opening of the mass flow controller prior to the opening of the H<sub>2</sub> flow valve (emergency shut-down valve) and the detection of H<sub>2</sub> pressure prior to the mass flow controller. (3) No sudden increase in the H<sub>2</sub> flowrate during the switching process of engine operation modes with different H<sub>2</sub> flowrates. The mass flow controller was programmed to gradually open when a higher H<sub>2</sub> flowrate was requested. Additionally, no H<sub>2</sub> was added before the set of engine operation speed and load was reached. (4) No H<sub>2</sub> present in the low-pressure H<sub>2</sub> fuel system after the completion of each set of experiments involving H<sub>2</sub>. This was achieved by the following approaches: (a) the H<sub>2</sub> between the mass flow controller and mixer was consumed by continually running the engine with the mass flow controller and H<sub>2</sub> emergency shut-down valve closed and (b) the H<sub>2</sub> fuel trapped between the mass flow controller and pressure regulators was purged using compressed N<sub>2</sub> after each set of experiments involving H<sub>2</sub>. After the purging of the low-pressure H<sub>2</sub> fuel system, the pressurised N<sub>2</sub> trapped in the H<sub>2</sub> fuel system was used to perform the leakage test in the low-pressure H<sub>2</sub> fuel system and serve as inertia gas when the system was recharged with low-pressure H<sub>2</sub> prior to the next set of experiments involving H<sub>2</sub>. The latter was a very important practice to form a N<sub>2</sub>–H<sub>2</sub> mixture other than the H<sub>2</sub>–air mixture in the low-pressure H<sub>2</sub> fuel system during the purging and recharging process. (5) Better ventilation of the engine laboratory prior to, during, and after the completion of each set of experiments. During this research, the ceiling ventilation fans of the laboratory were used to ensure a high air exchange rate in the laboratory. After the completion of each set of experiments involving H<sub>2</sub> and the purging of the H<sub>2</sub> fuel system with N<sub>2</sub>, the ceiling exhaust fan was required to run for at least 30 additional minutes for further ventilation in case of possible leakage of H<sub>2</sub> into the laboratory.</p>

<title>2.4 Exhaust emissions measurement</title>
<p>The raw engine exhaust gas was ducted to a full-scale dilution tunnel with flow control accomplished using a critical flow venturi-constant volume sampler (CFV-CVS) system. A 25.4 cm diameter orifice, located 1 m from the tunnel entrance, ensured the thorough mixing of the raw exhaust gas with dilution air before reaching the dilute emissions sampling zone, located ten tunnel diameters downstream. The CFV-CVS controlled the dilute exhaust flow at a nominal 68 standard cubic metres per minute (scmm) throughout this test program. Instantaneous measurement of CFV-CVS flow was accomplished using a fast-response thermocouple and pressure transducer installed at the venturi entrance. The diluted exhaust gas was sampled from the full-flow dilution tunnel through heated sample probes, lines and finally fed into the individual emissions analysers.</p>
<p>The gas analysis bench was equipped with an exhaust sample conditioning and analysis system following the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 86 Subpart N.1310-90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468087411435049">19</xref>]. The emissions of CO and CO<sub>2</sub> were measured using non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) analysers. The HC emissions were measured using a heated flame ionization detector (HFID). The emissions of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and NO were measured using a wet chemiluminescence system with two analysing units. One unit was equipped with an NO<sub>2</sub> converter and was used to measure the emissions of the total NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> (including NO and NO<sub>2</sub>), while the other was without an NO<sub>2</sub> converter and was used to measure the emissions of NO. The emissions of NO<sub>2</sub> were calculated by subtracting NO from NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions. For computational purposes, NO, NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, and NO<sub>2</sub> are presented in this paper as equivalent NO<sub>2</sub> by mass, which is consistent with the calculation method recommended in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468087411435049">19</xref>].</p>
<p>The PM emissions were measured using the gravimetric method. Diluted exhaust gas was drawn from the full-flow dilution tunnel into a stainless steel 10.2 cm diameter by 76.2 cm long secondary dilution tunnel and, in turn, passed through a stainless steel filter holder that contained two Pallflex 70 mm diameter model T60A20 fluorocarbon-coated glass microfibre filters in series. The sample stream was maintained at temperatures below 52 °C as measured at the inlet of the PM filter holder. Secondary dilution air, which can be used to lower the temperature of the dilute sample upstream of the sample filters, was not required during this evaluation. Prior to the measurement of PM filter mass (both before and after PM loading), sample filters were conditioned in an environmentally controlled clean room (Class 1000) with a nominal dry bulb temperature of 22 °C. The PM filters were then weighted using a Sartorius microbalance in this controlled environment. To minimize the contribution of background PM on the dilute exhaust PM measurements, dilution air was drawn through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters located in the intake conditioning system of the full-flow dilution tunnel. The two HEPA filters, each at a 68 scmm capacity, were installed in parallel to provide up to 136 scmm.</p>

<title>2.5 Measurement of flowrate of diesel, H<sub>2</sub>, and intake air</title>
<p>The flowrate of diesel fuel was measured using a Max 710 fuel flowrate measurement system. The intake air flow of the engine was measured using a laminar flow element capable of measuring the flow of air up to 27 scmm. The flowrate of H<sub>2</sub> was controlled and measured using two compact size, digitally controlled mass flow controllers for the addition of H<sub>2</sub> at high and low flowrates, respectively. The high-flow mass flow controller, with a capability of measuring and controlling flowrates from 10 to 1200 standard litres per minute (slpm), was used for the addition of 1–6.5 per cent H<sub>2</sub> by volume into the intake air. The low-flow mass flow controller was used for the addition of up to 1 per cent H<sub>2</sub> by volume into the intake air. In this study, the flow of H<sub>2</sub> was controlled according to the engine intake air flow measured to obtain the preset H<sub>2</sub> flow.</p>

<title>2.6 In-cylinder pressure measurement and calculation of the average bulk mixture temperature</title>
<p>The in-cylinder pressure was acquired using a Kistler model 6125C pressure transducer sampled at 0.25° crank angle (CA) resolution. A low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 2500 Hz was applied to the raw in-cylinder pressure data to reduce the high-frequency combustion noise. The averaged cylinder bulk gas temperature was calculated using the ideal gas equation (T = PV/mR), with the measured in-cylinder pressure and cylinder volume at the intake valve closing as a reference condition. This averaged cylinder bulk gas temperature was further processed to obtain its peak value, which was used to qualitatively explain the effect of H<sub>2</sub> addition on the variation of the peak local combustion temperature and the emissions of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. A detailed description of the data acquisition system and post-processing of the sampled data can be found in Liew <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468087411435049">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Data from exhaust analysers, sampling trains, engine instrumentation, the dynamometer, and the dilution tunnel along with flow measurements of intake air, H<sub>2</sub>, and diesel fuel, were acquired and archived at a rate of 5 Hz. Each steady-state test was performed for a duration of 270 s including 30 s of mode switching, 150 s of stabilization, and 90 s of measurement of exhaust emissions and PM sampling. Cylinder pressure was sampled over the same period of emissions measurement. Regulated emissions of HC, CO, NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, and PM were always measured and reported in brake-specific mass units. When measured using the 13-mode European Stationary Cycle (ESC), a filter-based sample of integrated PM emissions was obtained.</p>
<p>In this study, the effects of H<sub>2</sub> addition on the exhaust emissions of a 1999 Cummins ISM370 engine were investigated. Initially, the effect of H<sub>2</sub> addition on the exhaust emissions was examined using the 13-mode ESC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468087411435049">Table 2</xref>). For the 13-mode ESC, no H<sub>2</sub> was added during idle mode (mode 1) due to safety concerns arising from the combustion instability that was encountered in this research. The detailed impact of H<sub>2</sub> addition on exhaust emissions was investigated under various engine loads at 1200 r/min (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468087411435049">Table 3</xref>). When operated under constant load, the diesel flowrate was gradually reduced with the addition of up to 6.5 per cent H<sub>2</sub> by volume in the intake air. In this research, the maximum H<sub>2</sub> flow was selected based on the following rules: (a) the diesel fuel flowrate at low load must be high enough to maintain stable H<sub>2</sub>–diesel dual fuel operation; (b) the maximum cylinder pressure at 70 per cent load was comparable to the peak cylinder pressure of this engine observed under maximum torque; and (c) no occurrence of engine knock was tolerable. During the H<sub>2</sub> addition, the injection timing and injection duration of diesel fuel was allowed to shift, as managed by the engine electronic controller. However, the injection timing change was very small, as indicated by the variation of the start of combustion (SOC). When operated at 70 per cent load, the addition of 6 per cent H<sub>2</sub> retarded the SOC by 0.8° CA. When operated at 15 per cent load, the addition of H<sub>2</sub> had a negligible effect on the SOC. To address the feasibility of proposed small H<sub>2</sub>O electrolysers in reducing the exhaust emissions and improving the performance of diesel engines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468087411435049">21</xref>], the detailed effects of the addition of a very small amount of H<sub>2</sub> (0–1 per cent in intake mixture) on the exhaust emissions were also investigated. The evaluation of H<sub>2</sub> addition during transient operating cycles was not performed due to safety concerns and the difficulty of setting a tracking control strategy for the quantity of H<sub>2</sub> added during transient operation.</p>

<p>As further shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1468087411435049">Table 4</xref>, the addition of 2 per cent H<sub>2</sub> increased NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions from 3.41 to 3.59 g/bhp-hr (+5.3 per cent).

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1468087411435049">Table 4</xref>, the addition of 2 per centH<sub>2</sub> reduced the NO emissions from 3.27 to 3.03g/bhp-hr, although the emissions of total NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> were increased by 5.3 per cent. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087411435049">Fig. 3</xref>, the addition of 2 per cent H<sub>2</sub> reduced NO emissions measured at each mode with the exception of modes 6 and 8, in which the emissions of NO were not affected. The reduced NO emissions were associated with the increased emissions of NO<sub>2</sub>. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1468087411435049">Table 4</xref>, the NO<sub>2</sub> emissions for diesel-only operation were typical and small (4.1 per cent of total NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions). The addition of 2 per cent H<sub>2</sub> substantially increased the NO<sub>2</sub> emissions from 0.14 to 0.56 g/bhp-hr. The NO<sub>2</sub> emissions observed with the addition of 2 per cent H<sub>2</sub> contributed to 15.6 per cent of the total NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions. Compared to baseline diesel operation, the addition of 2 per cent H<sub>2</sub> increased NO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 300 per cent accompanied with a reduction in NO emissions by 7.3 per cent. The increased NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions (5.3 per cent) resulting from the addition of 2 per cent H<sub>2</sub> were not enough to compensate the NO loss due to its conversion to NO<sub>2</sub>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468087411435049">Fig. 4</xref>, the addition of 2 per cent H<sub>2</sub> enhanced NO<sub>2</sub> emissions measured at all modes of the 13-mode ESC.

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1468087411435049">Fig. 7</xref> for medium- to high-load operation, the addition of H<sub>2</sub> substantially increased the emissions of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, especially when a large amount of H<sub>2</sub> was added. This was consistent with published experimental data obtained using a single-cylinder small diesel engine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087411435049">11</xref>] and a four-cylinder light-duty diesel engine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468087411435049">16</xref>]. The increased NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions were due to the increased local combustion temperature resulting from the enhancement of the combustion process by H<sub>2</sub>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087411435049">Fig. 8</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468087411435049">20</xref>], the addition of a relatively large amount of H<sub>2</sub> substantially raised the peak heat release rate, slightly advanced the phasing at which the peak heat release rate was observed, and advanced the phasing of completion of the combustion process. Benefiting from the raised heat release rate, the addition of H<sub>2</sub> at 30–70 per cent load reduced the combustion duration, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087411435049">Fig. 9</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468087411435049">20</xref>]. The enhanced heat release process and advanced combustion phasing increased the local combustion temperature, which enhanced the formation of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. As the peak local combustion temperature was not available in this research, the maximum average bulk mixture temperature calculated from cylinder pressure was employed as a surrogate, which to some extent qualitatively reflects the variation trend of the maximum local combustion temperature. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1468087411435049">Fig. 10</xref>, the addition of a small amount of H<sub>2</sub> at 70 per cent load slightly reduced the maximum averaged bulk mixture temperature without causing an expected reduction in NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions. Further increasing the addition of H<sub>2</sub> substantially increased the maximum averaged bulk mixture temperature accompanied with a substantial increase in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. It should be noted that the averaged bulk mixture temperature calculated was much lower than the maximum local combustion temperature due to the diffusion combustion features of diesel fuel in the H<sub>2</sub>–diesel dual fuel engine. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1468087411435049">Fig. 11</xref> for 70 per cent load operation, the addition of a small amount of H<sub>2</sub> slightly reduced the emissions of NO accompanied with a substantial increase in NO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The addition of H<sub>2</sub> beyond 2 per cent increased the emissions of both NO and NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1468087411435049">Fig. 12</xref> for low-load operation, the addition of a small amount of H<sub>2</sub> (&lt; 3 per cent) at 10 per cent load had negligible effect on NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions. However, increasing the addition of H<sub>2</sub> beyond 3 per cent was found to reduce substantially the emissions of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. In comparison, the addition of a small amount of H<sub>2</sub> at 15 per cent load slightly increased NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions, with the maximum NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> observed with the addition of 4 per cent H<sub>2</sub>. Further increasing the addition of H<sub>2</sub> beyond 4 per cent substantially reduced the emissions of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. The dramatic drop in NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions observed at 10 per cent and 15 per cent load was due to a deteriorated combustion process. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1468087411435049">Fig. 13</xref> for 15 per cent load operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468087411435049">20</xref>], the addition of a large amount of H<sub>2</sub> significantly reduced the peak heat release rate, observed during the premixed combustion process. The first combustion peak for this H<sub>2</sub>–diesel dual fuel engine was due to the premixed combustion of diesel fuel, which was a major contribution to the formation of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> at low-load operation. In comparison, the diffusion combustion process was slightly enhanced and elongated. This would retard the combustion event to a point later in the down-stroke and reduce the sustained local combustion temperature and the formation of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. The reduced maximum average bulk mixture temperature shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1468087411435049">Fig. 14</xref> qualitatively confirmed the reduction of the maximum local combustion temperature. The substantial reduction in NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions observed with the addition of over 4 per cent H<sub>2</sub> was accompanied with a significant reduction in the maximum averaged bulk mixture temperature. The reduced NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions could also be explained by the increased combustion duration, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087411435049">Fig. 9</xref> for 15 per cent load operation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468087411435049">20</xref>]. The reduced peak heat release rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1468087411435049">Fig. 13</xref>) and increased combustion duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087411435049">Fig. 9</xref>) contributed to the reduction in the maximum local combustion temperature and the formation of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. In comparison, the relatively mild impact on NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions of the addition of a small amount of H<sub>2</sub> was due to the relatively mild impact of H<sub>2</sub> on the peak heat release rate as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1468087411435049">Fig. 15</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468087411435049">20</xref>], combustion duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087411435049">Fig. 9</xref>), and maximum average bulk mixture temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1468087411435049">Fig. 14</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1468087411435049">Figure 16</xref> shows the effect of H<sub>2</sub> addition and engine load on the NO<sub>2</sub>/NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> ratio. The addition of a small amount of H<sub>2</sub> at low load substantially increased the NO<sub>2</sub>/NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> ratio, indicating the significant effect of H<sub>2</sub> on the conversion of NO to NO<sub>2</sub>. The maximum NO<sub>2</sub>/NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> ratio of 62.2 per cent was observed with the addition of 4 per cent H<sub>2</sub> at 10 per cent load. Further increasing the addition of H<sub>2</sub> started to reduce the NO<sub>2</sub>/NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> ratio, but still produced more NO<sub>2</sub> than for baseline diesel operation. It was also noted that the increase in engine load inhibited the enhancing impact of H<sub>2</sub> on the NO<sub>2</sub>/NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> ratio. When operated at high load, the effect of H<sub>2</sub> addition on the NO<sub>2</sub>/NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> ratio became weak. When operated at 70 per cent load, the maximum NO<sub>2</sub>/NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> ratio of 9.2 per cent was observed with the addition of 1 per cent H<sub>2</sub> by volume into intake air. This could be due to the relatively high local combustion temperature, which was known to enhance the decomposition of NO<sub>2</sub> to NO. When operated with baseline diesel, the NO<sub>2</sub>/NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> ratio observed was 2.6 per cent. The addition of H<sub>2</sub> seems to have enhanced the conversion of NO to NO<sub>2</sub>. However, this conversion effect merits further investigation through the examination of NO<sub>2</sub> formation chemistry.</p>

<title>3.2.2 Particulate matter emissions</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1468087411435049">Fig. 17</xref> for medium- to high-load operation, the addition of up to 4.5 per cent H<sub>2</sub> gradually reduced the emissions of PM. A further increase of H<sub>2</sub> beyond 4.5 per cent had only minimal reduction effect on PM emissions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1468087411435049">Fig. 18</xref>, the addition of up to 4.5 per cent H<sub>2</sub> for low-load operation gradually reduced PM emissions as well. However, the addition of H<sub>2</sub> beyond 4.5 per cent started to increase PM emissions, especially at 10 per cent load. Compared to diesel operation, the maximum PM reduction obtained was 40 per cent and 65 per cent, which was obtained when operated at 10 per cent and 70 per cent load, respectively. It was also demonstrated that the reduction in PM emissions was mainly due to the reduction in diesel fuel flowrate. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-1468087411435049">Fig. 19</xref>, the addition of H<sub>2</sub> had a minor effect on the fuel specific PM emissions rate, defined as the PM emissions per kg of diesel fuel burned. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-1468087411435049">Fig. 19</xref> for medium- to high-load operation, the addition of H<sub>2</sub> had a mild impact on the fuel specific PM emissions rate reported in <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-1468087411435049"><mml:math display="inline" id="math1-1468087411435049"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>g</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">/</mml:mo><mml:mtext>kgdiesel</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, especially at 50 per cent and 70 per cent load. The reduction in PM emissions at medium to high load was due to the reduced diesel fuel flowrate rather than the significantly improved combustion of diesel fuel. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-1468087411435049">Fig. 20</xref>, the addition of a relatively small amount of H<sub>2</sub> at low load had a mild effect on PM emissions evaluated on diesel fuel flow basis. However, the addition of a relatively large amount of H<sub>2</sub> substantially increased the fuel specific PM emissions, especially at 10 per cent load. This unexpected increase in PM emissions observed with the addition of a relatively large amount of H<sub>2</sub> at low load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1468087411435049">Fig. 18</xref>) was due to the incomplete combustion of diesel fuel. This might be due to the poorer atomization of diesel fuel when injected in a very short pulse and the reduced temperature combustion at low load. When operated at 10 per cent load, the diesel fuel flowrate observed at 6 per cent H<sub>2</sub> addition was about 9 per cent of baseline diesel operation. The diesel fuel injected during initiation and ending of the injection event contributes to a greater proportion of the fuel delivered at light load, and may offer a suboptimal spray pattern. In addition, part of the diesel fuel might have been mixed with the hot combustion products of H<sub>2</sub> during the diffusion combustion process of diesel fuel, which might have contributed to the increased PM emissions observed. The addition of H<sub>2</sub> to the diesel engine did not reduce the PM emissions through the improved combustion of diesel fuel.</p>

<title>3.2.3 HC and CO emissions</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21-1468087411435049">Fig. 21</xref>, the addition of H<sub>2</sub> reduced the emissions of CO with the exception of the 70 per cent load case. However, the addition of up to 3.5 per cent H<sub>2</sub> at 70 per cent load had negligible effect on CO emissions. Further increasing the addition of H<sub>2</sub> beyond 4 per cent slightly increased the emissions of CO. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22-1468087411435049">Fig. 22</xref>, the addition of H<sub>2</sub> at medium to high loads (30–70 per cent load) has a negligible effect on HC emissions. However, the addition of a large amount of H<sub>2</sub> (beyond 5 per cent) at 10–20 per cent load slightly increased the emissions of HC. This might be due to the incomplete atomization observed when the diesel fuel flowrate was very low. The diesel fuel injected during initiation and ending of the injection event was usually not well atomized. When the flowrate of diesel fuel was extremely low, the diesel fuel injected during initiation and ending of the injection event contributed to a significant portion of the total fuel injected. This might explain to some extent the increased PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-1468087411435049">Fig. 18</xref>), CO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21-1468087411435049">Fig. 21</xref>), and HC emissions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22-1468087411435049">Fig. 22</xref>) observed with the addition of a large amount of H<sub>2</sub> at low load.</p>

<title>4 Conclusions</title>
<p>The addition of a relatively large amount of H<sub>2</sub> at medium to high loads substantially increased the emissions of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. In comparison, the addition of a small amount of H<sub>2</sub> had mild effects on the emissions of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. The substantial reduction of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions was only observed with the addition of a relatively large amount of H<sub>2</sub> at 10–15 per cent load. When measured using the 13-mode ESC, the addition of 2 per cent and 4 per cent H<sub>2</sub> increased the emissions of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> by 5.3 per cent and 15.5 per cent, respectively.</p>
<p>The addition of H<sub>2</sub> enhanced the conversion of NO to NO<sub>2</sub>. When measured using the 13-mode ESC, the addition of 2 per cent and 4 per cent H<sub>2</sub> increased the NO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 300 per cent and 221 per cent, respectively. When examined at constant load, the maximum NO<sub>2</sub>/NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> ratio of 62.2 per cent was observed at 10 per cent load, with the addition of 4 per cent H<sub>2</sub> by volume into intake air. When operated at 70 per cent load, the maximum NO<sub>2</sub>/NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> ratio of 9.2 per cent was observed with the addition of 1 per cent H<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>The addition of H<sub>2</sub> substantially reduced PM emissions reported in g/bhp-hr. With the addition of up to 6 per cent H<sub>2</sub>, maximum PM reductions of 40 per cent and 65 per cent were observed when the engine was operated at 10 per cent and 70 per cent load, respectively. The reduction in PM emissions was mainly due to the reduced consumption of diesel fuel.</p>
