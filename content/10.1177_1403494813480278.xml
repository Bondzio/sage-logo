<p><italic>Aim</italic>: To examine perceived health of elderly medically hospitalized patients 1 year after hospitalization, and to explore factors associated with the perceived health at follow-up. <italic>Methods</italic>: A one-year follow-up study included 363 (175 men) elderly previously medical inpatients with age range 65–98 (mean 80.2, SD 7.5) years. Information was collected at baseline and follow-up, where perceived health – the dependent variable – was measured by one self-report item. The independent variables were assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Lawton and Brody’s scales for physical self-maintenance and performance of the instrumental activities of daily living (PSMS and I-ADL). <italic>Results</italic>: The proportion of elderly people assessing their health as good at baseline was 43.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 157) and at 12 months 41.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 150). Of those with poor health at baseline, 34% (<italic>n</italic> = 70) experienced good health at 12 months. In the analysis controlling for physical health, perceived health, physical and instrumental functioning, and depression at baseline, an increase in the level of physical and instrumental functioning and reduced symptom level of depression were independently associated with good perceived health at 12 months. <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: Improvement in performing the activities of daily living and a reduction of depressive symptoms are important factors for the perception of health one year after hospitalization. The rehabilitation of medically ill elderly patients could be the means of achieving this improvement.</bold></p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>To maintain health, or to re-establish health after an acute illness, is a central goal for the elderly themselves as well as for the health care disciplines. Studies, asking their respondents to rate their health by a single item as excellent, good, fair or poor, have reported self-perceived or self-reported health to be a powerful tool with which to measure people’s general health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813480278">1</xref>].</p>
<p>The concept “self-perceived health” seems to be an integrative summary of biomedical, functional and affective components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813480278">2</xref>], incorporating both people’s subjective assumptions and their actual knowledge of their own health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813480278">1</xref>], being influenced by socio-demographic factors such as age, gender and living alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813480278">2</xref>], culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813480278">3</xref>], being related to the person’s coping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813480278">4</xref>], their ability to realize their own ambitions and influence their own quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813480278">5</xref>]. Even though self-reported health is widely used as a measure and associated with later health outcomes, such as mortality, functional decline and health care use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813480278">1</xref>], it is still poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813480278">3</xref>]. Over the years, studies have examined how physical health, functional capacity and emotional health may be associated with self-perceived health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813480278">6</xref>] in order to increase the understanding of the elements underlying the concept. Again, such studies have been performed among adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813480278">2</xref>] and the elderly living in in the communities, nursing homes and hospitals in Scandinavia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813480278">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813480278">8</xref>]. However, the published studies have mostly been cross-sectional, and to understand fully the factors contributing to perceived health in elderly former patients, that is, the elderly who have experienced acute illness and medical hospitalizations, longitudinal studies are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813480278">9</xref>]. Factors associated with perceived health in cross-sectional studies may not be important for perceived health, for example, over a one-year period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813480278">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine perceived health 1 year after hospitalization in elderly medically-hospitalized patients, and to explore factors associated with perceived good health at follow-up. Based on a review of the literature, we hypothesized that good perceived health at follow-up was associated with good physical health at baseline, increased functional capability and improved emotional health since hospitalization after controlling for baseline perceived health as well as baseline functional capability and emotional health.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>During a 2-year period (1 September 2006–30 August 2008), a cross-sectional observational study was performed on elderly patients (≥ 65 years) at a general public hospital in Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813480278">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813480278">11</xref>]. The hospital serves nine inland municipalities covering an area of 15,000 km<sup>2</sup> with 25,000 inhabitants, where 4600 persons are 65 years or older. The participants in the study were followed up 1 year after inclusion. The same two registered nurses (one specialized in geriatrics and one in health science) collected the data at both points in time using a standardized procedure and interview. Prior to the start of the study, the nurses completed a 2-day course on how to conduct the interview, followed by training on a number of healthy subjects. The inter-rater reliability between the nurses was checked at baseline for the first 30 patients in the study and found acceptable (Spearman rho varying from 0.91–0.97).</p>
<sec id="section3-1403494813480278">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 484 (of potentially 802) elderly patients who came to the internal medical in-patient service at the Tynset Division of the Innlandet Hospital Trust with an acute medical condition, who were hospitalized for at least 48 hours and who lived in the region, were included in the cross-sectional study. Those who were excluded had: a terminal state or died before inclusion (47 patients); severe cognitive impairment signified by a score of three on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813480278">12</xref>] (CDR = 3, 116 patients); profound communication difficulties (25 patients); severely reduced physical condition and functioning (106 patients) that made the completion of the protocol questionnaires impossible (mainly caused by profound cardiovascular, pulmonary or cancer diagnoses); or declined to participate (24 patients). More information regarding the inclusion and exclusion of the participants in the cross-sectional study (T1) may be found elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813480278">11</xref>].</p>
<p>At follow-up (T2), four participants had severe cognitive impairment (CDR = 3), 88 had died and 29 declined to participate. In total, 363 (75%) patients participated in the follow-up study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494813480278">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1403494813480278">
<title>Measures</title>
<p><bold>Perceived health</bold>, the dependent variable, was measured by asking “How is your present state of health?” on a four-point response scale that included the following options “very good” (score 1), “good”, “fair” and “poor” (score 4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813480278">13</xref>]. The perceived health scores were dichotomized, that is, good (score 1 and 2) versus not good (score 3 and 4), a procedure that has been carried out in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813480278">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813480278">15</xref>].</p>
<p><bold>Socio-demographic information</bold> (living alone or not, smoking habits and residence details) was self-reported using questions from the population-based health studies undertaken in Nord-Trøndelag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813480278">16</xref>].</p>
<p><bold>Physical health</bold> (number of hospitalizations in the previous 5 years, length of hospital stay, diagnoses and medications at inclusion) was obtained from medical records or hospital administrative systems. Details of co-morbid diseases were collected at inclusion using the Charlson Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494813480278">17</xref>] and employing Schneeweiss weighting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494813480278">18</xref>], the diseases are scored according to severity (range 0–6). A higher score indicates more severe co-morbidities.</p>
<p><bold>Cognitive, physical and instrumental functional capability</bold>: The cognitive function was assessed by means of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); a 30-point questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494813480278">19</xref>] where a MMSE score on the Norwegian version higher than 24 indicates minimal or no cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813480278">20</xref>]. The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) assessed the severity of dementia in six domains (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care). A total score is calculated by means of an algorithm giving priority to memory (range 0–3). A total score of 3 indicates severe dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813480278">12</xref>]. The level of physical and instrumental functioning (Activities of Daily Living – ADL) was measured by the Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS, score range 6–30) and the instrumental activities of daily living scale (I-ADL, score range 8–31) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494813480278">21</xref>]. Lower scores indicate a higher level of functioning, and having a PSMS sum score at 6 and an I-ADL sum score at 8 indicate a normal level of functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494813480278">21</xref>]. Information regarding hearing impairment and visual impairment was collected by a single self-report item recorded in the population-based health studies undertaken in Nord-Trøndelag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813480278">16</xref>].</p>
<p><bold>Depressive and anxiety symptoms</bold> were assessed using the self-report inventory Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale. The HAD has 14 items assessing depressive and anxiety symptoms (7 items each with a score range of 0–21) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494813480278">22</xref>]. High scores indicate more severe symptoms. The cut-off point for having clinically significant depression (HAD-D) or anxiety (HAD-A) were set to ≥ 8 in each sub-scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494813480278">23</xref>]. The HAD questionnaire has been validated in Norway and used in several studies including some among the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813480278">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494813480278">24</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494813480278">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All the patients aged 65 years or older were invited to participate during their hospital stay just after they had been medically stabilized. The date and time of their inclusion in the study was registered. The patients received written and verbal information about the study, and they subsequently gave their written consent. If they lacked the ability to give informed consent, their next of kin were informed and they could decline participation on behalf of the patient. Initially, the research assistants completed the MMSE with all the potential patients. If the MMSE score was 18 or lower, the CDR assessment was performed. Those with severe dementia (CDR = 3) were excluded. One year after inclusion (± 14 days), the patients included in the cross-sectional study were contacted by phone at their home address or wherever they were located at the time to make an appointment for the follow-up. The test battery and procedure used in the cross-sectional study were repeated at the follow-up.</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics in south-eastern Norway and the Norwegian Social Science Data Service.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1403494813480278">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data were analysed by means of the PASW, version 18.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive analysis of independent samples was performed with the chi-square statistic or Fisher’s Exact Test for categorical variables (depending on the number of cases included). Independent sample <italic>t</italic>-tests, or the nonparametric Mann–Whitney test, were performed for continuous variables (depending on whether or not the distribution was normal). A comparison of individuals and their symptoms and perceived health at T1 and T2 was made by means of tests for dependent samples; that is, the McNemar test for categorical variables and dependent sample <italic>t</italic>-tests, or the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test for continuous variables (depending on whether or not the distribution was normal). The correlations between socio-demographic, health-related variables were studied using nonparametric Spearman’s rho analysis.</p>
<p>The principle outcome, health perceived as good at T2, was studied using logistic regression analysis (the “Enter” method). All analyses were adjusted for perceived health at T1. In the initial analysis, age, gender, number of hospitalizations in the previous 5 years, length of hospital stay, Charlson Index and number of medications at T1 and change in living status, MMSE, PSMS, I-ADL, hearing, and depression and anxiety (according to HAD) were studied. Changes in MMSE, PSMS, I-ADL, and HAD-D and HAD-A score between T1 and T2 were studied as continuous variables. Change in score on these scales was adjusted for the baseline values. The level indicating the poorest situation was set as the reference when possible for both continuous and categorical variables. The MMSE, P-ADL, I-ADL, HAD-D and HAD-A sum score at T1 were categorized because of a non-linear association with perceived health at T2. The variables of change that were significantly associated or tending to be significantly associated (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.1) with the outcome in the initial analysis were included in the subsequent analyses. In the final Models (4 and 5), physical health, functional capability and emotional health variables, which tended to be significantly associated (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.1) with the outcome in the previous Models (1–3), were included.</p>
<p>The analyses were checked for interactions and the independent variables for possible collinearity. P-values ≤ 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.</p>

<title>Sample characteristics</title>
<p>In all, 175 men and 188 women participated in both the cross-sectional study and the follow-up study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813480278">Table I</xref>). At T1, the patients’ mean age was 80.2 years (mean, SD 7.5, range 65–98). When comparing the genders, women were significantly older (mean 81.0, SD 7.3 vs. mean 79.2, SD 7.6; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and more often lived alone (64.9% vs. 39.4%; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Those who dropped out prior to the follow-up were significantly older (mean 82.1, SD 7.2 vs. mean 80.2, SD 7.5; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and had a higher Charlson Index (mean 2.8 SD 2.3 vs. mean 2.0, SD 1.9; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). There were no differences in the gender distribution or the prevalence of anxiety and depression.</p>

<title>Factors associated with good perceived health at follow-up (T2)</title>
<p>In the initial analysis of perceived health at T2 controlling for perceived health at T1, age, gender and socio-demographic variables were not associated with perceived health. Higher-baseline Charlson Index, the number of medications and having no hearing impairment as well as changes from T1 to T2 in terms of improved cognitive function, a higher level of physical and instrumental functioning, and a reduced level of depressive and anxiety symptoms were associated with perceiving health as good at T2 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494813480278">Table III</xref>). The physical health, functional capability and emotional health regressors each explained (Models 1–3) about 10% of the adjusted variance for good health at T2, while the fully adjusted regression model explained 19%. In the fully adjusted logistic regression model (Model 5), improved function in personal and instrumental activities of daily living and reduced depressive symptoms from T1, independently, increased the odds for perceiving health as good at T2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to follow-up perceived health of hospitalized somatically-ill elderly people in Norway. A year after hospitalization, about 41% of the elderly perceived their health as good, which was similar to the proportion at baseline. About half of the individuals who had experienced their health as good at baseline still had the same perception at follow-up. In the present study, the proportion of the elderly assessing their health as good was quite low compared to a sample of home-dwelling elderly people (in which 90% perceived their health as good) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494813480278">25</xref>], but quite comparable with perceived health of Swedish fragile elderly being discharged from hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494813480278">26</xref>].</p>
<p>The odds for perceiving health as good at follow-up were independently increased with an improved function in the personal and instrumental activities of daily living and reduced depressive score from baseline. Each improvement of one point in the independent continuous variable increased the odds for perceiving health as good with about 10%, adjusting for the importance of the other independent variables. These findings may illustrate how important emotional health and function in the activities of daily living are for an older person’s self-perception of health. Many older persons have a range of disorders. Less symptoms of depression and better function in everyday life can improve their health, and subsequently also their quality of life, although they are still not cured of their diseases. Thus, the clinical importance for rehabilitation is evident, the intervention after hospitalization should focus on the improvement of functional capability and emotional health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813480278">6</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, physical health at baseline was measured by the number of hospitalizations in the previous 5 years, length of hospital stay, number of medications and the Charlson Index. Yet, the number of medications and the Charlson Index at baseline, as the only ones kept in the regression analyses, just tended to be associated with perceived health at follow-up. Unfortunately, we did not have access to medical information about co-morbidity and medication at follow-up, thus we could only study whether physical health at baseline (not change in physical health from baseline) was important for perceived health at follow-up. Even so, the elderly may adapt to increasing physical health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494813480278">27</xref>]. They may modify their perception of health so that physical health loses some of its significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813480278">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494813480278">28</xref>]. Moreover, in a recent cross-sectional study of medically hospitalized elderly people, “coping” was found to be equally important for perceived health as the health aspects assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813480278">8</xref>]. Assessing coping strategies and resources in the perspective of perceived health at follow-up might have strengthened the present study and, subsequently, increased the significance of rehabilitation advice that is commonly given, highlighting the importance of increasing the ability of the elderly to cope with their health challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813480278">6</xref>]. The relatively low explained variance (19.4%) using physical health, functional capability and emotional health as regressors of perceived health at follow-up supports the idea that other factors may be relevant for the fragile elderly. As a supplement to coping, other factors not included in our study such as social support and socioeconomic information may be of importance. However, we included a measure of cognition, which has hardly been investigated previously in this context, and found that it was not associated with perceived health at follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813480278">6</xref>]. As regards our methods, we might be criticized for using baseline functional capability and emotional health as well as changes in the same variables in the same regression analysis, but the independent variables correlated at the most only moderately (&lt; 0.5) and the procedure has been used by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494813480278">29</xref>].</p>
<p>The study has limitations that need to be addressed. Firstly, we did not include the most fragile elderly patients, in terms of cognitive and physical health, either at baseline or follow-up. Including these patients would probably have decreased the proportion with overall good health. However, to include the most fragile group of elderly by using a proxy person who knew the patient well might have led to other problems with the method; previous research has reported a low correlation between self-assessment scores rated by the patient themselves and a proxy person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494813480278">30</xref>]. Furthermore, the cultural background of the respondents may be important for their perceived health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813480278">3</xref>]. Finally, all the respondents in the present study came from rural areas of Norway, and thus, generalizations from the study to more urban areas should only be made with caution.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This is the first study of elderly medical inpatients from rural areas in Scandinavia assessing perceived health at a one-year follow-up. As hypothesized, good perceived health at follow-up was found to be associated with improved function in physical and instrumental activities of daily living, and reduced symptoms of depression from baseline. In the present study, the proportion of elderly people perceiving their health as good was about the same at baseline and at follow-up, but it was necessarily not the same elderly individuals who perceived their health as good at baseline and follow-up.</p>
