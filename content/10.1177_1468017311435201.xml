<sec id="sec1-1468017311435201" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past 20 years, controversy has arisen in mental health over patient autonomy and involuntary psychiatric hospitalization in Europe, where most studies regarding this topic have been undertaken. In Taiwan, before 1990 people who were thought by the public or their family to exhibit mentally unstable uncontrollable behavior were involuntarily admitted to mental care facilities or asylums without psychiatric evaluation upon the request of the family or police. However, Taiwan’s Mental Health Act of 1990 changed that by stipulating that the involuntary hospitalization of psychiatric patients must be decided by two licensed psychiatrists agreeing on patient symptoms and need. That act did not concern itself as much with a patient’s legal right to liberty and privacy as it did to the risk of self-harm and community endangerment, using a medical model to justify lawful detention. The 2007 Mental Health Act Amendment in Taiwan stipulated that involuntary hospitalization of these patients be based on review by a Psychiatric Disease Mandatory Assessment and Community Care Review Committee (hereafter referred to as the Review Committee), consisting of several specialists participating in a court-like body to check and ensure the criteria for involuntary hospitalization (a diagnosis of psychosis and possible harm to self or others) is met. These specialists include psychiatrists, registered psychiatric nurses, occupational therapists, psychologists, patient representatives (usually the caregivers), lawyers, and psychiatric social workers.</p>
<p>Although it might seem that such criteria would result in lower rates of involuntary hospitalizations, more than 90 percent of the requests for involuntary hospitalizations were authorized in 2009 in Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017311435201">Department of Health, Executive Yuan, 2010)</xref>, which is interesting because in France, Germany and the UK, only one in ten psychiatric admissions was involuntary early the same decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468017311435201">Salize &amp; Dressing, 2004</xref>). In the Netherlands, around five in ten of the requests for involuntary hospitalization were accepted, the difference probably related to diagnosis for admittance for a patient with neurosis, addiction, and psychosis and by the admittance of those with psychoses, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468017311435201">Lorant, Depuydt, Gillain, Guillet, &amp; Dubois, 2007</xref>). Taiwan and Europe use similar criteria for deciding upon involuntary hospitalization. In Taiwan, the criteria are basically, a history of psychosis and risk of danger to themselves or to others; in much of Europe criteria may also include neuroses.</p>
<p>In Europe there has been increasing focus on the autonomy, the rights, and recovery of people with severe mental illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017311435201">Cook &amp; Jonikan, 2002</xref>). While it varies by profession, there is overall strong support for patients’ rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468017311435201">Ziegenfuss, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468017311435201">Ziegenfuss &amp; Lasky, 1986</xref>). The Mental Health Act of 1983 in the UK was enacted to encourage at-home crisis management and treatment and reduce involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations. The Dutch Mental Health Act also set stricter criteria for involuntary hospitalization and stipulated that involuntary hospitalizations could be reversed by a judge who reviewed the case five days from admission. However, following such attempts to protect the human rights of patients and reduce involuntary psychiatric hospitalizations, there was a 40.2–46.5 percent increase in involuntary admissions in Europe from 2000 to 2004 (e.g. England, Netherlands, Germany) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017311435201">Lelliott &amp; Audini, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017311435201">Mulder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468017311435201">Priebe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468017311435201">Salize &amp; Dressing, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The reason for these increases in involuntary hospitalizations in both Taiwan and Europe may be related to more conservative or protective attitudes, beliefs, and values in society, or there may be other unknown reasons. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017311435201">Lelliott and Audini (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468017311435201">Wall, Hotopf, Wessely, and Churchill (1999)</xref> found the rise in involuntary admissions to be caused by several factors, including demographic changes in the psychiatric patients (i.e. increases in the admissions of young people, particularly men, certain ethnic groups, and certain diagnoses) and changes in public and professional attitudes (i.e. increased fear of the threat these patients might pose to the public, the increased pressure of the professional to keep patients in hospital until it is ‘safe’ to discharge them, and the attempt to reduce readmissions, which was due to not having enough hospital beds at the time). They also suggest the practitioners had become more safety conscious regarding the risk to the patient which influenced mental healthcare workers’ attitudes towards the use of involuntary restraint, outreach, and intensive treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1468017311435201"><title>Individualism versus paternalism</title>
<p>Obviously, there are significant increases in involuntary admissions and ethical dilemmas with regard to the desire to protect a patient’s rights to autonomy and the pressure to protect the public and the patient for his own good (direct intervention) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468017311435201">Scheyett et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017311435201">Wilk, 1994</xref>). In most Western democratic societies, which hold self-determination and individual freedom in high value, individuals ideally have the human right to make their own choices (autonomy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468017311435201">Butts &amp; Rich, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468017311435201">Macer, 1992</xref>). Autonomy has been defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468017311435201">Harris (1985)</xref> as the capacity to make and act on deliberated or reasoned decisions. Harris proposed that autonomy could be undermined by defects in control, reasoning, information, or stability. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468017311435201">Bindman, Maingay, and Szmukler (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468017311435201">Szmukler (2004)</xref>, psychiatric patients, who are often stigmatized as incapable of making decisions due to seemingly defects in these areas, are ignored and not as respected as other seemingly more capable patients. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468017311435201">Spandler and Calton (2009)</xref> argue that the diagnosis of ‘psychosis’ might be conceived of as a human rights issue, especially as it pertains to enforced treatment and choice. Human rights activism has not only tried to prevent coercion (‘negative’ rights), but also to act as an impetus to, and mechanism for, creating alternative support (‘positive’, or ‘welfare rights’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468017311435201">Spandler &amp; Calton, 2009</xref>). For example, patients have been granted the right to seek non-medical alternatives to compulsory treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468017311435201">Gottstein, 2007</xref>) and the right to receive written justification for the compulsory treatments they receive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468017311435201">Thomas &amp; Thomas, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In Taiwan, the purpose of the Article of Mental Health Act Amendment of 2007 was to protect the human rights of psychotic patients. Ironically, the subsequent high rate (approximately 94.73% in 2009) of involuntary admissions might suggest that there remains a lack of respect for patient autonomy and human rights in Taiwan or perhaps a greater concern for public security or caregiver burden and inadequate outside support for the patients and caregivers. Although much of the West holds individualism and personal freedom in high regard, much of Asia highly values Confucian-based collectivism. Confucianism emphasizes filial piety, which is the respect and the subservience to one’s parents or authority figures. In the West, this is referred to as paternalism. Confucian thinking also emphasizes the subservience of one’s self to the good of the family and community. Therefore, there may be differences in Western and Eastern interpretations of human rights resulting in conflicts regarding the rights of public and the patient.</p>
<p>Involuntary psychiatric hospitalization can be considered paternalistic action taken for the protection of the patient or the protection of his/her community. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468017311435201">Harris (1985)</xref> points out, paternalism makes it possible for someone to expect another to follow his orders, irrespective of his or her own wishes or judgments. Given their education and specialized knowledge, health care professionals, especially doctors, have traditionally assumed the right to make paternalistic judgments based on what they think is best for their patients. This approach has certainly been challenged in the West where today there are patient advocate groups and greater emphasis on patient involvement in treatment decisions. In Taiwan, however, just as people are obligated to follow the directions set by their parents and teachers without question, it has been traditionally expected for them to follow those set by their physicians and healthcare workers. Therefore, patients’ involvement in treatment decisions has traditionally been forfeited to the family and the physicians. In other words, they often willingly give up rights they do not think they have. And family members and physicians assume rights they think they are entitled to. Strong paternalism overrides autonomy when the patient is rarely involved in decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468017311435201">Beauchamp &amp; Childress, 1989</xref>). Weak paternalism, which involves some degree of compromise between the wishes of the patient and suggested medical interventions as well as clear justification for treatment, sees patients involved the decision-making and respected to some degree as long as they are considered capable and not a threat to themselves or others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468017311435201">Kopelman, 1997</xref>). It can, therefore, be said that in cases of involuntary hospitalization there is no ‘weak paternalism’ because patients are coerced against their wills as they have been deemed incapable, meaning not able to make decisions, and a threat to themselves or others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1468017311435201"><title>Ethical dilemma among social workers</title>
<p>While most members of Taiwan’s Review Committees are committed to the medical safety of the patient, two in particular are by profession supposedly dedicated to patients’ human rights: the lawyers, who are legally obligated, and the social workers, who are ethically obligated<bold>.</bold></p>
<p>Social work has been viewed as the most value-based of all professions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468017311435201">Reamer, 1995</xref>). The US National Association of Social Workers stated Code of Ethics, which dedicates the social worker to the protection of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice, ideally underlies social worker ethical/professional judgments and gives meaning to their responsibilities and duties. However, when faced with issues of coercion, restriction of liberty, and medical paternalism (in this study, involuntary hospitalization), psychiatric social workers experience to some degree an affront to their ethical values and feel stress when values collide and professionals disagree (Taylor, 2002). Although involuntary hospitalization tends to be justified by intended benefit to the patient and prevention of harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468017311435201">Rosenson, 1993</xref>) as well as by a patient’s inability to make decisions, it brings forth a discomfort in social workers mostly trained from a Western perspective who, in consideration of their code of ethics, may consider it potentially harmful to clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017311435201">Brown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468017311435201">Kisely, Xiao, &amp; Preston, 2004</xref>), an abuse of power, and form of social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468017311435201">Dallaire, McCubbin, Morin, &amp; Cohen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468017311435201">Jordan, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>However, social work is also traditionally very sensitive to the values, attitudes, and political beliefs of the society in which it functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017311435201">Wilk, 1994</xref>). Sworn to a code of ethics but born to and serving a local culture, the social worker in Taiwan is faced with many dilemmas, for example, public security versus personal freedom, medical opinion versus patient will, or the social worker’s opinion versus will of the committee.</p>
<p>Studies, too, have found psychiatric social worker incongruity when conflict arises between the increasing emphasis on involuntary intervention and social workers’ historical stance and current Code of Ethics, which allows for restriction of self-determination only when risk is foreseeable and imminent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017311435201">NASW, 2000</xref>; Taylor &amp; Bentley, 2005). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017311435201">Bentley (1993)</xref> found that using coercive and involuntary treatment has become part of the job duties of many mental health practitioners, and that opinions and attitudes vary widely regarding the initiation of involuntary treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468017311435201">Encandela, Korr, Lidz, Mulvey, &amp; Slawinski, 1999</xref>). Some social workers have reacted by taking a more conservative, paternalistic stance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468017311435201">Reeser &amp; Epstein, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017311435201">Wilk, 1994</xref>), while others find themselves struggling to negotiate the difficulty of following involuntary orders when they are against the idea in principle. For them, the tension between paternalism and autonomy in treatment of psychiatric patients has become a thorny issue.</p>
<p>In this study, we administered a survey assessing staff attitude toward coercion and patient human rights to 400 psychiatric social workers serving in psychiatric wards in general hospitals and psychiatric hospitals to identify what attitudes they hold toward involuntary hospitalization of psychiatric patients. Psychiatric social workers are seen as authorities by their patients and so they, themselves, have professional authority over their patients in this paternalistic system. An examination of relevant psychiatric social work perspectives on involuntary hospitalization may bring more consideration of a psychiatric patient’s rights than a governmental act that significantly and inadvertently increased the number of involuntary hospitalizations when it intended to reduce them.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1468017311435201" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>In this study, we first telephoned the 400 psychiatric social workers serving in psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric wards in general hospitals in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468017311435201">Taiwan listed by the Department of Health, Executive Yuan, 2010</xref>. They were invited to participate in this study if they had served as psychiatric social workers who for at least one year and had provided services to adults diagnosed with severe mental illnesses (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar, major depression). Questionnaire surveys with cover letters were mailed to each interested eligible participant. Two hundred thirty-six of them returned 235 complete surveys, giving us a reasonable response rate of 59%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1468017311435201"><title>Measures</title>
<p>After reviewing several studies and research instruments assessing values and attitudes of mental health professionals towards people with severe mental illness, two commonly used scales were chosen: the Staff Attitude toward Coercion Scale and the Human Rights of Patients with Severe Mental Illness Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017311435201">Alem, Jacobsson, Lynoe, Kohn, &amp; Kullgren, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468017311435201">Kullgren, Jacobsson, Lynöe, Kohn, &amp; Levav, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468017311435201">Manktelow et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468017311435201">Taylor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017311435201">Wilk, 1994</xref>) so that the results of the study could be easily woven into existing literature. To do this, we first translated the two scales into Chinese. The scales were reviewed and back translated by three psychiatric social workers and then pre-tested for readability by an interdisciplinary team. Once the final versions of the scales were accepted, they were integrated along with items to collect participant demographic data into a multi-question, self-reported questionnaire. The survey was divided into three major sections: the coercion scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017311435201">Husum, Finset, &amp; Ruud, 2008</xref>), human rights scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017311435201">Wilk, 1994</xref>), and the sociodemographic characterization survey.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1468017311435201"><title>A. The Staff Attitude to Coercion Scale (SACS)</title>
<p>The Staff Attitude to Coercion Scale is a 15-item self-reported questionnaire designed to measure staff attitudes toward the use of coercion. This scale consists of three attitude domains on coercion: 1) offending or critical attitude, meaning coercion is viewed as offensive and possibly harmful, 2) care and security or pragmatic attitude, meaning coercion is not viewed as either positive or negative but considered necessary for safety reasons, and 3) treatment or positive attitude, meaning coercion is viewed as a treatment intervention necessary for regressive patients or those who lack insight. Its Cronbach’s alpha has been reported to be .78 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017311435201">Husum et al., 2008</xref>). Each of the three domains contains statements to which the participant indicates how much she agrees or disagrees using a five-point Likert scale, 1 meaning totally disagree and 5 totally agree. Domain 1 has six statements (e.g. Too much coercion is used in treatment), domain 2 has six (e.g. Coercion may represent care and protection) and domain 3 has three (e.g. Patients without insight require the use of coercion). We found the Cronbach’s alpha for the Chinese version to be .68.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1468017311435201"><title>B. Human rights of psychiatric patients</title>
<p>The Human Rights of Patients with Severe Mental Illness Scale consists of 29 items covering five domains of rights: 1) involuntary commitment, 2) environment and daily living, 3) right to treatment, 4) right to refuse treatment, and 5) presumption of legal incompetence. Each item is a statement to which the participants indicate how much they agree or disagree using a five-point Likert scale, 1 meaning totally disagree and 5 totally agree. Domain 1 has seven items (e.g. People could be present at their commitment proceedings even if this were against the psychiatrist’s advice), domain 2 has eight (e.g. People involuntarily committed to mental hospitals could make formal complaints against the staff whenever they pleased), domain 3 has four (e.g. Every person involuntarily committed was allowed to participate in planning for his or her own treatment), domain 4 has eight (e.g. People who had been involuntarily committed were allowed to refuse treatment), and domain 5 has two (e.g. People involuntarily committed would be presumed to be legally incompetent and proper measures would be taken to handle their personal affairs). The reliability analysis for this scale has been reported to yield an excellent internal consistency coefficient of .84 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017311435201">Wilk, 1994</xref>). The Cronbach’s alpha of our Chinese version was .67.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1468017311435201"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>A cover letter, a questionnaire survey, a consent form, and two self-stamped envelopes were mailed to each potential participating social worker at his or her health care facilities. Given the sensitive nature of the ethical and human rights issues at play, in order to protect participant confidentiality, we asked the respondents to mail their consent forms to us separately before they completed their questionnaires, which were filled out anonymously, if they were willing to volunteer to participate in this study. Later, if we did not receive the same number of questionnaires from a specific healthcare facility, we phoned the facility and ask that they remind their staff members to mail their anonymous questionnaires to us if they had previously sent us their consent forms. We received 235 useable surveys, giving us a response rate of 59 percent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1468017311435201"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Quantitative data were coded and analyzed. After an analysis of the descriptive statistics was conducted to characterize all measures as mean and standard deviation, the variance in the reported three coercion attitude domains and five human rights domains were analyzed by gender, educational background, and working experience in a hospital setting. Significance was tested by <italic>t</italic>-test and one-way ANOVA. Bivariate analyses were performed to investigate associations within all the independent measures. All statistical operations were performed using SPSS 16.0.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1468017311435201"><title>Characteristics, attitudes, and values of the respondents</title>
<p>We received complete sets of questionnaires from 235 participants (29 men, 206 women). The average age range fell within the 30–39-year-old category (41.3%). Around eighty-seven percent (87.3%) were women, 78.4 percent had undergraduate degrees in social work (the rest masters degrees), and 42.4 percent had between one and five years of mental health work experience followed by more than five years but less than 10 years (22.5%).</p>

<p>The results of our multiple regression analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468017311435201">Table 3</xref>), revealed that the following factors had the greatest influence on the value social workers placed on the human rights of severely mentally ill patients: gender (<italic>b</italic> = −.12, β = −.14, SE = .05, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05), the critical view of involuntary hospitalization as offensive (<italic>b</italic> = .16, β = .27, SE = .04, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001) and the positive view that it was a form of treatment (<italic>b</italic> = .06, β = .15, SE = .03, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05). Those with either of two extremes views were to be more concerned with patients’ human rights than those viewed from a practical step needed for the protection patient and others. Viewing it as offensive predicted a higher concern on the human rights of these patients and viewing it as a form of treatment predicted less concern with their human rights.

<p>Most of the respondents in this study supported involuntary hospitalization because they believed it to be a means of providing care and security (paternalistic) as well as a means of treatment, and most were more supportive of these patients’ right to a good environment and daily life than their right to make legal decisions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468017311435201">Table 1</xref>). Male social workers tended to believe patients had the right to refuse medications and therapists, and less highly educated social workers tended to view coercive involuntary hospitalization as part of the treatment process. Only number of years of psychiatric service was found to be related to positive attitudes toward involuntary hospitalization, the right to complain about the environment and daily living, and the right to receive treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468017311435201">Table 2</xref>). Our multivariate regression revealed gender and the critical view that involuntary hospitalization was offensive and the positive view of it as treatment could predict a higher regard for the human rights of psychiatric patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468017311435201">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the participants in this held a medical hierarchy model or paternalistic view toward involuntary hospitalization, as evidenced by their tendency to believe it to be means providing care and security more than means treatment. Most of the participants agreed that the patients had the human right to a quality environment and daily life but that the patient was not competent to make legal decisions and that he or she had the right to refuse treatment, which is partially consistent the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017311435201">Wilk (1994)</xref> in his study of 216 registered clinical social workers who had served in various psychiatric facilities in the United States. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017311435201">Wilk (1994)</xref> indicated that the right to refuse treatment evoked the least support.</p>
<p>Male social workers tended believe the patient had the right to refuse involuntary hospitalization more than female social workers (<italic>t</italic> = 2.17, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05), social workers with undergraduate degrees tended to support involuntary hospitalization and to view it as a form of treatment more than those with higher degrees (<italic>t</italic> = 2.26, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05). We also found that years of service to be significantly associated with a divergence in attitudes toward involuntary hospitalization (<italic>F</italic> = 4.80, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01), the right to expect a quality environment (<italic>F</italic> = 2.16, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01) and daily living, and the right to treatment (<italic>F</italic> = 5.78, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01). This study found sociodemographic factors (gender, education, and years of service) to be significant associated with attitudes toward involuntary hospitalization and human rights. Similarly, Scheyett et al. (2009), studying the attitudes toward autonomy versus directive interventions (involuntary hospitalization) in 193 social workers in North Carolina, reported that those who had worked in a hospital in the past year were more likely to see involuntary treatment of psychiatric patients as needed because of the high risk of violence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017311435201">Wilk (1994)</xref> did not found sociodemographic factors (age, gender, and social work experience) to have much effect on professional attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017311435201">Wilk, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017311435201">Wilk (1994)</xref> found women in their 40s with a masters in social work degree and 14 or 15 years’ social work experience in psychiatric facilities to be the most supportive of patients’ human rights, and men in their 40s with 12 years of social work experience to be the least supportive those right. However, because these findings did not reach significance and because his study did not control for age, experience, and gender, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the independent influence of these factors. In fact, few studies explicitly explore gender differences in attitudes toward involuntary hospitalization. In a survey of a similar coercion issue among psychiatrists in Sweden, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468017311435201">Kullgren et al. (1996)</xref> found that female psychiatrists less often their male counterparts suggested the use of physical restraints and the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In this study, the female social workers might take a more conservative attitude on involuntary hospitalization than male counterparts. In a collective Asian culture, the female tends to be granted the role of protecting public security and emphasizing societal ethics more so than individual ethics for maintaining universal harmony. Because only one in nine of social workers are male in Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468017311435201">Taiwan Society of Mental Health Social Work, 2010)</xref>, the statistical power of our study was not strong enough to draw concrete conclusions about gender differences in attitudes toward involuntary hospitalization.</p>
<p>In this study, social workers between the ages of 40 and 49 years old were found to be supportive of the human rights of the involuntarily hospitalized patient of than their younger or older counterparts. Of interest, we found the younger social workers more often than their older counterparts tended to view involuntary hospitalization as a means of the treatment, indicating they held a more positive attitude towards this practice. Although a greater proportion of the social workers over 40 years old tended to view involuntary commitment as a positive procedure, they also tended more than their younger counterparts to support the right of patient to a quality environment and daily living, suggesting that older social workers became more supportive of the rights of the involuntarily hospitalized patients.</p>
<p>Our multivariate regression revealed a higher regard for the human rights of psychiatric patients could be predicted by the gender of the social worker (male), the view of involuntary hospitalization as a positive treatment, and the view of it as offensive. These findings suggest, apart from being male, that extreme divergent attitudes towards involuntary commitment reflected greater support of human rights. Those with either of these extreme attitudes were in the minority, however. Most of the respondents held a pragmatic attitude in support of care and safety, meaning that they viewed involuntary hospitalization as neither positive nor negative, but necessary. Necessity is not only related to patients’ ability to make decisions and safety issues, but is also related to available resources, competency, and convenience of the caretakers and healthcare providers, which could theoretically take precedence of the needs and rights of the patients themselves. Therefore, although the rights of patients may be taken into consideration, it seems as though the needs of others could also be a determinant of whether one is involuntarily committed.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468017311435201">O’Brien and Golding (2003)</xref> stated that the use of power by a professional to make an individual adhere to treatment tended to be justified by the prevention of harm. This is a forced paternalistic attitude. We found that in Taiwan, already a paternalistic society, when psychiatric patients become very ill, when they cannot protect their own interests, and when they are deemed possibly harmful to themselves or others, the review committee quickly takes a strong paternalistic stance and the autonomy of the patient is forfeited for the safety and good of the patient and others. Even to the social workers, whose code of ethics requires that they respect and protect the rights of their clients, autonomy and self-determination of the patient lose priority for safety reasons. It is also interesting to note that paternalism goes beyond care of a patient in Taiwan. Being a society strongly influenced by Confucianism, hierarchical workplace relationships and subservience to authority is prevalent and seen as good. Therefore, even social workers, who are sworn to protect the rights of individual, are also expected bow to the will of the physicians and the general will of the review committee. When they do, they may harbor feelings that a patient’s human rights have been largely ignored.</p>
<p>We found involuntary hospitalization and treatment of the psychiatric patient to be complex and at times unsettling for the level of awareness of risk management increased over the past decade on mental health practitioners, as have other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017311435201">Lelliott &amp; Audini, 2003</xref>). Many professionals believe that we are obliged to provide legal representation for each patient, but are frustrated with the failures of the legal system to adequately do so. Patients’ rights to autonomy should not be denied, but when a patient cannot exert that right due to some limitation, then the power to decide whether that patient is hospitalized should be used properly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468017311435201">Kopelman (1997)</xref> pointed out that self-determination, advanced directives, substituted judgment, and the best-interest standards are the four most important standards for making health-care decisions in psychiatric and other medical practices. He suggested that involuntary hospitalization might be avoided through shared decision-making on the part of the physician, legal guardian, and the severely mentally ill person as well, hopefully obtaining the agreement of the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468017311435201">Kopelman, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017311435201">Lelliott and Audini (2003)</xref> also suggested that the seeming harshness of the act can be softened somehow by giving the patient information and cooperation where possible. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468017311435201">Campbell, Charlesworth, Gillett, and Jones (1997)</xref> suggested a shared decision-making model. These suggestions are ideal, especially in societies that value individualism. In a society that values collectivism like Taiwan, they may be viewed as unnecessary and troublesome. Therefore, perhaps the best alternative for the Taiwanese psychiatric social worker, who does not personally know the severely mentally ill person whose case is being discussed in a review committee, is to ask important questions that raise the level of respect and awareness of a patient’s human rights among the committee members. This would to some degree fulfil their duty to follow their code of ethics and make the decision-making process more considerate and humanistic.</p>
<sec id="sec16-1468017311435201"><title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>This study has some limitations. Most of participants were women, which may make this study difficult to generalize to other areas where more men serve as psychiatric social workers. We found no structured risk assessment methods, validated across different countries, to assess the potential dangerousness of a patient to himself or herself or others. This was a cross-sectional study of attitudes and values, so our results may only reflect point-in-time conditions. In addition, it would have been ideal to review studies on the effect of changes in mental health law and practices in Taiwan. However, we could find no such studies in either international journals or local journals in Taiwan. Finally, our study did not distinguish between psychiatric social workers with professional licenses and those without. We are not sure how that may have affected our results.</p>

<sec id="sec17-1468017311435201" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The study found gender, educational level, and working experience to be associated with the professional attitude toward coercion and the rights of the involuntarily hospitalized patient. Our study found that both the view of coercion as offensive practice and the view of it as a positive means of treatment could predict a higher respect for the human rights of involuntarily hospitalized psychiatric patients, reflecting the strong paternalistic attitude toward psychiatric patients in Taiwan. In conclusion, the patient advocate role, which is usually assumed by the psychiatric social worker, is weakened within this decision-making committee. More studies are needed to determine either the need for education to prepare psychiatric social workers for the conflicts they will encounter in this role or the need for further revision in Taiwan’s Mental Health Act to ensure greater protection of patient rights and autonomy.</p>
