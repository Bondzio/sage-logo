<sec id="sec1-1463499613483404" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In Lunda,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1463499613483404">1</xref></sup> Angola’s diamond-rich region, the quality of a diamond is not simply an attribute of its materiality. Miners and traders often describe these rough gemstones as ‘dirty’ or ‘clean’, ‘noisy’ or ‘silent’. Depending on the rock’s provenance, pattern of circulation, and physical properties, diamonds are also said to have an inner ‘life’ of brilliance or to be tarnished by an internal ‘fire’. They can move around between trading posts, seemingly aimlessly, and vanish without a trace. Significantly, in light of the rigorous techniques to appraise its value and avoid any breach to its security, the perfect diamond is <italic>invisible</italic>: like water it bears no color and, given its potential value, it is quick to vanish from the pit or riverbed from where it was first dug out.</p>
<p>This highly-desired translucent visibility or clarity (‘top white’ color, or pure crystal) is less the effect of clearly defined classificatory rules than a product of the ability to detect, appraise, and seize a quality of invisibility. For Juca,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1463499613483404">2</xref></sup> a former diamond transporter and rogue ‘operative’ for ‘big bosses’ of <italic>kamanga</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1463499613483404">3</xref></sup> this diamond ‘is an insane crystal. You see a bit of water inside the diamond; ‘top white’ is like water [i.e. translucent]’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1463499613483404">4</xref></sup> At night, placed over a flashlight on a piece of paper, the diamond disappears. In pure heteroglossic fashion, Juca’s narrative alternates between the fearless agitator and the swift diamond carrier, deploying the disguising powers of the body to evade obstacles to the circulation of diamonds. His speech mixes voices and tenses with agentive verbs of directed motion, indexically reminiscent of movement-intense, high-pressure moments in diamond-mining areas: If there’s a ‘hot’ stone coming out of the ‘oven’ for example, ‘those who catch it – Leave!, running!’ But to get rid of an undesirable stone that is ‘burning’ value, he cunningly deceives a junior buyer by signaling a different experience of speed: ‘Look, this one is getting out <italic>fast</italic>: you don’t want it? Ah, okay. come back’… There’s no other way around, you have to be fast.’</p>
<p>This article deals with qualitative experiences of diamonds in ethnographically locatable moments of trading and transport. Under the guise of a materially ambiguous commodity – perfectly invisible, as it were, appearing and disappearing in socially relevant settings – the perception of its evanescent qualities implicates both the materiality of pure carbon-based stones and the social relations inscribed in the labor of extraction and exchange. As such, this valuation of diamonds is incommensurate with existing scales for measuring and classifying a stone’s potential value. At the juncture between a qualitative appreciation and the embodiment of the commodity<italic>,</italic> I contrast how diggers, transporters, and traders signify transformations of value in producing and circulating these rough stones. These processes and the actors partaking in them, I suggest, display a fundamental connection to the rock’s qualities, which in turn orients and organizes the overall social framework of this economy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1463499613483404">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In order to effectively trace the movement of these stones, this ethnographic study of diamond trading and circulation singles out three singular figures of this diamond economy: the transporter of rough stones, the mining ‘agitator’ that energizes the extractive and trading processes, and the diamond trader (buyer and seller), or <italic>kamanguista</italic>. Like Juca, these socially identifiable characters embody iconic ideal-type features that often spill onto each other. To make sense of the complex social significance of these actors, I put forward an empirical and conceptual examination of qualia in practices and networks of circulation. In other words, I examine diamond transport, smuggling, and trading by the qualities smugglers, traders or agitators invoke and procure. In the relationships they cultivate and the social processes they facilitate, these characters exhibit the qualitative dimensions of the diamond trade and its wide expanse of movement, and reflect the various facets of the diamond at different moments of its commodity-life. I suggest, furthermore, that they effectively embody the desirable qualities that are generally attributed to diamonds such as those pertaining to clarity, invisibility and an ill-defined hiddenness.</p>
<p>Commonly perceived as agents of mistrust or unlawfulness, the transporter, agitator, and kamanguista offer an interpretation of law and morality that challenges the aftermath of neoliberal corporate-state synergies, and their increasing regulation of the sector, tightening police and security repression, and control over access to mining concessions. Angola’s securitization of social life in mining communities results from the intersection of nearly one hundred years of industrial, colonial, and corporate-driven extraction, and, since the early 1990s, a period of ill-reputed social agitation, free-for-all diamond digging and military disarray. To this day, and despite the pronouncements of a new social configuration led by mining corporations and the postcolonial state, Lunda’s social economy of diamonds operates unavoidably with practices reminiscent of rough, clandestine agents of trafficking and petty-trade, unexpectedly resilient in Angola’s post-war, corporate-driven, and state-regulated diamond economy. In fact, diamond trading in Angola has matured under the conflicting presence of corporate mines licensed by state authority and assisted by the law of private security forces, and the socially pervasive activity of thousands of diamond diggers, catering to the region’s diamond buyers, or kamanguistas. These figures’ social relevance, to be sure, seems to have accrued from their legal and political exclusion, much like the bohème-conspirateur and the flâneur of the era of ‘high capitalism’. In fitting resonance with the current predicament of diamond diggers and dealers in Angola, Walter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1463499613483404">Benjamin (1973)</xref> noted that when the flâneur disappeared from the arcades of Paris what got lost was their ‘marginality’ rather than what they came to stand for, i.e. ‘the society of mass consumption’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1463499613483404">Buck-Morss 1986</xref>: 104).</p>
<p>In brief, despite the growing presence of corporate mining concessions in the Lunda region from the mid-1990s and more acutely since the end of the civil war in 2002, the production of value and maintenance of social order in the region’s diamond mining areas are deeply implicated in everyday interactions between diggers and diamond buyers. Bundled up in economic practices and ever-present in spaces of social life, diamonds are suggestive objects for the protagonists of extraction and trade, evoking sensuous and qualitative experiences. The experience of these interactions is carefully calibrated by the qualities of the fruits of its laborers, uncut diamond stones, and the qualitative dimensions of the bodies of those who transport and trade them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1463499613483404">6</xref></sup> I am thus particularly attuned to the corporeal dimensions of mobility and movement that are characteristic of the manner in which rough stones are dug up, passed hand-to-hand, and move out of sight in the first moment of exchange from diggers to kamanguista, the ‘salto mortale’ in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1463499613483404">Marx’s (1976)</xref> felicitous expression, or the ‘leap’ from the body of the commodity to that of money.</p>
<p>Conceptually, this article traces the movement that brings diamonds <italic>qua</italic>-commodities from the earth, out of mining areas, and into circulation. This way, organized semiotic qualisigns of bodily movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1463499613483404">Munn 1986</xref>) stand in indexical and iconic relation to the experience of qualities exhibited and embodied in the events of transporting and trading diamonds in Angola. Extracting diamonds and moving them into circulation sits uneasily between and betwixt signs of stasis and ‘speed’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1463499613483404">7</xref></sup> and intense social and spatial mobility, contentious issues of availability of resources and territorial accessibility, on the dubious borderline between legality and illegality. This experience of extracting, carrying, and trading, I suggest, is fundamentally organized and structured around two clusters of opposing qualities: clarity and visibility, invisibility and hiddenness. Specifically, I argue that qualisigns of speed and slowness, secure and insecure bodies, mobility and immobility, orient objects and people in transport and trade by displaying a connection to the experience of diamonds’ qualities of visibility and hiddenness. In other words, qualia in exchange and circulation of diamonds allow for the articulation of disparate social processes by standing for diamonds’ clarity and in/visibility in a dialectical movement between a quality of material clarity and its negative doubling of hiddenness or lack of visibility.</p>
<p>This tension between visibility and invisibility is not unique to diamonds. While conspicuous in discussions of power, secrecy, and conspiracy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1463499613483404">Foucault 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1463499613483404">West and Sanders 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1463499613483404">Masco 2006</xref>), tropes and metaphors of transparency and visibility, hiddenness or occlusion are also deeply established in studies of commodities, money and material objects. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1463499613483404">Masuzawa (2000)</xref> demonstrates, the invisible capacity of objects to animate immaterial powers and, conversely, the endowment of matter with ‘super-natural’ potency, took 19th-century debates on materiality, atomist theory, or ‘fetishism’ in so-called ‘primitive’ religions by assault. Likewise, the irony of Marx’s much-glossed theory of fetishism, as Peter Stallybrass (1998) eloquently points out, relied precisely in denouncing – at the point when immaterial spirits were seemingly taking over the material world – that commodities depend on an invisible value (‘mysterious’, for it is hidden from sight), much like his own coat, appearing and disappearing from the local pawn shop.</p>
<p>Iconic of this uneasy relationship between hiddenness and visibility, David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1463499613483404">Graeber recently suggested (2001: 92–115)</xref>, is the distinction between money and objects of adornment, be it kula shells, heirloom jewelry or beads. Money’s furtive and destabilizing power, he argues, derives precisely from its capacity to be hoarded and hidden away, coming to stand for the invisible potency of its holder. To the contrary, the value of objects that rely on the visibility and display of their qualities creates the possibility of agency through the premise of congealed history contained in them. In a similar vein, although with very different implications, recent semiotic studies of commodity registers refute the notion that use-value is somehow inherent in the commodity itself, left as it were to the ‘work of history’, in Kockelman’s reading of Marx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1463499613483404">Kockelman 2006</xref>: 79–80). In tandem with Kockelman’s suggestion of the commodity as a semiotic process, giving way to an analysis of immaterial commodities, Asif Agha proposes that a strict reading of use-value makes ‘invisible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1463499613483404">Agha 2011</xref>: 22) and obscures the visible signs of ‘commodity formulations’ – the metasemiotic practices, institutional discourses or the indexical alignment of commodities in mediating social relations.</p>
<p>While these contributions open room for new and exciting avenues for research, what I am suggesting here goes in a somewhat different direction. Unlike money, diamonds’ desired invisibility is rooted on a qualitative appreciation of its materiality, a point to which I will later return; unlike objects of display, however, its value is ostensibly tied to the capacity to be hidden away and quickly removed from circulation. Moreover, rather than putting forward an exchange-centered or object-focused analysis of diamonds, or dwelling on their unsettling lack of use-value, diamonds’ peculiar capacity for in/visible materiality is articulated from the standpoint of qualia. This way, I aim to capture the dynamic transformations that align material properties to people, propel objects in action, and indexically orient social life in and through the experience of qualities. In tandem with Gell’s discussion of the ‘perfume state’, the phenomenological awareness of diamonds’ properties and capacities permeates the sign itself ‘with the force of something inscribed in the fabric of the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1463499613483404">Gell 1977</xref>: 33). In what follows, thus, I track diamonds as symbolic tokens and powerful vehicles of signification, capable of transforming the social world as much as they allow for understanding it.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1463499613483404"><title>I ‘Get inside the stone’: Materiality, qualia and the clarity of value</title>
<p>As different evaluators told me on occasion, there are no identical rough diamonds. In the unlikely event of two diamond stones showing up of seemingly equal shape, size, and color, one of them will still ‘speak’ and look differently to the experienced eye. While pale-white or light-yellow diamonds, smaller than one carat, with rough edges and tense, earth-tainted surfaces are the stuff of everyday diamond transactions, diggers and dealers strive towards the peculiar diamond stone: fancy color, large sizes or pure smooth facets and crystal-clear interior. After all, only these few rare diamonds survived unscathed to the powers of millions of years of erosion, which eventually molded, shrank, and critically intruded the core of the diamond.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1463499613483404">8</xref></sup> Overall, however, diamonds are categorized according to three qualities, clustered around the well-known ‘4 Cs’. With the exception of carat weight, all the other ‘Cs’ – cut, color and clarity – determine the qualitative variations found in a diamond: gradients in color, the shape of the cut and the flawlessness of its clarity.</p>
<p>In principle, ‘color’ seemingly invites an arbitrary categorization, elucidated only by resorting to expensive color machines not accessible to most traders. In practice, however, clarity (in the potential to refract light) is effectively the most complicated quality to pin down for both specialists and laymen alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1463499613483404">Bruton 1971</xref>: 180). The degree of clarity or opacity significantly impacts a rough stone’s value, often more so than color. For this reason, assessing clarity in larger stones can be a delicate process, fraught with uncertainty and threatened by the possibility of failure in detecting a diamond’s internal intrusions. Unlike other classificatory registers, clarity is continuously summoned technically over the course of the stone’s path from rough to cut, being repeatedly <italic>louped</italic>, magnified and thoroughly examined in search of the ambiguous presence of the hidden occlusion, a process that can take days and engage the expertise of competing evaluators.</p>
<p>In large mining complexes, diamonds are first sorted out between industrial-quality and gemstones based on clarity (or lack thereof). Gemstones are then categorized along a minute spectrum of clarity ranging from the ‘clean’ flawless, or pure clarity, to the heavily spotted, with internal inclusions visible to the naked eye. Pickers and evaluators used to mediate this first assessment of a stone’s clarity by breathing onto its hazy facets, although security measures growingly prevented this unmediated proximity to the diamond. In artisanal extraction, diggers <italic>loupe</italic> a diamond by soaking it in the transparency of water or other makeshift techniques, such as placing the stone under a flashlight and a piece of white paper in order to measure the degree by which, in their own words, it ‘disappears’. Proper evaluation analyzes the stone’s inner ‘glitz’ or potential cracks, as well as the dire presence of ‘charcoal’ residues of fire. While the potential to refract light stands out as a sought-after quality, a ‘rainbow’ reflection may indicate an undetected tension. As such, the quality of a diamond, like that of clarity, is not simply an attribution of its material properties, but is revealed and produced along a structure of relations opposing clarity to opacity, tangibility to hiddenness, transparency to occlusion.</p>
<p>This is not a straightforward correlation: as a rule of thumb, the clearer the stone is, the less noticeable its occlusions should be; the more visible traces it contains, the less clarity it possesses. In reverse, the more clarity a diamond possesses the less visible it becomes as a whole and in-between, a number of other features (small clouds or cracks, damaged surface, minor spots), at times hardly detectable even for the experienced eye, can make the act of evaluating an exercise in speculation. As a veteran kamanguista explained, in order to see and evaluate a diamond one has to ‘get inside the stone’. Only that way, he said, can one find the ‘hidden traces that ‘spoil’ a stone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1463499613483404">9</xref></sup> Until a diamond is finally cut, polished, or cracked open – the decisive moment of revelation of these ‘impurities’ – the social significance of a stone’s quality of <italic>invisibility</italic>, I suggest, is indexically contiguous with a qualitative experience of uncertainty, elusiveness, secrecy, hiddenness, and a socially-perceived ‘shadiness’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1463499613483404">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In opposition to diamonds’ lack of clarity, a quality of ‘visibility’ emerges as a productive feature of diamond mining. This quality of clear visibility – a near-flawless internal configuration – is reflected by the transparency of value, recouped and experienced at different stages of production and circulation. First and foremost, the expenditure of wealth by kamanguistas or, conversely, by the control over its accumulation in the apparatus of security and hyper-vigilance that organizes large industrial and corporate mining complexes: between bodily searches, x-ray screening, and ID tagging, living in a mine implies coping with techniques and practices of security and other forms of social control, extending over one’s range of relationships or consumption patterns. Diamonds, finally, epitomize visibility in that the social import of their material properties is by and large the historical product of a late 1930s marketing ploy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1463499613483404">Hart 2001</xref>: 138–41), its commodity status and hyper-mobility being similarly and continuously reinforced by an astute management of diamonds’ image, be it in media or high-end modes of product placement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1463499613483404">11</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1463499613483404"><title>II Trading and moving in kamanga</title>
<p>Kamanguistas or diamond traders (aka <italic>Big Father</italic>, <italic>Boss</italic>) are notoriously big: socially exuberant characters for whom money speaks of largesse. Through their trading offices (<italic>comptoirs</italic>/<italic>contuário</italic>, <italic>prontuário</italic>, <italic>casa grande, casa-mãe</italic>) they become the main agents of monetization on the frontline of diamond extraction, be it the relatively wealthy individual kamanguista to locally established retail businesses. The name by which a kamanguista is known in circles of diggers and small ‘traffickers’ or ‘ringuistas’ (buyers from the <italic>praça</italic>, or local market) is usually conflated in archetypal male figures, at times reflecting a prominent feature of the kamanguista’s body (one’s size or baldness, for example) but most frequently a mix of given names. This public name is cultivated and nurtured by the kamanguista himself (to ‘make my name’, often at the expense of monetary losses), consciously aware of his ‘public image’ and local reputation.</p>
<p>If more valuable stones can make up for weeks or months of wait, they also provoke less quiet transactions. As I sat in a diamond post in Lucapa over the course of my research, a group of four diggers had just agreed with the trader on the selling price for a 6-carat stone when the shouting outside the trading room became too loud to ignore. On the other side of the door, a squabble had erupted over who was allowed to negotiate directly with the ‘boss’, bypassing security barriers prior examination by the trader’s junior evaluator. On a whim, the group of diggers is escorted through an alternative exit out into the street, locking the door behind him. I remained seated, glancing over at the door. One of the trader’s employees came upstairs, bare-chested after shrugging his t-shirt to pieces in a fight but hanging on to his walkie-talkie like a precious lifeline. The trader returned a few minutes later, handed over a t-shirt stamped with the house logo, and quietly sat back. Later, he commented on the earlier uproar: ‘Diggers don’t like discipline. They get nervous if they see men in uniform. Diggers like to feel at ease, they don’t like to be barred.’</p>
<p>Although dealing with monetary transactions in excess of hundreds of thousands of dollars, this trader kept no armed security in the premises other than a <italic>taser</italic> used ‘playfully’ on occasion to tease ‘annoying visitors’. As the kamanguista explains, there could be a productive value to this form of agitation: ‘Usually the crazier, drunker [diggers] are the ones bringing good kamanga’, a painstaking truth in his experience as a diamond dealer. He relays the following episode to illustrate his point: a few years back, when he still worked with a partner, a group of three diggers entered his office with an exceptionally large 92-carat stone. As part of their bargaining strategy, they threw it on the table but before the evaluator had time to examine the large rock, they yanked a gold necklace from his chest, the trader’s satellite phone and his business partner’s jewelry. More commonly in these negotiations, diggers demand keys for new motorcycles or other gifts before flaunting what is expected to be an exquisite stone. In fact, whereas in more modest transactions diggers usually sit in silent expectation as the group’s leader bargains for a better offer from the buyer, in more extreme transactions the sheer size of a stone – as value in potency – can sometimes permit the breaking of rules of behavior that are usually enforced when dealing with diamonds. And with good reason, as trading in diamonds requires the cultivation of one’s reputation – for generosity, hospitality, and solid commercial standing – so as to attract the best stones.</p>
<p>Take Santos, a smaller trader in a neighboring mining town: ‘Don’t forget!’, he tells the group of diggers about his name after offering a batch of supplies, as if reminding them of where they should come again to sell their production. Santos’s diamond <italic>comptoir</italic> was the very last house at the end of a battered asphalt road signaled by a modest roundabout. For years, this part of Lunda was teeming with diggers until the local alluvial mining concession sealed the area neighboring the meandering Tchikapa River. Recently, diggers have swarmed the area again, now that the previous mine shut down operations and the anticipated opening of a new, in-depth kimberlite mine has yet to occur. In-between and despite various restrictions, to be sure, diggers never quite disbanded from the area given the quality of its uncut diamond stones, in their high-incidence of color, overall carat weight, and high-levels of clarity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1463499613483404">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In smaller trading posts like Santos’s, as it turns out, dealing in diamonds can be characterized as a slow business with occasional bursts of agitation. Back in August 2006, his commercial complex was effervescent. The house felt taken over by diggers, as it had not been thus far in my presence, when a 12-carat stone with minor internal flaws showed up for sale. There would seem to be an obvious correlation between the size and material qualities of these stones and the acts whereby the body figures in these exchanges.</p>
<p>While Santos and another evaluator carefully examined the stone, the group’s self-awareness of its value contaminated the room to the point of collective excitement, even before the deal had been sealed. While sellers of $100–$200 stones are shrugged off on a regular basis, this group felt entitled to be there, control the pace of the transaction, and duly engage the time and space of this event. As the warehouse opened to provide gifts, in addition to a cash offer in exchange for the stone, the group tried on new shoes and clothes, danced around palettes of beer and posed for a photograph with the diamond dealer, at his request. That day, he sponsored the excess of celebration and monetary wealth by temporarily relinquishing total control over the deal and the premises; the bodily excitement – in the form of unrest, commotion, or intense bodily tempo in otherwise orderly and safe environments – locked in a relationship between diggers and dealers, extending beyond the time or space of the transaction to include the potential of future deals and the generating capacities of diamond fields. Specifically with regard to the digger-dealer interaction, participants would seem to be oriented along a continuum of agitation and discipline, at different places in the ritualized exchange. On one end, ravenous consumption or displays of the body, with beer and goods, and on the other, the meticulous appraisal of the stone and the silent expectation of the first evaluation.</p>
<p>Crucial to these transactions is the movement of larger stones. A ‘noisy’ stone, for example, is one that has attracted the attention of a particular mining community. If there are rumors that an exceptional stone has left the ‘hole’ (<italic>tchibulo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1463499613483404">13</xref></sup>), the more resourceful kamanguistas may send their cars and motorcycles around the city in search for its whereabouts. Similarly, if a large transaction reaches the ears of the local state police, they are quick to demand a share of the deal: as a former ‘controller’, the self-ascribed ‘eyes’ of a diamond sponsor in digging sites, put it, referencing a dialogue with a digger, ‘go on to your life, disappear, otherwise the police is with you; take your value and split’. On the other hand, a stone that circles continuously between trading posts loses its value: if it is not quick to disappear, changing owners for a higher price or placed away in a safe vault, it is a ‘burned’ stone, fatally marked as flawed given a hidden or hardly detectable occlusion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1463499613483404">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>We are reminded here of the opening story of Juca, and his invocation of speed to counteract the closure of a diamond’s expected path to exchange. The kamanguista for whom Juca worked was a ‘really bad Muslim with no spirit’, a Middle-Eastern trader who could speak nine languages but ‘now is more Angolan… Belgium, and English’. The transport to nearby diamond dealers is a crucial endeavor and Juca was often tasked during the war with carrying supplies and diamonds between the cities under governmental administration and UNITA-controlled areas, given his capacity to dodge authorities and elude police controls. He would also travel to support his boss’s trading partner in Lunda, a Mauritanian buyer who resided in a UNITA [União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola, opposition to ruling party MPLA] camp, carrying ‘letters written in Arabic that only he could translate’. During one of his passages through Lunda, however, the kamanguista suffered a stroke:<disp-quote>
<p>You know how these things are. He caught it, paralyzed from this side! He left sick, from all the tension; we’re there, always money coming in, he had a stroke. The UNITA guys were already planning to kill us to receive the [treasure] chest, lots of problems, and why? Because money was not coming out anymore… But there was a mafia there too. Because every place is like that, when a lot of money starts coming out, it turns into a rounded circle… the money that left they’ll spend it again there. It won’t get out, it closes. It won’t leave. You may wash [gravel], you can take, but nothing comes out of it. [laughs]</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This passage is clearly indicative of the body’s insertion in value-making processes or, to be more precise, of the body’s capacity to be transformed negatively through immobility – a quite literal paralysis. The circulation of diamonds and the production of value are premised upon speed (‘Fast!’) and the potential to traverse road and border controls, namely through the disguising powers of the body. But to counteract this moment when diamonds and money were not flowing (‘no exit’), the smuggler did not react with the necessary speed. As a consequence, the sluggishness and slowness of value circulation (‘closing’) were transposed onto the body itself, turning the kamanguista’s capacity to safely and smoothly traverse mining areas into a dangerous, life-threatening situation.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1463499613483404"><title>III Digging and the ‘agitator of everything’</title>
<p>A competing movement takes place in the actual site of digging, as Tony’s story illustrates. He described himself as an ‘agitator’ long before I met him in early 2010 in the cab of his truck, an asphalt tank trailer that was the envy of the entire fleet. I was visiting a mutual friend and Tony’s fellow truck driver in a barren construction yard in Saurimo, home to the fourth largest diamond mine in the world, Catoca, and self-ascribed ‘diamond capital’ of Lunda Sul. Tony was sent to Cuango as a soldier in 1989, barely 18 years old, in a military attempt to flip this hotspot of diamond smuggling back into state control, choosing to stay after being discharged from the army. In the window of peace that preceded the 1992 elections, the possession and trading of rough diamonds outside the purview of state control moved from being illegal and clandestine to outright encouraged, if not by the law at least by its agents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1463499613483404">15</xref></sup> Like hundreds of thousands of others across Lunda, pouring in from other parts of Angola, neighboring DRC and beyond, Tony was determined to dig for diamonds, trade them and strike rich or die trying. He sold what he found in Cafunfo, a thriving mining town near Cuango, and not in Luanda, where he would fetch better prices, because the capital city had its own ‘bizneiros’, or business people: these diamond buyers ‘will bite you, those mwangole [Angolans] are the thieves, they’ll put you in jail if kamanga “flies”’, a common assertion in a business where motion-inspired terminology (i.e. ‘bird-stones’ or ‘passport-stones’) replicate the back and forth movement of undesirable stones, sent back after a devalued assessment.</p>
<p>Tony recalls with high regard one particular diamond buyer, the ‘son of British millionaires’ with a Portuguese-sounding and kin-inspired name, ‘Pais’ [lit. parents]. Pais arrived from Luanda and unilaterally raised the price of carat offered locally. This brought swarms of sellers to his house ‘lined up like in school’ until all other kamanguistas came together, ‘paid the police, paid FAA [Angolan Armed Forces], paid other guys and kicked Pais out’, further evidence of how the line between legality and illegality, state legitimacy and the authority of diamond buyers, often blend and subvert each other. As he was expelled from the mining town, Tony explains, Pais leaves for neighboring Congo, ‘pauses’ on the border and gains Belgian citizenship. Upon returning to Cafunfo, ‘they all see his name is different now. Who’s going to mess with him now?</p>
<p>Not unlike the uncertain nationality of Juca’s boss, ‘Pais’ was emblematic for Tony of how kamanguistas circulate with ease, smuggling across borders with ambiguous citizenship status and extending the quality of secure/insecure by the elusiveness of border-crossing (in and out of production sites). Back in his Cuango days of digging, Tony was the ‘agitator of everything’, ‘the very master who sponsors, the gentleman who finds maka [problem], the agitator! I was the very own agitator, but armed!’ He explained what he meant by agitator:<disp-quote>
<p>The agitator of everything.… Agitates work, agitates confusion, agitates war, fosters all things; projectile comes out, death comes out, shot goes out, some jump in the water, puncture buoys, everything, it’s everything.</p></disp-quote>In his description, an all-encompassing and productive agitation resonates with the movement of diamond extraction itself. Tony’s references to buoys and water, things that fall and are taken away, back and forth, in and out, bear striking resemblance to the motion of diamond panning. Consider the following, which was where Tony picked up his narrative to explain how control over theft was exerted in UNITA’s diamond fields:<disp-quote>
<p>You’re washing [gravel], tshq-thsq-tshq; if you stop you got to show diamond right away. ‘No, it’s because I’m tired’, ‘Ah, so, you stopped ‘cause you’re tired. That’s a lie, you hid it away’. He doesn’t care; you stopped, you have to give the diamond. That’s the problem about diamonds: when you suspect the other guy stole, everyone who is hearing you say the other one stole, then you stole for sure. And you even had nothing… Just because you touched [‘mexeu’] there is suspicion of money already.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Diamonds, in other words, exhibit qualisigns of agitation and movement, indexically contiguous with in/visibility. According to the abstract qualities of speed and slowness, diamonds orient and calibrate social interactions along a continuum of the qualia of agitation and containment, mobility and immobility, withdrawal and materialization. As Tony’s description of the labor of extraction makes clear, immobility – the discreet body possibly used as caching device – as negation of agitation could also represent a potential breach to security and a negative transformation of value. The digger’s pause, intended or not, is immediately inferred as distraction, a loss of control in how diamonds circulate and an experience in the negative transformation of value: the body’s slowness did not produce the visible materiality of diamonds but only a suspicion of its hiddenness.</p>
<p>The suspicion of theft – simply ‘because you touched’ even though one ‘had nothing’ – led to unfathomable episodes of violence: over an accusation of stealing, Tony saw a digger have his arm cut off with a machete; a soldier ‘complicating’ the crossing of a river had his eye poked with an iron ‘in plain daylight’. These forms of violence are recast as responses to obstacles to movement, both of people and commodities. In most contemporary mining sites, partly per the nature of the commodity and the historical circumstances of highly-secured mineral extraction, security and control become a qualitative experience intimately inhabited and collectively shared. While diggers and security forces collide frequently along the lines of mining concessions, in confrontations that often result from the exercise of territorial surveillance and disputes over the control of access to these areas, bodies are more broadly registered in Tony’s account as sites for the production of value, talked about locally as aspects of ‘agitation’. This embodied state can have both positive and negative valences, namely in relation to the control or loss of control exerted by kamanguistas over the movement, ownership, and disappearance of diamond stones. Not unlike Gawan gardens, where containments and limits to mobility set the condition for circulation and spatiotemporal expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1463499613483404">Munn 1986</xref>), here it would seem that bodily constraints and expansions are associated with diamond stones and the appropriate means of touching and moving them around to the actual moment of exchange.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1463499613483404"><title>IV ‘Fingermen’, ‘feelers’ and the control over transport of diamond stones</title>
<p>In this final section, I follow two competing trajectories of diamond trafficking at different points in the in/visible movement of the smuggling body. The first pertains directly to the historical smuggling of rough stones out of Angola into Europe; the second deals with a spurt of violence afflicting diamond salesmen in the United States in the late 1960s and the contained panic it generated. Insinuating the transporter of rough stones in the experience of security and control over diamond theft, qualisigns of agitation and swiftness of mobility deem what is secure from the insecure, lawful from unlawful, and bring together otherwise unbridgeable moments in the experience of dealing with diamonds (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1463499613483404">Munn 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1463499613483404">Keane 2003</xref>: 415).</p>
<p>Colonial vigilance over diamond trafficking and illicit trading traverses over 50 years of investigative updates, informants’ reports and the observation of potential suspects. The close monitoring and control over the movement of goods and national and foreign citizens (in ports, airports, and across the region), alongside rather speculative accounts over the dissimulating powers of the body, were at the crux of this security apparatus. It follows that the repression of unlawful and illicit diamond trafficking was predicated on the control over the body and forms of bodily agitation. Other than thorough inspections of workers, with a strong emphasis on sexual parts, colonial authorities employed ‘feelers’ [‘apalpadeira’], women that would literally feel and search for hidden diamonds in boat and plane passengers upon departure from Luanda or arrival in Lisbon, at once the most common and least effective technique for preventing diamond smuggling. Moreover, fines were routinely imposed in mining areas for African workers ‘causing confusion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1463499613483404">Cleveland 2008</xref>: 226) and, in fact, intertwined concerns about the body and agitation culminate 50 years of colonial security, when ‘Marxist terrorists’ get mixed-up with tricks on how to expose diamonds cached in the body. Such is clear from the following passage of a 1965 document on ‘Illicit Diamond Trading’: ‘Terrorists with Marxist characteristics, acting in the Province [Angola] seem to want to take advantage of Illicit Diamond Trading to finance their criminal intentions. There are plenty of tricks used by diamond traffickers. We cite a few: 1 – placement of stones in women’s sex; 2 – placement of stones in the anus; 3 – swallowing of stones; 4 – in several objects: tooth paste, tool box, hem of blankets, etc, etc.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1463499613483404">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The trajectory of David Graubart is suggestive of this twofold control over bodies and diamonds. Graubart was an established diamond merchant, like his brother Jacques and cousin Walter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1463499613483404">Bloomberg 2006</xref>). Born in Poland to a family of a prominent Hasidic rabbi, David Graubart was a dealer in the oldest bourse of the world, the restricted club of Antwerp, with official residence in three continents and a litigious relation with official authorities and law enforcements in as many places.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1463499613483404">17</xref></sup> Graubart visited Angola for the first time in the 1960s, where he ‘established contacts in Luanda with individuals interested in illicit trafficking of diamonds, uncut and unpolished, that he would receive in Lisbon or abroad’. In 1971 he was detained by the Portuguese secret police in his hotel room in Portugal with thousands of diamond stones in his possession. Upon his transfer to Luanda, the authorities were particularly apprehensive about Graubart’s criminal links, a concern upheld by the fate of his cousin Walter, to which I return ahead, and his potential deployment of elusive financial resources which would enable him to bribe his way out of prison or set him up for early deportation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1463499613483404">18</xref></sup> David Graubart’s arrest in Angola lends evidence to the idea, explicitly supported by the security archive of the colonial diamond company, that diamond trading was entangled with conspiracies most commonly related to subversive ‘political agitation’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1463499613483404">19</xref></sup> In tandem with fear of Mafia killings, smuggling bodies are at the center of the anxieties and widespread distress that agents and secret informants for the colonial company in Angola expressed about being poisoned or physically threatened. Nowhere is this fear more evident than in the event of death, as clearly revealed by his cousin Walter’s fate.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, Walter Graubart was a diamond salesman, traveling from city to city in the United Sates to visit buyers and trade in diamonds. In order to ‘evade what dealers call fingermen’, salesmen like Walter dissimulated their whereabouts and covered their tracks by faking hotel registrations, concealing destinations, mailing diamonds ahead, or alternating between different means of transportation. In 1968, Walter was found dead in a room of the Chicago Hilton Hotel, victim of a mysterious assault. Not unlike the other dealers found murdered that same year in an airport parking lot and bus terminal, his bruised body was evidence of what some perceived as a Mafia hit. More significantly, his unsolved killing raised fears among diamond merchants that a ‘syndicate’ or ‘insider’ was operating in diamond circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1463499613483404">Collier 1968</xref>).</p>
<p>These crimes, like the tireless attempts of colonial authorities to seize and control stolen diamonds, are contradictorily framed in terms of elusiveness and tangibility: first and foremost, the visible traces of cash and loose diamonds left behind and found next to Walter’s body ‘puzzled’ the police, rather than the missing diamonds from the robbery. Moreover, the public nature of these crimes stood in contrast to the subtle techniques and trading secrets used by diamond dealers. Finally, while smuggling swiftly circumvented the rigidity of law and security, the gagged bodies of smugglers in sites of transient mobility were the negation of movement in the qualitative experience of illicit and excessive wealth accumulation.</p>
<p>Similarly in Angola with episodes of criminality amongst diggers. Most frequently, these events deal with rapidly vanishing stones and disputed gravel waiting to be washed. In a revealing passage as told by a former ‘transporter’ who was often responsible for carrying rough stones from the extraction site to the kamanguista for whom he worked, the bandits of the ‘tchibulo’, with the equally suggestive name of <italic>Armée Rouge</italic>, ‘would come there at night and take [the gravel] to their zone. They would not dig, no; they would only transport: if you didn’t catch them, it’s washed already, it’s gone.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1463499613483404" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The sets of opposing qualities between clarity and visibility, on one hand, and invisibility and hiddenness, on the other, frame the qualitative experience of diamond security and control over theft in the actual processes of carrying and trading these stones through practices articulated by transporters, agitators, and kamanguistas. In the political economy of in/visibility and in opposition to murky and obscure forms of wealth accumulation, diamonds can entice public manifestations of hospitality and exuberant gestures of generosity from small traders or kamanguistas in order to consolidate their public image and improve their ability to acquire and attract the best stones. This allure of wealth – of diamonds’ tangible value – is also reproduced in contemporary diamond economies through ‘the organization of a particular state of security, totalitarian and hyper-repressive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1463499613483404">Misser and Vallée 1997</xref>: 91). Displacing the analysis away from the techniques and instruments of control and surveillance, a cultural valuation of networks of diamond circulation is rendered visible through the qualitative experience of diamonds’ regime of security, control, and unlawfulness.</p>
<p>The body of the actors here examined and the in/visible materiality of commodities, in sum, would come to stand for the abstract potentiality of agitation and elusiveness of movement. Qualisigns of diamond transport are effectively realigned in the aftermath of instances of public visibility and forced immobility, validating the risks and potentialities for which diamond communities are renowned. The relative swiftness with which dealers and transporters are capable of crossing borders and circulate, or not, makes it apparent how these bodies participate in a suggestive relation with the quality of clarity in diamonds – neither noticeable nor entirely detectable. In indexical contiguity with the qualities of trading diamonds, these forms of bodily movement become an icon of positive transformations of value in the process of producing and circulating these stones.</p>

<fn id="fn6-1463499613483404"><label>6</label><p>It is common to describe the product of diamond digging as ‘fruit’ [<italic>fruto</italic>] inasmuch as the total sum of diamonds bought by a kamanguista in a given period is known as a ‘crop’ [<italic>colheita</italic>]. The uneasy relation of informal diggers and dealers with a corporate regime of extraction, seemingly excluded from state-sanctioned corporate mining while still embodying the tensions produced out of and carried from the experience of these objects, would be prone to the invocation of the anthropological problem of gifts and commodities, the latter tied to global commodity networks and industrial exploration and the former to local monetized gift economies and artisanal extraction. While recent academic work has favored analytically collapsing these two modes of exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1463499613483404">Appadurai 1986</xref>; Parry and Bloch 1990; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1463499613483404">Austen 1993</xref>: 96), I seek to follow Marcel Mauss’s concluding remarks in <italic>The Gift</italic>, that people’s ‘firm determination to follow the thing they have produced’ generates a ‘strong feeling’ when they are left out of ‘the thing that is sold’. In other words, when the legal regulation of modern economic activity is at odds with the ‘morality’ of the ‘old principles [of gift relations]’, Mauss explains, there is a growing resentment ‘against the rigour, abstraction, and inhumanity of our [i.e. commodity-inflected] legal codes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1463499613483404">Mauss 1990</xref>: 66).</p></fn>

<fn id="fn8-1463499613483404"><label>8</label><p>This is a simple version of what are far more complex processes, and erosion affects diamonds differently.

<fn id="fn9-1463499613483404"><label>9</label><p>Although the diamond industry avoids an antonym for clarity, purposefully left uncoded to prevent the assumption that a diamond could somehow be ‘impure’ or ‘polluted’, internal occlusions come to stand rhetorically for the ‘dirtiness’ of natural traces, pressed upon by the ‘fingerprints and “hallmarks” of [nature’s] genuineness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1463499613483404">Bruton 1971</xref>: 133).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn10-1463499613483404"><label>10</label><p>Historically, diamonds have been mined and traded under a cloud of secrecy. Particularly since the 19th-century, when the revolutionary booty from the French crown was dispersed across Europe, diamonds have been commonly perceived by their elusive materiality and the artful ways they could disappear or reappear, uphold debt and life (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1463499613483404">Kurin 2007</xref>). This genealogy of unclear legality and dubious criminal connections became in some regards the mirror-image of contemporary business practices that until very recently found their moral ground in elaborate rituals of secrecy and exclusivity.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn11-1463499613483404"><label>11</label><p>For example, fancy stones are showcased in highly-anticipated social events or directly pitched to public figures. <italic>Blood Diamond</italic> (2006), a recent Hollywood depiction of diamonds in Africa, is particularly keen to reveal this tension of (in)visibility. Off-screen, the film helped garner support for the adoption of the Kimberley Certification Scheme protocol (2003), adding momentum to growing concerns over transparency in the industry. More pragmatically, the film portrays the attempts of an unscrupulous fortune seeker to get his hands on a fancy pink diamond. This stone seemed to be ‘cleansed’ of its moral impurities when it finally moved to a ‘legitimate’ market. Demonstrating how value can be implicated in invisibility, this diamond ends up locked away in an anonymous safe, hidden from public scrutiny. Somewhat ironically, at the point when the corporate and state actors of the diamond industry championed the Kimberley Protocol and the cause of a ‘clean’, ‘transparent’ and ‘accountable’ diamond business, it became clear that a certification scheme would not prevent untraceable paths of circulation or remove any uncertainty regarding diamonds’ origins.</p></fn>

<bio>
<p><bold>Filipe Calvão</bold>'s research focuses on the intersection between nature, culture, and capital in postcolonial Africa. His dissertation examines Angola's diamond economy to detail how processes of labor, commoditization, and sociality challenge or reinforce contemporary imaginings of corporate governance, state sovereignty, and the political economy and ecology of mineral extraction. Filipe received his BA in History (2002) from the New University of Lisbon, an M.A. from the University of Chicago (2006), and is expected to defend his doctoral dissertation in May 2013.</p></bio>
