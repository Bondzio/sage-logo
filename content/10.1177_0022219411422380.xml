<abstract>
<p>This study examined the effectiveness of a number sense program on kindergarten students’ number proficiency and responsiveness to treatment as a function of students’ risk for mathematics difficulties. The program targeted development of relationships among numbers (e.g., spatial, more and less). A total of 101 kindergarten students (not at risk: 22 control and 36 experimental; at risk: 18 and 25) from five classrooms in a high-poverty elementary school participated in the study. Using a quasi-experimental design, classrooms were randomly assigned to either the intervention (number sense instruction, NSI) or control condition. Results indicated significant differences favoring the treatment students on all measures of number sense (e.g., spatial relationships, more and less relationships, benchmarks of five and ten, nonverbal calculations) at posttest and on a 3-week retention test. Furthermore, the effects were not mediated by at-risk status, suggesting that NSI may benefit a wide range of students. Implications in terms of preventing early mathematical learning difficulties are discussed.</p>

<p>Students with good number sense develop a quantitative intuition that helps them to solve problems in a flexible manner. They understand that numbers are representative of objects, magnitudes, relationships, and other attributes and are aware that numbers can be operated on, compared, and used for communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022219411422380">Markovits &amp; Sowder, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022219411422380">National Council of Teachers for Mathematics [NCTM], 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219411422380">National Research Council, 2001</xref>). In contrast, children with poor number sense have difficulties in discriminating between quantities and are at risk for later failure in mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022219411422380">Berch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411422380">Gersten &amp; Chard, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The pioneering work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022219411422380">Dehaene (1997)</xref> suggests that well before the development of formal symbols, children acquire prenumber experiences informally through interactions with parents and siblings before they enter kindergarten. That is, they develop some sense about numbers even before they learn to count. Later, children are able to reliably count and represent small numbers and use that knowledge to make quantity estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022219411422380">Gelman &amp; Gallistel, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219411422380">Griffin &amp; Case, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, there is evidence that “early verbal number competencies are necessary for extending knowledge with small numbers to knowledge with larger numbers and for learning school-based mathematics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411422380">Jordan, Glutting, &amp; Ramineni, 2010</xref>, p. 83). The prenumber abilities form the basis for the development of symbolic number sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219411422380">Feigenson, Dehaene, &amp; Spelke, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Early number proficiency includes the ability to subitize small quantities, discern number patterns, compare numerical magnitudes and estimate quantities, count, and perform simple number transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022219411422380">Berch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022219411422380">Case, 1998</xref>). Many children’s learning difficulties in mathematics have been explained by problems related to counting, number comparisons, and set transformations (Geary, 1990; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219411422380">Mazzocco &amp; Thompson, 2005</xref>). The work of Jordan and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219411422380">Jordan, Huttenlocher, &amp; Levine, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022219411422380">Jordan, Kaplan, Ramineni, &amp; Locuniak, 2008</xref>) indicates that these number competencies “are highly sensitive to socioeconomic status, suggesting the importance of early input and instruction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411422380">Jordan et al., 2010</xref>, p. 82). Specifically, children from low-income households do not perform as well as their middle-income peers on verbal number combinations and story problems involving addition and subtraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219411422380">Jordan et al., 1994</xref>). Furthermore, their use of counting strategies is less adaptive in that they do not avail of their fingers to count on from addends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219411422380">Jordan et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although typical instruction in mathematics familiarizes students with procedures that emphasize mastery of algorithms and repeated practice of routine procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411422380">Gersten &amp; Chard, 1999</xref>), providing a strong conceptual base for number sense using realistic activities can support children’s learning and prevent later difficulties in mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022219411422380">Berch, &amp; Mazzocco, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022219411422380">Gersten, Jordan, &amp; Flojo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022219411422380">NCTM, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022219411422380">Yang, 2006</xref>). Early intervention is even more critical for children from low-income families, who are at risk for later failure in mathematics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022219411422380">Bowman, Donovan, &amp; Burns, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022219411422380">Denton &amp; West, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411422380">Ginsburg &amp; Pappas, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411422380">Mullis et al., 2000</xref>). Research indicates that providing these students, who are less likely to be supported in learning mathematics both in the home and school environments compared to their peers from middle- and high-income families, with systematic and purposeful activities, can alleviate their lack of experiences and lead to improved mathematics achievement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219411422380">Griffin &amp; Case, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022219411422380">Klein &amp; Starkey, 2004</xref>). Clearly, “theoretically grounded and empirically grounded curriculum-based interventions in early childhood may constitute an efficacious and cost-effective route to raising achievement in low-resource communities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022219411422380">Clements, Sarama, Spitler, Lange, &amp; Wolfe, 2011</xref>, pp. 128–129). Given that foundations for mathematics learning are established early (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219411422380">Clements &amp; Sarama, 2008</xref>), we designed early mathematics instruction to support children acquiring critical number competencies before first grade, “which can serve as a ladder for learning mathematics in school” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411422380">Jordan et al., 2010</xref>, p. 82). Furthermore, early intervention potentially can reduce inappropriate referrals to and placement of students into special education because of inadequate or poor instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022219411422380">Berch &amp; Mazzocco, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022219411422380">Gersten, Jordan, &amp; Flojo, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>One approach that is deemed to improve overall student learning in mathematics is the use of a multitiered instructional support system called the response to intervention (RTI) model. Tier I of RTI consists of providing high-quality, effective instruction for students in general education classrooms. Tier II includes additional instruction for those students who demonstrate difficulties with the core Tier 1 program; and Tier III represents intensive individualized instruction for students who do not benefit from Tier II instruction. The majority of studies of RTI in mathematics have focused on Tier II interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022219411422380">Newman-Gonchar, Clarke, &amp; Gersten, 2009</xref>). Given the importance of early intervention to establish successful learning trajectories, our number sense instructional program was designed to provide Tier I support to a wide range of learners by integrating instructional practices found to be effective for at-risk students in mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022219411422380">Clarke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022219411422380">Gersten et al., 2009</xref>) with critical number sense content (i.e., number relationships) that is fundamental to understanding numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022219411422380">Common Core State Standards, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411422380">National Mathematics Advisory Panel [NMAP], 2008</xref>). In the present study, we compared the effects of a number sense intervention to those of a control condition using a school-provided standards-based curriculum on the mathematics learning of kindergarten students, including students at risk for mathematics difficulties (MD), in a high-poverty school.</p>
<sec id="section1-0022219411422380">
<title>Standards-Based Mathematics Instruction</title>
<p>In recent years, we have seen an increasing number of districtwide adoptions of standards-based mathematics curricula that shifted emphasis from rote memorization of basic facts to more ambitious forms of learning such as thinking, reasoning, and problem solving that are integral to developing conceptual understanding and mathematical proficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411422380">Chatterji, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219411422380">National Research Council, 2001</xref>). Standards-based curricula emphasize active student engagement, with a focus on problem solving and connections to real-life contexts and include frequent group work and use of mathematical tools (e.g., manipulatives; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022219411422380">Tarr, Reys, Reys, &amp; Chavez, 2008</xref>). The goal of standards-based instruction is for students to generate ideas and discuss various approaches to solve the problem. However, such approaches may not be optimal for students who lack foundational mathematical knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022219411422380">Kroesbergen, Van Luit, &amp; Maas, 2004</xref>). Consequently, researchers have identified ways to integrate research-based practices from special education (e.g., systematic and explicit instruction) with standards-based mathematics to support mathematics learning of at-risk students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219411422380">Hudson, Miller, &amp; Butler, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022219411422380">Sayeski &amp; Paulsen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022219411422380">Scheuermann, Deshler, &amp; Schumaker, 2009</xref>). These practices have focused on providing instructional supports, including content (e.g., teaching backup algorithms) support and pedagogical (e.g., explicit instruction, concrete-representation-abstract sequence, instructional grouping) support, to develop understanding of foundational skills and higher-level concepts.</p>

<title>Number Sense Interventions</title>
<p>Over the past decade and a half, number sense interventions for students who struggle in mathematics have focused on a wide range of areas. Some studies focused exclusively on one area such as developing understanding of computational skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411422380">Funkhouser, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022219411422380">Markovits &amp; Sowder, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022219411422380">1994</xref>); other studies stressed several areas of number sense, including number sequence, number concepts, one-to-one correspondence, cardinality, magnitude of numbers, and benchmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219411422380">Arnold, Fisher, Doctoroff, &amp; Dobbs, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022219411422380">Aunio, Hautamaki, &amp; Van Luit, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022219411422380">Griffin, Case, &amp; Capodilupo, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411422380">Griffin, Case, &amp; Siegler, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022219411422380">Yang, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022219411422380">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0022219411422380">Yang, Hsu, &amp; Huang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0022219411422380">Yang &amp; Li, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0022219411422380">Yang &amp; Wu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022219411422380">Young-Loveridge, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Early studies of number sense conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022219411422380">Markovits and Sowder (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022219411422380">1994</xref>) with upper elementary and middle school students suggested that nonstandard strategies (e.g., 24 × 25 can be written as 20 × 25 = 500 and 4 × 25 = 100; so, 500 + 100 = 600) and reformulation of numbers in the problem (e.g., 86 − 38 is reformulated as 88 − 40) not only are effective in improving student computational skill learning (i.e., an increase in the proportion of correct answers) but also are efficient in that the time taken to solve computational problems is reduced. It has been argued that such strategies are crucial in helping students retain an understanding of the learned skills. Although these two descriptive studies suggest that the above strategies are promising, the efficacy of number sense instruction to affect number proficiency is not known given the methodological issues such as lack of a control group and small sample sizes. At the same time, several small-scale experimental studies of number sense situated learning conducted by Yang and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022219411422380">Yang, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0022219411422380">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0022219411422380">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0022219411422380">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0022219411422380">Yang &amp; Li, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0022219411422380">Yang &amp; Wu, 2010</xref>) with primary and upper elementary Taiwanese students (i.e., third, fifth, and sixth grades) showed that number sense can be enhanced by establishing a classroom environment that encourages communication, exploration, discussion, thinking, and reasoning.</p>
<p>Other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219411422380">Arnold et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411422380">Funkhouser, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411422380">Griffin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022219411422380">Young-Loveridge, 2004</xref>) of number sense with preschool and kindergarten children, including children from low-income families, showed that development of number sense enhanced children’s number proficiency (e.g., counting, recognizing and writing numbers, one-to-one correspondence, cardinality, comparison, understanding numbers and quantity, and addition and subtraction computation). For example, Griffin and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411422380">Griffin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022219411422380">Griffin et al., 1997</xref>) conducted a series of seven experimental studies that investigated the effectiveness of their number sense program, Rightstart, on kindergarten children’s understanding of addition and subtraction. Results indicated that students who completed the Rightstart program showed significant gains in number sense compared to students in the control groups, with 80% of the students in one of the studies performing at the first grade level. These studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411422380">Griffin and colleagues (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411422380">1997)</xref>, which were more rigorous methodologically and focused on kindergarten students at risk for mathematics failure, collectively demonstrated the importance of conceptually based readiness training programs, especially for children from a wide variety of socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022219411422380">Griffin et al., 1997</xref>). However, the existing research base is limited in answering questions about the efficacy of combining number sense situated learning and explicit, systematic strategies for children from low-income households, who are at risk for later MD. As such, we designed the number sense intervention program to support student learning by incorporating three research-based instructional practices—explicit and systematic instruction in teaching number relationships, opportunities for student response and feedback, and making connections to the real world using relevant tasks—from special education and general education research literatures to teach number sense, particularly number relationships.</p>
<p>The aim of explicit, systematic instruction is to promote new and difficult learning, and it is known to improve outcomes related to both basic skills and higher-level concepts for students at risk for MD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022219411422380">Baker, Gersten, &amp; Lee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022219411422380">Gersten et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022219411422380">Kroesbergen et al., 2004</xref>). Explicit instruction refers to highly structured teaching of the steps or processes needed for concept development, strategy application, and/or task completion. During the demonstration-prompt-practice sequence of the teaching routine, the teacher uses think-alouds and facilitative questioning (e.g., when using a bar of 3 yellow unifix cubes to represent the quantity 3, the teacher asks students to check how many more cubes will be needed to make 5 to determine the missing part when the whole and one part are given) to elucidate the steps or process that may pose problems for at risk students. Systematic instruction refers to chunking complex skills into manageable units as well as sequencing tasks from easy to more difficult and providing scaffolding to control for the difficulty level. Instruction in number sense intervention is scaffolded, with teachers presenting new concepts using a concrete-representational-abstract sequence that is known to develop student understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022219411422380">Witzel, Mercer, &amp; Miller, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The second instructional practice offers many opportunities for student response or practice during instruction. For example, the number sense intervention program provides students with frequent opportunities to talk about key math vocabulary (e.g., less, more, same, part-part whole) as well as has students predict (what next) and justify their answer. This practice is important because it not only allows the teacher to monitor student understanding but also enhances mathematical metacognition by requiring students to both express their own thinking and listen to the ideas of their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022219411422380">Greenes, Ginsburg, &amp; Balfanz, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, instructive feedback provided during practice can support students in refining and accelerating their learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022219411422380">Hattie &amp; Timperley, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The third instructional practice refers to extending student awareness of numbers in the real world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411422380">NMAP, 2008</xref>). Teacher-led explanations in number sense intervention focus on building connections to the real world and assist students in situating the knowledge of mathematics with other learned concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022219411422380">Van de Walle, Karp, &amp; Bay-Williams, 2010</xref>). The number sense intervention program uses activities and stories from children’s literature, for example, to explore and discuss key mathematical ideas. This practice of connecting mathematics to the real world can help students make sense of the numbers around them in a meaningful way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411422380">Faulkner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022219411422380">Sarama, Clements, &amp; Swaminathan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022219411422380">Van de Walle et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Purpose of the Study</title>
<p>Given the importance of number sense, the need for early intervention to develop young children’s mathematical understanding, and the limited research base relative to number sense instructional programs, there is need for further research examining the efficacy of number sense intervention in the early grades (i.e., kindergarten). The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the impact of early number sense instruction (described in the Procedures section) that focused on development of relationships among numbers in a high-poverty school of low-achieving students. We addressed the following research questions: What are the effects of a number sense intervention on the number-sense-related outcomes of kindergarten students, including students at risk for MD? What are the effects of number sense intervention on the retention of number-sense-related outcomes 3 weeks following the end of intervention for kindergarten students, including students at risk? We hypothesized that instruction in number sense that combined validated instructional practices (e.g., systematic and explicit instruction) with standards-based mathematics (inquiry and active exploration) would lead to improved mathematics learning of kindergarten students when compared to a control condition that emphasized an inquiry-based instructional approach.</p>

<title>School and Participants</title>
<p>The study was conducted in a suburban elementary school in the northeastern United States. Kindergartners from all five classrooms in the school participated in the study. The school served more than 500 students in Grades K–4. The student population in the school was primarily Caucasian (41%) and African American (36%), with a relatively high percentage of students living in poverty as measured by the rate (60%) of students qualifying for reduced-cost or free lunch. Based on reading proficiency (45.6%) scores and math proficiency (64.8%) scores, the school was rated below average by the state education agency.</p>
<p>All students in the five classrooms participated in the study. We randomly assigned these classrooms to one of two conditions: number sense instruction (NSI) and control. The random assignment resulted in three NSI (<italic>n</italic> = 64) classrooms and two control (<italic>n</italic> = 43) classrooms. The final sample included 101 students because 3 students did not receive parental consent and 3 students were dropped from the analysis because of transfer or withdrawal from school. The mean age of the sample was 66.36 months (range = 56 to 80 months, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.11). The sample was 37% Caucasian, 41% African American, 20% Hispanic, and 3% Asian American. Approximately 58% of the sample received free or reduced-price lunch, 5% were English language learners, and 3% were students with disabilities. We used the 40th percentile score on the Mathematics subtest of the <italic>Stanford Early School Achievement Test 1</italic> (SESAT 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411422380">Harcourt Brace Educational Measurement, 2003</xref>) as the cutoff to classify the sample as not at risk for MD or at risk for MD. This cut score has been used to screen at-risk learners and evaluate core curricular programs in early reading or mathematics research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022219411422380">Clarke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022219411422380">Kaminski, Cummings, Powell-Smith, &amp; Good, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022219411422380">Table 1</xref> provides student demographic data by condition and at-risk status.</p>

<p>This measure had students orally count on from an addend (i.e., 3 and 5), with a maximum of 5 correct in a sequence (e.g., 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), and was untimed. Students were stopped when they reached the fifth correct number in a sequence. When students counted out of sequence, the last number in the sequence stated correctly was recorded as correct. Missed numbers or numbers not stated in the correct sequence were scored as incorrect. Students were allowed to continue counting even if errors occurred in the sequence.

<title>Number sense—Number relationships</title>
<p>Early number sense in terms of number relationships was the primary area targeted in the study and was assessed using the following four measures: (a) spatial relationships, (b) more and less relationships, (c) five and ten benchmarks, and (d) nonverbal calculation, which were untimed. Items for these measures were designed by the first author and based on number-sense-related studies and other published assessments and mathematics textbooks. The same battery of measures were administered at pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest (3 weeks after termination of the intervention).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0022219411422380">
<title>Spatial relationships</title>
<p>This test consisted of 10 items and assessed students’ ability to recognize dot patterns for numbers 1 through 10. Instant recognition (i.e., subitizing) of amounts “without the routine of counting can then aid in ‘counting on’ (from a known patterned set) or learning combinations of numbers (seeing a pattern of two known smaller patterns)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022219411422380">Van de Walle et al., 2010</xref>, p. 130). The examiner presented dot cards in rapid succession, displaying each card for 3 s, and recorded student responses. When students did not respond within 3 s, the next dot card was presented. Each correctly identified pattern received 1 point, and no points were awarded for failure to identify or incorrectly identifying the pattern. No corrective feedback was provided for an incorrect response. Scores ranged from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 10. Cronbach’s alpha based on this sample was .74 at pretest, .70 at posttest, and .55 at delayed posttest.</p>

<sec id="section15-0022219411422380">
<title>More and less relationships</title>
<p>This 20-item test required students to state the number that is one more, one less, two more, or two less than the target number (i.e., 1 through 10). Numbers that were skipped or not correctly identified were recorded as incorrect. Each correctly identified number was given 1 point, and no points were given when students failed to respond. Scores ranged from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 20. Cronbach’s alpha was .93 at pretest, .97 at posttest, and .96 at delayed posttest.</p>

<title>Five and ten benchmarks</title>
<p>This test composed six items; three items each for the five-number and ten-number benchmarks. First, students had to identify the number quantity shown on a five-frame or a ten-frame. Second, they were required to use counters to represent the target number (e.g., 2) on the five-frame or ten-frame. Finally, students had to determine how many more counters would be needed to make five or ten when presented with a five- or ten-frame. Numbers that were skipped or not correctly identified were marked as incorrect. Each item could receive a total of three possible points, one each for correct identification, representation, and counting. No points were assigned when students did not respond or stated the incorrect answer. Scores ranged from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 18 points. Cronbach’s alpha was .79 at pretest, .89 at posttest, and .85 at delayed posttest.</p>

<p>The nonverbal calculation task was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022219411422380">Jordan, Kaplan, Olah, and Locuniak (2006)</xref>. This eight-item test assessed student understanding of part-part-whole relationships. Students solved four addition (e.g., 3 + 2; 5 + 2) and four subtraction (e.g., 2 − l; 5 − 3) problems using counters. For addition problems, the examiner placed a specific number of counters on the mat and asked students to identify the number of counters. The examiner then added some more counters to the same set and asked students to state the total number of counters in the set. For subtraction problems, the examiner placed counters on a mat and had students identify the number. Next, the examiner removed some counters from the set and asked students to indicate how many counters were left. For both, addition and subtraction problems, students could answer by saying the number word or showing the number of counters. Items were scored as correct if students displayed the appropriate number of counters and/or stated the correct number word. Each item could receive a possible score of 2 points, one each for identifying the original amount and 1 point for the correct answer. No points were assigned for not responding or stating the incorrect answer. Scores ranged from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 16. Cronbach’s alpha was .86 at pretest, .85 at posttest, and .66 at delayed posttest.</p>

<p>Teachers attended a 2-hr small group instructional session conducted by the first author to familiarize teachers with the NSI program that was developed by the authors specifically for this study and is unpublished. This session, which occurred prior to implementation of the treatment, described the overall instructional goals and reviewed lessons in the program. The session was used primarily to demonstrate step by step how to implement the number sense program. Specifically, the session focused on the instructional content by having teachers review the teaching scripts as they were modeled and discussed by the first author.

The program focused on developing kindergarten number proficiency using a variety of representations (e.g., dot cards, counters, cubes, five- and ten-frames) and instructional activities that integrated numbers and quantities into real situations. The activities described below were designed to align with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411422380">NMAP (2008)</xref> findings on the importance of developing high-quality learning activities to facilitate an early start in learning mathematics for children aged 3 to 6. Recommendations to develop high-quality learning activities, for example, included ensuring that the curriculum is coherent and emphasizes relationships and sequences of important mathematical ideas, using teaching practices that engage children in problem-solving processes (problem solving, reasoning, representing, communicating, and connecting mathematical ideas), providing children with a range of relevant experiences and using appropriate teaching strategies to develop mathematical concepts and language, encouraging deep and sustained interaction with central mathematical ideas, integrating mathematics with other activities, and providing sufficient time and support to engage children in exploring mathematical ideas.</p>

<title>Spatial relationships</title>
<p>The objective of this unit was to develop the ability to recognize sets of objects in patterned arrangements and specify how many there are without counting. The first two lessons in the unit introduced dot patterns for the numbers 1 through 10. During these lessons, the teacher displayed each dot card for 3 s and required students to identify the number and describe the displayed pattern. For example, if the displayed dot pattern represented the number 2, students first stated the number 2 and then described the pattern in terms of the placement of the dots. In Lessons 3 and 4, students were presented with two number patterns–quantities. They learned how to combine the smaller patterns–quantities to form one big number pattern–quantity. Next, students were shown two dot cards, each of which was displayed for 3 s and asked to identify the number of dots on them. Students then learned to combine the two smaller numbers to form a bigger pattern. For example, students recognized number patterns–quantities and combined two smaller patterns (e.g., <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022219411422380-img1.tif"/> and <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022219411422380-img2.tif"/>) to form a big number pattern–quantity (e.g., <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022219411422380-img3.tif"/>). The final lesson included a review of the previous lessons’ content (i.e., recognizing number patterns–quantities and combining two smaller patterns to form a big number pattern–quantity).</p>

<title>One more, one less, two more, and two less</title>
<p>This unit extended beyond the ability to count to emphasize the basic relations (i.e., <italic>more, less, same</italic>) between numbers. The activities focused on understanding that all numbers are related to one another in a variety of ways. For example, 8 is 1 more than 7 or is 2 less than 10 demonstrated how numbers are related to one another. The first lesson introduced the concept of “one more” by having students recognize the displayed dot pattern and use counters to show a pattern that is one more than the presented pattern. Next, students compared the two patterns to see how the two numbers were related. This lesson also had students listen to stories and draw the number pattern or write the number word to answer “one more than” questions. For example, the teacher read the following story: “The dinosaur laid 5 eggs. Then the dinosaur laid one more egg. How many eggs are there now?” The students had to answer the question by either drawing six eggs or writing the number word <italic>six</italic>. The lesson ended with the teacher reading the book <italic>Ten Black Dots</italic> by Donald Crews. As the teacher read the book, students were asked to predict the number of dots on the next page.</p>
<p>Lesson 2 introduced “two more than,” with students identifying a dot pattern–quantity and using counters to display the number that is two more than the presented number. For example, 7 is 2 more than 5. Next, students worked on “two more than” stories and played a predicting game, in which they learned how to make the calculator a “Two-More-Than-Machine.” Lessons 3 and 4 focused on “one less and two less than” and followed the same sequence of activities as Lessons 1 and 2. In Lesson 3, students read the book <italic>Ten, Nine, Eight</italic> by Molly Bang. In Lesson 4, they made their calculators a “Two-Less-Than Machine” to play the prediction game. Lesson 5 reviewed all four concepts of “one more, one less, two more, and two less than.” The activity, for example, had students help their teacher complete the story about Floppy the rabbit and his walk through the donut forest. Initially, the teacher modeled the story and then gradually had students complete it. The teacher read the following story: “One sunny day, Floppy the rabbit decided to go for a walk to the donut forest. . . . As he walked, he came to a tree full of blueberry filled donuts. He loved blueberries, so he put 5 blueberry filled donuts in his basket.” At this point, the teacher paused to allow students to make a stack with 5 unifix cubes to model the 5 donuts that Floppy put in his basket. The story continued, with the teacher questioning students, “So how many donuts does Floppy have in his basket?” (5). The teacher then continued the story, with the students adding two more cubes to their stack of 5 cubes when Floppy picked up 2 more donuts for a total of 7 donuts. When Floppy got hungry and ate a donut, students removed a cube from the stack to show that he had 1 fewer donut. Students were given the opportunity to continue the story using “one more, two more” and “one less, two less.”</p>

<title>Benchmarks—Five and ten</title>
<p>Teaching students to relate a specific number to a criterion or benchmark (5 or 10) is known to enhance students’ acquisition of mathematical concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022219411422380">Sowder &amp; Schappelle, 1994</xref>). The benchmark number 10, for example, plays an important role in the numeration system. Because two 5s make up 10, both 5 and 10 are useful anchors to consider when developing relationships between numbers less than 10. This relationship not only allows students to think about various combinations of numbers (e.g., 7 is “5 and 2 more” and “3 away from 10”) but also promotes the development of mental computation of larger numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022219411422380">Van de Walle, 2007</xref>). The first lesson in this unit introduced the five-frame and had students identify a number and represent it on the five-frame. In addition, students learned to identify the number of filled and empty boxes on the five-frame. The purpose of this activity was to instantly recognize the number represented on the five-frame without counting. Lesson 2 introduced the tens-frame and followed the same sequence of activities as Lesson 1.</p>
<p>In Lesson 3, students were presented with five-frames representing numbers 1 through 5. Students had to first identify the number and then state how many more counters were needed to make 5. For example, if the five-frame represented the number 3, students had to first identify the number (e.g., 3) and state that 2 more counters are needed to make 5. Finally, students solved story problems (e.g., “Clare has 3 puppets. She wished she had 5. How many more puppets does she need?”) by completing the five-frame or writing the number word. Lesson 4 followed the same sequence of activities as Lesson 3 but focused on the benchmark of 10.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0022219411422380">
<title>Part-part-whole relationships</title>
<p>The interpretation of numbers in terms of <italic>part-part-whole relationships</italic> is the most important conceptual achievement of early school mathematical understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022219411422380">Fischer, 1990</xref>). This relationship requires understanding that a number is made up of two or more parts. For example, 5 can be thought of as a set of 3 and a set of 2 or a set of 1 and a set of 4. The first activity, “Bean Toss,” in this unit allowed students to determine the two smaller numbers or parts that make up the numbers 2 through 4 (e.g., 2 and 1 or 1 and 2 make 3). For this activity, students were given a cup with four beans (painted red on one side and white on the other side). Students spilled the beans and made a note of the number of white and red beans. The activity ended with a discussion of smaller parts (white and red beans) that make up the whole (all beans). Lesson 2 followed the same sequence of activities but used 5 and 6 as the target numbers. Lesson 3 continued to explore and reinforce the part-part-whole relationships in the activity, “Covered Parts,” which had students determine the missing part of a number when the whole and one part were given. For example, if the target number was 4 (i.e., the whole) and 3 counters were visible on the table, then the students stated that 1 counter was missing, because 3 and 1 make 4. In the activity, “Build It in Parts,” students learned to create a two-part illustration for a number. For example, using a work mat and 6 toothpicks, students arranged the toothpicks so that the smaller parts that made up the whole (all the toothpicks) were explicit. Next, students discussed the arrangement in terms of all the toothpicks used and the two smaller parts that made up the whole.</p>
<p>Lesson 4 provided additional practice on part-part-whole relationships. In the activity, “I Wish I Had,” students determined the missing part of a number when the whole and one part were given. For example, the teacher held up a bar of 3 yellow cubes and asked the students, “How many cubes are there on this bar?” When students identified the number, the teacher said, “Correct, there are 3 cubes, but I wish I had 5. So, how many more cubes will I need to make my wish come true?” In this lesson, students not only practiced part-part-whole combinations but also learned to use the calculator to check their work. Finally, they completed the “Build It in Parts” activity using attribute blocks.</p>

<title>Implementing the NSI program</title>
<p>Using scripted materials, teachers implemented instruction in a variety of arrangements (e.g., whole class, small group, paired partners). Students received explicit, systematic instruction in developing relationships among numbers 1 through 10. Lessons were structured as follows: the teacher (a) introduced the key concepts and modeled the instructional steps, (b) used facilitative questioning to guide students in applying the concept and skill using a series of examples, and (c) assigned independent seatwork and provided students with feedback and guidance, as needed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0022219411422380">
<title>Control condition</title>
<p>Instruction in the control condition followed the procedures in the district-adopted standards-based mathematics textbook, <italic>Investigations in Number, Data, and Space</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022219411422380">TERC, 2008</xref>). The kindergarten curriculum is organized into six units, with four units focusing on the number system (i.e., Counting and Comparing; What Comes Next?; Measuring and Counting; How Many Do You Have?), and one unit each on data analysis (i.e., Sorting and Surveys) and geometry (i.e., Make a Shape, Build a Block). Topics and activities in the curriculum that emphasize the number system include, for example, pattern trains and hopscotch path; collecting, counting, and measuring; counting selves and others; benchmarks; addition and subtraction; and how many in all. <italic>Investigations</italic> offers activity-based mathematics that encourages students to think creatively, develop and articulate their own problem-solving strategies, and work cooperatively with their classmates. Many activities in the curriculum involve engaging games that reinforce students’ understanding of important mathematical concepts and skills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-0022219411422380">
<title>Treatment implementation fidelity</title>
<p>Independent raters (doctoral students in special education) observed 50% of the lessons using observation forms that were developed to document treatment implementation. For both the NSI and control conditions, the observation forms focused on essential instructional criteria (e.g., sets the purpose of the lesson, reviews critical concepts and skills, demonstrates or models the concept or skill using concrete objects and think-alouds, uses facilitative questioning during guided practice, monitors student performance, has students check or justify their answer, provides feedback). Each rater measured treatment fidelity using a dichotomous rating scale for each criterion on the observation form. Treatment fidelity was determined by calculating the percentage of completed steps divided by the total number of steps on the checklist. The mean treatment fidelity across teachers in the NSI condition was 89% (ranged from 73% to 100%). The mean treatment fidelity for the control condition averaged 72%, with a range of 40% to 93%. Most commonly, teachers failed to set the purpose, use materials appropriately (e.g., all students were not provided with manipulatives; rather, one teacher in the NSI condition modeled the skill using one set of manipulatives and called on students individually to demonstrate the skill with her set of manipulatives), or elicit student responses. The mean interobserver agreement was 96% (range = 76% to 91%) for the NSI condition and 98% (range = 94% to 100%) for the control condition.</p>

<title>Criterion Validity of Number Sense Measures</title>
<p>To address the relation between students’ scores on the number sense measures (i.e., spatial relationships, more and less relationships, benchmarks of five and ten, and nonverbal calculation) and an established indicator of mathematics number proficiency (e.g., SESAT 1), Pearson correlations between the pretest measures were calculated and are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022219411422380">Table 3</xref>. A strong direct relationship was found in the bivariate correlations for all measures, except between counting from and spatial relationships (<italic>r</italic> = .145, <italic>p</italic> = .147) and between counting from and nonverbal calculation (<italic>r</italic> = .108, <italic>p</italic> = .282) suggesting that counting from, spatial relationships, and nonverbal calculation measured unique sets of behavior. The concurrent validity coefficients for the SESAT 1 with number sense measures were in the low to moderate range, with performance on the combined number sense (<italic>r</italic> = .58), number relationship (<italic>r</italic> = .50), and five and ten benchmarks–calculation (<italic>r</italic> = .48) more strongly related than spatial relationships (<italic>r</italic> = .28) to SESAT 1. The concurrent validity coefficients for the EN-CBM with the number sense measures were also in the low to moderate range. To determine how much of the variance in the SESAT 1 could be explained by the number sense measure, we conducted a linear regression analysis. Results indicated that the number sense measure accounted for a statistically significant amount (0.34) of the explainable variance.</p>

Likewise, no significant differences were found between the at-risk and not-at-risk groups on gender, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 101) = 2.10, <italic>p</italic> = .148, ethnicity, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 101) = 3.94, <italic>p</italic> = .05, or SES, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 101) = 3.97, <italic>p</italic> = .05.</p>
<p>Separate two-way ANOVAs were performed on the EN-CBM and number sense pretest measures to assess pretreatment group equivalency. No statistically significant between condition differences were found on all measures: oral counting fluency, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 0.06, <italic>p</italic> = .811; counting from, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 0.03, <italic>p</italic> = .854; number identification, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 0.06, <italic>p</italic> = .807; combined number sense, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 0.30, <italic>p</italic> = .585; spatial relationships, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 0.06, <italic>p</italic> = .806; more and less relationships, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 1.87, <italic>p</italic> = .175; five and ten benchmarks, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 0.10, <italic>p</italic> = .753; and nonverbal calculation, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 0.81, <italic>p</italic> = .370. As expected, statistically significant differences were found between the at-risk groups on all the pretest measures: oral counting fluency, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 25.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; counting from, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 15.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; number identification, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 12.03, <italic>p</italic> = .001; combined number sense, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 42.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; spatial relationships, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 10.92, <italic>p</italic> = .001; more and less relationships, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 25.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; five and ten benchmarks, <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 27.78, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; and nonverbal calculation <italic>F</italic>(1, 98) = 19.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>

<title>Number Proficiency</title>
<p>Separate analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were conducted with the pretest serving as a covariate for the EN-CBM and number sense measures (see <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022219411422380">Note 1</xref>). Although participants in the control group were significantly older than students in the NSI group and not-at-risk students were older than at-risk students, age was not included as a covariate for all analyses because this potential covariate was not significantly related to scores on the dependent measures. Treatment group and at-risk status served as the between-subjects fixed factors. ANCOVA was selected to reduce the probability of a Type II error and to increase power by reducing the error variance. The means and standard deviations for pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest by condition and at-risk status are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022219411422380">Table 4</xref>. Given the multiple EN-CBM and number sense outcome measures in our study, we used the Benjamini–Hochberg correction to control for Type I error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022219411422380">Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995</xref>). Application of the Benjamini–Hochberg correction procedure did not change the pattern of significant findings for all analyses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential efficacy of a number sense intervention for kindergarten students attending a high-poverty school using a quasi-experimental design. The study was designed to examine whether a brief 4-week intervention would positively affect number-sense-related student outcomes. The number sense program used in this study was designed to focus on relationship among numbers and incorporated instructional activities for engaging and motivating young children. Results showed that students in the NSI condition outperformed students in the control condition on all our number-sense-related measures and on number identification of the EN-CBM. The effect sizes comparing the NSI treatment with control condition were medium to large (0.55 for spatial relationships, 1.14 for more and less relationships, 0.87 for five and ten benchmarks, and 0.68 for nonverbal calculation) on the immediate posttest. Furthermore, results suggested that students not at risk for MD scored higher than students at risk for MD on all but spatial relationships. At the same time, the effects for NSI were not mediated by at-risk status, suggesting that it may benefit a wide range of students.</p>
<p>In addition, the positive effects of NSI were retained 3 weeks after the intervention, and these effects were not mediated by at-risk status. The effect sizes for the delayed posttest comparing the NSI treatment with control condition were medium to large (0.68 for spatial relationships, 0.59 for more and less relationships, 1.20 for five and ten benchmarks, and 0.73 for nonverbal calculation). Furthermore, results suggested that students not at risk for MD scored higher than students at risk for MD on benchmarks and nonverbal calculation but not on spatial relationships and more and less relationships. These findings are encouraging, especially considering that the control group was receiving well-designed number sense instruction from a standards-based curriculum. Results from recent research on content analysis of first grade mathematics textbooks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022219411422380">Sood &amp; Jitendra, 2007</xref>) provide a positive outlook regarding the findings from this study. The evaluation of traditional and standards-based curricula indicated that although traditional instruction provided many opportunities for engaging in number relationship tasks, the standards-based curriculum “emphasized more real world connections” and “did better than traditional textbooks in promoting relational understanding” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022219411422380">Sood &amp; Jitendra, 2007</xref>, p. 145). As such, the enhanced instruction in the control group provides a more rigorous test of our intervention.</p>
<p>The present findings seem consistent with our hypothesis that carefully sequenced activities can promote the development of the big ideas of number sense for kindergarten children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411422380">Gersten &amp; Chard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022219411422380">Kame’enui, Carnine, Dixon, Simmons, &amp; Coyne, 2002</xref>). For children struggling in mathematics, particularly those from low-income backgrounds with possibly limited opportunities to build foundational knowledge in mathematics necessary for school success, it may be important to provide focused, explicit instruction in number sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022219411422380">Kroesbergen et al., 2004</xref>) and other critical content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022219411422380">Clarke et al., 2011</xref>). However, further research directly examining this question is needed. A particularly encouraging finding is the statistically significant between-group differences on all number sense measures favoring the treatment group based on only 4 weeks of instruction. Prior studies on NSI typically ranged from 7 weeks to 36 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219411422380">Arnold et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411422380">Griffin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022219411422380">Griffin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022219411422380">Markovits &amp; Sowder, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022219411422380">Yang, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0022219411422380">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0022219411422380">Young-Loveridge, 2004</xref>). Even though the study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411422380">Funkhouser (1995)</xref> with K–1 students with learning disabilities provided instruction for 4 weeks, instruction focused on only one skill, recognition of a patterned set (i.e., using the five-frame to recognize the number of objects in a set without actually counting them [subitizing]). Findings from our study suggest that even a relatively brief intervention (4 weeks) that emphasizes a variety of key areas can improve learning and retention of number proficiency, especially when instruction is designed around the big ideas of relationships among numbers using validated instructional practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022219411422380">Kame’enui et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022219411422380">Van de Walle et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that NSI is a multicomponent intervention, we can only speculate about which of the components affected student outcomes. Since making connections to the real world is also a feature of the control curriculum, this component may be less influential than the other components (i.e., explicit systematic instruction and opportunities for student response); however, future research is warranted to isolate the relative effects of the different components of NSI. An alternative explanation for the findings is that even though both groups received number sense instruction, NSI provided focused instruction targeting concepts and skills that were closely aligned with the skills tested on the multiple number sense measures. As such, it is difficult to determine whether the NSI curriculum alone was responsible for the difference in performance between the two groups. Furthermore, the effects for NSI may be an artifact of the professional development (PD) provided to the treatment teachers only. It is plausible that if control teachers had received PD that focused on teaching core concepts and skills directly from the standards-based curriculum using validated instructional procedures (i.e., explicit instruction) targeting at-risk students, the differences in student outcomes may not have been evident. These possibilities should be considered in further research into the efficacy of this intervention. Finally, given that the effects of NSI in this study were evident on only number identification of EN-CBM at posttest and on none of the EN-CBM measures at delayed posttest, future research should respond to this issue by designing and integrating these counting activities into the NS curriculum.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section40-0022219411422380">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Findings from this exploratory study should be considered in light of several limitations. First, we did not randomly assign students to the treatment and control conditions; instead, randomization occurred at the classroom level. We acknowledge that the ANCOVA model is misspecified in that it did not partial out variance resulting from the dependence of students within classrooms. The number of classrooms in this study was not sufficient to conduct the required nested analysis (e.g., hierarchical linear modeling [HLM] or multilevel modeling) controlling for intraclass correlation. However, HLM and ANCOVA models are both general linear models. In both cases, the student is the unit of analysis, and in HLM the classroom is also a unit of analysis. Basically in HLM, each level of the model has a unit of analysis and a respective sample and population. The amount of bias these two components will introduce into the model is small, and the advantages associated with random assignment in general need to be considered. For example, we analyzed both demographic information and pretest measures for differences between the two groups and found both groups to be comparable. Future intervention research should ensure that conditions are randomly assigned on a large-scale basis in which sufficient sample sizes can be secured to run HLM or multilevel modeling.</p>
<p>Second, the study did not completely control for the additional instructional time provided to experimental students. Although it may be argued that this is an artifact of employing a “business as usual” control condition that is often used to control for history and maturation effects, a major portion of the standards-based core curriculum used in the present study focused on activities to promote number sense. It must be noted that our NSI curriculum replaced the majority of units involving the number system in the control curriculum. Furthermore, because the core mathematics program (<italic>Investigations</italic>) incorporated many of the features of NSI (e.g., associating numbers to real-world quantities, use of manipulatives and hands-on activities), it is not clear whether NSI has an added value to standards-based classroom instruction and whether the effects would be realized when NSI was used alone or layered on top of a traditional, teacher-directed instructional program. Future research should investigate the impact of the NSI program in isolation and in combination with classroom mathematics instruction. Third, findings for kindergartners in this one school cannot be expected to generalize to students in other schools or those with very different backgrounds. Future research is warranted to validate the findings of this study with a larger sample of students in different schools and representing diverse populations. Fourth, the fact that only three teachers provided instruction in the treatment group and two in the control group limited our ability to make strong conclusions about the efficacy of the intervention. Any differences in student learning may be the result of characteristics or practices of the teachers rather than the intervention. A fifth limitation of this study is that the number-sense measures used in the study were researcher designed. Unfortunately, the school did not have end-of-year SESAT scores to examine the two groups’ growth on a standardized mathematics achievement test. Although we validated our number sense measures with SESAT 1 (the moderate correlations are acceptable for exploratory studies; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022219411422380">Nunnally, 1967</xref>), future research should examine the relationship between number sense and mathematics achievement.</p>

<title>Implications for Research and Practice</title>
<p>Given the above-mentioned limitations, this exploratory study suggests the need for larger-scale experimental research of similar interventions. Not all students enter school with well-developed knowledge of numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219411422380">Case, 1985</xref>; Hiebert, 1986) and may need formal instruction to acquire and maintain basic mathematics skills. Because a strong understanding of beginning mathematics skills is the foundation of later mathematics achievement, it is important that the knowledge of number sense is not left to incidental learning. Two implications for preventing and reducing the negative consequences of mathematical problems can be drawn from this study. First, students at risk for MD entered kindergarten with less than optimal knowledge in terms of early numeracy skills, suggesting the need for these students to receive effective instructional support in number sense that occur early to prevent later mathematical difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219411422380">Chard, Baker, Clarke, Jungjohann, Davis, &amp; Smolkowski, 2008</xref>). Within the RTI framework, the focus would be not only on providing research-based interventions but also on measuring progress as a result of intervention implementation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411422380">Chard, Ketterlin-Geller, &amp; Jitendra, 2008</xref>). Second, providing students with opportunities to learn might necessitate developing a strong conceptual base for number sense. Realistic activities could be combined with explicit instruction to develop students’ number sense knowledge structures that are connected and organized to enhance their learning.</p>
<p>In summary, providing students at risk for MD with instruction as early as kindergarten similar to that provided in this study may help ameliorate the gaps in number-sense-related outcomes between children from low-income backgrounds and their counterparts from middle- and high-income backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022219411422380">Gersten et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022219411422380">Jordan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219411422380">Mazzocco &amp; Thompson, 2005</xref>). This question should be further researched.</p>

<p>Results were analyzed initially for the combined overall number sense score. The ANCOVA was statistically significant as a function of treatment condition at posttest, <italic>F</italic>(1, 96) = 46.55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and delayed posttest, <italic>F</italic>(1, 96) = 34.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, for the combined number sense score. For at-risk status the results were significant for the posttest, <italic>F</italic>(1, 96) = 6.43, <italic>p</italic> = .013, but not for the delayed posttest, <italic>F</italic>(1, 96) = 0.71, <italic>p</italic> = .402. The pretest scores at both posttest, <italic>F</italic>(1, 96) = 26.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and delayed posttest, <italic>F</italic>(1, 96) = 49.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, for the combined number sense measure were statistically significant. Scores for the NS group surpassed those for the control group at both posttest and delayed posttest (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022219411422380">Table 4</xref>). Given the significant effects for the combined overall number sense score, we conducted separate ANCOVAs to compare the effect of number sense instruction on each number sense score (e.g., spatial relationships, number relationship, five and ten benchmarks, nonverbal calculation).</p>
