<p><bold>Background:</bold> Age-related effects on the ability of 6-min walking test (6MWT) and ejection fraction (EF) to predict mortality in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is still debated.</p>
<p><bold>Design and methods:</bold> In order to verify the role of 6MWT and EF on all-cause mortality in patients undergoing CR following CABG, 882 CABG patients undergoing CR stratified in adults (&lt;65 years) and elderly (≥65 years) were studied.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> At the admission, EF was 52.6 ± 9.1% in adults and 51.3 ± 8.9% in elderly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.234, NS) while 6MWT was 343.8 ± 93.5 m in adults and 258.9 ± 95.7 m in elderly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). After 42.9 ± 14.1 months follow up, mortality was 8.2% in adults and 10.9% in elderly (<italic>p</italic> = 0.176, NS). Cox regression analysis shows that EF ≥ 50% and 6MWT ≥300 m are protective on mortality in all CABG patients before CR. However, EF ≥50% in adults (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06–0.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005) but not in elderly (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.45–3.42, <italic>p</italic> = 0.354, NS) and 6MWT ≥300 m in elderly (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.10–0.79, <italic>p</italic> = 0.033) but not in adults (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.31–2.12, <italic>p</italic> = 0.654, NS) exert a protective role on mortality.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results indicate that both EF ≥ 50% and 6MWT ≥ 300 m independently protect against mortality in CABG patients before CR. However, their protective role is age dependent. In fact, EF ≥ 50% is protective in adults but not in elderly while 6MWT ≥ 300 m is protective in elderly but not in adult patients.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741826711422991" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Advances in medicine, and therefore the aging of population, determine an even greater number of elderly people presenting for cardiac surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711422991">1</xref></sup> Although age has been demonstrated to be a risk factor for mortality and morbidity in cardiac surgery outcomes, it has also been demonstrated that excellent outcomes can be achieved in selected populations of elderly patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711422991">2</xref></sup> Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) represents the critical point of the long-term management of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711422991">3</xref></sup> Although several studies demonstrated that CR reduces all-cause mortality by ≈ 20% and cardiac mortality by ≈ 25%, few studies included elderly patients undergone CABG surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711422991">4</xref></sup> However, recent data demonstrate that CR remains a useful tool even in frail elderly patients who have a higher rate of postoperative complications and in-hospital and mid-term mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711422991">5</xref></sup> To the best of our knowledge, data on predictors of mortality in elderly patients after CABG are not still available. In particular, whether left ventricular EF and the distance walked in 6 min are related to improved survival in elderly patients after CABG are not completely established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711422991">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of the study was to evaluate the age-related prognostic value on survival of EF and distance walked in 6-min walking test (6MWT) in adult (&lt;65 years) and elderly (≥65 years) CABG patients admitted to CR.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1741826711422991" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711422991"><title>Study population</title>
<p>The study enrolled 882 consecutive patients after CABG admitted between October 2004 and April 2008 to the Division of Cardiac Rehabilitation, Salvatore Maugeri Foundation, Institute of Telese, Italy. Patients were stratified in adults (&lt;65 years) and elderly (≥65 years). The following data were collected: age, sex, presence of comorbid conditions (Charlson Comorbidity Index, CCI), left ventricular EF measured by echocardiography on admission, heart rate, systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP), body mass index (BMI), and cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular drug consumption. The 6MWT was performed at baseline and at discharge. Data on ‘all-cause’ mortality were collected in all patients up to April 2010. The institutional ethical committee approved the study and a written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711422991"><title>Six-min walking test (6MWT)</title>
<p>The 6MWT was performed the second day after admission in all patients and, in any case, within the first 3 weeks after CABG. Patients were instructed to walk as far as possible along a 40-m straight, flat hospital corridor in 6 min.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711422991">7</xref></sup> The test was symptom limited, so patients who became symptomatic (e.g. angina, severe dyspnoea, dizziness, and musculoskeletal pain) were told to stop walking and restart when possible. The test was supervised by a physical therapist that encouraged the patients in a standardized fashion at regular intervals. The total distance walked was measured to the nearest metre and recorded. Before the test, patient's resting heart rate and blood pressure were measured in sitting position. Immediately after completion of the 6MWT, peak exercise data, including heart rate, blood pressure, rating of perceived exertion, and total distance walked were measured. The results of the 6MWT are given as absolute values in metres. At the admission, 124 out of 947 patients did not perform the 6MWT: 81 out of 124 patients were elderly (65.3%) and they presented severe dyspnoea (<italic>n</italic> = 65), angina (<italic>n</italic> = 12), and musculoskeletal pain (<italic>n</italic> = 4) while 43 out of 124 patients were adults (34.6%) and they presented severe dyspnoea (<italic>n</italic> = 26) and angina (<italic>n</italic> = 17), leading a final number of 883 (451 adults and 432 elderly). Moreover, 60 out of 883 patients did not perform the 6MWT at the discharge (6.7%). Sixteen out of 451 adult patients (3.5%) presented atrial fibrillation at high heart rate (<italic>n</italic> = 6), angina (<italic>n</italic> = 6), and infections and/or pleural effusion (<italic>n</italic> = 4), leading a final number of 435. Forty-four out of 432 elderly patients (10.1%) presented atrial fibrillation at high heart rate (<italic>n</italic> = 7), angina (<italic>n</italic> = 18), and infections and/or pleural effusion (<italic>n</italic> = 19), leading a final number of 388. Thus, the effects of the CR programme were evaluated as a percentage increase in the distance walked between admission and discharge in a subset of 823 of the initial sample of 883 patients (93.2%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711422991"><title>CR programme</title>
<p>The CR programme included exercise training, using the treadmill and/or the exercise bicycle and consisted of two daily sessions (morning/afternoon) for 5 days/weeks of endurance training on a cycle ergometer or treadmill (5-min warm-up, 20-min training at constant workload, 5-min cool down, and 5-min post-exercise monitoring) plus 1-h sessions by day of stretching and flexibility exercises. In both sessions, ECG was monitored by telemetry and exercise intensity was set at 70% to 85% of heart rate attained during baseline symptom-limited exercise test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711422991"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Univariate analysis (ANOVA) examined differences in age, sex, BMI, heart rate, SBP, DBP, PP, CCI, drugs number, EF, 6MWT, and metres variation in 6MWT on admission and discharge. Differences in death rates were evaluated with χ<sup>2</sup>. All these variables were entered into a multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards model considering total mortality at follow up as dependent variable. 6MWT and EF were entered into the model separately as continuous variables and as dichotomous variables dichotomized with the following cut-off values: 300 m for 6MWT (mean value 302.1 m) and 50% for EF (mean value 51.9%). This procedure was carried out for the group as a whole and separately for adults and elderly. Survival time was defined as from the time of admission to the time of all-cause death at follow up. A post-hoc sample size calculation by considering 0.03 as an acceptable difference and under a type 1 error of 0.05 was applied in order to verify the statistical power of detecting clinically significant differences. In all patients with an EF ≥ or &lt; 50% and 6MWT ≥ or &lt; 300 m, the power of the study was excellent (100%) with a sample size of 600 patients (300 vs. 300). However, when patients were stratified in age groups, the power of the study decreased to 83% in adults when considering 6MWT ≥ or &lt; 300 m with a sample size of 300 patients (150 vs. 150) and to 80% in elderly when considering EF ≥ or &lt; 50% with a sample size of 300 patients (150 vs. 150). A <italic>p</italic>-value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.</p>

<p>Baseline characteristics of all patients and patients stratified in adults and elderly are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711422991">Table 1</xref>. Comorbidity and drugs number were higher in elderly than in adult patients while EF values at baseline in adult and elderly were not different. Distance walked at 6MWT was lower in elderly than in adult patients (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The all-cause mortality after a mean follow up of 42.9 ± 14.1 months was 9.5%. No significant differences in total mortality between adult and elderly patients were observed (8.2 vs. 10.9; <italic>p</italic> = 0.176, NS). When stratified in survivors, in all patients, no-survivors were older and showed a higher CCI and drugs number and a lower EF and 6MWT. Moreover, in no-survivors, EF was lower in adults and 6MWT in elderly, but not vice versa. Finally, AF prevalence was higher in the elderly while no difference in the presence of pacemaker was noted in all groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711422991">Table 1</xref>).

<p>To provide a more clinical and pragmatic significance to our results, we dichotomized EF (&lt;50% and ≥50%) and 6MWT (&lt;300 and ≥300 m). In the all-patients model, PP, CCI, and drugs number are predictive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711422991">Table 3</xref>) while EF ≥50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711422991">Figure 1A</xref>) and 6MWT ≥300 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1741826711422991">Figure 2A</xref>) are protective on mortality. However, when patients were stratified in adults and elderly, drugs number is predictive of mortality in adults and elderly while age, PP, and CCI are predictive of mortality only in elderly subgroups. More importantly, EF ≥50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711422991">Figure 1B</xref>) but not 6MWT ≥300 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1741826711422991">Figure 2B</xref>) in adults while 6MWT ≥300 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1741826711422991">Figure 2C</xref>) but not EF ≥50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711422991">Figure 1C</xref>) in elderly are protective against mortality.

<p>Differences of EF and 6MWT at baseline and after CR are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711422991">Table 3</xref>. Differences in EF values at baseline and after CR in all patients and both in adult and elderly patients were not observed. However, when stratified in survivors and no-survivors, at the admission, EF was lower in no-survivors in all patients and in adults but not in elderly patients. At the admission, 6MWT was lower in elderly patients and in all patients and in elderly patients when no-survivors were considered. Interestingly, although the absolute improvement of 6MWT after CR was similar in adult and elderly patients, the percentage increment was higher in elderly than in adult patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1741826711422991">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec13-1741826711422991" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results indicate that both EF and 6MWT are independent prognostic variables on total mortality in all CABG patients before CR. However, EF ≥50% but not 6MWT ≥300 in adults and 6MWT ≥300 but not EF ≥50% in elderly are protective against mortality. Moreover, mortality is not influenced by 6MWT improvement after CR although the percentage increase of distance walked was greater in elderly than in adult patients.</p>
<sec id="sec14-1741826711422991"><title>Mortality after CABG in adult and elderly patients undergoing CR</title>
<p>In our population, at follow up, overall mortality was 9.5%. This percentage was similar to that observed in other studies. Kavanagh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711422991">8</xref></sup> in 3077 CABG patients referred for CR found a mortality of 7.3% after a mean follow up of 7.9 years. This percentage appears to be lower than that found in our study. However, the age of that population was 55.0 ± 9.6 years whereas our patients were 63.6 ± 9.1 years old. When patients were stratified in adults and elderly, mortality in adult patients was closer to that observed by Kavanagh (8.2%). In 183 CABG elderly patients (mean age 66.27 ± 11 years) undergoing CR, mortality was 14% after 4.3 years of follow up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711422991">9</xref></sup> Recently, in a very large cohort of elderly patients who attended at least one CR session, mortality ranges between 7% and 10% after 2 years of follow up and depends on the number the number of sessions attended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711422991">10</xref></sup> Surprisingly, mortality was similar between adults and elderly (8.2% vs. 10.9%) despite the fact that elderly patients have a higher comorbility and a low physical functioning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1741826711422991"><title>Mortality predictors in CABG adult and elderly patients undergoing CR</title>
<p>Few data are available on predictors of mortality in CABG adult and elderly patients undergoing CR. In a cohort of 418 coronary artery disease patients (age 64.4 ± 10.6 years) several variables were involved in mortality risk prediction but only diabetes and a low exercise capacity were predictive of mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711422991">11</xref></sup> However, in this study only 1.2% of patients underwent CABG and only diabetes was considered as comorbid disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711422991">11</xref></sup> In 333 consecutive patients with low (≤35%) EF on admission to CR after isolated CABG, the 3-year cardiovascular mortality were predicted by heart failure, low EF on admission to CR, early complications after CABG and 6-month remodelling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711422991">12</xref></sup> In our population, when all patients were considered, EF ≥50% and 6MWT ≥300 m reduced the risk of mortality by 58% and by 34%, respectively. When compared adult and elderly patients, EF ≥50% reduces the risk of mortality in adults (by 83%), but not in elderly patients while 6MWT ≥300 m reduces the risk of mortality in elderly (by 65%), but not in adult patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1741826711422991"><title>Role of physical functioning in CABG adult and elderly patients undergoing CR</title>
<p>Why is 6MWT ≥300 but not EF ≥50% able to reduce the risk of mortality in CABG elderly patients before CR? At the best of our knowledge there are no prior studies demonstrating the prognostic role of 6MWT in CABG elderly patients on mortality. The 6MWT is widely used in CR where is demonstrated to predict in patients with chronic heart failure short-<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711422991">13</xref></sup> and long-term cardiac death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711422991">14</xref></sup> In contrast, there are some studies in which 6MWT failed to predict mortality in heart failure patients when was entered into a multivariate model with NYHA class and peak VO<sub>2</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711422991">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711422991">15</xref></sup> Interestingly, in our study, after the exclusion of patients who did not adhere to the CR programme, a percentage improvement was greater in elderly than in adults group (49.0 vs. 33.5%). As underlined before, although the improvement of percentage increase in distance walked between the admission and the end of CR programme was observed in elderly but not in adult patients, mortality was similar between the two subgroups of patients at the end of follow up. This may be explained by the fact that elderly patients showed a higher comorbility and a lower exercise capacity at the admission which may partly justify the higher mortality observed despite of a greater percentage improvement of 6MWT. Recently, in the process of identifying tests to better define frail patients, several authors proposed 6MWT as measure of frailty demonstrating a relationship between frailty phenotype and 6MWT performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711422991">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711422991">17</xref></sup> In a sample of 1370 patients (mean age 64 ± 10 years), consecutively admitted for intensive CR, 6MWT was negatively associated with age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711422991">18</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec17-1741826711422991" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The present results suggest that the assessment of physical functioning by 6MWT is a useful tool to stratify elderly patients at high risk of mortality who needs a specific programme of CR. A lower performance at 6MWT may indicate a condition that requires a multidimensional geriatric assessment aimed to evaluate domains such as cognitive function and depressive status, typical conditions of clinical frailty. In contrast, cardiac function evaluated by EF seems to be not relevant in the prognosis of elderly patients with poor physical functioning.</p>
