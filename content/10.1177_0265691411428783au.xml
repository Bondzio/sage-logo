<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783au"><title>Alan E. Steinweis, <italic>Kristallnacht 1938</italic>, Belknap Press: Cambridge MA, 2009; ix + 214 pp.; 9780674036239, $23.95 (hbk)</title>
<p>In the libraries dedicated to documenting the history of the Nazi persecution of Jews and the Holocaust, one might find a good-sized shelf containing studies of the November 1938 pogrom known as the ‘<italic>Kristallnacht</italic>’. A reader may, then, be entitled to wonder whether a new book on the topic, and a relatively compact volume at that, can have anything new to tell us about that state-sponsored crime wave that marked a significant escalation in the persecution of Jews in the Greater German <italic>Reich</italic>. Pleasingly, this new study by Alan E. Steinweis justifies its publication, not only by offering an admirably concise narrative of the events of 9–10 November 1938, but also by the use of fresh source material to shed considerable light on the extent of grassroots participation in the pogrom at the local level.</p>
<p>The decision by Hitler late on 9 November, at the urging of Goebbels, to respond to the shooting of the German Paris embassy official Ernst vom Rath by the young Herschel Grynszpan, with a wave of destruction aimed at synagogues and Jewish businesses and the arrest of thousands of Jews, is well documented. Steinweis shows that the top-level decision was preceded by an epidemic of grassroots violence against Jews, throughout 1938 but especially after the shooting of vom Rath on 7 November. Centres of violence included areas where anti-Semitism had long been virulent, such as Kurhessen.</p>
<p>Steinweis convincingly reconstructs the process by which the pogrom was ordered, generally verbally down the chain of command of the NSDAP and the SA (along with the sometimes under-acknowledged participation of the SS). The pogrom was hastily improvised, literally overnight, but the violence against persons and property was so widespread and unfolded so quickly due to ‘the readiness of tens of thousands of Germans to commit violence against their Jewish neighbours’ (55).</p>
<p>Steinweis makes compelling use of the records of German local and district courts which prosecuted offenders responsible for crimes during ‘<italic>Kristallnacht</italic>’ under the Allied occupation from 1945 to 1949. These cases demonstrate what Steinweis portrays as the ‘intimacy’ of violence against Jews in small communities (63), where perpetrators often knew their victims, and took advantage of the officially sanctioned pogrom to settle personal scores: in one community, a Jewish woman was beaten up over a debt of 80 pfennig. These records document a significant amount of voluntary participation by local German citizens outside the structures of the Nazi party or the SA, who readily joined in the anti-Jewish acts of the latter. This degree of voluntary participation is one of the main findings of Steinweis’s book. It is, as Steinweis acknowledges, difficult to quantify. Post-war courts prosecuted relatively few men who had been youthful offenders in 1938, but teenage males were clearly active in the violence of <italic>Kristallnacht</italic>. The Nazi party’s own courts had their own narrow definition of ‘excesses’, which left the majority of anti-Jewish acts unpunished, although egregious unauthorized acts of looting and extortion (outside the massive state-organized shake-down of the Jewish community that followed the pogrom) were sometimes prosecuted. Steinweis notes the frequency of unauthorized looting, often involving women.</p>
<p>Steinweis dwells relatively little on the widespread (but not, he stresses, universal) popular disapproval of the lawlessness and destruction of property associated with <italic>Kristallnacht</italic>, which has been a theme of some other studies since Ian Kershaw’s ground-breaking work on popular opinion and the persecution of the Jews some 30 years ago. Such disapproval expressed discomfort with the overt violence of the pogrom and the destruction of valuable property at a time of increasing economic austerity, and with violations of bourgeois norms of propriety, but was not necessarily the product of any sympathy for Jewish victims. On the other hand, Steinweis finds that there were at least some cases where disapproval did express such sympathy, but again he is explicit about the limitations of the available sources: disapproval was rarely openly articulated in such terms under the conditions of the Nazi dictatorship.</p>
<p>Steinweis’s account traces the aftermath of the <italic>Kristallnacht</italic> and its consequences for the victims who survived the immediate pogrom but later suffered and died in camps, including the unhappy Herschel Grynszpan himself, and he traces the later history of the pogrom in historical memory and in the courts. His material on the post-war trials, conducted by German courts under Allied occupation, before the advent of the Adenauer administration in the Federal Republic delivered amnesty to a myriad of ‘minor offenders’, is fascinating. These trials, the records of which have become relatively recently available to researchers, merit a major study in their own right. Steinweis’s concisely written book is a fine example of how the historical understanding of a relatively familiar topic can benefit from a fresh body of source material, and a fresh pair of historian’s eyes.</p>
