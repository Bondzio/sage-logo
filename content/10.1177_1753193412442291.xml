<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We present the first reported case of extensive idiopathic avascular necrosis of the capitate in an adolescent treated with posterior interosseous neurectomy.</p>
<p>A 16-year-old, right-hand dominant girl presented with a 6 month history of insidious left-sided wrist pain. She had no history of trauma and was otherwise well. She described the pain as being intermittent initially, but having progressed to become almost continuous. She was unable to play her musical instrument and had given up her part-time job.</p>
<p>Examination revealed swelling and tenderness over the mid-carpal area of the left wrist. The range of motion of her left wrist was reduced due to discomfort: extension 20° and flexion 60°. There was no carpal instability or joint hypermobility. Inflammatory markers were all normal. Wrist radiographs showed a marked increase in the radiodensity of the capitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412442291">Figure 1</xref>). An MRI scan demonstrated diffuse signal change throughout the body of the capitate, consistent with a diagnosis of avascular necrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412442291">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Initial management consisted of a 6 month period of rest, splinting, and analgesia. Unfortunately, the patient continued to have significant symptoms, including rest pain. In light of this, a posterior interosseous neurectomy was performed as a day case. The patient was allowed to move her wrist freely postoperatively. No strengthening or axial loading exercises were permitted.</p>
<p>At 4 weeks post-operatively, her rest pain had resolved and range of movement had improved to extension 50° and flexion 80°. Functional rehabilitation under the guidance of a hand-therapist was then undertaken with gradual strengthening. At 2 year follow-up, she had regained an almost full range of motion in her wrist with minimal discomfort. Radiographs revealed sclerosis but no collapse.</p>
<p>Avascular necrosis of the capitate is a very rare cause of wrist pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412442291">Niesten and Verhaar, 2002</xref>). The most common causative factor is an episode of severe trauma or minor repetitive trauma. The intraosseous vascular supply of the capitate has been well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412442291">Walker, 1993</xref>). These studies have demonstrated that a large area of the bone is supplied by a single nutrient vessel, theoretically increasing its risk of vascular compromise. Very few cases of idiopathic capitate avascular necrosis have been reported, all in adults. Treatment of avascular necrosis of the capitate can be conservative or surgical, with success and failure reported by different authors.</p>
<p>Several different surgical procedures have been described, including excision, curettage and bone grafting, vascularized grafting, excision, and prosthetic replacement and arthrodesis. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of idiopathic avascular necrosis of the capitate in an adolescent. In the only other similar case report, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412442291">Humphrey et al. (2006)</xref> reported complete re-ossification of the capitate with conservative care in a 5-year-old gymnast. Conservative treatment in our case failed. Due to her young age we were hesitant to perform any irreversible bony procedures. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case where a posterior interosseous neurectomy alone was used to treat avascular necrosis of the capitate. This procedure proved effective in relieving the patient’s symptoms and returning excellent function to her hand and wrist 2 years post-operatively.</p>
