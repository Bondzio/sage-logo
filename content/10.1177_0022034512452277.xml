<abstract>
<p>Ce-TZP/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanocomposite (NANOZR) has not only higher strength, but also higher fracture toughness than conventional Y-TZP, indicating its potential for use in dental implants. Surface treatment to obtain osseointegration, however, may alter its surface topography, thus affecting the cyclic fatigue strength that plays such an important role in the durability of this material. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of surface treatment on cyclic fatigue strength in NANOZR as compared with grit-blasted and acid-etched Y-TZP (125BE Y-TZP). Bi-axial flexure strength was measured in both static and cyclic fatigue tests, as recommended by ISO 6872. The cyclic fatigue test was performed by the staircase method in distilled water at 37°C, with a load of 10<sup>6</sup> cycles and 10 Hz. Bi-axial flexure strength of NANOZR was 1111-1237 MPa and 667-881 MPa in the static and cyclic fatigue tests, respectively. The bi-axial flexure strength of NANOZR under all conditions was greater than that of 125BE Y-TZP in the static and cyclic fatigue tests. The cyclic fatigue strength of NANOZR was more than twice that of Y-TZP as specified in ISO 13356 for surgical implants (320 MPa), indicating the promise of this material for use in dental implants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Metal-free restorations have attracted attention in the field of advanced esthetic dental prosthesis, since they allow problems associated with metal allergy to be avoided. Tetragonal zirconia polycrystals, particularly yttria-stabilized zirconia (Y-TZP), have been applied to the framework for fixed prostheses and dental implants as metal-free restorations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512452277">Sato <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512452277">Andreiotelli <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512452277">Karakoca and Yilmaz, 2009</xref>). However, Y-TZP may undergo low-temperature degradation (LTD) in the aqueous solutions encountered in the oral environment. LTD is initiated from isolated surface grains, between which water is incorporated into the zirconia lattice through dissolution of Zr–O–Zr bonds and filling of oxygen vacancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512452277">Sato and Shimada, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512452277">Guo, 2004</xref>), and may result in a significant reduction in the strength and toughness of Y-TZP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512452277">Hirano, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512452277">Piconi and Maccauro, 1999</xref>), a problem that is further exacerbated by exposure of a restoration to cyclic stresses such as chewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512452277">Studart <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, Ce-TZP/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanocomposite (NANOZR) was reported to be resistant to LTD, offering not only higher strength, but also higher fracture toughness than Y-TZP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512452277">Tanaka <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512452277">Ban, 2008</xref>). These results suggest that NANOZR has the potential for use as dental implants under the cyclic loading in the oral environment.</p>
<p>If NANOZR were to be used for the body of dental implants, surface treatment such as grinding, grit-blasting, and acid-etching would be required to obtain osseointegration. Such treatment for Y-TZP dental restorations induces phase transformation, from tetragonal to monoclinic zirconia, as well as superficial microcracks, resulting in a reduction in its mechanical properties in terms of bi-axial flexure strength under both static and cyclic-loading conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512452277">Kosmac <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034512452277">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512452277">Pittayachawan <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Stress corrosion by water molecules is the key mechanism for slow crack growth in polycrystalline ceramics, called static fatigue. It has been reported that crack propagation under cyclic loading could occur at stresses lower than the threshold for subcritical crack growth under static fatigue on Y-TZP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512452277">Chevalier <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>), and that a ‘crack growth accelerating’ effect was shown under cyclic loading on NANOZR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512452277">Benzaid <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). However, the influence of surface treatment on the cyclic fatigue strength of NANOZR remains to be fully elucidated, even though this is an important factor in their durability in the oral environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512452277">Scarano <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512452277">Teixeira <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512452277">Koch <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of surface treatment on cyclic fatigue strength in NANOZR as compared with that in Y-TZP.</p>

<title>Materials &amp; Methods</title>
<p>NANOZR (ZrO<sub>2</sub>, 67.9 mass%; Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, 21.5 mass%; CeO<sub>2</sub>, 10.6 mass%; MgO, 0.06 mass%; TiO<sub>2</sub>, 0.03 mass%) (C type; Panasonic Electric Works, Osaka, Japan) powders and Y-TZP (ZrO<sub>2</sub>, balanced; Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, 5.16 mass%; Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, 0.25 mass%; Na<sub>2</sub>O, 0.021 mass%; SiO<sub>2</sub>, 0.007 mass%; Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, 0.003 mass%) (TZ-3YB-E; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) powders were processed in a cylindrical rod by a cold isostatic pressing method. After grinding of the rod surface, NANOZR and Y-TZP were sintered at 1,450°C for 2 hrs in air atmosphere and at 1,350°C for 2 hrs in air atmosphere, respectively. Disk specimens (13 mm in diameter, 0.5 mm in thickness) were prepared by cutting with a diamond wheel. These specimens of NANOZR were randomly divided into 4 groups: (1) mirror-polished (MS), (2) grit-blasted with 50-μm alumina (50B), (3) grit-blasted with 125-μm alumina (125B), and (4) grit-blasted with 125-μm alumina and etched (125BE).</p>
<p>Mirror-polished specimens were prepared on both sides of each specimen in a polishing machine (Ecomet 3, Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL, USA), which first ground diamond disks (70-µm and 45-µm) and then polished them with a polishing cloth with 9-µm, 3-µm diamond, and 0.6-µm colloidal silica to create mirror-polished surfaces. Grit-blasted specimens were perpendicularly grit-blasted on both sides from a distance of 10 mm with 50-μm and 125-µm alumina particles at 0.4 MPa air pressure until the surface reached a uniform gray tone. Specimens 125BE were prepared by etching 125B with 47% hydrofluoric acid (HF) for 30 min. Disk specimens of Y-TZP used for comparison in this study were prepared in the same manner as 125BE (125BE Y-TZP). These specimens were cleaned ultrasonically in acetone and distilled water for 10 min.</p>
<sec id="section3-0022034512452277">
<title>Surface Roughness and Microscopic Observations</title>
<p>Surface roughness of the specimens was analyzed by means of a surface roughness tester (Surfcom 130A, Accretech, Tokyo, Japan). Four specimens, each measured at 3 points, were used for each condition. The arithmetic mean surface roughness (Ra) was determined under these conditions with a cut-off value of 0.8 mm, measurement length of 4.0 mm, and measurement speed of 0.6 mm/sec. Filtering of the measured data was conducted with a Gaussian filter.</p>
<p>Microscopic observation was conducted to characterize the microstructure on the surfaces of MS, 50B, 125B, 125BE, and 125BE Y-TZP, before and after cyclic loading, by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM-6340F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).</p>

<sec id="section4-0022034512452277">
<title>Flexure Strength in Static Test</title>
<p>In the static test, 5 specimens from each group were used to measure bi-axial flexure strength in a universal testing machine (AG-I 20kN, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with a cross-head speed of 0.5 mm/min in air at room temperature. Disk specimens were placed on 3 steel spheres positioned 120 degrees apart in a circle (8.0 mm in diameter). A flat-end loading cylinder with a radius of 0.8 mm was then applied. Bi-axial flexure strength was calculated according to the equation listed in ISO 6872, with a Poisson’s ratio value of 0.25 for each specimen.</p>

<sec id="section5-0022034512452277">
<title>Bi-axial Flexure Strength in Cyclic Fatigue Test (cyclic fatigue strength)</title>
<p>A servo-hydraulic universal testing machine (EHF-F05, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used to measure bi-axial flexure strength in a cyclic fatigue test, by the application of a cyclic load in the bending mode at a frequency of 10 Hz, for 10<sup>6</sup> cycles in distilled water at 37°C.</p>
<p>Bi-axial flexure strength in the cyclic fatigue test was determined by the staircase method, in which stress is raised in increments of 5%. First, 70-80% of maximum load was applied to a specimen. If that specimen then fractured in fewer than 10<sup>6</sup> cycles of loading, a stress level one increment lower was applied to the next specimen. If this next specimen did not fracture at 10<sup>6</sup> cycles of loading, a load one increment higher was applied to the next specimen. This procedure was continued until the 20 specimens in each group were expended. The means and standard deviations of bi-axial flexure strengths in the cyclic fatigue test were determined by the staircase method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512452277">Collins, 1993</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-0022034512452277">
<title>X-ray Diffraction</title>
<p>Amounts of monoclinic and tetragonal phases before and after fatigue testing were determined in each specimen by means of an x-ray diffraction system (XRD) (RINT-2000, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a position-sensitive proportional counter. X-ray output was set at Cu-Kα, 40 kV, and 200 mA. For measurement, the incident beam was focused, by means of a collimator, onto a beam spot 100 µm in diameter. X-ray diffraction measurement was performed around the center of the tensile side of each specimen, the point of cyclic loading, before and after fatigue testing. Three specimens were used for each condition, each of which was measured at 3 points. The relative amount of the monoclinic phase was calculated based on the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512452277">Garvie and Nicholson (1972)</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study aimed to clarify the influence of surface treatment on the cyclic fatigue property of NANOZR, since its application to dental implants necessitates its being able to resist the type of cyclic loading to which it will be exposed in the oral environment.</p>
<p>We used the bi-axial flexure test, which is recommended under ISO 6872 and ISO 13356 specifications for evaluating static and fatigue strength in dental ceramics. The most common flexure test methods are the 3-point and 4-point bending tests, which have a significant drawback because of difficulties in eliminating undesirable edge failures. The bi-axial flexure test has been adopted by the American Society for Testing and Materials for determining the strength of circular disks of brittle materials to be used as ceramic substrates, and is also the international standard for evaluating dental ceramics. The ISO specifications also recommend the bi-axial flexure test (piston-on-three-ball) and 3-point bending test. A properly designed bi-axial flexure test overcomes edge failure problems and thus ensures a more accurate measurement of strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512452277">Ban and Anusavice, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, we used the staircase method to estimate cyclic fatigue strength. Many different fatigue-testing procedures have been devised: the standard method with the S-N curve, constant stress level testing, the response or survival method (Probit method), the step-test method, the Prot method, the staircase or up-and-down method, and the extreme value method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512452277">Collins, 1993</xref>). Among these, the staircase method automatically concentrates testing near the mean and requires fewer tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512452277">Little and Jebe, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034512452277">Yamamoto and Takahashi, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In our study, the bi-axial flexure strengths in static testing of NANOZR under all conditions were greater than those of 125BE Y-TZP. No remarkable differences were observed in bi-axial flexure strengths in static testing of NANOZR (1,111-1,237 MPa) among surface treatments, except between 50B and 125BE. In an earlier study, no clear relationship was observed between bi-axial flexure strength and surface roughness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512452277">Sato <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512452277">Swain (1980)</xref> suggested that volume expansion due to transformation from the tetragonal to the monoclinic phase induced compressive stress at the surface, thus enhancing strength. X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the monoclinic phase increased in the 50B, 125B, and 125BE specimens, indicating that compressive stress might have occurred on the surface as a result of the grit-blasting. However, grit-blasting can also introduce into the zirconia surface flaws or microcracks that may accelerate failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034512452277">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Consequently, we believe that any decrease in strength due to the introduction of microcracks may be compensated for by gains in strength due to the increased monoclinic phase.</p>
<p>Cyclic fatigue strength showed a remarkable decrease in comparison with bi-axial flexure strength in the static test under all conditions in the present study. In brittle materials such as ceramics, cyclic loading leads to the propagation of small cracks, causing them to break at relatively low degrees of stress, and cyclic loading is effective in predicting the strength of ceramics in clinical use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512452277">White <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>). In terms of cyclic fatigue strength, 125BE showed a lower value than did 125B. Microscopic observation revealed a finer structure on 125BE than on 125B, despite both surfaces having a similar roughness of Ra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512452277">Fig. 1</xref>). Accordingly, cyclic fatigue strength is susceptible to the fine surface structure that may involve microcracks compared with the surface roughness value. Cyclic fatigue strengths in the NANOZR can be explained as the degradation of reinforcement due to the toughening mechanisms, <italic>i.e</italic>., phase transformation and crack bridging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512452277">Chevalier <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512452277">Benzaid <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). In fact, the crack-bridging feature was observed around the fracture that occurred after cyclic fatigue testing on the MS surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512452277">Fig. 3C</xref>). However, this feature was unable to be recognized on the other specimens due to the complexity of the surface configurations of these specimens. No significant differences were observed in the monoclinic phase before and after cyclic loading according to XRD analyses, showing that the toughening mechanism due to phase transformation may not contribute to cyclic fatigue strength. Further study is necessary to clarify the phase transformation and bridging degradation mechanism under cyclic loading.</p>
<p>It has been reported that the cyclic fatigue strength of Y-TZP was 60-65% of the bi-axial flexure strength in the static test at 5×10<sup>5</sup> cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512452277">Pittayachawan <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512452277">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512452277">Studart <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). In this study, cyclic fatigue strength at 10<sup>6</sup> cycles of 125BE Y-TZP was 49% of the bi-axial flexure strength in the static test, and that of NANOZR was 60-76% of the bi-axial flexure strength in the static test. Thus, the influence of cyclic fatigue on the bi-axial flexure strength of NANOZR was smaller than that of Y-TZP, confirming that NANOZR is not as susceptible to LTD compared with Y-TZP.</p>
<p>From the clinical point of view, the cyclic fatigue strength of NANOZR treated by grit-blasting and etching was much higher than 320 MPa, the required fatigue strength of Y-TZP in surgical implants as specified in ISO 13356. Dental implants may be different from surgical implants in terms of the degree of fatigue strength required. However, we believe that NANOZR is applicable to dental implants, since the cyclic fatigue strength of this material is more than double 320 MPa, the level required for Y-TZP in surgical implants. These results suggest that the greater fatigue strength of NANOZR makes it a promising material for application to dental implants.</p>
