<abstract>
<p>The extant literature identifies a strong relationship between drug use and unprotected sex at large, gay-male-oriented, techno-parties that are known as circuit parties. The available research data, however, mostly fail to substantiate this link. Consequently, an interview-based qualitative study was undertaken with 17 gay men who attend circuit parties in Montréal, Canada. The findings revealed that the relationship between drugs and unprotected sex is multifactorial. Rather than there being a linear relationship between these items, the findings produced herein revealed that unprotected sex is the culmination of certain intersections between people's desire, their drug use, and the places where they use drugs and engage in unprotected sex. These findings highlight that researchers should now identify how these intersections yield unprotected sex.</p>

Because unprotected sex permits HIV transmission, and because the foregoing research indicates that such contacts occur at these events, it is important to understand the relationships between drug use, unprotected sex, and circuit parties. For these data to be useful for sexually transmitted infection (STI)/HIV prevention work, however, researchers must move beyond frequency descriptions; nurses who work in HIV prevention need in-depth, group-specific data that can be used to inform the development of targeted initiatives. To develop such knowledge, an in-depth, interview-based study was undertaken to examine how a group of gay men (<italic>n</italic> = 17) described their circuit party related sexual/drug-using practices.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1744987111415040"><title>Drug use, unprotected sex, gay men, and circuit parties</title>
<p>While an array of literature addresses the topics of drug use, unprotected sex, and gay men, there is very little information about how these items relate to circuit parties. Indeed, there are only 10 research papers on this topic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1744987111415040">2</xref></sup> Of these articles, the quantitative studies reveal that unprotected sex occurs most frequently when individuals use drugs or report sensation-seeking, and that more drug use / unprotected sex occurs at circuit parties than elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111415040">Colfax et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111415040">Mansergh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111415040">Mattison et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987111415040">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111415040">Ross et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111415040">Patel et al., 2006</xref>). The qualitative studies, by comparison, are fewer in number and different in focus. In the first of these studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111415040">Lewis and Ross (1995)</xref> identified that circuit parties enable gay men to celebrate their community, notwithstanding heteronormativity and HIV/AIDS. In these contexts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111415040">Lewis and Ross (1995)</xref> insist, drug use allows everyday life to be forgotten. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111415040">Kurtz (2005)</xref>, meanwhile, found that gay men who attend circuit parties use drugs either to overcome negative emotions or to fulfil sexual desires. Lastly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987111415040">Westhaver (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987111415040">2006</xref>) suggested that the participants in his study attended circuit parties, used drugs, and had unprotected sex to be recognized. He argued that circuit parties are bodily experiences, locations of empowerment, and places where gay men can be ‘open’. In both Westhaver's and the other qualitative researchers’ work, therefore, a list of benefits emerged. This contrasts with the quantitative studies which focused on the consequences of drug use.</p>
<p>To understand the relationship between drug use and unprotected sex among gay men, but not in relation to circuit parties, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987111415040">Ostrow's (2000)</xref> summary article, in which he categorizes the extant literature on this topic into the following five categories, is useful: (1) drugs cause unprotected sex; (2) drugs permit sensation seeking; (3) substance use induces disinhibition and usually-controlled behaviour; (4) the context wherein drug use occurs facilitates unprotected sex; and (5) the relationship between drugs and unprotected sex is multi-factorial. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987111415040">Ostrow (2000)</xref> thus summarizes the literature on drugs and, in doing so, identifies the incongruent aspects of this work; for eample, some researchers claim a causal relationship while others refute it. If one approaches the literature on circuit parties using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987111415040">Ostrow's (2000)</xref> five categories, circuit party authors frequently incorporate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987111415040">Ostrow's (2000)</xref> second, third, and fourth explanations. No research has been undertaken to examine whether these explanations are valid, however. Current, current knowledge is based on an <italic>ex post facto</italic> use of these ideas to explain circuit party behaviour. In this context, the opposite strategy was employed: gay men who attend circuit parties were asked to explain their drug use and unprotected sexual practices.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1744987111415040" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Audio-recorded, one hour, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with men who fulfilled the following criteria: (1) self-identify as gay, (2) attend circuit parties, (3) consume drugs, and (4) engage in unprotected sex. Regarding this last point, sexual contacts could have been on-site at circuit parties, off-site with people met at the parties, or off-site as part of other events which are held in conjunction with the main party event (e.g. after parties and/or porn auditions). These interviews continued until data saturation occurred, and recruitment occurred as follows: (1) business cards were distributed at two circuit parties in Montréal, (2) posters were affixed in sexual health clinics, gay bars, gyms, and other gay/gay-friendly commercial venues, and (3) already interviewed participants were asked to refer people they know. Underpinning this research was the belief that, while many individuals may not be able to describe the motivations behind their behaviour, systematic data collection/analysis of many people's descriptions could identify similarities. Such data can then be used to identify group beliefs about certain practices.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1744987111415040"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>First, familiarization with the data occurred through multiple readings of the transcripts. Second, codes were generated based on the content of the statements, the overall meaning of the interview, the language and sentence structures employed by the interviewee, and the positioning of these within the larger socio-political context. This involved multiple readings of the text to identify metaphors. Third, the codes were aggregated into themes, which involved ranking the codes, and producing sub-themes. Fourth, the themes were reviewed; the coded interview data was evaluated to ensure the codes belonged together. Fifth, the themes were defined and named. Here, the content of each theme was articulated both independently and in relation to the other themes. Sixth, there was a search to find cases that did not fit the model and these negative cases served as a foundational element in determining saturation.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1744987111415040" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>In total, 17 interviews were undertaken, and analysis yielded the following themes: (1) the participants' behaviour was the outcome of external/internal forces; (2) the participants purposively used drugs and attended circuit parties to manipulate the external/internal forces that affect their behaviour.

<sec id="sec6-1744987111415040"><title>1. Behaviour and external/internal forces</title>
<sec id="sec7-1744987111415040"><title>1.1 Internal forces</title>
<p>The first theme that emerged described the factors that impel the participants’ behaviour. One important aspect in this process was the participants’ internal forces; what they described as their drives, feelings, motivations, and perceptions – what has been categorized using the term ‘force’ herein. The following quotations illustrate how different participants employed different terminology, but did so to describe a common situation: an inner potency that incites behaviour. The participants state:<disp-quote>
<p>So it's not a positive desire or even a negative desire; it's a burst of something that then disappears. It's this element that takes us over. (Ott-13)</p>
<p>It's not like I have expectations – it's whatever I’m feeling that day or evening. (Ott-3)</p>
<p>I do a lot of stuff [sexually], but it depends on my mood. I can't tell you step by step. (TO-2)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The above excerpts illustrate that the participants experience a drive which is powerful and compels their behaviour, but which they are unable to properly describe. Other participants support the controlling nature of this internal force. Ott-6 states:<disp-quote>
<p>Depending how horny I am, I will fantasize about what I want to do and about the type of person I want to meet. The intensity of my sexual desire also affects the way I dress. (Ott-6)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, Ott-6 describes how his fantasies affect his overall comportment: his ‘dress’, his ‘attitude’, and his ‘fantasize[s]’. Ultimately, this statement supports the idea that the research participants’ behaviour is influenced by an array of factors, one of which is internal. This internal drive, however, was only one of the forces that the participants described.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1744987111415040"><title>1.2 External forces</title>
<p>In addition to internal forces, the participants reported that external factors influence their behaviour. The physical environment, social norms, and societal dictates about physical beauty, to name a few, combine and influence how the participants behave. This category thus encompasses, on the one hand, the intangible constructs that surround the social interpretations of ontology, epistemology, history, and politics, while on the other hand, it relates to the physical attributes of the real world. The following participant gives an example of the former type of external force when he suggests that knowledge modifies human behaviour:<disp-quote>
<p>Understanding human behaviour is a form of policing. It is not repressive, but it could be guiding in the opening you refer people to when they need help. (Ott-13)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For Ott-13, knowledge is ‘a form of policing’ because it can guide behaviour. What Ott-13 describes here resembles the contemporary use of group-based research data as a comparison point for individual analysis (i.e. how does an individual measure up against group norms?). Ott-5, meanwhile, articulated that responsibility is another important external force that affects behaviour. In the quotation below, Ott-5 illustrates this point in relation to personal obligations:<disp-quote>
<p>Even if I’m with a guy, it [sex] won't happen. You’re thinking about your dog, your Mum, and everybody that's waiting for you at home. So I just say no. (Ott-5)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, Ott-5 describes how he limits his sexual activities because of his dog, mother, and others waiting for him at home. It is not that these people and animals force his behaviour, but rather, that they exert an intangible, and powerful, force which – while manifesting within him – relates to external objects (i.e. other people and animals). This quotation exemplifies the effect of many external forces: it is his sense of social obligation and responsibility, not a physical force that guides his behaviour. The outcome, nonetheless, changes his behaviour.</p>
<p>However, external forces were not simply described in relation to moral norms; contextual norms were also part of this process. For example, Ott-10 and Ott-6 state that Montréal's social atmosphere induces behaviour that would not occur in other settings:<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve done worse things than I ever thought I’d do in my life in Montréal. There just seems to be no judgment. Complete freedom I guess. (Ott-10)</p>
<p>In Montréal, there's passion. I dress differently if I go to Montréal because there's more acceptance, more sexual appeal. It's fashion; it's touching, and there's a certain kind of language in these environments. (Ott-6)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For Ott-10 and Ott-7, Montréal is different from other cities, a perception that these two men believe changes their behaviour. Again, the situation that the participants describe is one wherein the internal process of choosing one's behaviour is influenced by external forces: it is Montréal's ambience that influences Ott-10's and Ott-6's perceptions and ultimately affects their behaviour. These forces remain, however, externally situated. Similarly, other participants reported how social perceptions of the body were a powerful external force – this external force was so powerful that some participants reported how cultural perceptions of beauty and physical attractiveness actually change their practices. Ott-2 illustrates this:<disp-quote>
<p>If I'm with someone just to get off, then it doesn't matter. I’ve already fulfilled my needs. But if it’s someone who I'm really attracted to, or we had a good connection, then I definitely want to get them off as well. I’m more into it. (Ott-2)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here Ott-2 reports that his sexual behaviour, whether or not he ‘get[s his sex partner] off as well’ that is, is greatly influenced by his physical attraction or connection with this person. He satisfies others if/when he finds them attractive. Another participant echoed this sentiment when he reported that he only receives anal penetration from attractive partners:<disp-quote>
<p>I prefer sucking, being sucked, or fucking, but I will get fucked. Basically, though, it's a favour to them if they’re hot or if they have a nice cock that I want to suck. (Ott-1)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Ott-1 illustrates in the above statement that physical attractiveness changes his behaviour. As with the cases above, this occurs entirely in a non-physical, but nevertheless, sufficiently real, realm to influence and modify behaviour. This process is somewhat easier to understand in relation to the effect of the physical environment, which Ott-5 describes in relation to the effect of attending a circuit party that is far from his home. The distance interferes with his impulses to engage in prolonged substance use and sexual activity:<disp-quote>
<p>I have a 2-hour drive [to get home]. So, when I go to Montréal and a guy's attracted to me I will tell him to go find somebody else. If he dances with me, fine; if he kisses me, fine; but if he wants more, [I tell him] I'm not there for sex.</p>
<p><bold>Is that just due to having to drive home?</bold></p>
<p>Yeah. If it weren't, it would be a different story. (Ott-5)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>According to Ott-5, driving home prevents him from engaging potential sexual partners. Ott-10 provides another example of this form of external influence. In this case, however, it is context, not distance that affects behaviour. Indeed, in the situation Ott-10 describes it is the fact that he is in a straight bar that affects his behaviour: ‘A while ago, I left a straight party to go to a gay bar in the middle of the night’. For Ott-10, the nature of his environment restricts his desires, thus requiring him to either acquiesce to the situation or directly act to change it. This process describes a situation wherein the external environment, in this case as a result of both the physical and social contexts, was powerful enough to influence behaviour: Ott-10 left the bar. Other participants (noted above) supported this finding.</p>
<p>Another frequently reported external force was drug use. The participants reported that drugs caused profound effects on sexual performance, perception, and judgment, to name a few. Note the effects that the following participants ascribe to drug use:<disp-quote>
<p>You do drugs to lower your inhibitions so that you will try things that you wouldn't on a regular basis. But if you don't do the drugs, you’re not going to go there. (TO-1)</p>
<p>I think it MIGHT kind of get rid of SOME inhibitions, but I don't think that it actually changes your values. (Ott-4)</p>
<p>Sometimes you wish you would be able to do it [have sex], but there's so many risks, moral values, or whatever. But then, once the drugs set in, things can be done more easily. (Ott-10)</p>
<p>There's tension because you WANT sex, but like I said, you can't get HARD, so you’re not having any; so there's also a tension in your body. (Ott-5)</p>
<p>I don't bottom unless I’m high. It hurts if I don't, and if I'm high then it doesn't. If, as well, I want to try something new, then your inhibitions are gone; you just put down your walls and you go when you’re under the influence. (Ott-11)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For these participants, drugs (which are external agents that alter people's internal forces) profoundly affected their physiological states. For TO-1 and Ott-4, this allowed for greater exploration, for the removal of ‘inhibitions [to] try things that [one] normally wouldn't’. Ott-10 described the same process of consuming drugs to indulge in desired activities. For Ott-5, meanwhile, drugs induced a state of tension as a consequence of erectile dysfunction. These substances thus modify the normal processes associated sexual arousal. Ott-11 described using drugs to achieve a similar effect – the only difference being that Ott-11 enjoyed how these external agents permit him to be penetrated anally without pain. In combination, these five quotations thus illustrate that an array of external forces influence the participants' internal forces, to such an extent that atypical (out of character) behaviour can transpire.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1744987111415040"><title>2. Using external forces to achieve desired outcomes</title>
<sec id="sec10-1744987111415040"><title>2.1 Purposive drug use to achieve desired outcomes</title>
<p>The second theme that emerged described (1) how the participants’ unprotected sexual behaviour was the culmination of numerous interactions between many internal and external forces, and (2) that they intentionally used external forces to achieve specific outcomes – ones that they desired, that their internal forces impelled, that is. Regarding sexual practices, the most pertinent of these exchanges involved the participants’ drug use to intentionally facilitate unprotected sex. This process is evident in the following excerpt, wherein Ott-15 reveals that drugs do not cause him to do things that he did not intend, but rather, that he purposively uses them to achieve specific outcomes. In this case, this is enhanced sexual experiences:<disp-quote>
<p>I don't do things because of drugs. The drugs are there to stimulate and arouse your desire, to add to the whole sexual experience, I guess. (Ott-15)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here Ott-15 articulates that he purposively uses drugs to enhance his ‘sexual experience[s]’ – a process which reveals how drugs can be used to achieve desired and desirable outcomes. They are an external agent that can be selected to manipulate one's internal forces. Similarly, TO-1 reports that he prefers sex when intoxicated because drugs allow him to ‘get more into it’, to ‘try new things’ and to indulge his preferences. He states:<disp-quote>
<p><bold>Would you rather have sex with or without drugs?</bold></p>
<p>I prefer it with drugs. It changes my limitations, and I can get more into it with drugs than without. I’m more susceptible to suggestion, and I will try new things; things that I would normally not try. (TO-1)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For TO-1, drugs are a means by which he can intentionally explore new sensations. These substances enable him to ‘get more into’ the situation’ and to ‘[be]come more susceptible to suggestion’. It is not that the outcomes are unexpected; rather, he prefers sex when intoxicated because he desires to change his limitations. This exemplifies the essence of this theme: the participants used drugs (external forces) to modify their internal forces that prevent them from engaging in sexual experiences that they desire. Another example of this intentional drug consumption to produce desired outcomes occurred in relation to orgasm for Ott-6:<disp-quote>
<p>Drugs allow you to last longer, so arousal and climax are a lot stronger. It's very enjoyable. (Ott-6)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Ott-6 reports purposive drug use to delay orgasm and to experience that increase in stimulation and sensation that corresponds with this delay. The forces that Ott-6 overcomes are not psychological (as was the case with Ott-15), thus suggesting that purposive drug use (the intentional use of specific external forces) can also relate to thephysical parameters of the participants’ bodies: delayed orgasm and enhanced arousal (Ott-6).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1744987111415040"><title>2.2 Circuit party attendance and desired outcomes</title>
<p>In addition to the effects that drugs can induce, other participants described the importance of place. For example, TO-1 stressed that it is not simply drugs that produce the effects he desires; rather, it isdrug use within specific milieux which culminates in the outcomes that he searches for. TO-1 states:<disp-quote>
<p>I’ve gone to parties, stayed for hours, and then walked out the door because I could have done a pound of drugs and it wouldn't have helped. Everybody would still be standing, looking stupid, and stoned. (TO-1)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here TO-1 adds an important nuance: drugs cannot be understood in isolation of the context wherein they are ingested and experienced. Ott-5 reinforces this point:<disp-quote>
<p>I wouldn't go with just booze. At one point you need drugs to dance and be awake. I’ve had friends who went without [drugs], and at 2 a.m. they had enough. Compared to us who are on drugs, at 3 a.m. you’re tired, [you] pop another one. (Ott-5)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Ott-5's quotation highlights a delicate intersection between drugs, partying, and context. On the one hand, Ott-5 uses drugs because of the effects that they can induce, while on the other hand, he attends specific places because of the potential effect that these environments can have on his drug using experiences. Thus, the effect both of drugs and of these parties that the participants reported desiring occurred when these two forces intersected, that is, when they used drugs within environments with the appropriate ambiance. Ott-5 and two other participants describe this process further:<disp-quote>
<p>It's the combination of the music, the atmosphere, and the drugs. (Ott-5)</p>
<p>You’re surrounded by hot guys; they’re buffed up; you’re on drugs; everybody looks good; the sex is there; it's reachable; you could have it. That's what I mean by sexual tension. (Ott-5)</p>
<p>It's a combination of the heat, the drugs, the alcohol, the loosening up, and the sexual environment. Then, the transition between a party and a bathhouse becomes muddled. (Ott-1)</p>
<p>I think it's because of the environment. I purposely go there for cruising, but part of the entertainment is the novelty of using drugs. (Ott-6)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In the foregoing excerpts, the participants clearly describe the importance of the intersections between drugs and place. It is the ‘combination’ of a series of external forces (drugs and location) and the participants’ desires (internal forces) to ‘go [to these parties] for cruising’. Thus, what the research participants recounted was neither an external process nor an internal one, but rather, a complicated interaction between internal and external forces. Nevertheless, the participants described how they would purposively select and utilize specific external forces, whether drugs or party venue, in an effort to manipulate their internal forces and then achieve the outcomes that they desired. Indeed, the participants’ desires for specific outcomes were achieved when they placed themselves in environments where specific external forces would negate other internal forces that prevent the actualization of these desires.</p>

<p>The foregoing results indicate that the participants’ unprotected sexual practices were the outcome of multiple interactions between an array of internal and external forces, such as personal desires, the places where partying/sex occurs, social norms, and the psychotropic and/or expected effects of certain drugs. This means that the participants’ desires, drug use, or party attendance, in isolation, did not directly cause unprotected sex. It was the intersection of these forces, in the correct combination/quantity and at the right time, which culminated in such encounters. This interrelationship became apparent because it was impossible, during data analysis, to discern the independent effects of the participants’ desires, drug use, and places of drug use / sexual activity. Thus, as part of examining unprotected sex among a sub-set of gay men who attend circuit parties in Montréal, this project indicates that, for some men at least, unprotected sex is the outcome of an array of interrelated factors. The relationship between drugs and unprotected sex that previous researchers have identified (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111415040">Mansergh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111415040">Mattison et al., 2001</xref>) thus appears valid, but more complicated than portrayed.</p>
<p>In other words, this research highlights that there was no single drug or method of drug use, type of person or specific desire, identifiable party locale or particular party environment that caused unprotected sex. The circuit party, while an environment wherein drug use and unprotected sex occurred, was not sufficient to cause unprotected sex. Similarly, people's desires for unprotected sex were not capable of inducing such sexual outcomes. Instead, it was a precise combination of the aforementioned factors that culminated in unprotected sex: the internal/external force interaction. It was the outcome of certain people, feeling in specific ways, with particular outlooks and perceptions about life/drugs/unprotected sex, ingesting certain drugs in precise milieux. This does not mean that there is only one set of predisposing factors that leads to unprotected sex; rather, many of the participants reported a unique sequence of events, places, and occurrences that made each of them more or less likely to engage in unprotected sex. This theme pervaded the research data.</p>
<p>Of interest, the assertions being made in this context about unprotected sex among gay men who attend circuit parties align with the extant research which focuses on the individual/drug/context specific factors that precede unprotected sex at circuit parties (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111415040">Mansergh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111415040">Dengenhardt and Topp, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111415040">Kurtz et al., 2005</xref>). More precisely, the current findings fall within the category of results that identifies the relationship between drug use and unprotected sex as being multifactorial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987111415040">Ostrow, 2000</xref>). The difference in this case is that the impact of drugs was directly modified by people's pre-existing desires and the place(s) where they have sex and arrange sexual encounters. These interrelations were not linear, however. For example, the participants described how they intentionally used drugs to facilitate specific sexual outcomes, but that this would only occur if, first, they were ‘in the right mood’, and second, the party ambiance was conducive to the occurrence of such behaviour. There was thus an array of interactions between social norms and drug use, personal desires and behaviour (whether sexual or drug use-related), drug use and sexual behaviour, drug use and context, and context and behaviour. The interrelationships were intricate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, the effects of desire and place have thus far been absent from discussions about circuit parties (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111415040">Colfax et al., 2001</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111415040">Ross et al., 2003</xref> for examples).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this absence the findings presented herein reinforce the available literature, which highlights that each of these items (i.e. desire, drugs, place) contributes to unprotected sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111415040">Colfax et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111415040">Mansergh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111415040">Mattison et al,. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111415040">Degenhardt and Topp, 2003</xref>; Less et al., 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111415040">Ross et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987111415040">Ghaziani and Cook, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111415040">Kurtz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111415040">Patel et al., 2006</xref>). It was simply noted in this case, however, that these forces also interact with and influence one another. For example, drug use affects people's perceptions of place, while places affect people's use of drugs, and both, in turn, affect behaviour independently and in combination; in addition, these factors also interact with people's desires, ultimately creating a sequence in which it is not one single force that predicts behaviour, but the combination of all three concurrently. This non-linear intersectionality is important because it emphasizes that researchers must examine not only the interrelationships between desire, drugs, or place and a person's behaviour (as occurred in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111415040">Mansergh et al., 2001</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111415040">Mattison et al., 2001</xref>), but also the intersections that occur between these three items and the behavioural outcome of interest. A comprehensive investigation should occur, wherein researchers would examine how the sum-total influence of these items induces a more profound effect that each could produce independently.</p>
<p>One benefit of such a gestaltist explanation is that it mitigates some of the conflicts within the extant literature on drugs, drug use, and unprotected sex. For example, some researchers argue that drugs cause unprotected sex, while others insist that unprotected sex is context, not drug, dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987111415040">Ostrow, 2000</xref>). The findings presented above suggest that both are influential, and that both conclusions are correct; they are simply two parts of the same equation. This indicates that the current knowledge about drug use, unprotected sex, gay men, and circuit parties must be interpreted with other information about the nature, scope, and ambiance of the places where gay men use drugs and have unprotected sex. Behaviour, drugs, and people cannot be understood in isolation of their context. Simultaneously, people's desires must also be explored as an important part of the sequence that leads toward unprotected sex.</p>
<p>These findings also shed light on the literature about circuit parties. In relation to the quantitative data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111415040">Colfax et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111415040">Mansergh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111415040">Mattison et al., 2001</xref>; Less et al., 2002; Rose et al., 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111415040">Patel et al., 2006</xref>), they suggest that the increased quantity of drug consumption that is associated with circuit parties is one of the reasons why people attend these venues. Some gay men attend circuit parties to use drugs and have unprotected sex. This aligns with previous research about sensation seeking as a predictive factor for drug use at circuit parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111415040">Mansergh et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover the occurrence of unprotected sex may not always be accidental. Circuit parties do not induce drug use; rather, some gay men purposively attend these parties so that they can be in a place where increased drug use is permissible. They intentionally place themselves within these milieux and ingest specific substances to fulfil their desires. However, more data are needed on this topic before such assertions of sequentiality can be made definitively.</p>
<p>Regarding the qualitative data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111415040">Lewis and Ross, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111415040">Kurtz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987111415040">Westhaver, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987111415040">2006</xref>), these findings reinforce the importance of exploring local narratives. Thus far, researchers have exclusively identified that circuit parties serve as places to escape the hardships of everyday life, that they permit disinhibition, and that they are bodily experiences wherein gay men can feel empowered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111415040">Lewis and Ross, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111415040">Kurtz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987111415040">Westhaver, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987111415040">2006)</xref>. Adding to these important findings is that circuit parties are also the outcome or culmination of desire. It is, therefore, not drugs, drug use, specific people, or particular places that induce unprotected sex; instead, it is some combination thereof that yields these outcomes.</p>
<sec id="sec13-1744987111415040"><title>Nursing implications and next steps</title>
<p>The above-noted findings suggest that individual and community level nursing practice, particularly when it involves sexual health assessments and interventions, needs subtle refinements. Nursing interventions that address unprotected sex must include not only drug-related aspects, but also desire-focused and place-based initiatives. For example, to encourage a reduction in drug use (in an effort to decrease STI/HIV transmission), without comprehensively exploring why, when, and where these substances are ingested might not yield the targeted outcomes of decreased unprotected sex. Indeed, although drugs may often precede unprotected sex (and thus appear to be an ideal item for health promotion or illness prevention practice), to focus exclusively on drug use in isolation would be to negate the complexities and intricacies that make unprotected sex more likely to occur in certain places, with certain people, and under certain conditions. Drug use is only one component in this equation, and nurses must recognize this important fact.</p>
<p>Such findings could similarly mean that front-line nurses should explore the roles of desire and place in patients sexual life style – this is particularly important when patients report drug use and unprotected sex during a sexual health or general health examination. As above, a failure to acknowledge the multifactorial nature of unprotected sex, drug use, party attendance, and desire might diminish the potential occurrence of targeted prevention outcomes. That is, front-line nurses may not adequately grasp their patients’ behaviour if and/or when sophisticated, multifactorial examinations are not undertaken to explore the nuances that render each patient more or less likely to engage in certain behaviour under certain conditions.</p>
<p>As part of this, nurse researchers must continue to examine the role, significance, and meaning of desire, drugs, and place (as an interrelated sequence), and they must do so in an effort to better understand and explain the relationships between these items – particularly as these relationships relate to the occurrence of unprotected sex. This process should thus include investigations that shed light on local narratives about how specific internal and external forces yield specific outcomes (such as unprotected sex) among different subpopulations. The findings of this work could then be used to inform group-specific STI/HIV prevention initiatives that are sensitive to the specific socio-political and cultural contexts of diverse groups who are disproportionately burdened by STI/HIV (e.g. gay men). Lastly, these explorations of unprotected sex must approach this topic with awareness that some of the factors that predict unprotected sex only do so because of the presence of other items, which in this case, was the interaction between the internal and external forces of desire, drugs, and place. A failure to acknowledge these interrelationships could overly simplify research results and findings.</p>
