<abstract>
<p>Survivors of community traumatic events (CTEs) are thought to be at an increased risk for suicide. Current studies of the impact of CTEs on suicide have (a) produced varied results and (b) not accounted for co-occurrences or series of CTEs. The purpose of this study was to determine if a relationship exists between the temporal distribution of CTEs and the temporal distribution of suicide and calls to the crisis hotline in a Louisiana parish, taking into account co-occurrences and series of CTEs. The sample consisted of 11 years of data on suicidal deaths and 5 years of data on calls to the crisis hotline. Poisson regression was used to assess whether suicide patterns and hotline call volume were affected by CTEs. The distributions of suicide and calls to the crisis hotline were not affected by the presence of single, co-occurring, or series of CTEs. Though suicide prevention efforts are often increased after CTEs, this study indicates suicide prevention efforts should be ongoing and have a community-wide focus. Given the varied results across studies of CTE impact on suicide distributions, further research should focus on co-occurrence and series of CTEs rather than the historical trend of focusing on a single CTE. Also, psychological autopsies of people who died by suicide in the wake of a CTE should be conducted using phenomenology as the guiding qualitative paradigm.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is evidence that certain types of exposure, specifically being a survivor of suicide (i.e., person left behind to grieve the loss of a loved one to suicide; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765612471145">Prigerson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765612471145">Qin, Agerbo, &amp; Mortensen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534765612471145">Runeson &amp; Åsberg, 2003</xref>) and exposure to media coverage of suicide (i.e., the Werther and Cobain effects) may increase the likelihood of a person dying by suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612471145">Frei et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612471145">Jobes, Berman, O’Carroll, Eastgard, &amp; Knickmeyer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765612471145">Phillips, 1974</xref>). Each suicide in the United States leaves at least six (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534765612471145">Shneidman, 1969</xref>) survivors with varying relationships—up to 24 unique relationships—to the deceased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612471145">Campbell, 2001</xref>) to grieve.</p>
<p>Being a survivor of suicide and being exposed to media coverage of suicides are not the only risk factors that may contribute to a person’s likelihood of dying by suicide. Situational factors are also important. Some of the most common factors found among people who kill themselves are hopelessness, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765612471145">Goldsmith, Pellmar, Kleinman, &amp; Bunney, 2002</xref>). These often have a situational component, usually in the form of a precipitating event that serves as a trigger (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534765612471145">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534765612471145">Kessler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534765612471145">Seligman, 1998</xref>). A precipitating event may be direct (experienced or observed) or secondary (e.g., being close to someone who experienced or observed the event, experiencing the event through media coverage; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534765612471145">Seligman, 1998</xref>). Some examples of extreme stressors include sexual assault, physical assault, combat, automobile accidents, life-threatening illnesses, and natural and human-made disasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534765612471145">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Natural and human-made disasters, which will be termed <italic>community traumatic events</italic> (CTEs), are types of extreme stressors of particular interest to the prevention of suicide given events such as the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the devastation of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and college shootings. CTEs encompass a wide range of occurrences. Examples of naturally occurring CTEs are tornadoes, hurricanes, and blizzards; whereas recent human-made CTE examples include the Okalahoma City bombing, Columbine School shootings, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the London bombings in 2005, and the shootings at Virginia Tech in 2007, Northern Illinois University in 2008, and the University of Texas at Austin in 2010. To qualify as a CTE, the survivors of the crisis, regardless of whether it occurred in the community of interest, experience changes in their daily lives due to the occurrence. This change results in an overwhelming, often paralyzing situation beyond their immediate control for which they feel woefully inadequate to survive. These changes may elicit an emotional response including depression and/or anxiety, which are complicated by other changes including economic stress and limitations to daily activities (e.g., curfews, increased traffic, and shortages of resources).</p>
<p>In the time period after these CTEs, there are many factors that may continue to retraumatize the survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765612471145">James &amp; Gilliland, 2001</xref>) ultimately leading to what 30 years of suicide research has deemed the most common underlying risk for suicide: hopelessness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765612471145">Goldsmith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612471145">Van Orden et al., 2010</xref>) or psychache—intense, psychological pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534765612471145">Shneidman, 1969</xref>). This raises several questions: Might suicide rates increase in the aftermath of human-made and natural-made CTEs? Is it not also possible that the likelihood of this might increase when a community is victimized in a series of CTEs, adding to the psychache of many residents already in a state of hopelessness due to internal crises? Might a community’s crisis hotline serve as a preventive mechanism in the aftermaths of CTEs? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534765612471145">Shneidman (1985)</xref> emphasizes that there is no one attribute, condition, or event that is solely responsible for a person’s death by suicide. Suicide’s cause is multidimensional and it is necessary to study different contributing factors in this “multidimensional malaise” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534765612471145">Shneidman, 1985</xref>). The impact of CTEs as one contributing piece to the puzzle of why people die by suicide is the focus of this study. The purpose of this study was to determine if a relationship exists between CTEs and the temporal distribution of suicide and calls to the local suicide and crisis hotline in a metropolitan parish in Louisiana.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The consideration of temporal patterns in the distribution of suicide has long been a focus with studies of regional variations first emerging in the late 1800s (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612471145">Durkheim, 1897/1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534765612471145">Morselli, 1882</xref>). The foci in these studies have varied to include days of the week, months of the year, weather seasons, media coverage, and CTEs among others. Morselli observed an increase in suicides during the warmer months and attributed these to the heat. Durkheim observed not only similar patterns related to seasons and months of the year but also patterns related to days of the week: Suicide rates tended to be fairly consistent Monday through Thursday then decrease on Friday and slowly return to the consistent rate observed Monday through Thursday. He posited that these were related to the social interaction patterns of the areas rather than weather. Durkheim theorized that these patterns observed in the rate of suicide across seasons, months of the year, and days of the week can all be explained by differences in activity with times with increased activity having increased rates of suicide and times of more rest, less activity, and thus more social interaction such as the weekends having fewer suicides.</p>
<p>The focus on temporal patterns related to days of the week, months of the year, weather seasons has continued in suicide research; however, a decrease in these patterns began to emerge in studies of various countries’ patterns (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765612471145">Barraclough &amp; White, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534765612471145">Lyster, 1973</xref>) with current research indicating a decrease or absence in these trends, especially in Western countries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534765612471145">Ajdacic-Gross, Bopp, Ring, Gutzwiller, &amp; Rossler, 2010</xref> [review of studies since 1990s]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534765612471145">Rihmer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534765612471145">Yip, Chao, &amp; Chiu, 2000</xref>). These decreases have been explained through increased social connectedness via the Internet and other technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534765612471145">Yip et al., 2000</xref>), more widespread treatment of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534765612471145">Rihmer, 2011</xref>), and possible methodological flaws in previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534765612471145">Ajdacic-Gross et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612471145">Hakko, Räsänen, Tihonen, &amp; Nieminen, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Apart from variations in temporal patterns of suicide, patterns in suicide related to media coverage of suicides have also been studied. There is evidence that media coverage of suicides results in increases in the rate of suicide in the geographical area receiving the media exposure. These increases are proportional to the amount of media coverage focused on the suicide. This phenomenon is referred to as the Werther Effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765612471145">Phillips, 1974</xref>) and has not only been identified after suicide media coverage but also after coverage of assisted suicides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612471145">Frei et al., 2003</xref>). An effect similar to the Werther Effect is the Cobain Effect. This effect was identified after the suicide of rock star Kurt Cobain in 1994. Because of the Werther Effect, there was much concern voiced by the general public that Cobain’s suicide would cause a suicide contagion in the youth population of the Seattle area where he killed himself. Cobain’s suicide was followed by media attention referring people to the local crisis center and a candlelight vigil where his wife expressed her grief over his death. What was observed after the death was not a rise in the suicide rate as is observed with the Werther Effect but rather an increase in suicide-related phone calls to the local crisis center hotline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612471145">Jobes et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>CTEs have also been studied with one of the first being <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612471145">Biller’s (1977)</xref> assessment of the impact of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination on the rate of suicide in the United States. Since then, studies have continued on a wide range of events including sporting events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612471145">Joiner, Hollar, &amp; Van Orden, 2006</xref>), the death of Princess Diana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612471145">Hawton et al., 2000</xref>), and the September 11th terrorist attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765612471145">deLange &amp; Neeleman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534765612471145">Salib, 2003</xref>) with varied results. Those variations in results will be discussed in this literature review after a discussion of the experiences of survivors of CTEs from the related research.</p>
<sec id="section3-1534765612471145">
<title>What Do Survivors Experience in the Wake of a CTE?</title>
<p>The experiences of people who were in the path of Hurricane Andrew are particularly relevant in creating a picture of what an extreme crisis state due to a naturally occurring CTE entails. Hurricane Andrew ransacked the Florida peninsula in late August of 1992 leaving many (an estimated 200,000) homeless and pensive about their previously “safe” world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534765612471145">Shelby and Tredinnick (1995)</xref> assisted the American Red Cross in relief services as part of the American Red Cross Disaster Mental Health Services Team. They noted a feeling of perceived powerlessness among survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534765612471145">Shelby &amp; Treddinick, 1995</xref>). Among adults, there was a clear distinction between those who saw the crisis as a learning experience and opportunity for growth and those who saw Andrew as a “last straw on the proverbial camel’s back” thrusting them into a state of hopelessness and despair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534765612471145">Shelby &amp; Tredinnick, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534765612471145">Phifer (1990)</xref> conducted a study after a flood to gauge the effects on the mental well-being of older adults exposed to this naturally occurring CTE. Findings indicate that depression and anxiety increased and remained at this increased level up to 18 months after the event. Additionally, Phifer concludes that the effect of natural disasters on an older adult’s psychological well-being is comparable to the effects of bereavement, severe health problems, and financial distress.</p>
<p>Studies after the Oklahoma City bombing, a human-made CTE, reveal the issue of indirect victimization in CTEs. The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma exploded on April 19, 1995 as the product of terrorist activity, resulting in the loss of 168 lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534765612471145">Zinner &amp; Williams, 1999</xref>). One study of 3,218 middle and high school students surveyed 7 weeks after the bombing, indicated that female students exhibited significantly higher levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms than male students. Of the students with a score of 65 or more on the Posttraumatic Stress Symptom Scale, only 15% sought counseling which is consistent with the silent suffering or numbing that is inherent in posttraumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612471145">Pfefferbaum, Sconzo, Flynn, &amp; Kearns, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A more recent example of a human-made CTE is the events of September 11. On September 11, 2001, the United States of America was violently attacked by terrorists on her shores in New York; Washington, DC; and Pennsylvania. A study using a randomized, representative sample revealed that 3 to 5 days after the attacks, more than 90% of adults across the nation were experiencing at least one posttraumatic stress symptom as were 35% of children. Additionally, it was reported that 47% of children were more vigilant about their safety and the safety of their family. Adult Americans watched an average of 8 hours of television coverage (children averaged 3 hours) of the events and individuals’ intensity of stress symptoms was positively correlated with the amount of television coverage viewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534765612471145">Schuster et al., 2001</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1534765612471145">
<title>Studies of the Impacts of CTEs</title>
<p>Though several studies of the impact of CTEs on the distribution of suicide exist, a handful will be discussed here for the sake of brevity: John F. Kennedy’s assassination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612471145">Biller, 1977</xref>), the death of Princess Diana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612471145">Hawton et al., 2000</xref>), sporting events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612471145">Joiner et al., 2006</xref>), and the September 11th terrorist attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765612471145">deLange &amp; Neeleman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534765612471145">Salib, 2003</xref>). The results of these studies are varied with Biller, Joiner et al., and Salib finding decreases or an absence of suicides the day or month of the respective events studied. Since the CTEs in these studies engendered feelings of patriotism (John F. Kennedy’s assassination, Princess Diana’s death) and community cohesiveness (sporting events), Joiner et al. explained the decreases as due to a rise in belongingness in the communities affected by CTEs, found to be protective against suicide. However, Hawton et al. and deLange and Neeleman noted increases in the rates of suicide in the month and 2 months following the events, respectively. Not only are the results varied in these studies of the impacts of CTEs but also methodological components vary with some researchers looking at changes in the rate of suicide for the day of the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612471145">Biller, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612471145">Joiner et al., 2006</xref>), and others looking at a range of days from 9 days to 2 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612471145">Biller, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765612471145">deLange &amp; Neeleman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612471145">Hawton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534765612471145">Salib, 2003</xref>), different from the conventional 6-day period often used.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The study qualified and was approved for exemption from the institutional review board because of the use of secondary data. The study included three samples of data: (a) the sample of suicide death data was obtained from the parish coroner’s office and included deaths from 1994 through 2004; (b) the sample of CTEs was obtained through the front page of the sole newspaper for the parish for the same time period, and (c) the sample of calls to the suicide and crisis hotline was obtained from the crisis center operating the hotline in the parish studied and covered 2000 through 2004 since data prior to that were not available. The questions guiding the research were (a) What are the patterns and prevalences of suicide, CTEs, and calls to the hotline? (b) Are there more suicides in the aftermath of CTEs as compared with non-CTE periods? (c) Was the difference in number of suicides due to the CTEs or chance? and (d) Did the presence of an active, well-managed hotline affect the results?</p>
<sec id="section6-1534765612471145">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The sample of suicide death data from the parish coroner’s office included 442 suicides. The distribution of suicides studied was, for the most part, descriptively similar to what is observed nationally in terms of age, gender, race, and method. Youth suicide and elderly suicide are the two largest concentrations by age of suicide in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612471145">McIntosh &amp; Drapeau, 2012</xref>). This concentration of youth suicide was present in the study parish but the elderly concentration was not. Nationally, it is observed that men die by suicide four times more often than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612471145">McIntosh &amp; Drapeau, 2012</xref>). In this parish’s 11-year long sample of suicides, the same phenomenon was observed (n<sub>Males</sub> = 348, 78.7%; n<sub>Females</sub> = 94, 21.3%). Nationally, White people die by suicide more often than any other race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612471145">McIntosh &amp; Drapeau, 2012</xref>). The same was noted in the study parish (n<sub>White</sub> = 346, 78.3%; n<sub>Black</sub> = 90, 20.4%; n<sub>Other</sub> = 6, 1.4%). Both nationally and in the parish (county) of interest, the most common method of death for suicide was gunshot wound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612471145">McIntosh &amp; Drapeau, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>For the second sample, CTEs experienced by residents of the selected parish, both natural and human-made, were identified by initial date of announcement to the parish through the major, sole local newspaper. A recording form was developed and validated to identify initial date of announcement, whether the CTE was a suicide, assisted suicide, human-made, or naturally occurring event and whether the CTE was local, state, regional, national, or international in breadth of impact. As noted previously, there is evidence that suicides and calls to crisis hotlines increase after media coverage of suicides (i.e., the Werther and Cobain effects; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612471145">Jobes et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765612471145">Phillips, 1974</xref>) and assisted suicides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612471145">Frei et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, suicides and assisted suicides covered by the media were included as CTEs since these may have affected suicide rates and suicide hotline call volume.</p>
<p>For identification and classification decisions about CTEs, a decision flowchart was developed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534765612471145">Figure 1</xref>) and content validity was established among two colleagues. The two colleagues each, independently, identified and categorized an abbreviated list of events using the decision flowchart. The colleagues met and compared their identifications and categorizations. Their identifications and categorizations were identical 97% of the time (interrater reliability).</p>

<p>For the third sample of calls made to the crisis hotline serving the parish, the executive director of the crisis intervention center managing the hotline authorized the use of call data on calls answered by the hotline from 2000 through 2004. In retrieving these data, it emerged that the crisis center would only be able to provide data for 2000 through 2004. Records prior to 2000 were not available. The researcher included the variables: age of caller, gender of caller, race of caller, date of call, and type of call.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study was to determine if a relationship exists between CTEs and the temporal distribution of suicide and calls to the local suicide and crisis hotline in a metropolitan parish in Louisiana. Four component questions guided the data analysis: What are the patterns and prevalences of suicide, CTEs, and calls to the hotline? Are there more suicides in the aftermath of CTEs as compared with non-CTE periods? Was the difference in number of suicides because of the CTEs or chance? Finally, does the presence of a well-managed suicide and crisis hotline influence the effects of CTEs on the likelihood of suicides? The data were analyzed using multivariate techniques such as Poisson regression analysis. However, prior to the multivariate analysis, aggregate properties of all the variables were examined. Furthermore, in preparation for multivariate analysis, the data were prepared to possess distributional properties such as “no autocorrelation” assumed for the Poisson regression estimation. To assess the patterns and prevalences of suicide, CTEs, and calls to the hotline, the lagged autocorrelation function in SPSS Trends was used with a minimum of 1 lag and a maximum of 16 lags using the default Box–Ljung Q-test to assess whether there were predictable trends in the data. The Box–Ljung Q-test is a well-known tool for assessing if a number of autocorrelations taken together in a time series are different from zero. The indication of trends necessitated further description and removal of these predictable trends prior to analysis. Ordinary least squares regression was used for this purpose and for identification and removal of influential outliers. Pearson correlations were used to identify any variance in suicide explained by the date of the observation. Because it is possible that statistically significant autocorrelation among residuals may make significance testing using the <italic>F</italic>-statistic invalid, the Box–Ljung Q-test was computed for the residuals. During this process, outliers were also assessed for leverage and influence.</p>
<p>To answer the question of whether there are more suicides in the aftermath of CTEs as compared with non-CTE periods, given previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612471145">Biller, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765612471145">deLange &amp; Neeleman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612471145">Hawton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612471145">Joiner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534765612471145">Salib, 2003</xref>), it is reasonable to assume that soon after a CTE, the likelihood of suicide may change significantly. If CTEs increase the risk for suicide in a community, the effects on the number of suicides are more likely to be delayed than instantaneous. In this study, we assumed a risk period of 6 days post-CTE for heightened suicide risk. In many instances, the 6-day periods, labeled risk days, following the community events overlapped. This occurred when more than one CTE was observed within the 6 days of risk associated with a prior event. Many of the previous studies have focused on a sole event rather than investigating the possible effects of overlapping events. To assess whether there is a statistically significant difference between average number of deaths occurring during risk days and nonrisk days, a <italic>t</italic> test was conducted.</p>
<p>To discern whether the difference in number of suicides was due to the CTEs or chance, a multivariate approach useful for analyzing the number of deaths per day is Poisson regression. In this study, no deaths were reported for a large proportion of the days observed with the likelihood of overdispersion. Chi-square tests may be used to detect the violation of assumption of no dispersion in Poisson regression modeling. The problem of dispersion occurs when the assumption of equality of mean and variance in the count outcome variable is violated. This assumption is evaluated using the likelihood ratio (<italic>LR</italic>) tests. The null hypothesis of no dispersion is rejected when <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-1534765612471145">

The data were therefore analyzed using negative binomial regression, a variant of Poisson regression, of death counts during 2000-2004 in parish on risk days and volume of calls.</p>
<p>Finally, to determine if the presence of a well-managed suicide and crisis hotline influences the effects of CTEs on the likelihood of suicides, the net effect of “risk days” on deaths was examined after controlling for the number of calls to the crisis hotline per day. Data on number of calls per day were compiled for the studied parish from 2000 to 2004. CTE data and the death data for the period 2000 to 2004 were combined with call data to form one data set for performing negative binomial regression of deaths on the risk days and the volume of calls.</p>

<title>What Are the Patterns and Prevalences of Suicide, CTEs, and Calls to the Hotline?</title>
<p>The selected parish experienced an average of 40 suicides per year (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.9) over the 11-year study period. The year 1997 had the most suicides. The majority of deaths by suicide were in the age categories “15-24 years old” (<italic>n</italic> = 89, 20.1%), “25-34 years old” (<italic>n</italic> = 98, 22.2%), and “34-45 years old” (<italic>n</italic> = 92, 20.8%). Males accounted for the majority of deaths (<italic>n</italic> = 348, 78.7%). Among those who died by suicide, the majority were White (<italic>n</italic> = 346, 78.3%). The most common method was gunshot wound (<italic>n</italic> = 303, 68.6%). Descriptive patterns of seasonality were observed: Fridays were the most common days for suicides and July the most common month.</p>
<p>It is hypothesized that CTEs alter the likelihood of suicides resulting in either an increase or decrease in the rate of suicides. An association between CTEs and suicide rates is likely to result in detectable trend in suicide rates over time. The 16 sets of lagged autocorrelations were significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) indicating that some trend may have been present. The indication of trends necessitated further description and removal of these predictable trends prior to analysis. Ordinary least squares regression was used for this purpose and for identification and removal of influential outliers. Pearson correlations revealed a negligible association between suicide and observation number (in this case, Julian Calendar date of death) that was not significant (<italic>r</italic> = .007, <italic>p</italic> = .329) with an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of less than .01 indicating that there is little if any variance in suicide explained by the date of the observation. The omnibus test was not significant (<italic>F</italic> = 0.195, <italic>p</italic> = .659). Because it is possible that statistically significant autocorrelation among residuals may make significance testing using the <italic>F</italic>-statistic invalid, the Box–Ljung Q-statistic was computed for the residuals indicating that the omnibus test was valid with the 16 sets of lagged autocorrelations being significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). During this process, outliers were also assessed for leverage and influence. Because none of the outliers exerted sufficient leverage and/or influence on the regression, no outliers were removed.</p>
<p>A total of 366 CTEs were identified for the time period. On 19 of the 4,015 days in this aspect of the study, the study parish sustained more than one CTE. The year with the most CTEs was 2002 with the study parish sustaining 63 CTEs. These 63 unique events occurred on 54 different days with 46 days having one CTE each, 7 days having two CTEs each, and 1 day having three CTEs. The year with the least CTEs was 2000, with the study parish sustaining only 13 CTEs. Of the CTEs sustained, too many to display in this article, a few are similar in nature to the CTEs in studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612471145">Biller (1977)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612471145">Joiner et al.

<p>Of the 442 suicides, only 145 occurred during days identified as risk days. The remaining 297 suicides occurred during days identified as nonrisk days. Thus, a large proportion of the deaths occurred during nonrisk days. More specifically, 145 suicides occurred during 1,228 days identified as risk days resulting in an average number of 0.12 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.345) suicides per risk day. The remaining 297 deaths occurred during 2,787 nonrisk days. The average death per nonrisk day is 0.11 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.326).

<title>Was the Difference in Number of Suicides Due to the CTEs or Chance?</title>
<p>The two data sets of death data and CTEs were combined to yield a data set with CTEs as well as the number of suicides reported each day during the 1994-2004 period in the parish studied. The occurrence of a CTE, either human-made or natural, was coded 1 and the rest 0. The deaths are assumed to be independent events distributed over 11 years. Our hypothesis is that the distribution of suicide over time may spike or ebb if CTEs either trigger or indirectly influence the occurrences of suicide.</p>
<p>For these analyses, only one third of the total number of 442 suicides occurred during the risk days. The results of the negative binomial regression are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534765612471145">Table 2</xref>. Statistical tests were conducted to examine if significantly more suicides occur during the “risk days” than over the “nonrisk days.” The predicted number of suicides in “nonrisk days” as a factor of predicted number of suicides in the “risk days” is exp(−.035) = 0.965. About 3% less suicides occur in the nonrisk days than in the risk days. The effect, however, is not significant at the .05 level. CTEs do not appear to significantly influence the likelihood of suicides.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As indicated in this study’s literature review, studies of the impact of CTEs on suicide have produced varied results with some finding impact and others none. A key characteristic of these studies has been the continued focus on a single CTE and its aftermath. This study focuses on co-occurring and temporally close (series) CTEs, in an attempt to further the understanding of the impact of CTEs on communities’ suicide rates and crisis hotline call volumes. The Poisson regression analyses in this study indicated that occurrences, co-occurrences, and overlaps of risk days of CTEs (a) had no impact on the likelihood of suicide in the selected parish and (b) the call volume during these time periods did not have a moderating effect on the likelihood of suicide. This has several implications significant to the progress of suicide prevention efforts.</p>
<p>The lack of CTE and crisis hotline impact on the distribution of suicide may speculatively be explained by a number of existing theories. To contextualize the discussion, the distribution of suicide was not affected by the CTEs. We speculate that this may be because of the presence of a well-managed crisis hotline in the parish; this hotline particularly amps up its media campaigns in the wake of CTEs. This may be the explanation for the significantly different means in call volume on “risk days” and “nonrisk days” where there were more calls to the hotline during “risk days.” It may be that the absence of a rise in suicides during risk days is a direct effect of the preventive work of the parish’s crisis hotline. Turning to theories of suicide, a converging point that explains the impact of a well-managed crisis hotline and its media campaigns to advertise available social support during a CTE is social connectedness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612471145">Durkheim (18971979)</xref> posited that suicide is a function of social interaction patterns and the culture of the area, specifically the lack of social interaction or its decrease. This social connectedness, what Durkheim termed <italic>social integration</italic>, has long been found to be a protective factor against suicide. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534765612471145">Yip et al. (2000)</xref> noted that current advances in communication contribute to social integration and social interaction, increasing belongingness, another protective factor against suicide (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765612471145">Greening &amp; Stoppelbein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765612471145">Marion &amp; Range, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612471145">McKeown et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534765612471145">Portes, Sandhu, &amp; Longwell-Grice, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534765612471145">Speice et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612471145">Van Orden et al., 2010</xref>). Focusing specifically on CTEs, especially those that might engender belongingness as noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534765612471145">Table 1</xref>, the findings in this study support the interpersonal theory of suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612471145">Van Orden et al., 2010</xref>). Specifically, the rallying together and increased belongingness felt during times of community and national crises actually help to protect against suicide since suicides during the risk periods did not increase.</p>
<p>There are key recommendations that result from these conclusions. The first and most important is that suicide prevention efforts be ongoing, not just in the presence and aftermath of CTEs. Prevention efforts must be aimed at all members of a community during all times (also known as primary or universal levels of prevention). In fact, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612471145">Durkheim (1897/1979)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534765612471145">Van Orden et al. (2010)</xref> propose and as this study corroborates, times of crisis may be less “worthwhile” times for offering prevention services as times of “normalcy” (i.e., times absent of a crisis).</p>
<p>Second, because it is still unclear as to whether the CTEs experienced by this parish were of substantial impact to detect a shift in the temporal distribution of suicide, this study should be expanded to include the year of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita that were perhaps the most impactful CTEs to date for this parish. Additionally, studies in other communities are encouraged to detect whether this parish is somehow different from others.</p>
<p>Third, given the varied results in studying CTE impact on suicide distributions, further research should be conducted where co-occurrence and temporal closeness (series) of CTEs are taken into account rather than the historical trend of focusing on a single CTE. Relatedly, replication of this study would allow further attention to improving the CTE classification system, where important aspects to address are intensity and frequency of media coverage and whether a CTE’s impact is related to group risk or perceived individual risk. In our definition of CTEs, we have included events that arouse intense concerns about physical security (e.g., serial rapes, escape of a convict), destruction of public and private property by both natural and human-made events, intense conflict (e.g., war), and fear of suicide contagion. The physical and emotional consequences of each of these classes of events vary for community members/survivors depending on how closely they identify with the situation. For example, a young woman who fits a serial rapist’s profile for a target would be more strongly influenced by media coverage of a serial rapist as a CTE than would others. An important question to consider is whether suicidality related to CTEs is a function of perceived widespread community or group risk, such as that of a devastating hurricane such as Katrina, or a function of distributed or individual risk such as the example of the young woman with characteristics matching a serial rapist’s target profile, thus juxtaposing ideas of CTE impact at the individual and community levels. A key area for further research is the development of a scale to measure community trauma. This study presents a starting point with the CTE classification system presented but much more needs to be done.</p>
<p>A final recommendation is to conduct psychological autopsies of people who died by suicide during the risk days of CTEs. These psychological autopsies should involve more than one survivor for each of the deceased and should be conducted using phenomenology as the guiding qualitative paradigm.</p>
<sec id="section14-1534765612471145">
<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>Strengths and limitations exist in this study. A major strength is that previous studies of the impact of CTEs have focused on lone events, not taking into account the possible impact of co-occurrences or overlapping risk days. This study included both situations in the analyses. Additionally, this study also took into account the possible impact of preventive strategies in place such as a well-managed suicide and crisis hotline.</p>
<p>Despite this strength, a major limitation relates to the CTEs studied. The CTEs that qualified for inclusion in this study were not as intense or catastrophic as events such as the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were for New York, the Oklahoma City bombing was for Oklahoma, Hurricane Andrew was for Florida, the Columbine tragedy was for Colorado, the shootings at Virginia Tech were to Virginia, and the shootings at Northern Illinois University were for Illinois. This study encompasses a time series that ends shortly before two devastating events were sustained by the parish of interest: Hurricanes Katrina and Rita of 2005. Though the community itself was not destroyed, its infrastructure was taxed in the aftermath of the storm due to an influx of evacuees and refugees. It still remains unknown as to whether events so directly affecting the area on such a catastrophic level would have a statistically significant impact on the area’s suicide distribution. Because of changes in administration for the entities that provided the data for this study, accessing data to complete the data set to include these two events was not possible.</p>
