<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>: Feeding difficulties are common with an estimated prevalence of 25%–45% in normally developing children. Clinicians and researchers emphasize the need for timely and effective treatment because a proportion of children develop failure to thrive with possible long-term impairments. Interprofessional assessment and treatment has emerged as an optimal approach to reduce parental anxiety and increase children’s acceptance of a wider variety of foods. <italic>Methods</italic>: Participants, including 30 children (mean age of 26 ± 8.2 months) meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria and their families, attended a program consisting of 4 sessions, and a 1-month follow-up. Parents completed the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale pre- and posttreatment and Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS). <italic>Results</italic>: Paired <italic>t</italic> tests indicate that the composite scores for frequency of feeding difficulties were on average significantly less posttreatment compared with pretreatment, and composite scores for frequency of parental problems with feeding were also significantly less posttreatment. These results were reflected in the composite scores for both feeding difficulties and parental problems with feeding on child- and parent-related items. The median for the GAS was +2 (range, −2 to +2). Written parental responses in the GAS reflected 2 major themes: satisfaction with the program and a desire for more individualized attention. <italic>Conclusions</italic>: These results offer preliminary evidence suggesting that an interprofessionally led parent group, with contributions from clinical nutrition, occupational therapy, psychology, and speech-language pathology professionals, is effective in treating young children with feeding difficulties.</p>

<body>
<p>Feeding difficulties, such as selective eating, food refusal, exceedingly slow eating, and tantrums,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533611430231">1</xref></sup> are commonly faced among young children, with an estimated prevalence of 25%–45% in normally developing infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533611430231">2</xref></sup> Eating is only instinctive for the first month of life, with transitional feeding developing around 6 months; however, after 6 months, eating becomes a learned behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533611430231">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533611430231">5</xref></sup> The developmental progression for learning to eat various food textures requires effective oral-motor functioning and sensory processing, as feeding requires the dynamic interaction of organs, muscles, and senses to function adequately.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533611430231">6</xref></sup> Consequently, the motivations for young children to eat are related to many complex issues, and eating problems often occur because of biophysiological differences between children.</p>
<p>Patterns and behaviors around mealtimes and eating have been identified in normally developing children. Mealtime completion in less than 30 minutes, chewing solid foods as well as swallowing effectively, and self-feeding are seen in normally feeding children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533611430231">7</xref></sup> In contrast, lengthy mealtimes, talking to delay eating, pocketing food, and tantrums at mealtimes are typical negative behaviors of the dysfunctional feeder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533611430231">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Early studies examining feeding problems primarily focused on an organic–nonorganic dichotomy. However, feeding difficulties are now thought to be more complex, occurring as a result of the interplay between biological, social, and behavioral factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533611430231">7</xref></sup> Feeding issues are a common concern for parents, and increased pressure from one or both parents has been associated with limited food intake and lower weights for these children, as well as a higher reported incidence of “pickiness” ratings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533611430231">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The traditional nutrition education given to parents focuses on imparting nutrition knowledge, and has not alone been successful at promoting functional eating patterns and healthy diets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533611430231">9</xref></sup> However, parent training on child feeding strategies, including positive modeling, has emerged as an efficient method of increasing children’s acceptance of a wider variety of foods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533611430231">7</xref></sup> The mealtime environment, the predispositions to prefer and reject basic tastes, the steps to learn food preferences based on the postingestive consequences, and the social contexts of eating have all been identified as important when educating parents about their child’s eating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533611430231">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to parental education, an effective interprofessional team is now thought to be best for nutrition, emotional, and oral motor needs of children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533611430231">2</xref></sup> Interprofessional care is defined as the provision of comprehensive health services to patients by multiple health caregivers who work collaboratively to deliver quality care within and across settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533611430231">11</xref></sup> Interest in interprofessional education has increased and is seen as a means to promote effective interprofessional collaboration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533611430231">12</xref></sup> Empirical evidence suggests that an interprofessional care approach will result in many service improvements to patient care delivery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533611430231">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533611430231">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533611430231">14</xref></sup> including an increase in service capacity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533611430231">11</xref></sup> reduction of wait times,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533611430231">13</xref></sup> and greater provider job satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533611430231">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533611430231">13</xref></sup> As the process of eating, feeding, and swallowing is a complex and dynamic function of the body, an interprofessional team is well suited to provide a multifaceted approach to address the dynamic interplay of nutrition, oral motor development, and psychosocial needs of children with feeding problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533611430231">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO), the majority of feeding referrals are triaged through occupational therapy, and in the past, the occupational therapist (OT) would see the child alone for assessment and therapy. Other health care professionals, including a dietitian, psychologist, and speech language pathologist (SLP), were consulted on an as-needed basis only. In response to long waiting lists and the lengthy process of sequential visits to specialists, the hospital adopted an interprofessionally led parent education program as a new service delivery model. The intent of this strategy was to facilitate timely, coordinated, and comprehensive care.</p>
<p>This study was designed to quantify and describe the change in parents’ ability to implement new mealtime strategies and assess children’s feeding behaviors after a 5-session education intervention. It also identified the change in parental emotional reactions to their child’s feeding experiences. The objective was to determine if interprofessionally led parent education sessions and a child-observation picnic would successfully inform parents about how to advance their child toward functional feeding.</p>

<sec id="section2-0884533611430231">
<title>Participant Selection</title>
<p>Parents (n = 30) of children aged 1–3 years, referred to occupational therapy for feeding problems at CHEO, were selected to participate. Reasons for referral included picky eating, inability to tolerate a variety of textures, food refusals, undernutrition/failure to thrive, long and/or stressful mealtimes, no mealtime routine, and poor oral-motor skills. Children with oral-facial malformations, severe developmental disabilities, or physical/medical problems affecting oral feeding were excluded. This study was approved by the CHEO Research Ethics Board.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0884533611430231">
<title>Program Intervention</title>
<p>The parent education program consisted of an initial 120-minute session and four 90-minute weekly therapy treatment sessions provided over 2 months. Sessions were led by an OT and psychologist and included participation from both a dietitian and SLP. Topics discussed each week focused on facilitating the child’s development of eating skills and built on lessons from the previous week. Sessions began with a recount of the parents’ personal experiences in applying the new approaches, including a discussion of the handouts and topics presented from the past week. For clinical documentation and to meet best practice guidelines, an individual assessment reviewing feeding abilities and a nutrition assessment was administered to each family using the CHEO Feeding Skills Scale, an internally developed scale designed by the interprofessional feeding team. This scale included measures of appropriate amounts of fluid and milk consumption, the number of foods eaten from each food group, and the child’s need for vitamins, iron, fiber, or other supplements. Assessments continued at the end of each subsequent session and offered a consistently structured clinical approach for initial, interim, and discharge assessment. Parents left each session with an individualized strategy to practice at home for the next week. Critical to the success of the sessions was the team’s ability to identify roadblocks to success and guide the parents by offering strategies that were specific to the needs of their family. This approach ensured that parents moved forward with the changes they were implementing.</p>
<p>Prior to the first week, participants were mailed a form reviewing the child’s weight, height, and nutrition concerns. These data were collected to identify children at high risk for failure to thrive and to understand the population being treated by this program. The first week of parent education identified individual feeding concerns and provided a guided discussion of the emotional impact of feeding problems on families. In response to these concerns, long-term goals were established and specific feeding strategies were explored.</p>
<p>In the second week, the dietitian focused on nutrition guidelines for infants and children. A discussion on introducing new tastes and textures, as well as the use of strategic attention during mealtimes, was provided by the psychologist and OT.</p>
<p>During the third week, the children attended a group picnic where the interprofessional team conducted one-on-one screening through clinical observations and made individual recommendations for the children. Parents were asked to bring food that their child could easily eat to assess oral motor skills and mealtime behavior between the parents and their child.</p>
<p>Communication and oral motor development were reviewed by the SLP in the fourth session. A review of the strategies implemented from the beginning of the program was provided, and parents were encouraged to practice and build on these strategies at home.</p>
<p>After a month break, the follow-up session included a question-and-answer period and follow-up planning for each family. A discussion on relapse prevention occurred, and the child’s progress was assessed to determine the need for ongoing support. If further intervention was required, direct individual therapy sessions were set up for the child and parents. If further intervention was not required, the referring source was notified of discharge from the program. Referring physicians were asked to monitor the weight of discharged children within several months after completion of the program.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>The Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale (BPFAS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533611430231">7</xref></sup> is a parent-report measure completed by the parent at session 1 (preintervention) and again at the end of the follow-up session (postintervention). Previous research has shown the BPFAS to be a valid and reliable representation of a child’s and parent’s mealtime behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533611430231">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533611430231">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533611430231">18</xref></sup> This measure is composed of 35 items; the first 25 describe the child’s feeding behavior, and the last 10 describe the parent’s feelings and strategies for dealing with eating problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533611430231">19</xref></sup> Parents were asked to rate on a 5-point Likert scale how much they agreed or disagreed with each statement, as well as whether each of the 35 items was a problem. Scores were generated for both the parent and child subscales and for the number of behaviors that presented as problems. Some questions were reverse-coded so that higher scores were suggestive of more problematic feeding behaviors.</p>
<p>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS), developed by Kiresuk and Sherman in 1968, was completed at the follow-up session (postintervention) as a measure of how helpful the parents found the interprofessional approach to treating feeding difficulties. The GAS is a flexible approach to outcome measurement, taking into account the individual’s specific goals, and has demonstrated validity for clinical and research applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533611430231">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533611430231">21</xref></sup> Parents were asked if they learned new information and to provide a rating on a 5-point scale. A score of “0” represented the expected level of learning where the parent “learned new information I feel I will try at home.” The highest score of +2 indicated that parents “can appreciate how I could try to do things differently to make positive changes to my child’s eating patterns,” and the lowest score of −2 indicated that parents “did not learn anything new.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0884533611430231">
<title>Qualitative Data Analysis</title>
<p>The GAS contained a written section for postintervention parent comments. These comments were compiled and coded accordingly to identify significant statements and key themes guided by the research question. The data were analyzed independently by 2 of the authors to achieve consensus on emerging themes. Coded data were then clustered into 2 main themes allowing related data to be grouped together and to identify relevant subthemes. Comments were manually coded according to the following themes: (1) satisfaction with the program and (2) a desire for more individualized attention.</p>

<p>The most common comment among participants was a variation of thank you and appreciation for the program. The parents directly observed positive results in their child’s feeding patterns and felt they learned a great deal of information. For example, a participant stated that “my son for the first time expressed his hunger.” One parent reported that their child was “not eating any more pureed baby foods” and other children were accepting various types of solid foods. Parents expressed that they “learned a great deal” when it came to strategies for getting their children to eat and learned about structuring meals as well as “how praising works.”</p>

<p>One of the goals of the program and a comment reflected by participants was a sense of decreased stress. Parents “tried to reduce stress and praise” and learned how to “keep stress levels down.” This gave the parents an appreciation of how their behaviors can influence their child’s feeding patterns: “I now have a better understanding of how my behavior and reactions impact [my daughter’s] feeding issues.”</p>

<sec id="section14-0884533611430231">
<title>Confidence</title>
<p>In addition to providing more information, several participants felt that the program helped to reinforce their confidence in dealing with their child’s feeding behaviors: “I learned some things to try, but I also learned that I was already on the right track. Thank you.” In particular, one parent expressed that the techniques from the program were already being implemented at home, but the “course was a good overview, and helpful in reinforcing what I was doing.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0884533611430231">
<title>Group support</title>
<p>Participants felt that being in a group was an additional positive aspect of the program. A group learning environment provided an opportunity for participants to meet others facing similar challenges and provided a group support system: “I appreciate the positive and group environment. . . . It helped me to grow as a parent and realize I am not alone.”</p>

<title>Desire for More Individualized Attention</title>
<p>Although expressed by a minority, a recurrent comment related to the program and group environment was a lack of individualized attention reported by a subset of participants: “I didn’t feel that class discussions addressed my son’s individual issues and therefore I did not receive any methods I felt applied to his case” and “I need for someone to understand [my son] in order to be able to help me.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that an interprofessionally led education program can be an effective intervention to help parents facilitate the development of functional feeding in young children. Although imparting nutrition knowledge has been the focus of traditional nutrition education, it has not consistently and successfully promoted functional eating patterns and healthy diets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533611430231">9</xref></sup> Similarly, occupational therapy or psychological education alone may not be as effective as an interprofessionally driven intervention. Rather, parent education focusing on (1) the importance of mealtime environment, (2) understanding the predispositions to prefer or reject basic tastes, (3) the steps to learn to prefer foods based on consequences of food ingestion, and (4) social contexts of eating has proven more effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533611430231">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Literature has shown that repeated tasting or exposure to new foods can reduce neophobia and transform dislikes into likes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533611430231">23</xref></sup> In accordance with these findings, families were encouraged to persevere with exposing new foods to their child in the face of rejection throughout the intervention. By the end of the program, parents commented that their children were actively trying new foods, such as “chicken,” “fish,” “tofu burger pieces,” “mashed potatoes,” and “broccoli and asparagus” and that they were pleased with these results. Clinical measures on the CHEO Feeding Skill Scale were in accordance with these reports of increased acceptance of food from each of the 4 food groups by the end of the program.</p>
<p>The short-term goal for all participants was to change mealtime strategies. However, weight gain was the long-term goal for only some of the children, as weight requirements varied for each child. It was observed that families frequently relied on milk to compensate for poor eating habits, and the overuse of milk resulted in some children actually being overweight. As parents implemented the recommended changes, such as reducing the amount of milk offered, introducing new foods at family meals, and following a scheduled meal and snack time, the children’s weight would often plateau or decrease initially. Only children who were plotting on an acceptable growth curve and achieving the required nutrients through their regular diet were considered for discharge.</p>
<p>Scores on the BPFAS showed that composite scores for both feeding difficulties and parental problems were significantly less postintervention, with parents experiencing a decrease in problems associated with mealtime strategies. This may be due, in part, to the psychologist’s focus on managing negatively impacting stressors and emotions causing the impediment of functional feeding around mealtimes. The psychologist’s ability to facilitate the parents’ management of their own reactive behaviors during mealtime helped contribute to influencing their child’s feeding behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533611430231">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533611430231">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although parental pressure placed on a child to eat has been associated with limited intake and lower weights, positive modeling from the parent can improve child eating habits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533611430231">8</xref></sup> As observed in the qualitative results, educating parents regarding child feeding strategies was an effective method for reducing parental anxiety and provided a framework for structuring mealtimes to increase children’s acceptance of a variety of foods.</p>
<p>The picnic session provided an opportunity for the parents to model mealtime strategies and for the team to offer individual recommendations for the children. As the parents implement their personal strategies, they were able to relay the outcome of the new approach to the team. This activity demonstrated how the child-related problems identified on the BPFAS were diminished through hands-on experience and parental education. Results from goal attainment scaling showed that many of the parents understood how to try things differently to make positive changes in their child’s eating patterns. Moreover, a particular strength to this approach was the support system parents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0884533611430231">27</xref></sup> gained from each other in the group and a sense of community with other parents who were experiencing similar difficulties when feeding their child.</p>
<p>Although most participants were satisfied with the program, a small minority continued to desire more individualized attention. It was observed during the program that certain parent-child dyads were more apt to fail or remain dissatisfied with their child’s progress. In particular, children of participants who reported the desire for more individualized attention did in fact develop adequate strategies for functional feeding, but parents continued to present as angry or frustrated with their child’s feeding challenges. Some parents became frustrated because they had hoped clinicians would “treat” their child rather than place emphasis on the parental changes needed during mealtimes. Other participants wanted their child to eat very specific food choices (eg, more vegetables for a vegetarian diet) and were not able to focus on the successful feeding skills their child had acquired. This program placed an emphasis on parental attention to productive activities such as sitting at the table and self-feeding, rather than focusing on the specifics of what they eat. Once general goals of the group were achieved, families were then able to individualize their child’s diet. Collecting additional information from this subset on how to better address their needs could further improve program delivery.</p>
<p>A diagnosis of autism or pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) was part of the exclusion criteria for this research because children who fall under the PDD or autism spectrum disorder umbrella are likely to have limited success in this type of program. However, a limitation of this study is related to the young age of the participants, as some children who will likely receive a diagnosis of autism were inadvertently admitted into the group. Other limitations include incomplete participant attendance for the full 5 sessions. Factors such as illness or schedule conflicts prevented complete participation, and families did not consistently have both parents at each session. Moreover, quantitative data for improvements to child feeding skills and a nutrition assessment were collected during the study using the internally developed CHEO Feeding Skills Scale, but was not presented in the results because this assessment tool has not yet been standardized and was not initially intended for research but for clinical purposes only.</p>
<p>Future research stemming from this project include standardizing the CHEO Feeding Skills Scale and creating a screening tool to identify clients who would not likely benefit from this program. Both initiatives are currently under development. In addition, group sessions are a very cost-effective treatment modality compared to individualized sessions. It would be of interest to determine the cost savings of this treatment modality for the institution.</p>
<p>In conclusion, parents who experience problems at mealtimes are typically more likely to report coaxing, threats, force feeding, and making multiple meals,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533611430231">7</xref></sup> but results from this study show a decrease in these types of behaviors. Postintervention scores on all measures of child and parent behaviors, as well as frequency of problems, decreased on all measures. Parents reported satisfaction with the program, reduced stress, increased confidence in dealing with their child’s feeding, and an increased sense of group support. Although a few participants preferred individualized care, the resounding majority of participants expressed gratitude for the information and strategies to reduce negative feeding behaviors.</p>
