<sec id="sec1-1462474511424687"><title>Joshua Page, <italic>The Toughest Beat: Politics, Punishment, and the Prison Officers Union in California</italic>, Oxford University Press: Oxford, 2011; 293 pp. (including index): 9780195384055</title>
<p>In this impressive and important book Page tells the story of the rise, history, and contemporary nature of the prison officers union in California. It began in the late 1950s as more or less a fraternal club. By 2002 the association had become a full-fledged union with more than 30,000 members and was widely considered among the most powerful in the country and a dominant player in the penal field. One of the challenges Page faces is that this is a story that even readers tangentially familiar with punishment in California will likely think they already know; the union is routinely and widely castigated as one of the largest impediments to penal reform in California, and the ‘800 pound gorilla’ of California politics. Missing from existing accounts are attempts to explain the mechanisms, processes, and nuances of this purportedly familiar story. According to Page, ‘no one has thoroughly examined the connection between the Golden State’s punitive turn and the rise of the union’ (p. 6). As it turns out, an understanding of these connections complicates our view of the union and the penal field alike.</p>
<p>The structure of the book is conventional but works well given both the interesting material and Page’s uncanny knack for accessible, highly readable prose (remarkably, this is the case even in theoretically dense discussions of Bourdieu and the construct of the ‘penal field’). The chapters are organized topically and for the most part in chronological order. Chapter topics include the early history of the union and its transformation into a key political player, alliances between the union and certain victims’ rights groups, efforts to help pass and later protect an ultra-punitive Three Strikes law, the fight against private prisons, and how the union increasingly wrestled managerial control away from administrators.</p>
<p>Although each chapter is capable of standing on its own as an important and self-contained story, Page unifies them through his remarkably balanced approach: instead of (merely) castigating the union, he tries to understand it. Doing so is ideologically and normatively commendable because Page is able to demonstrate that it is possible to be empathetic without sympathizing (or tacitly approving) the highly destructive and racialized policies and practices that the union helped create and currently helps maintain. This approach also has empirical benefits. For instance, at times Page pushes against popular perceptions of the union as all-powerful, instead persuasively and repeatedly arguing that the union is one of several groups that temporarily join forces to get something done. One example provided by Page is that in fighting against private prisons in California, the union has teamed up with such unlikely allies as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and prisoners’ rights organizations. At other times, Page’s balanced approach leads in the other direction, like when he unearths connections between the union and other players in the penal field that have led to almost unparalleled power in and over the penal field. Exemplary of this power and the union’s political strategy are the political action committees (PACs) that are tied to the victims’ rights groups that the union created and for which the union is sometimes the sole (or near sole) provider of funds. In short, Page demonstrates time and again that the union is both product and producer of the penal field.</p>
<p>Chapter 5, in which Page explores the passage and subsequent history of California’s Three Strikes law, demonstrates this balanced approach. It also offers some of the book’s most interesting reading. Page resists equally the temptation to overstate and underestimate the importance of the union in these political battles. The lessons of this chapter are the same as the book more generally, and include the fact that individual actors matter, but in ways that are shaped by the larger penal field: one cannot tell the story of California’s Three Strikes law without considering, for instance, what drove Governor Schwarzenegger to become, just weeks before a 2004 election, an outspoken opponent of a critical reform effort that might otherwise have been approved by voters. A related lesson is that while the story of California’s Three Strikes law is in some ways unique to that state, it has broader import in that California is a bellwether state and researchers studying penal fields elsewhere and/or with different substantive foci might profitably adapt Page’s analytic framework.</p>
<p>As is often the case with research that is the first to systematically study a particular topic or phenomenon, it is not surprising that there is room for more work to be done by Page and others in order to fully understand the union and its relationship to the penal field in California. Four brief examples will suffice. First, although Page gives us some sense in the final chapter of the contemporary leadership that took over the union in the 2000s, I found myself pining for a more detailed discussion of the internal politics of this shift: why these particular leaders, at this particular time? Clarifying the reasons for this shift and what it looked like might help explain why and how the union today manages to espouse a somewhat progressive rhetoric regarding rehabilitation, reform, and forgiveness while still advocating for the same punitive policies and practices that have long been the union’s main rallying cries. Second, I would like to learn more about Page’s call for a politically realistic counterforce to the existing status quo, including what role academics could (or should) have in facilitating such a development. Third, what might the penal field as an analytic framework offer scholars studying other topics? Fourth, while gender and race are important subthemes throughout the book, there is clearly more to be done on both fronts: to name but one example, how is it that a union that appears to genuinely embrace diversity nonetheless advocates for racialized policies with astoundingly destructive consequences?</p>
<p>Overall the book is well written, persuasive, and important, and should become required reading for those interested in punishment in California. This includes academics, policy makers, penal administrators, politicians, and anyone with an interest in changing the status quo of punishment in California. However it is also a useful case study for thinking about punishment more broadly. I expect students (both undergraduate and graduate) will find it enlightening, and believe that scholars and researchers interested in punishment and prisons in other contexts would be well served by giving it a careful read.</p>
