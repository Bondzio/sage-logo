<p>I often read “review copies” of books when I’m traveling. I had planned to take my copy of <italic>Freeing Speech: The Constitutional War over National Security</italic> with me on some lengthy trips abroad in 2011.</p>
<p>Then I hesitated. Would customs officials in countries like Azerbaijan look askance at a book with a title like that? What about reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have searched and seized, without a warrant, electronic devices like laptop computers belonging to U.S. citizens at border crossings—sometimes, at least according to lawsuits filed by the ACLU, with no apparent suspicion of “wrongdoing” other than supporting accused leaker Bradley Manning’s legal defense fund?</p>
<p>Not wishing to succumb to what the book’s author, John Denvir, a constitutional policy professor at University of San Francisco School of Law, calls “government-induced political passivity” engendered by fear of attracting the unwanted attention of government investigators, I decided to take my chances and take the book along with me. I did, however, first remove the jacket, which includes a photograph of antiwar protestors on the cover. No point in being needlessly provocative, I figured.</p>
<p>Denvir himself wouldn’t hesitate to be provocative. His book certainly is. Right off the bat, he claims that the same First Amendment that grants the press independence from government control has allowed presidents, who enjoy virtually unfettered access to the media, to utilize official secrecy coupled with propaganda techniques to mislead the public and mobilize support for their national security policies. This has led to what he calls the National Security Presidency, unchecked by Congress and the courts. The remedy he proposes would be for Congress to enact a law making it a felony for the president, vice president, or cabinet-level officials to utter false statements recklessly, or with knowledge that they are false—echoing the “actual malice” standard from the landmark First Amendment case, <italic>New York Times v. Sullivan</italic>.</p>
<p>And that’s just the beginning. Denvir manages to pack quite a few controversial concepts into his six short chapters, all predicated on the idea that the First Amendment’s protections for freedom of speech, press, and assembly have been severely eroded by the so-called War on Terror. He provides brief histories of the First Amendment as well as the laws of access and provides chilling examples of increased surveillance of individuals and groups engaging in constitutionally protected activities, growing restrictions on access to government-held information, and missed opportunities by the federal courts to rein in zealous law enforcement officials because of excessive deference to their supposedly greater expertise.</p>
<p>At the root of all this, he suggests, is the failure of the Supreme Court to interpret the First Amendment in a sufficiently robust way that not only encourages debate and dissent but curtails the expansion of executive power. Instead of being cowed by accusations of “judicial activism,” he writes, the justices should embrace it. Rather than being apolitical, the Supreme Court should be “a forum of higher politics.” It’s not entirely clear what Denvir means by this, but he argues that judicial nominees should be required to demonstrate an “acceptable political vision” and then be confirmed by a filibuster-proof vote of sixty (rather than fifty) senators. This, he writes, would mean that the successful nominee would be “perceived as being within the mainstream in their political values.” Failing that, he argues, we should amend the Constitution to abolish lifetime tenure for the justices.</p>
<p>Denvir has plenty of other ideas to float, some more radical than others, including a federal reporter’s shield law, a statutory right of press access to military operations, and restrictions on government investigations of activists, all predicated on judicial recognition of a broad constitutional “right to know”—an idea arguably implied by the language of the First Amendment. At the end of the book, he supplies an outline for a “Human Rights Constitution,” including universal health care, gay marriage, individual privacy rights protected from private sector intrusion, and a requirement that corporations be prohibited from violating First Amendment rights of individuals. All this, if it does nothing else, should provide fodder for lively class discussions.</p>
<p>The book is a somewhat uneasy mix of readable summaries of applicable law interspersed with polemics denouncing the National Security Presidency, most prominently (though not exclusively) that of George W. Bush. There’s clearly a point of view to this book, and it favors the dissenters, sometimes at the expense of providing a broader context. For example, Denvir’s harsh criticism of government retaliation against activists is probably justified in most instances. But when he argues that antiwar demonstrators, including those at the University of Wisconsin–Madison during the Vietnam era, may have violated the law but did not endanger human life (whereas the police who “inflicted wholesale beatings” on them did), his failure to mention the 1970 bombing of Sterling Hall on the same campus by the so-called “New Year’s Gang,” resulting in the death of researcher Robert Fassnacht, seems disingenuous at best.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this short book could be useful for students seeking to begin the process of trying to reconcile the perennial conflict between the First Amendment and national security, even though it concludes at the beginning of the Obama administration. Revelations about covert use of drone aircraft and crackdowns on leakers suggest, as does Denvir, that George W. Bush had no monopoly on the National Security Presidency.</p>
