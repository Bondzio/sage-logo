<abstract>
<p>In this essay, I raise three questions regarding spatiality. Why do we struggle to explain spatiality? What kinds of politics does an appreciation of spatiality enable? And why do discussions of spatiality seem to be framed by people who often share subject positions shaped by education, class, gender, racialization, and postcolonialism? I raise these – admittedly awkward – questions, but confess that I struggle to answer them. Yet it seems important to address them if we are to meet our responsibilities to the publics that support academics and the publics we hope to support.</p>

<p>I was on a plane the first time I read these reflections on spatiality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820611434865">Merriman et al., 2012</xref>). It seemed appropriate to read essays on space-time-movement, about relationality and materiality, as I was flying home to Boulder, Colorado, and my family after my first year at Durham University. In addition to sons and husband, I expected I would also see my mother, sister, and aunt in Eugene, Oregon. Perhaps because I hoped to see my mother, as I read, I kept hearing her ask: ‘Why? Explain it, so that I can understand.’ My mother is as smart a person as you ever want to meet, but she does not have a lot of education. She wants to learn and know in a deep sense, though, and wants explanations. So as I read these pieces, I imagined her asking: ‘Why? If it is so important, explain it, so that I can understand.’</p>
<p>I read these pieces a second time, a week later on a plane to Eugene. My mother had suffered a stroke, and I was travelling to be with her. Throughout the two-hour flight, the question ‘why?’ filled my head. Perhaps unfairly, I wanted these pieces to speak to me about the spatiality of our lives. But in a way that my mother and I could understand.</p>
<p>There were three why questions that I kept returning to as I read the essays and the questions from the audience. The main speakers were tasked with a daunting set of issues to consider, and they certainly could not address them all. I also know they were not talking to my mother and that there is a time and a place for abstract, theoretical discussions. But what each of the speakers had to say is important and challenging, and I think we need to take these ideas beyond the questions about ontology, epistemology, and methodology, as important as they are. So I will not provide a commentary, so much as ask what seems to me to be the burning question: why?</p>
<p>
<italic>Why do we – collectively – seem unable to explain what spatiality means, even though we can feel it and experience it, and even though we believe it is so important? Should we care that we cannot express it? </italic>It was refreshing to read the honesty in the four speakers’ comments and their acknowledgement that they struggle to define spatiality and to convey its deepest meanings. Here are four articulate, thoughtful, accomplished men who have pushed our collective thinking on this topic. Yet from the first set of remarks by Gunnar Olsson, it was clear that these are issues and ideas that are felt, as much as explained. Eric Sheppard and Nigel Thrift speak of this in slightly different ways, pointing to the ways that spatiality is bound up with and inseparable from a set of methodological – and thereby epistemological and ontological – issues. But while the commentators are honest, I wonder whether being honest about the difficulty in articulating the meaning of spatiality is sufficient. Why can’t we explain it? As a mother, I often told my children that some things just are, and I could not explain them. In most cases, however, I felt I had neither the time nor the inclination to work through those questions with them. Two years ago, my eldest son reminded me of that after explaining string theory in a way that I could understand. In that situation, it was a gentle and playful rebuke, but there was a lesson there. I think we need to keep pushing at the explanation of spatiality, as difficult as it may be. Many of us argue that an appreciation of spatiality is one of the key contributions of geography to understanding social and environmental issues. This is a deeply important concept, and we need to be able to talk about it in a way that people can understand.</p>
<p>
<italic>Why should we care about spatiality?</italic> This question follows from the first question. The speakers argue that a new kind of politics is implicit in an appreciation of spatiality. Well, what is that politics? Concretely, what does this politics help with? I realize this may sound a crude and instrumental question, but those of us in the academy face a reality – that I do not think is as new as some people imply – that we have responsibilities to the publics that support us, and also to the publics that most of us hope to support. If we want to challenge our communities, cities, countries to do better, if we strive for social justice, then we need to be able to explain the politics that an appreciation of spatiality makes possible to imagine or to enable. The slaughter of teenagers in Norway in 2011 reminds us that politics need not be progressive, and empowerment can enable fanatics and murders. So what is this new politics? Or perhaps, recognizing that power is plural, what are <italic>these</italic> new politics? My own feeling is that this is particularly important in the context of discussions about post-democracy and the implication that meaningful politics is only carried through rare, big events that visibly challenge hegemonic regulations and figures, such as in the youth-led uprisings on the streets of North Africa and the Middle East. I worry that the micropolitics that enable those bigger challenges will once again be swept to the side, not by the state, but by the very academic discourses that have been in important in opening minds and discussing ideals that challenge some forms of oppression. Where would the protests of the ‘Arab spring’ be if families had not made sacrifices to educate their children, if youth had not engaged with a range of people and ideas in a range of places, and if those youth had not made decisions to go out onto the street? The speakers argue that the new politics will work through the spatial processes and relationships that we live and enact every day, and will be smaller and less abstract than those of the structural and institutionalized relationships that shape the broad contexts for our lives. If so, how do these new politics articulate with broader forces and relationships? What do they enable?</p>
<p>Finally, <italic>why do we repeatedly retreat from the uneasy fact that many of these discussions about spatiality and spatial theory are framed by the work of men who share educational and class positions and who are located in major western universities? </italic>The composition of the panel was raised by the organizers, by Eric Sheppard, in Peter Merriman’s response, and by audience members, although perhaps not so directly as I phrased it here. But in each case, the speakers quickly moved to questions of ontology and epistemology. I wonder whether that is sufficient. Again, I think about my mother. Would it be possible to imagine a panel of spatial theorists composed of my siblings and the technicians, health aides, and cleaners taking care of my mother? In a purely practical sense, the answer is ‘no’. They would not be able to participate in a panel at an academic conference. But are their perspectives, their theories, their meanings represented on this panel – or many others that I could point to? The answer, again, is ‘no’. Less polemically, I think we should not settle for the answer that a broader range of theorists were asked to be on the panel, but were not available. We need to ask <italic>why</italic> these people were not available for this panel, and for many other similar panels over the years. And why have people from – or at least connected with – the Global South been absent from these panels? And on and on. If we push at this question, we might begin to learn something about how the very concept of spatiality itself is operationalized and lived, about why we struggle to define it, and about the kinds of politics it might enable. In short, it might help us understand whether it is academic politics and pragmatics that seem to marginalize other voices and perspectives in this field or whether it is the project of theorizing spatiality itself that is the reason. Quickly moving beyond this difficult question to issues of ontology and epistemology may well serve to signal to the people not represented on the panel that these debates are truly not for them. A more productive debate about spatiality may ensue if theoreticians beyond ‘the usual suspects’ are included in this project. So the question of why they have not been present needs to be taken further than the comment that they were invited but could not attend. In many ways, this may be a painful question to pursue, but we need to engage it seriously.</p>
<p>These questions about why – why we can’t explain what we mean about spatiality, why we should care about it, and why a broader range of people are not engaged with this issue – feel very raw at this moment. By the time this commentary is published – or indeed if it is published – I will probably be embarrassed at having written this, and written it this way. Certainly, my mother would be horrified if it were ever shown to her. But for now, as I care for my mother and try to juggle a life with commitments in several places and to a variety of people and institutions in multiple countries, all I can do is ask ‘why?’, and hope that I can come up with answers that my mother and I can understand.</p>
