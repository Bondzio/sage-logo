<abstract>
<p>This article reports a critical case of systematic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to wound infection. By intensive local wound treatment including debridement, topical negative pressure, and topical antibiotics, SIRS was effectively controlled, vital signs stabilized, and the wound healed in 45 days. This case reflects the close association between wound infection and SIRS while highlighting early diagnosis of local pathology and local treatment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As living standards rise and with the increase of the aged population, more and more patients may encounter traumatic accidents because of various underlying chronic diseases. This type of trauma, if not treated in time and effectively, will often lead to local wound infection, and severe local wound infection is prone to systematic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612456395">1</xref></sup> Once SIRS has developed, clinicians may neglect wound treatment, resulting in deterioration of disease, organ function impairment, and finally multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), a life-threatening event. Thus, it is worthwhile to discuss the link between wound infection and SIRS and its treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612456395">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>The patient, a 72-year-old male, was admitted due to an unhealed surgical incision (2 months after left patella fracture internal fixation) accompanied with SIRS represented by hyperpyrexia and respiratory and circulation dysfunction. Previous history included diabetes, hypertension, and arrhythmia and hydronephrosis. Commonly, insulin was taken to control diabetes and captopril for hypertension. The patient was in an extremely critical condition when he was admitted. Physical exam provided the following results: impaired consciousness, pupil 3.2 mm, weak photo reflex, weak pharyngeal reflex, temperature 39°C, heart rate 213 bpm, electrocardiogram showed fibrillation atria and complete right bundle branch block, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, blood pressure 40/20 mm Hg, suture loosened in the left knee incision, and drainage tube with small amount of discharge (sticky, yellow with odor). Granulation did not show fresh and above the skin, and soft tissue was swelled in the knee joint. White blood cell count was 14.1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, neutrophil 85%, blood urea nitrogen 13.1 mmol/L, creatine 147 µmol/L. Blood gas Pao<sub>2</sub> was 10.31 kPa, Paco<sub>2</sub> 3.77 kPa, pH 7.47. Serum sodium was 137 mmo/L, serum potassium 3.3 mmo/L, serum chlorine 102 mmo/L, and serum calcium 2.0 mmo/L.</p>
<p>The patient had fallen and sustained a left patella fracture 2 months before admission. He received primary open reduction, wire internal fixation, and primary closure in another hospital. The first day after surgery the patient developed ischemic stroke confirmed by computed tomography and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for 1 month. In the ICU, he developed surgical wound infection and pressure ulcer in sacrum and coccyx. He was transferred to the Endocrinology Department with the diagnosis of diabetes with wound formation.</p>
<p>In the Endocrinology Department, iodophors was topically applied while a simple drainage tube was inserted. But the wound did not show recovery and progress continuously, accompanied with systematic symptoms such as fever and respiratory/circulation dysfunction. Since then, the focus of treatment was on supportive care for organ functions: dopamine and coramine for maintaining vital signs, digoxin for arrhythmia, isosorbide for coronary artery dilation and milrinone for cardiotonic, insulin to control glucose at the level of 10 mmol/l, and nutritional support. To control infection, antibiotics such as teicoplanin, cefmetazole, aztreonam, and meropenem were used. But antibiotics did not work very well. Wound infection progressed with deteriorating fever and respiratory/circulation.</p>
<p>According to the patient’s symptoms, the physical examination, and the lab tests, common infection factors such as hypostatic pneumonia, urinary infection, bacteremia, and septicemia were excluded. The result of the wound smear for microbial culture demonstrated that <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> was positive, and antibiotics resistance testing showed vancomycin, teicoplanin, and nitrofurantoin were sensitive. Thus, the diagnosis of SIRS was established. We believed that the existence of the local wound infection was a major cause and would aggregate the progress of the SIRS.</p>
<p>Based on this, on day 3 after admission we started to enhance the local treatment of wound infection, including wound debridement. During wound debridement, we found the lesion penetrated into the joint, with odor and accumulated pus. After a complete wound debridement, we removed the necrotic tissue and accumulated pus; the joint was irrigated with 3% hydrogen peroxide, 10% mafenide, and 0.9% physiologic saline solution, and we applied topical negative pressure (TNP; the pressure dosage was 0.017-0.06 MPa, and the sponge was polyvinyl alcohol foam) to continue suction. Meanwhile we discontinued systematic antibiotics and retained other supportive medications. The condition of the patient improved the second day after the intervention. Hyperpyrexia resolved, consciousness was back, and the blood pressure restored. Three days after the operation, we did the second wound debridement. We removed necrosis residue and accumulated pus; irrigated with 3% hydrogen peroxide, 10% mafenide, and 0.9% physiologic saline solution; and continued with TNP. The patient was back to normal consciousness, temperature, heart rate, breath, and blood pressure (110/60 mm Hg), and he started eating. He continued his recovery. On the sixth day after the operation, neutrophil was 4.1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L and other lab indicators were back to normal. When changing the dressing, we observed a steady and sound improvement of the knee wound, such as fresh granulation tissue and clear drainage without odor. The wound smear culture turned negative. The observation was continued until 10 days after admission when we confirmed the stable status of the patients and he was discharged from hospital with TNP applied for 3 weeks, and a Chinese traditional medicine to speed wound closure was applied onto the wound for another 2 weeks till the wound healed.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SIRS is a common condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612456395">3</xref></sup> Would infection is one of the causes. For the elderly, concomitant with chronic systemic disease, SIRS will complicate the situation, lead to MODS, and be life threatening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612456395">4</xref></sup> The traditional treatment for these patients is the maintenance of the vital sign, by focusing on the circulation and respiratory system; correction of hypovolemia, tissue hypoperfusion, and hypoxia; improvement of the general conditions; and prevention of secondary organ dysfunction. However, clinicians often neglect local treatment of wound infection, and the efficacy of systematic antibiotics is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>As for the patient, longtime ignorance of the wound treatment led to SIRS. Although the traditional anti-SIRS therapy and systematic antibiotics were used, the status of patient continued to detiorate. But once the treatment strategy was switched to local treatment, including wound debridement, local anti-infection, and continuous suction, the patient immediately responded. From this case, we further understand the relationship between local wound infection and SIRS. Untreated local wound infection leads to severe bacterial proliferation and local reaction, which produces large amounts of toxin to trigger a strong inflammation response. For those elderly with underlying organ dysfunction, the attack will be more significant. Therefore, local wound treatment is the key.</p>
<p>Based on the theory of vascular occlusion around the wound site, it will be difficult for systematic antibiotics to reach the effective lethal level in the local wound. The weak action cannot eradicate the local bacteria, cannot improve the bacterimia, and may increase risk of release of endotoxins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612456395">5</xref></sup> which can make the situation even worse. In this case, application of broad-spectrum and sensitive antibiotics did not improve infection and did not result in resolution of symptoms.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if we had proper handling of the local wound by removing necrosis tissues, pus, and bacteria, the absorption of toxins would have been lessened, with an improved systemic inflammation response; thus, local intervention, instead of systematic antibiotics, can effectively eliminate the origin of infection and reduce bacteria and toxin burden, which will further translate to the prevention of bacteremia, sepsis, and stop the cascade of SIRS. In particular, when infection is limited in the wound without systematic invasion, local treatment, debridement, and pus drainage will be extremely important.</p>
<p>TNP is a helpful measure after debridement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612456395">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612456395"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612456395"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734612456395"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612456395">10</xref></sup> It helps drainage of liquid necrotic tissue whose local accumulation will accelerate infection and toxin absorption. It also enhances local circulation and facilitates new tissue growth and wound healing.</p>
<p>This case reminds us again of the issue of correct use of antibiotics. Are fever and leucocyte count the immediate indications of systematic antibiotics? Are high-dose systematic antibiotics able to replace local wound treatment? In addition, this case showed that a specialized wound repairing department is needed to give patients proper and timely treatment. Meanwhile, a multidisciplinary team has to be established.</p>
