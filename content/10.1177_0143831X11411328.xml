<abstract>
<p>Since 2002, the incumbent Justice and Development Party’s (JDP) industrial relations (IR) policy has dichotomized Turkish public opinion. Positions have ranged from socialism to neoliberalism and include a reference to Islamism. This article argues that this ambiguity stems from the confrontation between the JDP’s Islamist sociopolitical background and the confines of Turkish IR under the pressure of neoliberal restructuring. Thus, it aims to crystallize the party’s Conservative Democratic identity in relation to IR by examining how the JDP’s cosmopolitan nature embraces its Islamist, neoliberal and social democratic foundations. This article concludes that, in its current form, Conservative Democracy as an IR governmental strategy has less to do with <italic>pure</italic> Islamism, neoliberalism or social democracy than with a ‘hard pragmatism’, which is located between the suppression of and support for organized labour under the shadow of the party’s politico-economic agenda.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During a period when organized labour has in most cases come under extreme pressure from the incumbent governments across the world, the Justice and Development Party’s industrial relations (IR) policy has confused the Turkish public. Within this context, the leftist Turkish media have dubbed the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the ‘Che Guevara of Turkey’ and ‘Socialist Tayyip’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X11411328"><italic>Daily Radikal</italic>, 2007</xref>) in response to his declarations of support for the trade unions. However, the leading trade union and civil service confederations, along with the Islamist Felicity Party (FP) and the Kemalist social democratic Republican People’s Party (RPP), have denounced the Justice and Development Party (JDP) for implementing a neoliberal IR regime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0143831X11411328">1</xref></sup> The vast majority of studies of Turkish IR also vehemently denounce the JDP for enforcing restrictions on the right to organize, strike and bargain collectively and for failing to implement the democratization reforms required by the EU acquis and ILO conventions (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143831X11411328">Gülmez, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143831X11411328">Özdemir and Özdemir, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143831X11411328">Yıldırım, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0143831X11411328">Yıldırım and Çalış, 2008</xref>). The JDP has, however, enacted constitutional reform and made amendments to the trade union and collective bargaining acts, which introduced a number of emancipatory regulations in regard to individual and collective trade union freedoms. It has also implemented an austere corporatism in a solidarist manner that integrates Islamic principles. An overall analysis of the JDP’s IR strategy must therefore take into consideration the social democratic and Islamic implications of its IR policies, even if they are far from making a systemic impact.</p>
<p>In Turkish politics, ‘Conservative Democracy’, as adopted by the JDP, emerged from the systemic clash between the Just Order project, and the secular political and neoliberal economic status quo in Turkey at the turn of the 21st century. Since the end of the 1960s, the Just Order has been the politico-economic project of the Islamist politicians in Turkey, who aspire to transform the Turkish secular regime into a government that respects religious rights and freedoms and the capitalist regime into an interest-free mixed regime. Before developing the Conservative Democracy movement, the leaders of the JDP were among the pioneers of this project. The primary reason for their departure from Just Order politics was their belief that it could not be implemented in Turkey in view of existing conditions in the country. Consequently, they created Conservative Democracy to reconcile the ideological premises of the Just Order with the secular regime. Conservative Democracy has therefore taken on a mixed identity comprising both Islamist and neoliberal principles. When applied to IR policies, intriguingly, this mix also gives rise to social democratic ideals as well. As a result, the JDP’s IR policy has become aligned, as mentioned above, with Islamism, neoliberalism and socialism. And such a trilateral identification predictably triggers a dichotomous debate over what exactly the Conservative Democratic IR strategy is and what the JDP aims to realize through this strategy.</p>
<p>This article contextualizes this debate in the period during which the JDP has been in power (2002–10) and argues that the basis of this ambiguity is the JDP’s strategy of ‘hard pragmatism’, which aspires to manage IR through a hybrid set of principles and policies that include Islamist, neoliberal and social democratic elements. This article also argues that this strategy provides the party with the opportunity to capture and maintain the support of both labour and employers and to implement its austere economic policy that is the primary factor behind its electoral success (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X11411328">Çarkoğlu, 2008</xref>). To support its argument, the article develops a three-step analytical perspective. First, the article discusses the main characteristics of Turkey’s IR policies from 1960 to 2001. This retrospective analysis traces the scope of the party’s current IR policy in terms of its impact, if any, on the entrenched authoritarian and neoliberal characteristics of Turkish IR policy. Subsequently, the theoretical and practical implications of Conservative Democratic IR policies are elaborated with reference to their Islamist, neoliberal and social democratic implications at the levels of discourse and practice. In this section, the IR project of the Just Order is also examined to identify the Islamic elements in the Conservative Democratic IR strategy. Finally, using the framework outlined in the first two sections, the third section analyses the political economy of the Conservative Democrats’ IR strategy under the banner of ‘hard pragmatism’.</p>

<title>The playground of the JDP: The Turkish industrial relations system</title>
<p>The evolution of Turkish IR policies can be broken down into three main periods: the era of development, 1960–79; the dissolution, 1980–2001; and the reorganization crisis, 2002–10. Prior to dealing with these major periods, it is also a prerequisite to touch upon the enactment and composition of the Trade Union Act (TUA) of 1947 as this Act set the standard for Turkish IR policies by manipulating IR through top-down, state-dominated legal regulations according to the existing requirements of pragmatic policy-making. Following the inception of the multi-party system in 1946, the TUA of 1947 was enacted by the then-incumbent RPP, the governing party of the 1923–46 single-party era. In actuality, the essential aim of the Act was not to enable the workers to establish truly class organizations and seek their rights via democratic channels. Rather, the Act attempted to subdue the social discontent arising from the catastrophic economic crisis and relieve pressure from the international community to democratize state–labour relations. The face-saving nature of the Act was apparent in its absolute prohibition of strikes and political activities as well as in the mandatory settlement of industrial conflicts through arbitration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143831X11411328">Dereli, 2006</xref>: 36–7). In terms of power relations among the IR actors, it is safe to suggest that the TUA of 1947 demonstrated the unilateral authority of the state apparatus to determine the conduct of organized labour. However, this so-called unilateral authority was not always used to the detriment of organized labour. Intriguingly, in terms of the overall functioning of Turkish industrial relations, the first and last examples of the state’s pro-labour regulations were implemented by the military government of 1960–1, which came to power after the May 1960 coup d’état.</p>
<p>This coup d’état was a reaction to the incumbent centre-right Democrat Party, which remained in power between 1950 and 1960 due to the crises of the late 1950s, particularly its clash with the proponents of the secular regime (the military, the central bureaucracy and the media) and with trade unions. The principal catalyst was, inter alia, the diminishing status of the military due to decreasing wage levels and the social rights of its members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143831X11411328">Karpat, 1970</xref>). It is highly likely that as a result of these sociopolitical circumstances, the military administration paved the way for the heyday of Turkish IR in tandem with the methodology of top-down regulation. The Turkish Constitution of 1961 was the essential means for carrying out this function, and it recognized workers’ democratic rights to organize, to collectively bargain and to strike. It also recognized civil servants’ right to organize. In doing so, the Constitution gave rise to an authoritarian state corporatism in that an organized relationship between the actors of industrial relations was established through a top-down state regulation including some controlling policy tools (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X11411328">Table 1</xref>), but not through a bottom-up (democratic) clash.</p>

<p>It would not be an exaggeration to claim that, with respect to the initiators of the two major periods of Turkish IR (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X11411328">Table 1</xref>), the military administration, and not the political party in power, determined the rules and power relations of Turkish IR until the third period, between 2002 and 2010. (The government of 1980–3 created, contrary to the military government of 1960–1, an anti-union legislative and politico-economic structure that has remained in existence to the present day.) Proving this fact is that the RPP enacted the TUA of 1963 and the Collective Bargaining, Strike and Lock-out Act (CBSLA) of 1963 in compliance with the emancipatory spirit of the Constitution of 1961 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143831X11411328">Table 2</xref>). In light of the TUA of 1947, it could be argued that the RPP would not have wholeheartedly regulated these acts democratically had the military government of 1960–1 not introduced democratic regulations in terms of IR. This fact is because both Acts of 1963 provided organized labour with truly social democratic rights, in contrast to the TUA of 1947. Along with the full provision of individual and collective trade union rights, the TUA of 1963 called for an uncomplicated membership procedure (by signing the membership registry), the check-off system, free membership to international trade unions and even a soft inspection mechanism that required trade unions only to send their balance sheets to the Ministry of Labour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143831X11411328">Sönmez, 1968</xref>). In view of the fact that the TUA of 1947 had banned strikes of any kind, it is quite perplexing that the CBSLA of 1963, enacted by the same political party, recognized strikes called over rights disputes, but not those involving disputes over interests.</p>

<p>While these (social) democratic regulations were tolerant of organized labour, it should be noted that the regulations were created by a formerly authoritarian political party, the RPP, in a favourable environment established by a military government. The limitations of this situation are evident in the institutions established by these same Acts for controlling organized labour. The first was to grant the Board of Ministers the right to postpone strikes on the grounds of national health and security, which was essentially intended to de-radicalize the trade unions. In addition, the Higher Conciliation Board was instituted to arbitrate on postponed strikes. Allowing the decisions on postponement to be brought to the State Council did not forestall the use of strike postponement as a controlling and marginalizing tactic; quite a number of strikes (251) were postponed between 1960 and 1980 and 63 percent of these were in the public sector. Furthermore, the so-called ‘decisions’ were quite ambiguous and even ridiculous. For instance, 48 strikes were forbidden in the public transportation, warehousing and communication sectors on the grounds of national health and security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143831X11411328">Topalhan, 2003</xref>). In addition to strike postponement, the CBSLA of 1963 also implemented a ban on strikes in educational institutions, airways and highway and sea transportation vehicles, which contravened the ILO conventions. To settle the strikes in these sectors, the Higher Arbitration Board was instituted with the authority to make decisions that were the equivalent of collective bargaining.</p>

<p>The Constitution of 1961 also affected the economic environment of Turkish IR, establishing the State Planning Organization to lead a planned economic system. Consequently, the period from 1960 to 1980 featured an import-substitution-led planned economy under the auspices of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) – essentially, state capitalism. This inward-looking and planned economic strategy enabled Turkish trade unions to establish relationships of patronage with the incumbent political parties to organize in the SOEs (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143831X11411328">Figure 1</xref>, in the 1960–80 period public employment in the manufacturing sector was 39 percent on average). Paving the way for this relationship was the 1963 TUA’s recognition of the trade unions’ right to engage in politics, with the exception of establishing organic bonds with political parties. The efficacy and sustainability of this relationship were consolidated by an average economic growth rate of 5.2 percent and a low level (12 percent) of foreign trade as a percentage of GDP. To a large extent, these favourable conditions kept trade unions from confronting the challenges of both national and international competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143831X11411328">SPO, 2010a</xref>). Organizing predominantly in the SOEs under these relatively favourable circumstances, Turkish trade unions experienced a heyday with stable and consistent density rates (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0143831X11411328">Figure 3</xref>). However, this non-organic political patronage became, essentially, another means of control over organized labour in that the relationship between the trade unions and the political parties in power was based on the manipulation of the former by the latter (<italic>controlling tolerance</italic>). The trade unions had to conform to this controlled politicization because they had acquired the power to organize in SOEs as a result of rights granted by the state itself, and because they lacked bottom-up mobilizing power over their members in the political realm that would otherwise enable them to effect a political exchange with the governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143831X11411328">Tunay, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>The favourable legal and economic circumstances between 1960 and 1980 can be said to have established a <italic>conflictual compromise</italic> between the political parties and the trade unions throughout the 1960s and 1970s (excluding the military intervention from 1971 to 1973). Conflictual compromise here refers to the fact that the state and trade unions had a compromise-based relationship in principle, but this relationship was also prone to conflicts. The steady rise and fall of trade union density and real wage rates in the manufacturing sector provides some insight into this so-called compromise, while the immediate rise in the numbers of workers striking because of decreasing wage levels, especially towards the end of the 1960s and the second half of the 1970s, highlights the conflictual side of that relationship (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0143831X11411328">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0143831X11411328">3</xref>). In this respect, conflictual compromise demonstrates that the Turkish trade unions’ relationship with the state or political parties was not based on the former’s full dependency on the latter, but rather on the latter’s power to control the former. This fact did not prevent the Turkish trade unions’ radicalization through massive strikes when so-called ‘tolerance’ turned into absolute suppression. However, nor did it prevent the state and its political parties from closing down the unions radical wings and banning strikes of any kind, as occurred after the military intervention of September 1980.</p>

<p>The military government of 1980–3 turned the basic pillars of Turkish IR upside down. The new intervention was a reaction to the political chaos of the late 1970s, arising out of the clash between the left and right segments of the population. Exacerbating the political chaos were adverse economic circumstances, with low and even negative economic growth and quadrupling inflation rates combined with an increasing gap in the balance of payments. The consequences were decreasing wage rates, increasing numbers of strikes and reciprocal lock-outs at the end of the 1970s. Demonstrating the fact that the military, not the political parties, held the power in Turkey by suspending political democracy and abolishing all political parties, the military government did not leave the system of organized labour relations untouched. They closed the leftist radical DISK (reopened in 1992), the radical-leaning trade unions in the Turk-Is (which focuses on bread-and-butter unionism) and the Islamist Hak-Is (reopened in 1981), on the grounds that trade unions were among those primarily responsible for the political chaos as they exploited workers’ rights for their ideological purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143831X11411328">Kaleağası, 2007</xref>: 295–6). This ambiguous ground became a de-radicalization opportunity for the military government. In particular, DISK was regarded by the military government as the ambassador of communism among the workers; hence, it was especially subject to pressure to de-ideologize. This assimilative strategy largely worked. DISK systematically softened its radical stance by initially adopting a more conciliatory strategy when it was reopened in 1992 and subsequently by forging a cordial relationship from 2008 onwards with the Turkish Industrialist and Businessmen’s Association (TUSIAD), which had been the major catalyst for the colonization attacks on organized labour in the early 1980s. Hak-Is also adopted a more professional organizational style and relinquished its religious leanings by disassociating itself from the Islamist National Order Party and affiliating with the ETUC (European Trade Union Confederation) and the ICFTU (International Confederation of Free Trade Unions) in 1997.</p>
<p>Further steps taken by the military government in colonizing organized labour included banning strikes and lock-outs until the end of the 1983 and making the settlement of industrial conflicts dependent on a compulsory arbitration mechanism, to be conducted by the Higher Arbitration Board. The option of appealing to the State Council against the Board’s decisions was also abolished. Like its counterpart of 1960–1, the military government of 1980–3 also enacted a new constitution, the Turkish Constitution of 1982, following the intervention. However, the new constitution’s target was completely different from its predecessor’s. The 1982 constitution introduced two major oppressive regulations in terms of IR. The first was the compulsory settlement by the Higher Arbitration Board of strikes that were to be postponed by the Board of Ministers or were in the sectors for which the right to strike was revoked. The second was the prohibition of trade unions’ engagement in politics in both organic and inorganic ways. This latter regulation ushered in a new era of hard depoliticization of IR by unlinking trade unions’ bonds of patronage with political parties. Following this came a massive privatization programme, the influence of which is evident in the plummeting public employment rates in the manufacturing sector throughout the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p>Unlike its counterpart of 1960–1, the military government of 1980–3 did not, however, leave the enactment of the trade union and collective bargaining acts to a democratically elected government. Reflecting the authoritarian spirit of the Constitution of 1982, the TUA of 1983 considerably restricted individual and collective trade union freedoms by: (1) extending the coverage of those who are prohibited from joining a trade union; (2) establishing a system of notary notification as a precondition for becoming a trade union member; (3) binding membership in the international trade unions to the approval of the Board of Ministers; and (4) imposing strict inspection mechanisms by the Ministry of Interior Affairs upon trade union activities. In a similar vein, the CBSLA of 1983 prohibited general and solidarity strikes along with the right to strike and expanded the coverage of those places and works where strikes were prohibited. Furthermore, the authoritarian nature of these regulations became stricter as the Higher Arbitration Board’s decisions on postponed strikes and industrial conflicts in the sectors forbidden to strike were made binding (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143831X11411328">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The anti-trade union storm swept through not only the politico-legal context of Turkish IR, but also its economic environment as well. It is within this context that the military government of 1980–3 pushed for neoliberalization by maintaining the IMF-led 24 January Programme signed by the overturned elected government. The programme included financial and commercial liberalization, privatization of publicly owned enterprises, export-led growth and public downsizing in favour of free market capitalism. This unquestioned strategy of rampant neoliberalism was pursued by the series of coalition governments, founded in most cases by ideologically opposite political parties, which were in power until the end of the 1990s. Consequently, between 1980 and 2001, in spite of decreasing and volatile growth at 3.5 percent on average, foreign trade reached 23.8 percent in 1990 and 50 percent in 2001 – an increase from an average of 12 percent of GDP between 1960 and 1979; and public employment in the manufacturing sector fell to 24.3 percent in 1990 and then plummeted to 10.4 percent in 2001 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143831X11411328">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Under pressure from an authoritarian neoliberal IR policy, Turkish trade unions adopted a strategy of active conflict, as seen in the soaring strike rates between 1989 and 1992 and in 1995 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0143831X11411328">Figure 3</xref>). These conflicts were sparked by the unbearable effects of neoliberal suppression, as seen in the plummeting wage levels in the manufacturing sector before the upsurge of these strikes and the steady erosion of trade union power (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0143831X11411328">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0143831X11411328">3</xref>). In light of the fact that the anti-trade union environment arose from the systemic combination of these legal, economic and political factors, trade unions had to turn active conflict into a <italic>compromise</italic>. In this respect, the sudden fall in strike rates after 1989–92 and 1995 indicated the compromising nature of the conflict. In brief, it can be said that the rise and fall in trade unions’ conflict strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143831X11411328">Dereli, 1993</xref>: 125) under the grip of the neoliberal status quo resulted in a compulsory compromise that eroded the gains of those periods of conflict. This result is demonstrated by the plummeting of wages after the real increases of 1987–91 and 1996–8 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0143831X11411328">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>We have so far discussed the development of Turkish IR from the late 1940s to the end of the 1990s through examining its systemic characteristics. It is also, at this stage, worth making a specific reference to the IR policy of the coalition government preceding the JDP as it will provide an insight into the structure of Turkish IR just before the JDP came to power, and into the de-ideologizing sway of neoliberalism in Turkey even over those political actors which were once rigorously advocating the empowerment of organized labour to participate in politico-economic processes to obtain a larger share of the nation’s wealth. Under the premiership of Bülent Ecevit, the Democratic Left Party (DLP), the major partner of the coalition government, had been just such an advocate. By combining the motto ‘left of the centre’ with anti-capitalist rhetoric, Bülent Ecevit was a symbol of social rights among the left of the Turkish electorate. In 1973, Ecevit wrote:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Today, the power and the direct political influence of the workers are far greater than those of the peasants. The significance of this development lies in the fact that at least one group of people outside the elite has, for the first time in Turkish history, attained a real position of influence and is now able to balance to some extent the traditional elites’ power. …It is obvious that without the right to bargain collectively and to strike, workers could not insure for themselves a just share of the increase in national income. Indeed, the first Five-Year Development Plan published in 1963, revealed that the per capita share of workers in the gross national product had declined to 10 per cent from 1950 to 1960. The Law on Collective Bargaining, therefore, provided the avenue for the worker to secure an income proportionate to his effort to his minimum living needs while protecting him against the employer. …Significant to note is the fact that many enterprises which granted substantial wage increases as a result of union pressures and bargaining achieved better profits than ever at the end of the year. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143831X11411328">Ecevit, 1973</xref>: 152–9)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This paragraph is quoted at length here because comparing it with the IR practices of the DLP-led coalition government demonstrates the transformative power of neoliberalism. This is exemplified in Article 23 of the Letter of Intent, dated 18 January 2002 and submitted to the IMF, in which the government declared:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>We recognise the need to move to a system of wage and salary determination that <italic>focuses increasingly on productivity and profitability rather than inflation</italic>. To this end, <italic>we will seek a significant reduction of the ex-post indexation element contained in current contracts during</italic> the next public worker collective bargaining round and civil service salary adjustment, and will <italic>use the Economic and Social Council as a forum for income policy discussions with the private sector</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143831X11411328">IMF, 2010</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This liberal manifesto was intended to prove the government’s decisiveness in implementing the IR element of the successive IMF stand-by agreements signed in 1999 and 2002. Its consequence was high losses in the net wages of civil servants, public sector workers and even in the minimum wage. As provided by Article 23, the relative increase of these indicators in 2002 was limited compared to the losses in 2000 and 2001, even on the eve of the 2002 general elections (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0143831X11411328">Figure 4</xref>). Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that the government used the Economic and Social Council (ESC) as a ‘forum’ for elaborating how to implement its neoliberal IR policy without taking the labour organizations into consideration, while claiming to discuss the income policy exclusively with the private sector. From its foundation in 1995, the ESC had been a state-dominated discussion forum rather than an institution that made binding decisions with an equal contribution from its participants. The coalition government maintained the structure of the ESC by rearranging its composition to include 16 representatives from the government, 12 from public and private employers and 12 from trade and civil servant unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143831X11411328"><italic>Resmi Gazette</italic>, 2001</xref>). Within this authoritative approach, the coalition government enacted the Public Officials’ Unions Law (POUL) in July 2001, which did not grant the civil servant unions the right to collective bargaining, let alone to strike. The unique function of civil servant unions was confined to ‘collective meeting’ with the government. It is ironic that in the event of a disagreement between these <italic>partners</italic>, it was the Board of Ministers that would make the final decision.</p>

<p>It was no coincidence that during the same period that Bülent Ecevit’s left-of-the-middle paradigm was upended, an attempt to commodify another worker-friendly project, the Just Order, also appeared, which was initiated by the Conservative Democrats (the Just Order concentrates on the individual, not the organized rights of workers). Revealing the marginalizing impact of neoliberalism on Islamist politics, this initiative put its imprint on Turkish IR from November 2002 onwards, when the Conservative Democrats came to power. In what follows, I first discuss the emergence of Conservative Democracy as a politico-economic project and then examine its IR theory and discourse compared to its antecedent, the Just Order, and its practice within the entrenched characteristics of the Turkish IR system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0143831X11411328">
<title>Conservative Democratic industrial relations strategy in discourse and practice</title>
<p>As a politico-economic project, the Just Order features the adaptation of basic Islamic premises to the specific circumstances of Turkey. The Just Order has been institutionalized by five successive political parties with religiously sensitive electoral bases, including the National Order Party (NOP) (1970–2), the National Salvation Party (NSP) (1972–81), the Welfare Party (WP) (1982–98), the Virtue Party (1997–2001) and, currently, the Felicity Party (2001–present). The core political concern of these parties has been to overturn the economic and political privilege of the civil and military bureaucracy and to erect a state model that respects religious rights and pursues an interest-free mixed economy. The first four of the parties listed above were shut down because they were believed to have a hidden agenda to transform Turkish secular capitalism into a religious order. Of these, it was the closure of the Welfare Party that initiated the division between the parties’ top figures. The reformists, led by Abdullah Gül, the current president of Turkey, and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the prime minister in office, split off from the Virtue Party and founded the Justice and Development Party in August 2001. They claimed that the Just Order politics, with its reformist perspective, was worn out and could not be sustained. The consequent political philosophy came to be known as Conservative Democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143831X11411328">Akdoğan, 2007</xref>), a new project developed through the reformulation of the Just Order under the economic and political constraints of the crisis-ridden structure of Turkey.</p>
<p>The political aspect of the crisis was triggered by the postmodern military memorandum of 28 February 1997, which resulted in the closure of the Welfare Party by the Constitutional Court of Turkey. The memorandum was a reaction to the coalition government under the premiership of Necmettin Erbakan on the grounds that his Welfare Party, as the majority partner of the coalition government, had a hidden agenda. This reaction had a structural, rather than a conjectural, basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143831X11411328">Ergil, 2000</xref>). As a result, the political tension has not diminished, but instead it has continued between those who had some type of relationship with the Just Order, and the Turkish military and civil bureaucracy. Within this context, there has been a persistent reference to the fact that the JDP maintains the Islamic spirit of the Welfare Party, albeit in a diluted fashion. For this reason, the Turkish military gave the government an e-memorandum warning on 27 April 2007 not to violate the main principles of the secular regime. Subsequently, in July 2008, the Turkish Constitutional Court decided that the JDP was the focal point of the activities against the secular political regime while rejecting demands for the party to be closed by majority decision. Aggravating this political turmoil was the post-crisis state of the Turkish economy with deep-seated structural imbalances caused by the successive catastrophic crises in 1994, 1998, 1999 and 2001 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143831X11411328">Akyüz and Boratav, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of these challenges, the JDP has adopted a pragmatic politico-economic strategy oscillating between calming the clash with the secular political regime and establishing economic stability, and responding to the demands of its wide-ranging electorate, which includes entrepreneurs, low-income populations and the working class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143831X11411328">Hale and Özbudun, 2010</xref>: 30–43). As far as Turkish IR is concerned, this pragmatic strategy assumed a ‘hard’ character that embraced the elements of Islamism of the Just Order, which formed the neoliberal status quo from the 1980s onwards, and, unexpectedly, also those of social democracy. I pursue the traces of this trilateral mixture in what follows, but to begin this investigation, it is important to first touch on the Just Order’s propositions about IR to cast light on the Islamic elements in the IR policy of the JDP.</p>
<p>In terms of IR, the Just Order envisions a social contract between the state, employers and workers that will keep employers from abusing workers’ rights, workers from abusing their jobs and the state from showing a bias towards either employers or workers. In this peace-based articulation of IR the Just Order does not elaborate on <italic>class</italic> organizations, taking for granted the absence of class-based conflict among the actors of labour relations. As the primary theoretician of the Just Order, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11411328">Erbakan (1991)</xref> argues that in the Just Order, everyone will become a member of solidarity organizations like trade unions or guilds. Their main function would be an intermediary role between the state and their members for apportioning social security and unemployment benefits. In this respect, the term ‘trade union’ does not refer to contemporary trade unionism but rather refers to those labour organizations that would function as self-help organizations for their members and would participate in the regulation of supply and demand in the labour market under the leadership of the state authorities, in the same way as the Ottoman craft associations. Given the state-dominated structure of Turkish labour relations, the Just Order explicitly tailors a more interventionist function for the state than does pure Islam. This is because the Just Order’s politics focus exclusively on the provision of a decent working environment through the political power that establishes an interest-free economic regime, ‘the Just Economic Order’. This regime would provide an equal distribution of income between labour and capital (see the party programmes of the National Order Party, National Salvation Party and Welfare Party; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143831X11411328">Ekinci and Önsal, 2008</xref>: 43–5, 189, 60). However, the mobilization of workers against political authority by radical means such as mass strikes is not condoned, as it is believed that such methods cannot exert a systemic influence over secular capitalism. Rather, such methods, it is argued, serve no other purpose aside from triggering political chaos.</p>
<p>However, prominent Muslim scholars in Turkey confirm workers’ right, under Islamic law, to strike to prevent the exploitation of their rights by employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143831X11411328">Karaman, 2010</xref>). In this respect, the IR strategy of the Just Order appears to be contradictory. It develops an ultra-radical anti-capitalist rhetoric that envisages ceasing all economic ties with international economic organizations such as the IMF and World Bank, and it tailors a politico-economic programme, the Just Order, to transform the inequitable structure of Turkish secular capitalism and eliminate the economic and political privilege of its constituents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11411328">Erbakan, 1991</xref>). However, at the expense of violating a basic Islamic principle, its rhetoric also abstains from encouraging exploited workers to secure their rights, even through democratic channels such as strikes.</p>
<p>This authoritarian nature of the Just Order’s IR policy led the Islamist Hak-Is Trade Union Confederation to end its semi-dependent relationship with the tradition of Just Order politics. The Hak-Is was founded between 1975 and 1977 with the strategic support of the NSP and NSP-affiliated ministries, which played a key role in the coalition government. It is thus not surprising that the Confederation adopted a conciliatory trade union strategy centred on establishing an employee–employer fraternity and on rejecting class conflict. Because such a strategy failed to materialize, particularly under the anti-union politico-economic structure of the post-1980 era, Hak-Is revised its ideas and adopted a more democratic and professional stance by articulating a more secular attitude and, as mentioned earlier, becoming a member of the ETUC and the ICFTU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143831X11411328">Duran and Yıldırım, 2005</xref>). In addition to these developments, another factor that contributed to the termination of the semi-dependent relationship between the Confederation and Just Order politics was the systemic clash of the latter with the secular regime, as it was leading to the Confederation becoming marginalized among the workers.</p>
<p>Along with the disassociation of the non-secular Hak-Is, the clash between Just Order politics and the secular trade union confederations (Turk-Is and DISK) can be seen as a factor in Erbakan’s disregard for organized rights and instead his direct focus on workers’ individual rights. Based on the claim that the Just Order politics had a hidden agenda, this clash came to the fore when the WP-led coalition government was in power between June 1996 and 1997. Combined with the hidden (albeit marginalized) ideological relationship between the WP and Hak-Is, such an ideological confrontation led the Turk-Is and DISK to act together with the centrist forces (the civil and military bureaucracy) to put political pressure on the WP-led coalition government, resulting in the collapse of the WP. As the major representative of the secular bourgeoisie, the Turkish Industrialists’ and Businessmen’s Association (TUSIAD) was also the major partner of that cooperation. TUSIAD’s clash with the WP specifically derived from the fact that the party had begun to utilize political power to direct Turkey’s economy away from the West towards the Islamic world, in particularly diverting it from the European Union membership process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143831X11411328">Önder, 1999</xref>: 670–90).</p>
<p>In Conservative Democratic discourse, the state/government has retained a relatively powerful position. In theory, the government is assigned the role of organizing the power relations between the employers and the workers by proactively setting necessary legal regulations to settle and prevent conflicts among them. The unique means for ensuring peaceful IR is to establish social dialogue as a platform for mutual agreement. From this perspective, trade unions and employer organizations are expected to take a conciliatory stance to attain and sustain peace in a positive-sum relationship. The following declaration in the party programme describes this approach:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Our biggest target is to place the social dialogue at the highest level and solve problems through <italic>mutual agreements</italic>, within a triple structure consisting of worker, employer and the government, for the purpose of attaining <italic>peace</italic> for workers and for the maintenance of labour activities in a healthy and balanced manner. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143831X11411328">JDP, 2010</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It is apparent that by adapting a democratic political language, the Conservative Democrats maintain a peace-based articulation among the actors of IR in the Just Order in the interest of achieving austerity corporatism. They substitute religion with ‘mutual interests’ as the main catalyst for maintaining peaceful industrial relations. Unlike the Just Order’s rhetorical stance, the Conservative Democrats do not refrain from supporting the right of both trade and civil servant unions to collectively bargain and to strike. But because they ultimately aim to establish an austerity corporatism, it is safe to suggest that the JDP does not envision a radical unionism, but a conciliatory unionism, as does the Just Order. Their discourse, however, goes beyond soft support, and takes on a truly social democrat nature: Prime Minister Tayyip Erdoğan declared, ‘It is our <italic>primary</italic> responsibility to strengthen trade unionism.’ No declaration like this has been publicly expressed by the leader of a governing party since the 1980s. The impact of this discourse was reflected in the description of him in the leftist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143831X11411328"><italic>Daily Radikal</italic> (2007)</xref> as the ‘Che Guevara of Turkey’ and ‘Socialist Tayyip’. Accordingly, the existing trade and civil servants unions have been able to adopt a radical (albeit compromising) strategy, as seen at the end of the 1980s and in the mid-1990s. And both the trade and civil servant unions are inclined to utilize the political tensions to bolster their bargaining power with the government, as they did during the WP-led coalition government. However, the <italic>Daily Radikal</italic> perceived this social democratic discourse more as socialist primarily because the JDP’s pro-organized labour discourse was emerging after two long decades of authoritarian and neoliberal state control of the trade unions. Furthermore, Turkey was struggling in the aftermath of successive economic crises.</p>
<p>In realpolitik, however, the JDP’s electrifying IR discourse has fallen into a vicious circle as it remains under the shadow of the party’s goal to provide and sustain economic and political stability as the means to its electoral success. The JDP came to power in November 2002, and it chose to uphold the IMF stand-by agreement signed by the previous government in February 2002. In April 2005, the party signed another agreement with the IMF, which included an austere economic policy designed to maintain strict fiscal discipline in order to decrease the debt ratio, avoid deficit spending and thereby create a balanced budget. In the throes of this austere economic strategy, the Conservative Democrats adopted an IR policy based on: (1) determining wage and salary levels irrespective of ex-post indexation and restricting the employment of civil servants so that the total personnel expenditure does not become an unsustainable burden on government budgets; (2) equalizing public worker wages and civil servant salaries; and (3) reducing the employment levels of publicly owned enterprises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143831X11411328">UT, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>To operationalize its IR targets smoothly, the JDP came up with a strategic tactic, <italic>controlling governance</italic>, to inspire the trade and civil servant unions to passively engage in the managerial processes of the IR policy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0143831X11411328">2</xref></sup> The major tools of controlling governance have been collective contract negotiations between the government and civil servant confederations and public sector collective bargaining with the trade union confederations, the Economic and Social Council of Turkey (the ESC) and the EU–Turkey Joint Consultative Committee (JCC) (each tool is discussed below). Motivated by the EU accession process, the unions have engaged in these controlling governance mechanisms as a means of revitalizing organized labour which was marginalized under the hard de-politicizing impact of the Turkish state’s strategy of suppression throughout the two long decades of the 1980s and 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143831X11411328">Valk and Süral, 2005</xref>). In fact, they are aware of the limited functionality of passive engagement in the face-saving governance processes, but they have been forced to use these channels in the absence of any better alternatives. The embedded top-down organizational style of Turkish trade and civil servant unions has created a desperate deadlock in the face of the systemic pressure of neoliberalism which has restricted their scope in both the industrial and political spheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143831X11411328">Özdemir, 2004</xref>: 248–61). Because of their inexperience in developing independent mobilization in the industrial sphere, they feel obliged to protect their organizational entity through a face-saving/passive engagement in the political arena. At the end of the day, caught in a vicious circle, the trade and civil servant unions have, however, had to turn this silent compromise/engagement into conflict (<italic>conflictual compromise</italic>), as the so-called ‘engagement’ has, unsurprisingly, not produced the expected gains. Hence, labour organizations have once again adopted the strategy of conflictual compromise, as they did during the development of Turkish IR between 1960 and 1979 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X11411328">Table 1</xref>). In both periods, the state has aimed to keep labour organizations under control by strategically incorporating them into the managerial processes of IR through manipulative politicizing and controlling governance, respectively. (In contrast, the state used the tactic of hard depoliticization in the dissolution period between 1980 and 2001.) In both periods, labour organizations have engaged in these tactical policies because they are organized primarily in the public sector and unable to initiate a bottom-up mobilization against the state authority. That is, they have not been able to instrumentalize political exchange for equal power sharing in IR. However, even if they have compromised through the so-called ‘engagement’, they have not hesitated to stir up conflict when the so-called manipulative politicizing and controlling governance changed into complete passivization.</p>
<p>Within this context, during the period from 2003 to 2009, a large majority of the public sector collective contract negotiations resulted in disagreements between the government and the civil servants. The Board of Ministers made the final decision in line with the government’s goals. Each year, the civil servant unions reciprocated through <italic>passive</italic> protests, such as press releases following massive gatherings or organizing their members to stay away from work for a few hours. Despite the threat of these soft protests and in complete opposition to their social democrat promises, the Conservative Democrats chose to maintain the authoritarian regulations of the POUL of 2001. In terms of public IR, on the other hand, the next two JDP governments did not follow a hard neoliberal strategy. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0143831X11411328">Figure 4</xref>, civil servant salaries rose slightly but steadily. This phenomenon can be attributed to the Islamic patrimonialism of the Conservative Democrats, which was implemented as formulated by the Just Order: salaries are raised by the government itself without permitting a genuine conflict with civil servant unions in the ‘public sphere’. Thus, the JDP governments’ endeavour is to create the impression that there is ‘no need for conflict-generating initiatives because the government is already doing everything that can be done for wage labour’. In particular, the increases are based on the implementation of austerity corporatism in a solidarist manner. In other words, the Conservative Democrats allot the available budgetary funds for personnel expenditure to civil servant salaries and freeze public sector wages to compensate for the high difference between them. It is also within this context that the highest increases materialized in the minimum wage levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0143831X11411328">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike the civil servant unions, the trade unions came to agreements with the government at the public sector collective bargaining table in 2003, 2005, 2007 and finally in 2009. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0143831X11411328">Figure 4</xref>, this ‘concession bargaining’ resulted in an agreement due to the workers’ acceptance of the wage freeze. The rapid meltdown of trade union power under the systemic pressure of the neoliberal status quo (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0143831X11411328">Figure 3</xref>), high (structural) unemployment levels around 10 percent and a sweeping privatization process aimed at reducing the employment level of publicly owned enterprises has been the chief factor in the compulsory acceptance by the trade unions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143831X11411328">Figure 1</xref> shows that public sector employment in manufacturing retreated to around one-quarter). The compulsory nature of the unions’ acceptance is indicated by the fact that in spite of this wage restraint policy by the government, between 2003 and May 2009 there were only 11 strikes, involving 2554 workers, in the public sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143831X11411328">MLSS, 2010</xref>). Despite their relative silence towards the wage restraint, the trade unions did hold mass rallies and protests against the rampant privatization of the publicly owned enterprises where the great majority of their members were employed, such as the Turkish Petroleum Refineries, Paper and Cardboard Producing and Processing, Turkish Telecom, Tobacco and Tobacco Products and Salt and Alcohol Enterprises. In most cases, the mass protests by the public sector workers were backed up by the civil servant unions. However, these reactionary protests have not gone beyond passive conflict, which has had no real impact on the JDP’s reduction of employment levels in the public sector or on trade union power. This is not confined to public sector workers in the manufacturing sector but rather is a general strategy. Hence, public employment decreased to 14 percent in 2007 from 14.2 percent in 2002. Furthermore, the party has increased the share of contracted employment in total as seen in its steady and swift increase from 2004 onwards (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0143831X11411328">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>As the third major tool of the JDP’s controlling governance strategy, the ESC has been regarded by the party as an instrument for implementing austerity corporatism. This is exemplified in the party’s declaration that, ‘Civil servant salaries and public worker wages will not be subject to backward-looking indexation. More generally, the Economic and Social Council will be <italic>instrumental</italic> in conveying the government’s commitment to breaking the cycle of backward-looking indexation to all parties involved in wage setting in the economy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143831X11411328">UT, 2010b</xref>). This declaration means that wage levels will continue to be determined according to the inflation index without any attempt to compensate the real losses from persistent hyperinflation in the previous decades. Furthermore, like the DLP-led coalition government, the JDP does not hesitate to declare that it uses the ESC simply as a forum through which it ‘conveys’ its austerity measures to the trade and civil servant confederations even without considering their proposals.</p>
<p>Even though it is under the direct guidance of the European Economic and Social Committee members, the fourth ‘instrument’ of the JDP’s controlling governance, the EU–Turkey Joint Consultative Committee (JCC), is no more effective than the ESC. Founded in 1995, the JCC theoretically functions as an instrument to promote interaction between the economic and social actors of organized civil society in the EU and Turkey. Meeting twice a year, its members consist of employer organizations, trade unions and various interest groups. The primary aim of the JCC is the direct involvement of organized civil society in the accession process. As far as the practice of Conservative Democratic IR is concerned, it is not surprising that trade union rights are a recurrent topic on the Committee agenda. Following each meeting, the Committee reiterates the fact that Turkey ratified the ILO Convention No. 87 in 1993 and No. 98 in 1952, and it urges the Turkish government to carry out their requirements with reference to the fact that trade union rights are one of the chief preconditions of the EU accession process. However, no concrete result has been reached in the realm of trade union rights. For example, at the JCC’s 25th meeting, it was declared that ‘The JCC regrets that trade union rights and freedom of association are still being infringed in Turkey’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143831X11411328">JCC, 2008</xref>); in its 21st meeting the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143831X11411328">JCC (2006)</xref> had noted that neither visit of the JCCs co-chairpersons to the Turkish Minister of Labour and Social Security, in autumn 2005 and spring 2006, had produced any further results. In fact, Turkey’s continued abstention on Articles 5 and 6 of the European Social Chapter is the most prominent example of the inconclusiveness and passivity of negotiations within the JCC. As a result, the leftist DISK withdrew from the JCC as well as the ESC, declaring ‘We should not be “the oxygen” of these institutions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143831X11411328"><italic>Daily Milliyet</italic>, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Like their promise to provide the right to organize, to strike and to collectively bargain, the discourse of the Conservative Democrats on achieving a genuine ‘social dialogue’ for the democratic management of IR is belied by their authoritarian practice. This practice proves that the Conservative Democrats, in reality, perceive the trade and civil servant unions as simply civil society organizations whose primary function is to convey their views at the negotiation tables, such as the ESC and the JCC. Such a perspective complies with that of the Just Order, as the latter also does not perceive a challenging role for labour organizations with regard to governmental strategy. It should be noted that the JDP’s authoritarian practice with regard to IR is based on its neoliberal economic programme, not on its hostility to labour organizations on the grounds that these organizations can engage in regime-based clashes against the party, as they did against the WP. The JDP guarded against such a risk by transforming the Just Order’s religious oriented discourse into a secular/democratic one. Islamist orientations within the discourse and practice of the JDP’s IR, such as solidarism, have not become a risk factor as the party has entangled them with neoliberal (and even social democrat) parameters. Rather, the trade and civil servant bodies have largely declared that they oppose the e-memorandum issued by the Turkish military and the attempted closure of the JDP by the Constitutional Court.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0143831X11411328">3</xref></sup> Even the secular bourgeoisie, primarily the members of the TUSIAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143831X11411328">2009</xref>: 29), declared their prudent opposition to closing down the JDP in light of the JDP’s strong commitment to the EU membership process and IMF stand-by agreements. In this respect, it can be suggested that the JDP has developed a democratic vision on the part of the labour organizations through its social democrat discourse. However, it prevented this discourse from becoming a risk factor in its relationship with the employers by committing itself to the austere economic programme and by abstaining from implementing this discourse.</p>
<p>To create its so-called democratic vision, the Conservative Democrats initiated a debate on amending the TUA and CBSLA of 1983 and the POUL of 2001, as they rose to power in 2002. Under the auspices of the ‘social democrat IR discourse’ in the party’s programme and the populist articulation of this discourse by Tayyip Erdoğan, the prime minister, such a diplomatic manoeuvre has functioned to put controlling governance into practice in a less contentious way. In doing so, the JDP has given the impression that the Conservative Democrats intend to establish a genuine industrial and economic democracy, but the crisis-ridden circumstances of the Turkish political economy restrict the party from implementing this discourse in practice. This impression is reflected, for example, in the reason that the Conservative Democrats offered for refusing to ratify Articles 5 and 6 of the European Social Chapter. They claim that the ‘socioeconomic circumstances’ of the Turkish Republic prevent them from regulating organized labour’s rights – and especially civil servants’ rights – to organize, to collectively bargain and to strike in a democratic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143831X11411328">Turkish Parliament, 2005</xref>). Therefore, the party intended to (1) prevent austerity corporatism from triggering labour radicalism that would exacerbate the existing regime-based political turmoil, thereby blemishing the party’s populist/democratic political vision; and (2) alleviate the perennial critiques in the EU progress reports and ILO Committee on Freedom of Association and Application Committee on the anti-democratic character of Turkish IR. The impact of this manoeuvre, however, did not last long once its face-saving nature was recognized. For example, the party did not take a genuine step towards implementing democratization reforms in the IR system even when the Turkish economy reached a steady growth rate of an average 6.4 percent between 2003 and 2007. It has thus become inconceivable to present a rational criterion for when circumstances will become favourable for the provision of economic and industrial democracy. However, it was apparent that by not ratifying these Articles, the party hoped to avoid putting itself under any further obligation, especially with regard to the provision of collective bargaining and strike rights to civil servants. By signing the ILO Conventions No. 87 and 98, Turkey had, in fact, taken up those obligations much earlier. Yet, the Social Chapter is of special significance for the ongoing EU membership process, and the party does not wish to risk the implementation of the Maastricht criteria, which is of top priority and more essential than Articles 5 and 6 for the membership process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143831X11411328">Öniş and Bakır, 2007</xref>: 155). This is because once they acquire the right to collectively bargain and strike, the civil servants can challenge the government to increase their salaries and therefore prevent the government from determining the budgetary targets, public debt and deficits by simply ignoring the retrospective inflation index. Civil servants will hold the power to do so as they work under permanent contracts. It is also for this reason that, as mentioned earlier, the party escalated the proportion of flexible employment patterns in the public sector (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0143831X11411328">Figure 5</xref>).</p>
<p>When the above-mentioned diplomatic manoeuvres became ineffective, the party launched two new (practical) ones. First, in May 2008, the party prepared a Draft Act on the amendments to the TUA and CBSLA of 1983 and brought it to the Turkish parliament for ratification. The second manoeuvre was a further amendment to the Turkish Constitution of 1982. The first amendment was presented as (1) compliance with the EU acquis and ILO Conventions and (2) elimination of the Acts’ anti-democratic character, with special reference to the fact that they were enacted by the military government of 1980–3. The process of EU accession was the prime catalyst for the JDP’s democratization reforms between 2002 and 2010; thus, the primary justification for the amendment was the EU acquis, and the other two factors were of secondary importance. The amendments to the TUA of 1983, in essence, aimed to: (1) eliminate authoritarian state control over the financial and organizational operations of trade unions; (2) replace the notary notification requirement for trade union membership with an internet application to be submitted by email; and (3) recognize the right of international trade unions to found affiliations in Turkish territories. The amendments to the CBLSA of 1983 included: (1) repealing the 10 percent sectoral coverage to qualify the right to collective bargaining; (2) requiring the Board of Ministers to consult with the Higher Arbitration Board and stating that the Board of Ministers’ decisions can be brought to the Council of State; and (3) lifting strike bans on some sectors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143831X11411328">Table 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143831X11411328">Turkish Parliament, 2008</xref>). On the one hand, the impact of these amendments cannot be understated as they eliminate several of the authoritarian elements of the TUA and CBLSA of 1983. On the other hand, it should be noted that these amendments cannot be claimed to exert a significant impact on the power relations between the actors of Turkish IR: trade union density rates decreased to 5 percent (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0143831X11411328">Figure 3</xref>) in a politico-economic environment where neoliberalism, with its all trappings, became entrenched. Furthermore, the amendments have been awaiting endorsement in the Turkish parliament for more than two years (since May 2008), and the current perspective, at the time of writing, is that they will be handled after the forthcoming elections in 2011. In this regard, it seems more rational to claim that the Conservative Democrats aim to maintain their diplomatic game rather than to implement the requirements of their social democratic IR discourse.</p>
<p>Their second new practical manoeuvre involves two major democratization reforms in IR through amendments to the Turkish Constitution of 1982 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143831X11411328">Turkish Parliament, 2010</xref>). These amendments were endorsed by the referendum of 12 September 2010, which was deliberately held on the 30th anniversary of the military intervention of 12 September 1980. They are currently in force. The first is the provision to the civil servant unions of the right to sign collective contracts and the settlement of disagreements at the end of the collective contract negotiations by the Conciliation Board, whose decision is equal to a collective contract. There is no need to comment on the fact that replacing the phrase ‘collective meeting’ in its previous form with ‘collective contract’ in its current form is of little evident value in practice. But passing the authority to make final decisions on disagreements arising out of the collective contracts to the Conciliation Board instead of the Board of Ministers can augment the power of civil servant unions to obtain higher salary increases in view of the fact that the former is composed of four academics from the departments of labour economics, labour law, public finance and administrative law under the leadership of the Higher Arbitration Board’s chair. This favourable change is nonetheless bound to be restricted because the civil servants are not granted the right to strike. The right to strike for civil servants has yet to be provided in the eighth year of the JDP, even though it was explicitly promised in the party programme. Furthermore, there is no projection of when this right will be granted.</p>
<p>The second amendment is the repeal of the ban on political, solidarity and general strikes and go-slows. This regulation can be said to be the most concrete social democratic step taken by the JDP in democratizing IR. However, when combined, again, with the fact that civil servants have not been granted the right to strike, a rather confusing picture appears. Why does the JDP government maintain the ban on the right to strike for civil servants while repealing the ban on even political and general strikes for workers, which could simply augment the scope for trade unions to challenge the politico-economic decision-making? Because the latter is an indirect risk for the government, while the former carries a direct risk by enabling civil servants to directly challenge the economic policies of the government. And there is also the strike postponement mechanism, which can be used to control levels of trade union radicalism. The JDP governments have not hesitated to use this mechanism five times during their incumbency on the grounds of national health and security. On the other hand, it is safe to assume that the JDP has had to take such an indirect risk in view of the fact that these amendments have been launched during a time when the JDP’s popularity is at a critical point, on the eve of the 2011 general elections. Political tension has remained high in Turkey since mid-2007 due to the ‘Ergonokon Suit’, the trial of the military and civil officials alleged to be behind the attempted military revolution against the JDP government. In this respect, the constitutional revision included the repeal of an amendment providing the Turkish military with grounds for military revolution to protect the secular regime, and amendments changing the selection procedures and composition of the Turkish Constitutional Court and Higher Court of Justice. In light of the JDP’s ambiguous IR strategy, we may assume that the party views the new above-mentioned democratic regulations in IR as a tool for alleviating its contentious political agenda as those regulations were presented to the referendum. Otherwise, why wait until now to forge these regulations, and why take these social democratic regulations in IR to referendum alongside such politically divisive issues?</p>

<title>‘Hard pragmatism’ as a governmental industrial relations strategy</title>
<p>When we examine the amendments to the TUA and CBLSA of 1983 and the Turkish Constitution of 1982 from a systemic viewpoint, it becomes apparent that the Conservative Democrats essentially aim to render the provision of individual and collective trade union freedoms in the public and private sectors contingent on their politico-economic manoeuvres. This kind of pragmatic policy-making is not restricted to these amendments, but encompasses the entire IR system. Given the JDP’s IR policies between 2002 and 2010, during their eight-year period of power as the inheritors of Turkish IR, it can be suggested that the Conservative Democrats adopted a ‘hard pragmatism’ as their main IR strategy. This ‘hard pragmatism’ aims to manage IR through a combination of Islamist, neoliberal and social democratic principles at the levels of discourse and practice. By means of their hard pragmatism, the Conservative Democrats attempt, first, to prevent an escalation of conflict among the IR actors and to build a popular consensus among the working class. To do so, they use controlling governance as a strategic tactic under the auspices of a social democratic IR discourse, a series of diplomatic IR manoeuvres and an austere corporatism combined with Islamic solidarism. Second, the Conservative Democrats aim to establish and sustain economic austerity without violating fiscal discipline. Thus, they pursue their third aim, which is to capture and maintain the support of both labour and employers or at least to prevent their ‘flawed’ voices from blemishing the party’s popular ‘democratic’ image. A survey of the JDP’s electoral base, for example, showed that the JDP’s supporters were, by and large, members of the rural population, artisans and small traders in the cities, urban slum-dwellers, and up and coming religious entrepreneurs running small- or middle-sized businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143831X11411328">TESEV, 2002</xref>: 70–1). The working class also voted for the JDP to a considerable extent (see below). Thus, the party realizes its hard pragmatism through a trilateral IR strategy that comprises neoliberal, Islamic and social democratic motives. To a large extent, it does so because it is a mass party that must create a delicate balance between the diverse IR interests of its wide-ranging electorate.</p>
<p>Of these three so-called motives, the ‘independent’ variable of the JDP’s hard pragmatism, in terms of the overall functioning of Turkish IR during the period 2002–10, is the neoliberal motive. The JDP inherited an authoritarian and neoliberal IR regime and a political economy in deep crisis. In the context of domestic electoral competition and global economic competition, the party singled out the neoliberal ingredients of hard pragmatism against Islamic and social democratic values. In this respect, we can treat the Islamist and social democratic motives as the dependent variables that compensate for the suppressive dimensions of the JDP’s IR policies, which include economic austerity and catch-all policies. In other words, hard pragmatism requires that economic austerity and catch-all politics be prioritized, but it also requires a balance between these and Islamist and social democratic policies, as discussed in the second section of the article. However, the JDP’s ultimate aim in cultivating hard pragmatism is not to create a purely neoliberal political economy, under which the public and private employers can easily manipulate labour, but to sustain its support among its electorate. The increasing support of the working class for the party indicates that the JDP is achieving this goal. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0143831X11411328">Figure 6</xref> shows JDP votes in major working-class towns in 2002 and 2007. It is clear that the workers voted for the JDP in all but one location. The average percentages of votes in these towns are consistent with the JDP’s rates of total votes nationally; these were, respectively, 36.4 and 34.2 percent in 2002 and 44.6 and 46.7 percent in 2007.</p>

</fig>
<p>It is within this context that, given these intriguing implications, the Conservative Democrats’ pragmatist IR strategy could not be aligned solely with any one of those three motives in systemic terms in spite of its bias towards neoliberalism. What makes the JDP’s pragmatism hard and unique is its complex and intractable nature arising out of the use of these three opposite motives, with changing emphasis. It is hard because the JDP has to pragmatically fine-tune the relative weight of those three motives under the constraint of co-managing a lot of ‘opposing’ factors such as high unemployment and trade union rights, capturing the support of both employers and labour, the democratization reforms in terms of IR required by the EU acquis and fiscal discipline as another parameter conditioned by the Maastricht criteria, etc. (These factors are not necessarily opposite, but the JDP’s policy adaptations in IR indicate that the party perceives them as such.) In this regard, unlike the incumbent governments during the development and dissolution periods of Turkish IR, the JDP has had to initiate or at least to articulate some reforms even though these reforms have not had systemic impact. By and large, the governments sustained the balance of power established by the military governments at the beginning of these periods. Thus, they were inclined either to commit to the status quo by refraining from making or even articulating changes that would undermine the established power relations in IR, or to adopt simple pragmatic actions, such as wage and salary increases before general elections. In reality, the JDP’s reforms have had little, if any, actual impact. What differentiates the JDP from the previous governments is that it has pragmatically reconfigured the Turkish system of IR in discourse and practice without any real involvement of the Turkish military. Furthermore, it managed this reconfiguration in such a manner that it could win the support of labour and employers and has even increased its support for the upcoming elections. The JDP constructed a new vision by creating a social democratic IR discourse that allowed it to perpetuate its central position in Turkish politics and to fulfil the requirements of this discourse under the shadow of its neoliberal politico-economic agenda. It is this delicate balance between discourse and practice that makes the JDP’s hard pragmatism a double-edged IR strategy that at once suppresses and supports organized labour.</p>
<p>In this sense, the JDP could not sustain a directly suppressive IR strategy, as the Motherland Party did between 1983 and 1991. The JDP has been in power during a period in which the dominant ideology is a neoliberalism that envisages the complete elimination of organized labour. This ‘strong’ contextual factor provides the party with an opportunity to dismantle organized labour. The JDP has not hesitated to use the neoliberal status quo in Turkish IR as leverage to implement its hard pragmatism. However, were the JDP to adopt a purely neoliberal strategy, it could not obtain the support of the working class. Furthermore, the JDP cannot take the risk of a massive conflict with the working class in other respects, especially when this risk is combined with existing political tensions. In addition to undermining the JDP’s popular image, this risk would change this so-called ‘political tension’ into a regime-based clash. Another factor is the EU membership process, which was the prime initiator of democratization reforms within IR during the reorganization crisis between 2002 and 2010. Even if the EU factor does not become influential in this regard (which appears to be the case with respect to the operation of the ESC and JCC because the IR stipulations within the EU acquis process are non-binding), it still rules out the implementation of anti-democratic regulations. This point is significant for the JDP’s general democratic image in terms of the state–civil society relationship, even if IR is perceived to be a marginal element of the EU accession reforms.</p>
<p>Along with the unfeasibility of maintaining the previous neoliberal status quo as it was, it is also not propitious for the Conservative Democrats to implement their social democratic discourse abruptly, as the RPP did while regulating the TUA and CBSLA of 1963. In such a case, as discussed above, the JDP is likely to have to set fiscal discipline aside because organized labour, especially the civil servants, would be able to challenge the government’s politico-economic strategies. This conflict would put economic stability, the prime determinant of the JDP’s electoral success, at risk (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143831X11411328">Çarkoğlu, 2008</xref>), and it would become inconceivable for the JDP to sustain a cross-class alliance. It should also be noted, however, that the JDP cannot calmly overlook its social democratic promises because the Turkish working class has tactical competence sufficient to eliminate such simple pragmatism. The collapse of the political establishment in the general elections of November 2002 was a landmark in this regard; none of the three political parties in the DLP-led coalition government could enter the Turkish parliament because none could meet the 10 percent national threshold. For example, thanks to its social democratic promises, notably its support of the working class, the DLP took 22.9 percent of the total votes in the 1999 general election, but this rate fell to 1.2 percent in the 2002 general elections. It argues safe to say that the aforementioned neoliberal IR policy of the DLP-led government, in opposition to Ecevit’s social democratic discourse, played an important role in the DLP’s loss of 21.7 percent of the vote. As a political party that rose up out of these ruins, the JDP could not take the risk of cutting wages and salaries or neglecting its social democratic promises, as did its predecessor.</p>
<p>Due to the politico-economic risk, the JDP could neither formulate nor implement a pure Islamist IR strategy either. An IR strategy should be part of a general politico-economic project, such as the Just Order; these projects are likely to stir up regime-based conflict between the JDP and the labour organizations, as was the case between the Welfare Party and the leading trade union organizations. The emergence of Conservative Democracy, in essence, rests on the elimination of this risk. Even without this risk, the party would not sustain the IR premises of the Just Order because it could not, in this case, put into effect its hard pragmatism in IR. In this respect, the Just Order’s ‘social justice first’ manifesto (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143831X11411328">Erbakan, 1991</xref>) would call for the relaxation of austerity corporatism to provide a decent work environment, and its anti-capitalist rhetoric would rule out any sustainable relationship with TUSIAD. (To operationalize its hard pragmatism in IR, the JDP chooses to maintain economic and political stability over providing a decent work environment. Even if the party does not aspire to establish an employer-friendly IR structure, its austere corporatism singles out economic stability as the prime determinant of electoral success. Furthermore, it emphasizes providing a favourable investment environment for employers more than it emphasizes providing a decent working environment for employees.) The maintenance of the Just Order’s IR strategy is also not feasible for the party because it cannot sustain its popularity by camouflaging its neoliberal policies in a social democratic IR discourse and in the aforementioned diplomatic manoeuvres.</p>
<p>What should be done if the party cannot adopt a purely neoliberal, social democratic or Islamist IR policy in discourse and practice? The solution is hard pragmatism, as described in this article. It should also be noted that the other factor reinforcing the JDP’s pragmatism is that the labour organizations and opposition parties are unable to develop effective counter-strategies. Trade unions blame the JDP for adopting such a political stance (hard pragmatism), which unsurprisingly is designed to maintain the party’s hold on power, rather than to have created a pro-union environment by providing the trade unions with truly democratic rights without expecting them to engage in any political exchange. The reason for this expectation is that throughout the evolution of Turkish IR, the state has unilaterally set the rules and power relationships. The trade unions and civil servants do not criticize themselves for their failure to compel the JDP to democratize IR. In terms of the interplay between organized labour and the incumbent government, IR is a game of political exchange in which labour must in turn create its own input to force the government to take its demands seriously. The only available means for the unions is to encourage its members to vote or not to vote for the government. However, in Turkish politics, both civil servant and trade unions are incapable of such an action. For example, as mentioned earlier, the JDP enjoys support in working-class towns where massive privatizations were implemented (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0143831X11411328">Figure 6</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143831X11411328">Yıldırım (2006)</xref> argued, the trade unions have failed to encourage their members not to vote for the JDP in these areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0143831X11411328">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As discussed in the first part of this article, Turkish IR, since its institutionalization in the late 1940s, has been conducted by incumbent civil or military governments according to the requirements of their pragmatist or authoritarian politico-economic strategies. The Conservative Democrats have chosen to maintain this tradition by creating a ‘hard pragmatism’, which aims to establish an IR structure that will not restrain but feed their austere economic policy and catch-all politics. What makes the JDP’s pragmatism ‘hard’ is that it has been put into effect by means of an intriguing IR discourse and practice consisting of Islamist, neoliberal and social democrat motives. The JDP’s multivariate approach, which manages the shifting weights of these three motives, has enabled them to maintain the support of the Turkish working class. Although, under this hard pragmatist perspective, the JDP has implemented some noteworthy changes in favour of organized labour, these changes have not had a systemic impact on the overall functioning of Turkish IR. Rather, as <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143831X11411328">Table 1</xref> shows, the party used the controlling policy tools of Turkish IR under the protective umbrella of its populist discourse. As a result, the panorama is a pending reorganizational crisis arising out of the confrontation between the JDP’s populist discourse, non-systemic changes and entrenched systemic peculiarities of Turkish IR. It is possible to suggest that the party has produced this crisis intentionally (and, admittedly, managed it effectively in terms of its political career) by following up its so-called hard pragmatism with subsequent diplomatic manoeuvres. Organized labour’s failure to create a political exchange and to develop influential strategies against these manoeuvres has facilitated the manipulative power of the JDP. In this respect, the passivity of the trade and civil service unions and their ineffective participation in public sector collective meetings, the ESC and the JCC have served to leave the JDP’s hard pragmatism unchallenged. This power imbalance can be seen, for example, in rapidly decreasing trade union membership rates and in the continuing ban on collective bargaining and right to strike for civil service unions. Furthermore, organized labour has made no promising response to these issues. Thus, there is no evidence to refute the conclusion that Conservative Democracy, as a hard pragmatic strategy of IR, will continue to exist should the JDP remain in power after the general elections in June 2011. The main opposition party’s failure to develop a genuine alternative strengthens this possibility in terms of IR.</p>

<p>Tactics are the actual ways in which the strategies are executed (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143831X11411328">Keane, 2005</xref>). What characterizes ‘strategic’ tactics is that they are those strategic actions that help to implement a strategy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143831X11411328">David and Bruton, 2009</xref>: 464). In this regard, as to be discussed in the next section, controlling governance is a strategic action that helps to implement the JDP’s main strategy of ‘hard pragmatism’.</p></fn>

<p>During the Tekel workers’ protests for improvements in their working conditions, the chairman of the Tek Gıda-Is trade union declared, ‘If it becomes a necessity, we will overthrow the government.’ Admittedly, such a ‘socialist’ discourse is no less pragmatic than Tayyip Erdoğan’s social democratic discourse because the trade unions are unable to convince even their own members not to vote for the JDP. In contrast, the JDP has been able to convert its pragmatism into votes among the working class. Tayyip Erdoğan’s response to this pragmatic response confirms this phenomenon. He said, ‘They think that this country consists solely of themselves. The JDP came to power by cultivating 15 million votes. How many members do you have? How will you overthrow the JDP government, which has 15 million members and is so close to its workers and civil servants?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143831X11411328"><italic>Daily Milliyet</italic>, 2010</xref>). Moreover, the fact that there is no genuine alternative party for the workers strengthens the JDP’s position. The IR career of the main opposition party, the RPP, has been highly ambiguous. The RPP has no decisive social democratic discourse like Tayyip Erdoğan’s and certainly does not have a full-fledged programme to democratize IR. The new chairman of the RPP could not succeed in cultivating such a programme under an authoritative politico-economic project; rather, in a response to the question of where he would find the resources to finance higher social expenditure, he said, ‘My name is Kemal. I will find the resources’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143831X11411328"><italic>Daily Milliyet</italic>, 2011</xref>). This outlook is a kind of simplistic pragmatism because he is not aware of the transformation of social democracy in Europe stemming from the search for resources for so-called social expenditure over the past three decades. This approach is simply not convincing for the Turkish working class because of their aforementioned experiences during era of the DLP-led coalition government. They are aware that, in the Turkish context, simplistic pragmatist policy adaptations will end in economic catastrophes that will considerably diminish their earnings, as occurred in 2001 under the DLP-led coalition. And what persuades them to vote for the JDP is their double shuffle in making a ‘hard choice’ between the simplistic and hard versions of <italic>pragmatism</italic> in IR; it seems that they will face a similar choice in the upcoming general elections in June 2011.</p></fn>
