<abstract>
<p>Mutations in the smooth muscle–specific isoform of α-actin (<italic>ACTA2</italic>) cause vascular smooth muscle dysfunction leading to aortic aneurysm and moyamoya syndrome. A unique R179H mutation in <italic>ACTA2 </italic>has been reported to result in widespread smooth muscle dysfunction affecting vascular and extravascular smooth muscles. We report a 7-year-old girl with an <italic>ACTA2 </italic>R179H mutation manifesting with neonatal seizures due to multifocal infarcts, asymmetric motor deficits, global developmental delay, spasticity, congenital bilateral mydriasis, and a large patent ductus arteriosus. Serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain over 7 years showed diffuse supratentorial white matter abnormalities consistent with a progressive leukoencephalopathy. Magnetic resonance angiography of the cerebral vessels showed stenosis in the terminal portion of the bilateral internal carotid arteries with fusiform dilation of the proximal segment. Neonatal onset of neurologic symptoms in <italic>ACTA2 </italic>mutations has not been previously reported. R179H mutation in <italic>ACTA2</italic> represents the severe end of the disease spectrum.</p>

<p>Mutations in the smooth muscle–specific isoform of α-actin (<italic>ACTA2</italic>), a gene that encodes for a major contractile protein in vascular smooth muscle, typically manifest as aneurysms in the aorta and moyamoya syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812446631">1</xref></sup> Recently, a novel de novo mutation in <italic>ACTA2</italic> (p.R179H) has been linked to diffuse smooth muscle dysfunction with multisystem abnormalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812446631">2</xref></sup> The spectrum of neurologic manifestations in this newly described entity is largely unknown. Neurologic manifestations occurring in the newborn period have not been previously described.</p>
<p>We report a 7-year-old girl with symptomatic neonatal seizures and asymmetric motor deficits due to multifocal infarcts, spasticity, and global developmental delay with progressive diffuse leukoencephalopathy. The presence of congenital bilateral mydriasis and large patent ductus arteriosus led to the diagnosis of an <italic>ACTA2</italic> gene mutation.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>This 7-year-old girl was born at term gestation by cesarean section for fetal distress. She weighed 3500 g at birth. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. On day 2 of life, she developed right arm clonic seizures. Physical examination showed a lethargic newborn with bilateral mydriasis appearing as “dilated and non reactive pupils,” and hypertonia in the right upper and both lower extremities. Reflexes were initially subdued but subsequently became hyperactive with extensor plantar responses. Primitive reflexes were normal but her Moro response was incomplete. Head circumference was normal at 35 cm. No dysmorphic features were present. A comprehensive ophthalmologic evaluation confirmed bilateral iris abnormalities that simulated partial aniridia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed multiple foci of acute infarction within the periventricular white matter and splenium of the corpus callosum, with associated minimal petechial hemorrhages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812446631">Figure 1</xref>). On day 3 of life, she developed congestive heart failure due to an unusually large, window-like patent ductus arteriosus, which was surgically repaired at 6 weeks of age. Intraoperatively, the anomaly was found to be an enormous “window” connecting the pulmonary artery bifurcation and proximal left pulmonary artery to the underside of the aortic arch, aortic isthmus, and upper descending aorta. On transecting the window under cardiopulmonary bypass, the connection was clearly of ductal tissue, suggesting that this was a huge ductal communication with no-length extending into the aortic arch and upper descending aorta. Following surgical repair, her cardiac function remained stable.</p>

<p>Serial brain magnetic resonance imaging studies show progressive white matter abnormalities in the supratentorial regions. T1 weighted images at 10 days of age show abnormal hyperintense signals in the periventricular and deep white matter. Follow up images at 9 months (T2-weighted images) and 7 years of age (T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery images) show marked increase in the signal abnormalities in the same region; also note cystic changes in the periventricular white matter.</p>

</fig>
<p>On serial follow-up visits until 7 years of age, she had normal physical growth, acquired microcephaly, global developmental delay, and asymmetric spastic quadriparesis with relative sparing of the left arm. She had no loss of acquired skills. She was treated with levetiracetam for seizure recurrence at 3 years of age. Follow-up brain MRI at ages 9 months, 3.5 years, and 7 years showed progressively increasing diffuse supratentorial white matter abnormalities, with mild dilation of the ventricles, and marked hyperintensity on T2-and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812446631">Figure 1</xref>). Chiari I malformation with tonsillar descent of 6 mm was also noted. Spine imaging revealed no syringomyelia or cord tethering. Her eye findings were stable on follow-up with myopia of 3 diopters in each eye.</p>
<p>Given the progressive white matter abnormalities on early brain imaging, evaluation of causes for leukoencephalopathy was performed. Extensive biochemical and genetic workup for white matter disorders was negative. Following recent reports of <italic>ACTA2</italic> mutations with iris, cardiac, and neurologic manifestations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812446631">2</xref></sup> sequencing of the <italic>ACTA2</italic> gene was performed. This showed a pathogenic c.536G&gt;A mutation in exon 6, confirming the genetic etiology for the syndrome. Magnetic resonance angiography of the cerebral vessels showed severe stenosis of the terminal portions of the bilateral internal carotid arteries, with dilation of the proximal cavernous-to-supraclinoid segment of the internal carotid arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073812446631">Figure 2</xref>). Magnetic resonance angiography of the aorta showed no evidence of aneurysm. She had mildly delayed gastric emptying, and problems with chronic constipation requiring laxatives. No hypotonia of the bladder or dilation of the ureters was noted.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>ACTA2</italic> is a highly conserved gene encoding for a smooth muscle cell isoform of α-actin, a major contractile protein in vascular smooth muscle cell. Mutations in <italic>ACTA2</italic> alter the structure and assembly of actin filaments of vascular smooth muscle cell, leading to weakened vessel walls—a state of “vasculomyopathy.” The role of <italic>ACTA2</italic> in vasculopathy was first reported in a study of families with thoracic aortic aneurysms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812446631">1</xref></sup> Later, early-onset coronary artery disease and strokes were also reported confirming <italic>ACTA2</italic> mutations as a risk factor for a more widespread systemic vasculopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812446631">3</xref></sup> Recently, a report of 5 patients with a specific mutation in <italic>ACTA2</italic> (c.536G&gt;A) resulting in a R179H change was found to be associated with multisystem abnormalities. These patients had congenital mydriasis, patent ductus arteriosus, moyamoya syndrome, diffuse leukoencephalopathy, variable involvement of the pulmonary alveoli, and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts suggesting more widespread dysfunction of smooth muscle in the vascular and extravascular systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812446631">2</xref></sup> One other reported patient with the same mutation had only moyamoya syndrome without any other systemic features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812446631">4</xref></sup> Our patient had this unique mutation and had systemic and neurologic manifestations. Neonatal onset of neurologic symptoms as noted in our patient has not been previously described in this disorder.</p>
<p>The complete clinical spectrum of neurologic manifestations in <italic>ACTA2</italic> R179H mutation is not well described. From the limited description of 5 patients in the medical literature, most have had transient neurologic deficits suggesting a stroke-like presentation, with the youngest age of onset being 2 years. Other manifestations include headache, tinnitus, hyperactivity, inattention, motor and language delay, and paraplegia due to spinal cord ischemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812446631">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812446631">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812446631"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812446631">7</xref></sup> Our patient presented with seizures, abnormal tone, and asymmetric motor deficits in the early neonatal period. Brain MRI shortly after birth showed features of multifocal ischemic brain injury in the bilateral periventricular region and evidence of a few petechial hemorrhages. Serial brain imaging showed increasing diffuse white matter abnormalities predominantly affecting the periventricular and deep white matter bilaterally, consistent with a progressive leukoencephalopathy. The white matter abnormalities in our patient were not typical for global hypoxic ischemic injury of a term infant and were remarkably similar in appearance to an earlier report of a patient with the same <italic>ACTA2</italic> mutation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812446631">2</xref></sup> We believe that the brain lesions in our patient are secondary to the R179H mutation in <italic>ACTA2</italic> and represent the severe end of the spectrum of this disease. Among <italic>ACTA2</italic> mutations, the R179H mutation is considered the most severe in terms of both the degree and extent of systemic involvement. Some patients have been noted with symptomatic alveolar dysgenesis and hypomotility at birth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812446631">2</xref></sup> Another recent case report described fetal megacystis and gastrointestinal prune belly sequence along with other multisystem abnormalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812446631">8</xref></sup> Findings in our patient suggest that neurologic manifestations can occur as early as the newborn period and possibly even in utero. The apparent nonprogressive clinical course in our patient probably reflects the very slow progression of the disease after a severe acute injury in early life.</p>
<p>The cerebrovascular abnormalities associated with the R179H <italic>ACTA2</italic> mutation appear to be distinctly different from “moyamoya disease.” Almost all reported patients have had fusiform dilation of the cavernous-to-clinoid segment of the internal carotid artery, with stenosis or occlusion of the terminal portion of the internal carotid arteries. The stenotic segment often extends to the origin of anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Focal dilation of the internal carotid artery is not a typical finding in childhood “moyamoya disease.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812446631">9</xref></sup> We consider that such focal dilation may be a clue to the diagnosis of this rare genetic disorder. Detailed description of cerebral vasculature is not available in patients with other <italic>ACTA2</italic> mutations to postulate whether this finding is universal in all <italic>ACTA2</italic> mutations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812446631">3</xref></sup> Focal aneurysmal dilations occur as a result of weakened vessel wall from altered structural protein, and focal stenosis as a result of increased proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the intima and media of the arteries. These effects appear to be site-specific variably affecting different segments of the internal carotid arteries—stenosis in the distal segment and dilation in the proximal segment. The reason for such selective effects remains to be determined. It is uncertain whether our patient had moyamoya-type vasculopathy at birth, as vascular imaging was not performed until later on in life.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we report a child with an <italic>ACTA2</italic> R179H mutation presenting with neurologic manifestations in the newborn period. Associated systemic manifestations, specifically congenital bilateral mydriasis and large patent ductus arteriosus, serve as key diagnostic clues to this rare disorder. Recognition of this disorder is critical to aid early recognition and management of systemic and cerebral vascular complications.</p>
