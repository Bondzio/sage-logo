<abstract>
<p>Here we design, fabricate, and study a composite-antenna-structure (CAS) with excellent electrical and mechanical properties. The CAS, consisting of a glass/epoxy face sheet and a honeycomb core, acts as a basic mechanical structure in which a spiral type antenna is embedded. To increase the signal intensity, a carbon fiber plate is used as the bottom sheet. This reflector interrupts radiation, causing the wave from the antenna source to flow to the end of the arms without sufficient radiation. To overcome this problem, a microwave absorber is used for unwanted radiation to reduce the effect of the reflector. We measured the antenna performance by the return loss, axial ratio, gain, and radiation pattern. The structure showed a bandwidth of 0.5–2 GHz and a gain of 5–9 dBi, with circular polarization characteristics and a reflection loss below −10 dB within the desired frequency band.</p>

<p>In the last 20 years, there has been much research into the embedding of antennas in load-bearing structural surfaces of aircraft, so as to improve both structural efficiency and antenna performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311426806">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311426806">3</xref></sup> Structural designers as well as material and antenna designers have collaborated to develop a novel high-payoff technology known as a conformal load-bearing antenna structure (CLAS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311426806">3</xref></sup> This technology shows great promise for enhancing the performance and capability of aircraft, by reducing weight, improving the structural efficiency of airframes that contain antennas, and improving the electromagnetic performance of antennas. To develop the load-bearing antenna structure, we proposed the surface-antenna-structure (SAS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311426806">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311426806">6</xref></sup> and the composite-smart-structure (CSS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311426806">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311426806">9</xref></sup> which use antenna-integrated composite structures of sandwich construction.</p>
<p>In those studies, we designed and fabricated a microstrip antenna structure that implemented satellite communication in the X band (8.2–12.4 GHz) and Ku band (12.4–18 GHz). These structures are based on a sandwich structure, consisting two thin load-bearing facesheets, bonded on either side of a moderately thick and lightweight core that prevents the face sheets from buckling.

<sec id="sec2-0021998311426806"><title>Structure and materials</title>
<p>The basic design concept of the CAS panel involves an organic composite multi-layer sandwich panel into which spiral antenna elements are inserted. This concept originates mechanically from a composite sandwich structure, and electrically from a spiral antenna, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311426806">Figure 1</xref>. The sandwich structure consists of two thin load-bearing facesheets, bonded to either side of a moderately thick and lightweight core that prevents the face sheets from buckling. The sandwich structure has considerably high structural efficiency (ratio of strength of stiffness to weight), and acquires its bending rigidity mainly by separation of the facesheets. The SAS panel consists of several basic layers. Each layer must meet its own combination of structural and electrical design requirements as well as manufacturing and assembly requirements. The basic panel layers are: an outer facesheet, antenna element, honeycomb core, and supporter elements. The layers are bonded by an adhesive to form the final assembly. The outer facesheet must carry a significant portion of the in-plane loads, as it contributes to the overall panel buckling resistance, and provides low velocity impact and environmental resistance. This outer facesheet must also permit the transmission and reception of RF signals. The facesheet material must be low loss and only weakly dielectric in order to minimize signal attenuation and reflection loss. The honeycomb cores transmit shear loads between layers induced by bending loads in the panel, and support the facesheet against wrinkling. They also provide impact resistance and increase the overall panel buckling resistance. The thickness of the honeycomb cores contributes significantly to the overall rigidity, and is involved in the balance between panel thinness and structural rigidity. The supporter, in addition to supporting the entire structure, also carries a significant portion of the in-plane loads together with the outer facesheet. It can be selected without considering electrical performance, and therefore has the best mechanical properties of any layer in the CAS construction. Spiral antennas can be used in high-performance aircraft, spacecraft, and satellite/missile applications-where constraints include size, weight, cost, performance, ease of installation, and aerodynamic profile.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311426806">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311426806">18</xref></sup> These antennas are low-profile, conformable to planar and nonplanar surfaces, simple and inexpensive to manufacture using modern printed-circuit technology, and compatible with monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) designs. Our CAS design is based on a spiral type antenna for low frequency and broadband communication with a bottom layer consisting of a carbon fiber plate for strength improvement.

</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0021998311426806"><title>Design and experimental procedure</title>
<p>The aim of this study is to design the antenna for low frequency and broadband communication. The antenna requirements are: a frequency range 0.5–2 GHz (bandwidth 1.5 GHz), and a gain of at least 10 dBi with circular polarization. In designing the antenna elements, a computer-aided design tool (CST Microwave Studio) is used to select a large number of strongly interacting parameters by means of integrated full-wave electromagnetic simulation. The resulting antenna elements and their dimensions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311426806">Figure 2</xref>. The 1 mm thick facesheet is a flame-retardant composition (FR-4) glass/epoxy radiating patch comprising a spiral antenna. This spiral antenna, set in a circle of diameter 30 cm, is 2 mm wide, makes 10.5 turns, and has a coaxial feed line, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311426806">Figure 2</xref>(a). FR-4 glass epoxy is a popular and versatile high-pressure thermoset plastic of laminate grade with a good strength-to-weight ratio. FR-4 undergoes negligible water absorption and is commonly used as an electrical insulator possessing considerable mechanical strength. The main objective is to obtain a good impedance match as seen by the feedline, in the range of frequencies from 0.5 to 2 GHz. The feedline connected to the input port has a characteristic impedance of 50 Ω, chosen to match the impedance at the port. A coaxial cable is used to feed the antenna in the center. Manufacturing of the CAS is a sequential process. The facesheet, which includes the antenna elements, is first prepared by a photolithographic process. The honeycomb cores must be aligned with each layer prior to permanent bonding, in order to give precise electromagnetic coupling. For alignment, four guide holes are made near the edge of every layer. These are confirmed to have no effect on antenna performance. The CAS is assembled by aligning these holes using a plastic nut and bolt. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311426806">Figure 2</xref>(b) shows an exploded view of a CAS, with the materials chosen for each layer.

</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0021998311426806"><title>Experimental results</title>
<p>Antenna performance was measured and compared with that of the corresponding assembly without adhesive bonds. The input return loss was measured with a Network Analyzer 8510 under laboratory conditions; radiation patterns were obtained using a compact range at POSTECH (Pohang University of Science and Technology). The compact range provides an efficient means of obtaining antenna patterns, which normally involve far-field measurements, at a relatively short distance. Measurement is achieved by converting the spherical wave produced by the feed source to a plane wave, using a parabolic reflector. By placing the antenna at an appropriate distance from the reflector, high-quality plane wave illumination of fairly uniform amplitude and phase is obtained. Gains are calculated by comparing the strength of the electric field with that of a standard gain horn antenna (SAS-585, A.H. Systems, Inc.) for which the gain is known.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311426806">Figure 3</xref> shows the electrical performance of a single ring antenna and a CFRP backed spiral antenna. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311426806">Figure 3</xref>(a) shows that at low frequencies (under 0.8 GHz), the transmission characteristics around the spiral antenna with CFRP backing become rapidly degraded because of negative electromagnetic effect. This indicates that the CAS cannot operate at these frequencies because the antennas only operate under −10 dB frequency band. This result is caused by the CFRP acting as a dielectric material. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311426806">Figure 3</xref>(b) shows the gain. When CFRP is used, the gain increases, enabling the antenna to be oriented toward the top sheet. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311426806">Figure 4</xref> shows the radiation pattern of the single ring antenna and the CFRP backed spiral antenna. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311426806">Figure 4</xref>(a) shows that radiation on both sides of the radiation pattern can occur. There is an upwards LHCP (left-handed-circular-polarization) and a downwards RHCP (right-handed-circular-polarization) for the single ring antenna. In addition, radiation occurs on both sides without distortion of the radiation patterns. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311426806">Figure 4</xref>(b) shows the radiation pattern of the CFRP backed spiral antenna. The CFRP downwards of the antenna blocks the radiation pattern in one direction because it has the orientation; hence, the CFRP backed spiral antenna has the characteristic of an LHCP antenna. These results are due to CFRP acting as a dielectric material. When the reflector is located near the spiral antenna, the currents on the spiral arms are insufficiently reduced at the end of the arms; that is some reflection at the end of the spiral arms. In other words, the reflector interrupts radiation, and causes the wave from the antenna source to flow to the end of the arms without sufficient radiation. Therefore, it is necessary to consider and compensate for the resonant property under about 0.8 GHz.

</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0021998311426806"><title>New design with CFRP plate for high strength</title>
<p>A frequency shift is observed with the use of CFRP backing in the CAS. The greatest problem of the spiral antenna is that the antenna current flowing along the edge of the spiral antenna, resulting in the reflection points, the antenna reflector on the back of the spiral due to the presence of interference received by the antenna current antenna does not work out as well as.</p>
<p>In addition, to satisfy the mechanical and electrical performance requirements, an electromagnetic wave absorber should be used while maintaining a low height of the antenna to improve performance. The spiral antenna is placed on this absorber to absorb the electromagnetic waves. Thus, the effect of the reflector can be reduced as the absorber blocks unwanted radiation. However, the absorber has the disadvantage of decreasing the antenna gain and efficiency because it absorbs electromagnetic radiation. It is necessary, therefore, to deploy these absorbers proper to use to effectively. Placing absorbers in the top and bottom fillings is inefficient from the standpoint of material. Thus, it is necessary to properly place a smaller amount of absorber to maintain the performance of the antenna. In order to find the optimal arrangement of the absorber for antenna performance, three cases were evaluated using a computer-aided design tool (CST Microwave Studio), the results of which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311426806">Figure 5</xref>(a)–(c). In first case, the absorber fills the space between the antenna and the reflector at the periphery. In the second, a gap is placed between the antenna and the absorber. The third absorber is in contact with the antenna reflector. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311426806">Figure 5</xref>(d) shows the reflection coefficient characteristics as a function of the absorber configuration. At 1 GHz and above, all show similar performance regardless of the absorber configuration. At around 0.5 GHz, the ring absorber shows the best performance, followed by the bottom gap absorber and then, upper gap absorber.
<fig id="fig5-0021998311426806" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Design configuration of microwave absorber: (a) ring absorber, (b) upper gap absorber, (c) bottom gap absorber, (d) reflection coefficient characteristics as a function of absorber configuration.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311426806-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>From these results, a CAS with an input port impedance 50 Ω was subsequently designed to operate at the frequency range of 0.5–2 GHz, taking into consideration the effect of the electromagnetic absorber. Each layer is bonded to the top and bottom of its neighbors in sequence, using an epoxy film adhesive. The assembly, covered by a vacuum bag, is then cured in an autoclave according to the recommended curing cycle for the adhesive (125°C for 90 min. at a pressure of 3 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311426806">Figure 6</xref>(a) and (b) shows the appearance of each layer and the top view of the final assembly after fabrication. The size of the CAS is 300 × 300 × 28 mm<sup>3</sup>. Antenna performance of the fabricated CAS is determined by electrical measurements. We have studied antennas embedded in a structural surface, which provides good structural and electrical efficiencies at the same time. The design is a CAS into which a spiral antenna element is inserted. This design provides antenna performances that meet our requirements. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311426806">Figure 7</xref>(a) shows the return loss characteristic; the observed bandwidth is approximately 1.5 GHz, corresponding to the frequency range of interest (0.5–2 GHz). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311426806">Figure 7</xref>(b) shows the antenna gain, in which gain reduction occurs at low frequencies because of energy loss due to absorption. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311426806">Figure 8</xref> shows the radiation patterns at 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 GHz. The radiation pattern indicates that emission from the front of the spiral antenna is LHCP, whereas RHCP comes out of the back. The back radiation is low because of the carbon fiber plate, whereas the front radiation is large with an LHCP characteristic. Without absorber, there is some reflection at the end of the spiral arms. This reflection distorts not only the radiation patterns but also the polarizations. A wide-band axial ratio performance is obtained only by adding the absorber.

<p>In this article, we have designed and fabricated a spiral antenna of honeycomb sandwich construction. The final article is a 300 × 300 × 28 mm<sup>3</sup> flat antenna panel with an antenna element. Electrical measurements of the fabricated structure show that it satisfies the design requirements, with a bandwidth above 1.5 GHz and a high gain. In addition, given that structure is based on a carbon fiber plate, it has a higher signal intensity than other structures with a glass fiber plate. The design concept can be extended to provide a useful guide for manufacturers of structural body panels as well as antenna designers, and promises to become an innovative future communication technology.</p>
