<abstract>
<p>Using household survey data collected during November 2009 to January 2010 among 500 low-income families in Shanghai, this article provides updated evidence on the poverty reduction effects of the Minimum Living Standard Assurance (MLSA, or <italic>Dibao</italic>), urban China’s primary public assistance program. The article finds that, even though Shanghai’s MLSA line has been constantly raised, it has trailed behind the average living standard in Shanghai as measured by city per capita income and consumption levels. Low education, unemployment, being unmarried, and having child(ren) have been revealed to be strongly linked to MLSA participation and higher benefit amounts. MLSA’s poverty reduction effects were most prominent when a low poverty line was used, and the effect size became smaller as the level of the poverty line rose. When using two absolute poverty lines that were set in the national context, MLSA lowered the poverty rate, gap, and severity in Shanghai significantly but was unable to eliminate poverty. When using two much higher relative poverty lines, it is evident that MLSA was far from sufficient in lifting the relative positions of the recipient families in the context of the overall income distribution in Shanghai.</p>

Si se utiliza una línea de pobreza baja, se verifican impactos fuertes sobre la reducción de la pobreza; utilizando una línea de pobreza más alta se observa un impacto menor. Cuando se utilizan dos líneas de pobreza absoluta definidas en el contexto nacional, el MLSA tiene un impacto significativo sobre la tasa, la brecha y la severidad de la pobreza en Shanghai, sin embargo, el seguro no elimina la pobreza. Cuando se usan dos líneas de pobreza relativa más elevadas, es evidente que el seguro MLSA estuvo lejos de ser suficiente para mejorar la posición relativa de las familias en el contexto de la distribución general del ingreso en Shanghai.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>China has experienced the largest and fastest poverty reduction in history since the launching of its economic reforms in the late 1970s, making it currently the second largest economy in the world. Yet, due to its enormous population size, China is still very much a developing country. Its per capita GDP currently ranks only the 94th (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468018113484609">International Monetary Fund, 2011</xref>). Coupled with this laggard status has been its staggeringly rising income inequality. According to one estimate, China’s Gini coefficient reached 0.48 in 2007, with the top 1% income group enjoying 41.4% of the national wealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468018113484609">Cong and Li, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Low-income families in urban China are particularly vulnerable as they are not only left behind by the market competition, but also by the substantial cutbacks in public benefits formerly provided by their employers or the state. Before the economic reforms, China’s urban citizens were covered by comprehensive and generous welfare benefits, usually offered by their employers. However, these welfare provisions – including social insurance, health care, housing, education, and food assistance – became heavy burdens for the state-owned and collective enterprises and decelerated China’s economic growth as well. Therefore, one of the major goals of China’s economic reform in the urban areas has been to shift the welfare burden borne by the state-owned and collective enterprises to individuals. As a result, the urban social benefits have retrenched to a great extent. In the rural area, social benefits have always been minimal, covering only a small fraction of people, usually those in desperate need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468018113484609">Davis, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468018113484609">Gao, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468018113484609">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468018113484609">Gao and Riskin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468018113484609">Guan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468018113484609">Leung, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468018113484609">Li and Piachaud, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468018113484609">Saunders and Shang, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468018113484609">Wong, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>To provide a basic safety net for the urban poor, Shanghai initiated a public assistance program, the Minimum Living Standard Assurance (MLSA, or <italic>Dibao</italic>), in 1993. The city government set up a local minimum living standard (also called the MLSA line) to reflect the basic income level that could meet a person’s consumption needs. The MLSA line is measured at per capita monthly amount in yuan. If a family’s per capita household income is lower than this standard, then the family is eligible for MLSA assistance, calculated as the difference between the family’s per capita income and the MLSA line. The MLSA line is adjusted annually to take into account changes in living standards and consumer prices.</p>
<p>Following Shanghai’s successful experience, MLSA was quickly adopted by several other cities. In 1999, the central government stipulated that MLSA should be implemented in all cities and all city governments should set up their respective MLSA lines and commit a budget to this program. Since then MLSA has been rapidly expanded, serving as a last resort to the urban poor. In 2007, MLSA was implemented in rural areas nationwide.</p>
<p>Which families receive MLSA benefits and how much do they get? More importantly, to what extent does MLSA reduce poverty? A set of recent studies have made efforts to address these questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468018113484609">Du and Park, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468018113484609">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468018113484609">Gustafsson and Deng, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468018113484609">Leung, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468018113484609">Ravallion et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468018113484609">Wang, 2007</xref>). They find that certain demographic characteristics such as low education, poor health or disability, unemployment, and larger household size are associated with higher probability of MLSA participation. They also find that MLSA has some modest impacts on poverty reduction among the participants, but these effects are limited by the program’s partial coverage and delivery. Further, MLSA has shown a larger impact on reducing poverty depth and severity than on poverty rate.</p>
<p>Building on this set of studies, the present article uses household survey data collected during November 2009 to January 2010 among 500 low-income families in Shanghai to provide updated evidence. This article makes two unique contributions. First, as detailed below, the sample for this study was drawn from MLSA’s target population – low-income families who qualified or nearly qualified for MLSA benefits. Focusing on low-income families in the survey allows us to not only have a relatively large sample of MLSA recipients compared to previous studies, but also to more directly examine MLSA’s poverty reduction effects and its policy implications among its target population. Second, most existing studies examined the demographic determinants of MLSA participation, but few provided evidence on how family demographics affected MLSA benefit amount received by families. This study addresses this literature gap.</p>
<p>The rest of the article is organized as follows. The next section provides a policy background of MLSA in Shanghai, followed by a section reviewing the existing literature. The following section introduces data and methods. Results are reported in the section that comes next. A final section concludes and discusses limitations and policy implications of this study.</p>

<title>Policy background</title>
<p>Shanghai was the first city in China to set up an MLSA program, in 1993. It was a rather bold initiative taken up by the Shanghai city government. Despite being one of the most rapidly developing and most prosperous cities in China, Shanghai in the early 1990s was faced with increasing urban poverty and public discontent, resulted from the bankruptcy of many state-owned and collective enterprises and the disappearance of various social insurances formerly provided by employers. Enabled by its high economic performance and relative decision-making autonomy allowed by the central government, in 1992 the Shanghai government held a series of meetings to study the issue of urban poverty and proposed possible policy solutions. The central theme of the meetings was to provide basic income security to those in need, regardless of their employment status. A particular focus was on how to ensure social stability by providing assistance to those without jobs so that the city could stay on course with its economic development and growth. Based on this series of meetings and research done simultaneously to provide empirical evidence, the Shanghai government established its MLSA program on 1 June 1993 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468018113484609">Hong, 2005a</xref>).</p>
<p>Seen as the last resort for the most disadvantaged, the MLSA line needed to reflect the bare minimum living standard for people to survive in Shanghai. To start with, the line was set to be lower than the minimum wage, the unemployment insurance, and the living subsidy to the unemployed, to reflect its ‘last resort’ nature. It was then conferred and discussed among various government departments, including civil affairs, finance, statistics, labor, commerce, health, education, and housing, to gauge the appropriateness of the estimated line. The initial MLSA line – the presumed local minimum living standard – was set at 120 yuan per capita per month in 1993 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468018113484609">Hong, 2005a</xref>).</p>
<p>Since then the MLSA line has been lifted constantly to reflect the rising basic consumption needs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468018113484609">Figure 1</xref> presents the trends in the MLSA line from 1993 to 2009, before and after adjusting for official Shanghai consumer price indices (CPI). The unadjusted line increased steadily from 120 yuan in 1993 to 205 yuan in 1998. In 1999, when MLSA was implemented nationwide in the cities, Shanghai also raised its MLSA line substantially to 280 yuan. The MLSA line was mostly stable during the next several years, increasing only slightly to reach 300 yuan by 2005. Since then, the Shanghai government has lifted the line annually by a substantial margin. In 2009, when the collection of the survey data used in this study started, the MLSA line was 425 yuan.</p>

<p>When adjusted for CPI, the Shanghai MLSA line was actually more generous than the unadjusted line. In 1993, the adjusted MLSA line was 235 yuan, nearly double the unadjusted line. From 1994 to 1998, the adjusted MLSA line increased steadily but to a less extent than the unadjusted line, averaging about 50 yuan higher than the unadjusted line. When MLSA was implemented nationwide in the cities in 1999, the adjusted line also had a substantial jump, from 243 yuan in 1998 to 327 yuan in 1999. From 1999 to 2005, the adjusted MLSA line hovered around 325 yuan, about 35 yuan higher than the unadjusted line on average. Since then the increase in the adjusted MLSA line has leveled off, trailing the pace of the unadjusted line. By 2008, the adjusted line was virtually at the same level as the unadjusted line. Overall, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468018113484609">Figure 1</xref> shows that the Shanghai MLSA line – both unadjusted and adjusted for CPI – has increased over time, reflecting the government’s continued effort to make the line mimic the rising basic consumption need.</p>
<p>How does the MLSA line compare to the average income and consumption levels? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468018113484609">Figure 2</xref> shows the trend of MLSA line as a percentage of per capita income and consumption, respectively, in the urban area of Shanghai from 1993 to 2009. The MLSA line was a quarter of Shanghai per capita income in 1993. It then dropped to 21% in 1994 and remained at about that level until 1998. In 1999, the MLSA line rose to be 24% of the city per capita income as a result of the nationwide implementation of MLSA and the substantial increase in the MLSA line. Since then, however, the MLSA line as a percentage of per capita income has shown a consistent and rather steep decline, dropping from 22% in 1998 to only 12% in 2009. It is an indisputable fact that the MLSA line in Shanghai and across all cities remains very low relative to the average living standard. The MLSA subsidy in most cases can only help beneficiaries sustain a very basic livelihood. They typically do not consume any meat or fruits and mostly cannot afford health care or education fees for their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468018113484609">Solinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468018113484609">Tang, 2001</xref>). Many families receiving MLSA actually use the money to pay for health care and education instead of buying necessities such as food and clothing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468018113484609">Gao et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, the Shanghai trend documented here parallels the broader trend that the national average MLSA line declined during this period relative to the minimum wage, household per capita disposable income, and as a share of both total GDP and total government spending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468018113484609">Solinger, 2012</xref>).</p>

<p>The trend of the MLSA line as a percentage of per capita consumption paralleled that of the MLSA line as a percentage of per capita income. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468018113484609">Figure 2</xref>, in 1993, the MLSA line was one-third of Shanghai per capita consumption, 8 percentage points higher than as a percentage of per capita income. It then dropped in 1994 and stayed around 27% till 1998. After a jump to 31% in 1999, it declined consistently and nearly halved to 16% by 2009. These trends shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468018113484609">Figure 2</xref> suggest that the MLSA line has been increasingly trailing behind the average living standard in Shanghai.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468018113484609">Figure 3</xref> presents the trends in total MLSA expenditure in the urban area of Shanghai and as a percentage of total Shanghai GDP from 1999 to 2009. It shows that while the absolute value of total MLSA expenditure increased rather steadily during this period, it fluctuated to a great extent as a percentage of total GDP. The total MLSA expenditure was 51 million yuan in 1999. It had a significant jump to 449 million yuan in 2000 and then continued to rise, to 783 million yuan in 2003. After the increase was halted for two years, it regained steam and kept rising to reach 1.2 billion yuan by 2009.</p>

</fig>
<p>The trend of total MLSA expenditure as a percentage of total Shanghai GDP reveals a different picture. After a sharp rise from only 0.01% in 1999 to 0.09% in 2000, the total MLSA expenditure as a percentage of GDP hovered around 0.10% for the following two years. However, after reaching 0.12% in 2003, it has since dropped and remained around 0.08%. Therefore, these trends shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468018113484609">Figure 3</xref> suggest that, despite the steady increase in Shanghai’s total MLSA expenditure, its proportion to the city’s total GDP has remained small. These contrasting trends since 2003 suggest that Shanghai’s total MLSA expenditure has not kept pace with the rapid growth in GDP.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468018113484609">Figure 4</xref> presents the total number of MLSA recipients and as a percentage of Shanghai’s total population from 1999 to 2009. The two trends largely mimicked each other during this period. From 1999 to 2002, the total number of MLSA recipients rose steadily and steeply, from 44,000 to 432,000. This increase then leveled off and transited into a mild decline, reaching 363,000 in 2009. The total number of MLSA recipients as a percentage of total population also rose sharply from only 0.28% in 1999 to the peak of 2.6% in 2003. It then entered a phase of decline, reaching 1.9% in 2009.</p>

<p>How does the Shanghai MLSA policy compare to the national average in urban China? I draw from a recent publication on the national urban MLSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468018113484609">Gao et al., 2011</xref>) to conduct a brief comparison to better understand the Shanghai case. The Shanghai MLSA line has been consistently higher than the national average of urban MLSA lines, with the difference ranging between 130 and 220 yuan. This is expected because of Shanghai’s high economic growth rate as compared to most other cities in China. However, relative to per capita consumption, the Shanghai MLSA line has lost its superior position in recent years. It was 31% of Shanghai per capita consumption in 1999, as compared to the national average of 28%; however, by 2007, it dropped to only 16% and was trumped by the national average of 19%. In addition, Shanghai’s MLSA participation rate (i.e., the total number of MLSA recipients as a percentage of the total population) was lower than the national rate. It was 1.8% in 2007 as compared to the national rate of 3.8%. These comparisons suggest that the performance of Shanghai’s MLSA may not be as stellar as is often claimed for its pioneering status and nominally high assistance lines.</p>

For example, in 2002, over half of all urban MLSA recipients were unemployed (either laid off or nominally on the job roster but not working or receiving any income) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468018113484609">Hong, 2005b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468018113484609">Tang (2004)</xref> conducted a study in five major cities in 2003 and found that 53% of all MLSA recipients were unemployed and 12% were retired, chronically sick, or disabled. Results from a national survey of 10,000 MLSA recipients in 2003 suggested that 34% of these families had disabled members and 65% had chronically sick members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468018113484609">Leung, 2006</xref>). Other demographic characteristics that are linked with higher probability of MLSA participation include low education, being unmarried, larger household size, and residing in a less developed region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468018113484609">Du and Park, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468018113484609">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468018113484609">Gustafsson and Deng, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468018113484609">Ravallion et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Even when families have participated in MLSA, whether they have been able to receive the full amount that they are entitled to remains another question. Using the national China Household Income Project (CHIP) 2002 urban data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468018113484609">Gao et al. (2009)</xref> found that only about half of the eligible families received any MLSA benefits, and the average benefit gap (i.e., the difference between the entitled amount and the actual amount received) was 43 yuan per capita per month, which represented an astonishingly high 75% of the entitled amount.</p>
<p>Despite the increasing research on MLSA participation, little work has been done to explore the determinants of the MLSA benefit amount received by families. Only two existing studies examined the determinants of the MLSA benefit amount, but they both focused on the effect of city-level contextual factors rather than family demographics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468018113484609">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468018113484609">Ravallion et al., 2006</xref>). Specifically, they found that more generous MLSA lines were associated with a higher benefit amount received by participating families. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468018113484609">Gao et al. (2009)</xref> also controlled for family demographics in their regression models but did not elaborate their exact effect patterns. Because the data used in the current study are from one city only, it is impossible to examine the effect of variations in city-level contextual factors. This study instead focuses on the effects of family demographics on the MLSA benefit amount received by families and provides new empirical evidence on this question.</p>

<title>Effects of MLSA on poverty reduction</title>
<p>The existing literature has found that MLSA has shown modest impacts on poverty reduction among the participants, but these effects are limited by the program’s partial coverage and delivery. Further, MLSA has had a larger impact on reducing poverty depth and severity than on poverty rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468018113484609">Du and Park, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468018113484609">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468018113484609">Gustafsson and Deng, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468018113484609">Ravallion et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Using the CHIP 2002 urban data and a poverty line developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468018113484609">Khan (2008)</xref> according to the minimum food intake required to sustain energy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468018113484609">Gustafsson and Deng (2011)</xref> found that MLSA reduced the poverty rate by 16% among its participants. The poverty gap was narrowed by 29% and the poverty severity was lessened by 38%. The impact sizes were larger if a lower poverty line was used. Using National Bureau of Statistics survey data from the 35 largest cities in China, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468018113484609">Ravallion et al. (2006)</xref> discovered that MLSA lowered the poverty rate among participants by 20%, poverty depth by 29%, and poverty severity by 37%. Using data collected from five big cities (Shanghai, Wuhan, Shenyang, Fuzhou, and Xi’an) in 2001 and 2005, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468018113484609">Du and Park (2007)</xref> found that MLSA’s poverty reduction effect had increased over time. The poverty rate was lowered by 3–15% in 2001 and by 2–32% in 2005, depending on the poverty lines used.</p>
<p>What if a relative poverty line is used to take into account the overall income distribution? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468018113484609">Gao et al. (2009)</xref> adopted a relative poverty line defined as 50% of national urban median income to estimate the effects of MLSA on poverty reduction using the CHIP 2002 urban data. As one would expect, this poverty line turned out to be much higher than the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468018113484609">Khan (2008)</xref> line. Gao and colleagues found that MLSA’s impact on poverty reduction was less predominant using the relative poverty line than when the Khan line was used. Specifically, the poverty rate was reduced by only 2%, while the poverty gap and severity were reduced by 14% and 26%, respectively.</p>
<p>The present article contributes to this growing body of literature by focusing on a sample of MLSA’s target population in Shanghai, the pioneer of the MLSA policy and one of China’s richest cities. In particular, I am interested in finding out whether MLSA’s effects on poverty reduction were larger in Shanghai than the national average. By using both absolute and relative poverty lines, I also investigate if MLSA helped recipient families move out of poverty in absolute terms and also relative to the overall income distribution in Shanghai.</p>

<title>Data and methods</title>

<title>Data</title>
<p>This study uses household survey data collected among 500 low-income families in a Shanghai community during November 2009 to January 2010. Focusing on low-income families in the survey allows us to have a sample of MLSA’s target population and thus facilitates in-depth understanding of MLSA recipients. The survey contains detailed questions about family demographics, income, and receipt of MLSA and therefore suits the purpose of this study. The dataset includes 442 MLSA recipient families and 55 low-income families who did not receive MLSA at the time of the interview. Three families did not report their MLSA receipt status.</p>
<p>The study site, community (<italic>jiedao</italic>) Y, is one of the oldest communities in Shanghai’s Pudong District. It had slightly over 4000 MLSA recipients in January 2010, making up about 0.3% of the total population in this community. This participation rate is far below the overall MLSA participation rate of 1.9% in Shanghai in 2009, reflecting the relatively high living standards in this community. The Department of Civil Affairs (DCA) of the community is in charge of its MLSA implementation. The DCA of community Y has expanded its MLSA program in recent years, aiming at full coverage and delivery of MLSA benefits to all eligible families.</p>
<p>The sampling frame of this study was the full list of families receiving MLSA as well as those who resided in public low-rent housing in October 2009 obtained from the DCA of community Y. Sample families were drawn using a stratified systematic sampling method so that all neighborhoods (<italic>juweihui</italic>) in the community are represented. Data collection was carried out by graduate students in the Sociology Department of East China University of Science and Technology under supervision of their professor. In each family, one randomly selected adult member was interviewed. If the randomly selected member was unavailable, then another available adult member was interviewed. In addition to responding to questions about family demographics, income, and receipt of MLSA, the interviewees also answered questions regarding their individual demographic background and employment situation.</p>
<p>The unit of analysis in this study therefore is families. Income is calculated as family per capita income. Main family characteristics, including pre-MLSA income, household size, number of children, and number of older persons, are controlled for in regression analysis. Furthermore, following the standard strategy in the relevant literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468018113484609">Du and Park, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468018113484609">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468018113484609">Gustafsson and Deng, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468018113484609">Ravallion et al., 2006</xref>), I also control for respondents’ individual characteristics to understand their roles in affecting family MLSA participation and benefit amount.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1468018113484609">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>I use logistic regressions to examine how family demographics affect MLSA participation because MLSA participation is a binary variable. I use Tobit regressions to investigate the determinants of MLSA benefit amount received by families because the 55 non-recipient families had a value of zero in the amount received while the 442 recipient families received various levels of MLSA benefits. As a sensitivity test for the Tobit regression results, I also run OLS regressions on MLSA benefit amount among MLSA recipient families only.</p>
<p>As MLSA is a means-tested program, families’ pre-MLSA income is the predominant determinant of MLSA participation and the MLSA benefit amount that they may receive. However, it is also highly endogenous to both dependent variables. To account for this consideration, I run regressions with and without pre-MLSA household per capita income (measured in hundreds) to see if the result patterns hold across these models. Family demographics are controlled for in all regressions. These include respondent age (18–35, 36–45, 46–55, and 56 or older), education (primary school or less, junior high school, and senior high school or higher), marital status (married or not), Communist Party membership (member or not), employment status (unemployed, retired, with part-time or temporary job, full-time job, and never worked or other), self-rated health condition (good or very good, so-so, and poor or very poor), whether respondent had any serious diseases in 2008–2009, and the presence of child under 18 years old and older members aged 60 or above, respectively.</p>
<p>I adopt four poverty lines to estimate MLSA’s effects on poverty reduction among the recipient families. The first two are absolute poverty lines: (1) the official national poverty line of 1196 yuan per capita per year set by the National Bureau of Statistics; and (2) the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468018113484609">Khan (2008)</xref> line estimated based on the minimum food energy requirement and set at 2982 yuan per capita per year in 2009 (adjusted for consumer price index). Even though these two absolute poverty lines are widely used, they are set in the national context and thus probably too low for Shanghai given that Shanghai is one of the most developed cities in China. To address this concern, I adopt two relative poverty lines: (3) the most widely used relative poverty line set at 50% of median income in Shanghai in 2009 and estimated to be 12,359 yuan per capita per year; and (4) because of the very high level of the previous line, especially when compared with the two absolute poverty lines specified above, another relative poverty line set at 25% of median income in Shanghai in 2009 and estimated to be 6179 yuan per capita per year. Both of these relative poverty lines reflect the living standard and income distribution of Shanghai and are much higher than the two absolute poverty lines.</p>
<p>For each poverty line, I calculate the poverty rate (or head count ratio), poverty gap index (i.e., the mean income shortfall relative to the poverty line as a proportion of the line), and poverty severity ratio (measured by the squared poverty gap index so that individual poverty gaps are weighted by the gaps themselves). The poverty gap index measures poverty depth. The poverty severity ratio emphasizes income distribution among the poor – the more uneven the distribution, the more severe the overall poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468018113484609">Foster et al., 1984</xref>).</p>

<title>Characteristics of MLSA recipients</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468018113484609">Table 1</xref> presents the demographic characteristics of families receiving MLSA. A family is defined as an MLSA recipient if any member of the family received MLSA income at the time of interview. As mentioned earlier, 442 families in the sample are identified as MLSA recipients. A non-recipient family therefore is one with no members receiving MLSA. Fifty-five families in this low-income sample are non-MLSA recipient families. Their demographic characteristics are also presented for comparison purposes. Three families did not report their MLSA receipt status and thus have missing values on this key variable. <italic>T</italic>-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables are conducted to detect statistically significant differences across the MLSA recipient and non-recipient groups.</p>

<p>Among the MLSA recipient families, the mean age of the respondents was 49 years, with nearly 52% belonging to the 46–55 age group. Around 18% were aged 56 or older or between 36 and 45, respectively. Only 11% respondents were 35 or younger. Even though not explicitly stated, in survey interviews such as this one, the respondents tend to be the household heads if they are available for the interview. Therefore, this result suggests that most of the household heads of the MLSA recipient families were middle-aged or older. With regard to education, the respondents of MLSA recipient families averaged 9.67 years of schooling, with 45% completing junior high school and 42% having completed senior high school education or above. About 13% had only primary school education or less.</p>
<p>A rather high proportion – nearly one-third – of respondents from MLSA recipient families were unmarried (i.e., divorced, widowed, or never married), which is an important contributor to the economic vulnerability of these families and in turn their eligibility for MLSA benefits. Only 2.7% of respondents from MLSA recipient families were Chinese Communist Party (CCP) members. With regard to health condition, about one-third of respondents from MLSA recipient families reported their health as poor or very poor, and 42% considered their health as so-so. About a quarter reported their health as good or very good. About 18% reported having serious disease during 2008–2009.</p>
<p>Employment status can be a close proxy for MLSA eligibility. As expected, a high proportion – 53% – of the respondents from MLSA recipient families were unemployed, with no income source and thus qualifying for MLSA benefits. Additionally, 15% respondents were retired and 11% held part-time or temporary jobs. Only 10% were full-time employed, and 12% had never worked or reported another, non-specified employment status. As for household characteristics, MLSA recipient families on average had 433.98 yuan of pre-MLSA income per capita per month, with an average household size of 3.34. Half of the MLSA recipient families had children younger than 18 while 38% had members older than 60 living in the household.</p>
<p>Given that the non-MLSA recipient families in the sample also had low income and qualified for public low-rent housing, the demographic characteristics of the recipient and non-recipient families were mostly similar. However, there were a few notable differences. First, the respondents in non-recipient families were much less likely to be unmarried (18%) than those in the recipient families (31%). Second, the respondents in non-recipient families were less likely to be unemployed (40% as compared to 53%) and more likely to be retired (33% as compared to 15%) than those in the recipient families. Third, as expected, non-MLSA recipient families had a much higher pre-MLSA household per capita income (687.26 yuan per month) than the recipient families (433.98 yuan per month). Lastly, significantly fewer non-recipient families had children in the household (18%) than recipient families (50%). All of these statistically significant differences point to the disadvantage experienced by MLSA recipient families relative to their somewhat better-off non-recipient counterparts.</p>

<p>Model 1 of the logistic regression results shows that pre-MLSA household per capita income was significantly associated with family’s MLSA participation. Specifically, as pre-MLSA household per capita income increased by 100 yuan per month, the odds of MLSA participation decreased by 19%. The logistic regression results also suggest that having junior high school or more education and being retired instead of unemployed were associated with lower odds of MLSA participation, while being unmarried and the presence of child(ren) in the household were associated with higher odds of MLSA participation. Specifically, relative to those with primary school or less education, having a junior high school education lowered the odds of receiving MLSA by 83–86% (Model 1 and Model 2, respectively) and having a senior high school education or more lowered the odds of receiving MLSA by 83% (Model 2 only). Being retired reduced the odds of receiving MLSA by 63–80% as compared to those who were unemployed, most likely because pensions and/other old-age benefits associated with retirement could boost a family’s income.</p>
<p>Being unmarried and having child(ren) in the household proved to be significant predictors of MLSA participation as both are strongly linked with a lack of financial resources and high supporting burden. Specifically, the odds of receiving MLSA for unmarried respondents were 3.43–3.92 times that of their married counterparts. The odds of receiving MLSA for those with child(ren) were 4.91–5.28 times that of those without child(ren). These results are consistent with the literature and suggest that families with unmarried adult members and those with child(ren) may experience extra disadvantages and thus need additional support.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468018113484609">Table 2</xref>, the Tobit regression results on the determinants of MLSA receipt amounts are largely consistent with the logistic regression results on the determinants of MLSA participation. Overall, higher pre-MLSA household per capita income, higher education levels, being retired or employed, and having older persons (60 or older) in the household were associated with lower MLSA benefit amounts, while being unmarried, having a larger household size, and having child(ren) were associated with higher MLSA benefit amounts.</p>
<p>Specifically, a 100-yuan increase in pre-MLSA household per capita income was associated with a 12-yuan decrease in household per capita MLSA benefit received per month. Having a junior high school education reduced MLSA benefit amount by 47–48 yuan per capita per month, while having a senior high school education or more reduced MLSA benefit amount by 57–69 yuan per capita per month. As compared to being unemployed, being retired, having a part-time or temporary job, and being full-time employed lowered the MLSA benefit amount by 67, 36, and 37 yuan per capita per month, respectively (Model 2 only). In addition, having older persons in the household was associated with a reduction of 20 yuan per capita per month in MLSA benefits. On the other hand, being unmarried raised the MLSA benefit amount by 41 yuan per capita per month. A one-member increase in household size was associated with a 30–31 yuan increase in MLSA benefit per capita per month, while having child(ren) was associated with a 25–34 yuan increase in MLSA benefit per capita per month.</p>
<p>The one somewhat unexpected finding was that respondents who were 56 or older tended to report higher MLSA benefit amounts (by 40–53 yuan per capita per month) as compared to those who were 18–35 years old. This is probably because of the disproportionately low education level of those aged 56 or older, which in turn is linked to higher MLSA benefits. Indeed, 27% of those aged 56 or older reported having a primary school or lower education, while the proportion with such low education was between 7 and 13% for other age groups. However, with the model already controlling for education level, this explanation might be spurious and this result therefore needs to be interpreted with caution.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, I have also run OLS regressions on MLSA benefit amounts among MLSA recipient families only to test the robustness of the Tobit regression models. These results, shown in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1468018113484609">Appendix</xref> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1468018113484609">Table A1</xref>, are very similar to the Tobit regression results.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468018113484609">Figure 5</xref> and the top panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468018113484609">Table 3</xref> show the results using the two absolute poverty lines. Using the very low official national poverty line of 1196 yuan per capita per year set by the National Bureau of Statistics, MLSA lowered participants’ poverty rate from 0.14 to 0.03, a reduction of 79%. Consistent with the evidence in the existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468018113484609">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468018113484609">Gustafsson and Deng, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468018113484609">Ravallion et al., 2006</xref>), MLSA’s poverty reduction effects were more prominent on the poverty gap and poverty severity than on the poverty rate. Specifically, the poverty gap was narrowed by 90% (from 0.08 to 0.01) and poverty severity by 94% (from 0.07 to 0.00).</p>
<p>The second absolute poverty line, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468018113484609">Khan (2008)</xref> line estimated based on the minimum food energy requirement and set at 2982 yuan per capita per year in 2009, is nearly 2.5 times that of the first line. Using this poverty line, the poverty rate was reduced by 47% (from 0.30 to 0.16), poverty gap by 64% (from 0.16 to 0.06), and poverty severity by 78% (from 0.12 to 0.03). Compared to the results above using the first absolute poverty line, these results testify that MLSA’s poverty reduction impacts were smaller when a higher poverty line is used. However, MLSA was unable to completely eliminate poverty using either of the two absolute poverty lines.</p>
<p>How does this result in Shanghai compare to MLSA’s poverty reduction effects in the national context? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468018113484609">Gustafsson and Deng (2011)</xref> used the CHIP 2002 urban data and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468018113484609">Khan (2008)</xref> poverty line estimated for 2002 and found that MLSA lowered the poverty rate, gap, and severity by 16%, 29%, and 38%, respectively. Therefore, using the Khan poverty line and data collected in 2009–2010, MLSA’s anti-poverty impacts were clearly larger in Shanghai than discovered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468018113484609">Gustafsson and Deng (2011)</xref> in the national context in 2002. This could be partly due to the different time periods of these two studies, and partly due to the different living standards in Shanghai and in urban China as a whole.</p>
<p>How would MLSA’s poverty reduction effects change when the relative poverty lines that take into account the overall income distribution are used? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468018113484609">Figure 6</xref> and the bottom panel of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468018113484609">Table 3</xref> present these results. When the most widely used relative poverty line (set at 50% of median income in Shanghai in 2009 and estimated to be 12,359 yuan per capita per year) is used, the poverty rate, gap, and severity were all drastically higher than when the much lower absolute poverty lines are used. Pre-MLSA poverty rate was strikingly high at 0.97 while the pre-MLSA poverty gap and severity were estimated to be 0.59 and 0.42, respectively. The poverty-reduction effects of MLSA, however, were much smaller than when the lower poverty lines were used. MLSA lowered the poverty rate to 0.95, a reduction of only 2%. The poverty gap and severity indices were lowered to 0.51 and 0.32, a reduction of 12% and 23%, respectively. Note that these smaller effect sizes are driven by the much higher value of this poverty line in comparison to the absolute poverty lines used earlier, but not the relative nature of this poverty line per se.</p>
<p>Using the other relative poverty line set at 25% of median income in Shanghai in 2009 and estimated to be 6179 yuan per capita per year, the poverty-reduction effects of MLSA fell somewhat between those using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468018113484609">Khan (2008)</xref> line and the first relative poverty line. This is precisely because the value of this poverty line stands about in the middle of those two lines. Specifically, the poverty rate was reduced by 7% (from 0.65 to 0.60), poverty gap by 34% (from 0.32 to 0.21), and poverty severity by 50% (from 0.22 to 0.11). As evident from these results using the relative poverty lines, MLSA was far from sufficient in lifting the relative positions of the recipient families in the context of the overall income distribution in Shanghai.</p>

<title>Conclusion and discussion</title>
<p>Using household survey data collected during November 2009 to January 2010 among 500 low-income families in Shanghai, this study provides updated evidence on the poverty reduction effects of the Minimum Living Standard Assurance (MLSA), urban China’s primary public assistance program. I find that higher education levels and being retired instead of unemployed were associated with lower odds of MLSA participation and lower benefit amounts, while being unmarried and the presence of child(ren) in the household were associated with higher odds of MLSA participation and higher benefit amounts.</p>
<p>Consistent with existing evidence, MLSA’s poverty reduction effects were most prominent when a low poverty line was used, and the effect size became smaller as the level of the poverty line rose. When using the two absolute poverty lines that were set in the national context and likely too low for Shanghai, MLSA lowered the poverty rate, gap, and severity to significant extents yet did not eliminate poverty. When using the two much higher relative poverty lines, it is evident that MLSA was far from sufficient in lifting the relative positions of the recipient families in the context of the overall income distribution in Shanghai.</p>
<p>These findings based on the Shanghai case are mostly consistent with those using national data to examine MLSA’s anti-poverty effectiveness. How does the Chinese case compare to the rest of the developing world? In their extensive review of public assistance programs in developing countries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468018113484609">Grosh et al. (2008)</xref> revealed similar trends. Characterized by targeting and low benefit levels, these programs often are unable to reach all eligible participants, but instead provide subsidies to some who are in somewhat better economic conditions but still qualify for the public assistance according to the eligibility rules. This fact highlights the challenges in implementing such strictly means-testing programs and partially explains the underachievement of these programs’ anti-poverty effects. The limited financial resources in developing countries also constrain the effectiveness of these public assistance programs in reducing poverty.</p>
<p>Several policy implications can be drawn from these results. First, several risk factors, including low education, unemployment, being unmarried, and having child(ren), have been revealed to be strongly linked to MLSA participation and higher benefit amounts. Families with these characteristics may face extra disadvantages compared to other poor families and thus require additional assistance other than MLSA. During the past several years, the local Department of Civil Affairs (DCA) in the study community has been offering job training programs to MLSA recipients to help them gain skills and find jobs. It is worthwhile to examine the effectiveness of these programs in future studies and possibly strengthen them to improve the employability of the MLSA recipients. Additionally, more attention should be paid to single-parent families, a rapidly growing group in Chinese cities. Policy makers should make efforts to understand their unique needs and modify existing programs and/or develop new ones to address their needs.</p>
<p>Second, as the pioneer of MLSA and usually with the highest MLSA line among all cities, Shanghai has always been hailed for its MLSA policy. This study provides a unique opportunity to examine its performance empirically. As revealed by the analyses, even though Shanghai’s MLSA line was constantly adjusted, it has trailed behind the average living standard in Shanghai as measured by city per capita income and consumption levels. The total expenditure in MLSA as a proportion of the city’s total GDP has remained small, not keeping pace with the rapid growth in GDP. Furthermore, MLSA was unable to eliminate poverty when the two rather low absolute poverty lines were used and was far from sufficient in raising the relative positions of the recipient families when the overall income distribution in Shanghai was taken into account. These results suggest that there is much room for improvement in the performance of Shanghai’s MLSA. The city government as well as the local DCA of the study community is keen to achieve better outcomes for MLSA. These results can provide helpful suggestions regarding areas that need improvement.</p>
<p>This study bears a few important limitations that need to be kept in mind when interpreting the results and drawing policy implications. First and most important, data used in this study were collected in one community in Shanghai that is not representative of the entire city. Therefore, results from this study are only suggestive of MLSA’s performance in the city as a whole and in other communities in Shanghai. Similarly, policy implications drawn from this study should be taken with caution and applied only with serious consideration of the context of the city as a whole and of other communities.</p>
<p>Because the study sample is drawn from a relatively well-off community in Shanghai, I suspect that the results based on a broader sample from various districts and communities of Shanghai would be less rosy and the effect sizes would be smaller than the ones identified in this study. The willingness of the DCA of community Y to participate in this research study and their eagerness to ensure full coverage and delivery of MLSA benefits to all eligible families may have led to somewhat better outcomes in this community as compared to some other communities in Shanghai. These speculations, however, need to be validated using more diverse data sources in future work.</p>
<p>Second, also because the data were collected in one community, there is a lack of variation in the location and other characteristics of the sample, limiting the use of more sophisticated statistical methods. Nonetheless, the use of a sample of MLSA’s target population in this study allows us to closely examine its poverty reduction effects and offer direct policy implications concerning this population. Future research can address these limitations by conducting a larger scale survey that includes more diverse locales and multiple dimensions of demographic background characteristics.</p>
