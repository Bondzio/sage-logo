<p>Clinical Associate Professor Jonathan Rampono passed away on 10 April 2013, and as a result the Australian medical community has lost a committed, highly respected and caring psychiatrist, who has made a substantial contribution both in Western Australia, nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>Jon was born in South Africa, and during his medical training there won a prize in every year of study in the course. He came to Perth in 1976 and initially worked in general practice before entering training in psychiatry. He went on to run a thriving private practice for a number of years and then joined the medical staff of King Edward Memorial Hospital (KEMH) in 1995.</p>
<p>Jon was Chair of the Women’s Health Clinical Care Unit at KEMH and was also Head of the Department of Psychological Medicine. In these roles he was a strong advocate for perinatal mental health services for women in Western Australia. He was the driving force for the establishment of the Mother and Baby Unit at KEMH which opened in 2008 and was the first of its kind in Australia. This unit is located on the hospital grounds and was established as a dedicated inpatient unit where he oversaw high-quality specialist treatments for mothers with major psychiatric illnesses. Jon saw perinatal mental health as a family matter and was keen to involve spouses and other family members as much as possible, including the option for spouses to sleep at the unit and be involved in their own support groups. As a result of the demonstrated success of the Mother and Baby Unit at KEMH, another similar unit has been included in the nearly completed Fiona Stanley Hospital south of Perth. This also would not have happened without Jon’s advocacy.</p>
<p>In 2005 Jon joined the Beyond Blue National Perinatal Depression Initiative and played a key role in bringing perinatal depression into the public arena. A quote of his in <italic>Brief</italic> magazine in 2011 is a succinct summary of his vision: “we cannot over-emphasise just how important this business of being a mother is to a baby’s wellbeing”.</p>
<p>Jon has also been recognised internationally, published many significant articles and been involved in major research, including measures of transplacental passage of antidepressant medications and possible effects on the baby and the passage of antidepressants into breast milk. He was also elected as the President of the Australasian Branch of the Marce Society, which is a multidisciplinary forum for expanding knowledge about the mental health care for women in the perinatal period, and he hosted the 2011 conference in Fremantle in his role as President. Jon was awarded a Member of the Order of Australia in 2012 for his outstanding services to medicine and in perinatal psychiatry.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Rampono was a friend, colleague and mentor to many, and greatly respected by all who knew him, whether professionally or as friends and patients. He will remain a great inspiration for all who continue in his path, and have benefitted so much from knowing him. His mantra was always “What is best for the patient?”</p>
<p>Our deepest sympathy is extended to his family, friends and colleagues.</p>
