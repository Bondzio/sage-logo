<abstract>
<p>Does civil–military conflict harm military effectiveness? Most previous empirical literature on the effects of civil–military conflict has utilized dichotomous indicators of the presence or absence of overall civilian control. However, the extant theoretical literature is clear that mid-levels of civil–military conflict could be good for innovation and overall decision making. In line with these arguments, the author argues that we should not expect all civil–military conflict to harm military effectiveness and, by extension, international crisis bargaining outcome. Instead, some civil–military conflict should have a positive effect on the overall success of the military. Utilizing new events data that captures the level of civil–military conflict cross nationally from 1990 to 2004, the author examines how civil–military conflict actually has an inverse <italic>U</italic>-shaped relationship with crisis success. This project also adds to the theoretical literature by examining variations across different degrees of civil–military conflicts, drawing attention to the usefulness of mid-range civil–military “friction.”</p>

<p>In early spring of 1999, Pakistani forces crossed into the Indian-controlled Kargil district of Kashmir, escalating ongoing territorial and security tensions between the states. By the end of the summer, with an estimated 4,000 troops killed, the last of a defeated Pakistani military was forced to cross back into Pakistan. In later reports, the Prime Minister of Pakistan at the time, Nawaz Sharif, claimed that the “ill-conceived, ill-planned, and ill-executed misadventure” was completely orchestrated by chief of the army General Pervez Musharraf.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0095327X11430610">1</xref></sup> Not only did Musharraf use military forces internationally without a civilian mandate, by the end of 1999, Musharraf had ousted Sharif in a bloodless coup.</p>
<p>Less than three years earlier in Greece, Prime Minister Kostas Simitis was involved in a crisis with Turkey over the small island of Imia/Kardak in the Aegean Sea. This time, unlike Sharif, Simitis had the military completely under his control. In fact, during this time, many were lamenting that the Greek military had become too complacent with key civilians and political parties in order to garner cushy postservice appointments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0095327X11430610">2</xref></sup> Despite the complete “civilianization” of the Greek military, the crisis with Turkey was resolved only after Greece took down its flag on Imia/Kardak.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0095327X11430610">3</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>What explains the crisis defeats in these situations? Did civil–military relations play a part in the crisis outcomes here? For Pakistan, the typical answer is a resounding yes. The military ineffectiveness of Pakistan during the Kargil conflict, together with the coup later that year, are events long thought to be linked to issues of bad or unhealthy civil–military relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0095327X11430610">4</xref></sup> Without civilian control of the military, military forces cannot be used advantageously by civilian leadership, leading to fewer victories in international crises.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0095327X11430610">5</xref></sup> Additionally, without civilian control, civilians run the risk of being overrun by the very forces designed to protect them. In short, too much civil–military conflict leads to military ineffectiveness, as well as a host of domestic problems, including increased risk of military coup.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, however, is another, albeit more often overlooked, form of unhealthy civil–military relations that could also impede military effectiveness and, by extension, the likelihood of crisis victory: the problem of overdeference. This appears to have been occurring in Greece during the Imia/Kardak crisis. Unlike the problem of too little civilian control, the problem here is a military too micromanaged or controlled to such an extent as to not provide critical advice to civilian leaders when it is needed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0095327X11430610">6</xref></sup> When this occurs, the civilian leadership lacks the expertise of the military in making calculated crisis bargaining decisions. Much like Goldilocks's problem, as this line of reasoning goes, civil–military conflict can neither be “too hot” or “too cold.”</p>
<p>In this article, the author first develops the theoretical underpinnings of this argument and then empirically tests the somewhat controversial “Goldilocks” hypothesis using newly created data that captures quantitatively the extent and degree of conflict between the armed forces and executive leaders for all countries involved in an international crisis from 1990 to 2004. Using this new data, the author finds much support for the idea that not all civil–military conflict is problematic for military effectiveness. Intermediate levels of civil–military conflict, hereafter referred to as civil–military “friction,” can heighten the probability of victory in crisis bargaining situations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0095327X11430610">7</xref></sup>

<title>Theoretical Background and Argument</title>
<sec id="section2-0095327X11430610">
<title>Review of the Literature</title>
<p>Current understanding of civil–military relations owes much to the early work of Huntington and Janowitz.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0095327X11430610">8</xref></sup> Building off of the classical work of Clausewitz, Huntington’s <italic>The Soldier and the St</italic>ate stressed the importance of a form of interaction where civilian political leaders have ultimate control on large political issues but where the military retains autonomy within its own sphere. The key to a highly functioning military, according to Huntington, is professionalism of the armed forces. When the armed forces are allowed and encouraged to adopt an alternative military culture, distinct from civilian authorities, this aids in their functioning as a group and separates military officers from the political process, lessening the threat of military coups or insubordination. Huntington refers to this type of civilian control as “objective” in nature and contrasts it with “subjective” civilian control, which occurs when civilians politicize and control all aspects of military decision making.</p>
<p>Janowitz disagrees. In <italic>The Professional Soldier</italic>, Janowitz stresses the need for the military to reflect the civilian society writ large; civil–military relations more closely follows an interest group model where the military competes with other groups for funds and attention. Compared to Huntington, Janowitz, however, prescribes a far reaching form of civilian control at different levels within the organization.</p>
<p>Since these works, many have continued to utilize Huntington’s or Janowitz’s frameworks of civil–military relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0095327X11430610">9</xref></sup> Feaver largely departs from this literature in arguing that civil–military relations follow a classic principal-agent framework, with the civilian leadership serving as the principals and the military officers serving as agents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0095327X11430610">10</xref></sup> Accordingly, Feaver argues that the military has the tendency to “shirk” from its delegated duties and a system of monitoring behavior by the agents is necessary to punish the military when civilian instructions are not followed.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Feaver’s work is consistent with the canonical Huntington and Janowitz in identifying the “problematique” of civil–military relations being ultimately about making a strong and armed military still under civilian control.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0095327X11430610">11</xref></sup> This problematique represents a fundamental tension, Feaver contends, between having “protection by the military and the need to have protection from the military.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0095327X11430610">12</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Although most scholars recognize this basic tension, the predominant focus has continued to center on the determinants and effects of civilian control. On one hand, this makes sense, especially for the time period immediately after Huntington and Janowitz’s work first appeared. Military coup attempts in the 1960s were at an all time high, impeding democratic transitions in much of Latin America, for example.</p>
<p>On the other hand, however, this primary focus on civilian control seems to have limited discussions concerning the other half of Feaver’s “problematique”: making a strong and capable military that is able to aid the civilian leadership in times of crisis. In other words, like Avant, Gibson and Snider, Bruneau and Matei, Schiff, and Herspring all contend, there has been an overemphasis on civilian control as the key determinant of “healthy” civil–military relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0095327X11430610">13</xref></sup> As such, any civil–military conflict has often been summarily dismissed as problematic.</p>
<p>All civil–military conflict is not necessarily “zero-sum.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0095327X11430610">14</xref></sup> Avant makes this point as well when arguing against seeing all civil–military tension as a problem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0095327X11430610">15</xref></sup> Even Desch’s work on civilian control echoes this contention: “some conflict is inevitable and perhaps even desirable in a pluralistic political system.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0095327X11430610">16</xref></sup> This appears to be largely consistent with Huntington's classic argument against subjective control of the military. Although the military must be professional and under the ultimate control of civilian authorities, the military cannot be comprised of political yes-men to the civilian leadership. The military must still be able to advise their civilian leaders with military and strategic information that runs counter to the civilian leadership’s predisposed preferences. This can bring friction without causing a loss of civilian control.</p>
<p>This contention of the utility of conflict in interorganizational dealings is also reflected in the larger literature on conflict in public administration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0095327X11430610">17</xref></sup> According to Pondy, in disturbing the organizational equilibrium, low levels of conflict can positively affect “productivity, stability, and adaptability.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0095327X11430610">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Further, although the presence or absence of civilian control may be useful in accounting for the likelihood of military coups in dictatorships, for example, ultimate civilian control is well established in most regimes in the post-Cold War period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0095327X11430610">19</xref></sup> Coup attempts are down 63 percent since the mid-1960s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0095327X11430610">20</xref></sup> Although military coups still occur, the predominant focus on a dichotomous indicator of civilian control could limit a more nuanced understanding of the causes and effects of a broader spectrum of civil–military cooperation and conflict in the post-Cold War environment.</p>
<p>By moving beyond a focus on just the presence or absence of civilian control, the literature concerning the effect of civil–military relations on military effectiveness in international crises could also benefit. Brooks defines military effectiveness as the “capacity to create military power from a state’s basic resources.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0095327X11430610">21</xref></sup> As such, military effectiveness is important for achieving a state’s preferred outcome in an international crisis. Whether from the threat of force or actual force usage, an effective military will provide civilian leaders with bargaining leverage and information in times of international crises.</p>
<p>Below, the author uses a more nuanced conceptualization of the degree of civil–military conflict to expand on the causal pathways through which a middle range of civil–military friction can help crisis bargaining interactions. Throughout this theory, the author is arguing that civil–military conflict cannot be simply viewed as a dichtomous (yes/no) variable but should instead be viewed as events along of continuum. At very low levels, subjective control is likely. At very high levels, coup risk and overall lack of civilian control is also likely. Between these two extremes, however, the author argues that there exists a middle range of civil–military “friction” which can increase the probability of military effectiveness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0095327X11430610">
<title>Theoretical Argument</title>
<p>The author argues that middle ranges of civil–military friction benefit military effectiveness and, by extension, crisis bargaining outcomes in three ways: (1) military fighting, (2) information to civilian leadership on capabilities, and (3) information to adversaries on credibility of the threat of force.</p>
<p>Before outlining these causal mechanisms, however, it is worth noting that the author remains consistent with the larger literature in arguing that ultimate civilian control is necessary for military effectiveness. As such, high levels of civil–military conflict indicate a loss of civilian control that impede military effectiveness in much the same way that civil–military relations in Pakistan impeded crisis-bargaining with India during the Kargil conflict. Past a certain level, therefore, civil–military friction should quickly change into civil–military insubordination and represent a lack of civilian control.</p>
<sec id="section4-0095327X11430610">
<title>Military fighting</title>
<p>First, civil–military friction is needed to ensure that the military has leeway over their domain of war fighting. Without friction, it is too easy for bureaucratic mission creep to result in a situation of subjective control and, thus, civilians making decisions outside of their realm of expertise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0095327X11430610">22</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Subjective control of military forces by Russian president Boris Yeltsin is one explanation, for example, for that military’s ineffectiveness in the First Chechnya conflict in 1994 and 1995. During this time, both Desch and Herspring contend the Yeltsin had the military under “subjective control mechanisms.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0095327X11430610">23</xref></sup> According to Herspring, Yeltsin had overstepped his bounds in the war planning, instigating maneuvers that the army did not have the training or equipment to carry out successfully. Perhaps, increased friction from the military to civilians would have improved the war planning that occurred in the lead up to the conflict. However, Yeltsin had effectively silenced all critiques from officers during this time period, even starting criminal proceedings against discontents.</p>
<p>In the new quantitative data, the author used in this article, the same dynamics in Russian civil–military relations is observed during this time period. There is a dramatic decrease in the overall conflictual intensity of civil–military friction in the time period immediately prior to the First Chechnya conflict. In fact, there are twelve times as many cooperative events between military officers and civilians as there are conflictual (friction) events in 1993. This could indicate that any civil–military friction was not allowed by civilian leaders, leading to mission creep that harmed war fighting by limiting the input and expertise of military officers on the conduct of the war.</p>
<p>In addition, civil–military friction can serve as an indicator of military initiative. Initiative is a process of fighting efficiently and utilizing military expertise to insure that the fighting plans provide a strategic advantage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0095327X11430610">24</xref></sup> Having a military that is able to update battle plans and take initiative on the field has long been thought of as essential in military effectiveness and victory. According to the democratic peace literature, soldiers in democratic countries are more likely to take initiative on the battlefield, forcing their opponents to follow their battle plan and, in the long run, contributing to successful bargaining outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0095327X11430610">25</xref></sup> Though democracies typically have soldiers with more initiative, the larger literature views military initiative as a crucial component for military effectiveness across regime types. As such, indicators of military initiative should make victory more for any state in crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0095327X11430610">26</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>There is no reason to expect that initiative by soldiers on the battlefield would not be observed off the battlefield as well. It seems likely that military initiative could result in disagreements with civilian leaders as to battlefield and training decisions. In other words, in taking the initiative, officers are going to have to present ideas to civilian leaders which could run counter to the civilian’s preexisting desires and plans. When they are able to do that, overall military effectiveness will be improved. As such, in addition to the large advantage that democracies have in crisis bargaining, it follows that civil–military friction, as an indicator of military initiative, will contribute to military effectiveness and crisis bargaining success.</p>
<p>This idea of mid-level civil–military conflict differs from Feaver.<sup>27 </sup>Instead of “shirking” when voicing opinions in an insolent manner, the military may be providing advice in a way that will lead to an outcome preferred by all parties. As such, some civil–military conflict may lead to innovation, as it did in the case of Russian military use of fuel oil explosives in 1999 in Dagestan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0095327X11430610">28</xref></sup> The military had continually pressed for the use of these explosives from Yeltsin; if they had not “shirked” and just fought the war as they had had been requested to do, the military would not have been as effective on the ground. Later, Putin recognized the validity of their request and gave them permission to use the explosives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0095327X11430610">29</xref></sup> Feaver’s conceptualization of “shirking” does not appear to allow for any achievement of the principal’s goals; it is mainly viewed as a negative for overall military operations. Instead, as presented here, some push-back from the agents, military officers, to their principals, the civilian leadership, can be indicative of military initiative and, as such, contribute to overall crisis success.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0095327X11430610">
<title>Information to civilian leadership</title>
<p>Within the crisis bargaining model, information is a necessary component for successful bargaining short of war and a key component to outcome success once war has begun.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0095327X11430610">30</xref></sup> The military, as the key guardians and experts of the force structure, maintains a more updated view of military capabilities than the civilian leadership. By providing this information to civilian leaders, the civilian leadership is better able to bargain successfully short of war and will be more choosy in the crises it is in, all leading to a better likelihood of crisis bargaining victory.</p>
<p>In providing this information to the civilian leadership, however, friction is likely. The civilian leadership may have preexisting beliefs about the strength of a certain strategy or force structure. They can even have certain preexisting beliefs about how issues can be solved without involving military force, as Clinton did prior to the Haiti invasion of 1994.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0095327X11430610">31</xref></sup> When the military provides advice to the contrary of a civilian leadership’s preexisting beliefs, it is likely that that this will be a somewhat conflictual event. However, it is also likely that the overall result will be much improved.</p>
<p>For example, Brooks's account of the differences between Egypt’s abysmal performance in the 1967 Arab–Israeli war and the 1973 Arab–Israeli war is highly dependent on the increased information Sadat had in 1973 from his military leaders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0095327X11430610">32</xref></sup> As Brooks points out, “Sada had unfettered access to multiple sources of information.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0095327X11430610">33</xref></sup> This information from military officers, however, was definitely not free of conflict. The military frequently had somewhat serious friction with Sadat in the prewar planning phase of 1972. This was especially true when military officers had to provide Sadat with information he did not expect or like.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0095327X11430610">34</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Despite this friction, information from the military as to capabilities is necessary for civilian leaders to recognize their bargaining situation short of war or to bargain successfully during a conflict situation. As such, when the military is able to provide this information, victory in a crisis is more likely. When subjective control mechanisms do not allow this information to be conveyed to the leadership or when the military is too “civilianized” to want to provide conflictual information to the leadership, it is more likely that the civilian leadership will be disadvantaged in crisis bargaining situations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0095327X11430610">
<title>Information to adversaries</title>
<p>Finally, civil–military friction can serve as a signal to adversaries that the military is mobilizing or, at the very least, discussing battle plans. Quite basically, it can provide necessary information concerning the use of objective civilian control within the state. This information is necessary to reinforce the credibility of a threat of force during crisis bargaining.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0095327X11430610">35</xref></sup> When bargaining, there are incentives for states to “bluff,” indicating that they have more resolve or better capabilities than they actually do. Therefore, states seek ways to provide information to signal their resolve and capabilities in order to show the credibility of their threat, improving their bargaining outcome. Consistent with the crisis bargaining model, this information can lead to capitulation by the other side as it updates its beliefs concerning likely outcomes of conflict and reevaluates possible bargains on the table.<sup>36</sup>
</p>
<p>Lai argues that public military mobilization reveals information to an adversary that can stop a conflict short of war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0095327X11430610">37</xref></sup> Similarly, Slantchev argues that military mobilization is a very effective way for leaders to both sink costs and tie hands concerning both their resolve and their capabilities, leading to a more likely favorable war or negotiated settlement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0095327X11430610">38</xref></sup> Much like Slantchev’s discussion of how military moves reveal information, mid-range civil–military conflict could provide information of both impending mobilization and capabilities. Without any civil–military friction, an adversary has limited information about the credibility of a threat before actual mobilization occurs. With too much civil–military conflict, however, the adversary can expect the mobilized military to be less effective and can question the legitimacy or carry-through of any threat of force. Therefore, evidence of this mid-range civil–military friction could be used by a crisis adversary as a signal that the state is actually preparing to carry out its threat in a very militarily advantageous way. As such, once civil–military friction is observed in a bargaining partner, a state could be more likely to take a lesser negotiated settlement.</p>
<p>An example of this could have occurred in the United States prior to the deployment of ground troops in Bosnia in 1995. Immediately prior, military officials were taking up lots of newsprint lamenting against the use of “pin-prick” bombing techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0095327X11430610">39</xref></sup> Though the military was not overtly supportive of any intervention in Bosnia, their critique to the use of the pin-prick bombs in conflict, which Feaver (2003) does say was “not wrong,” would be the type of strong signal sent to an adversary that could provide information about the credibility of the threat of military mobilization. In fact, the Dayton Accords were signed shortly after the summer the United States military mobilized for ground combat.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0095327X11430610">40</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>This causal pathway, though perhaps very important, does rely on the assumption that any civil–military friction is observable to the adversary. To the extent that this information is widely provided in newspaper reports, like measured here, this assumption appears to hold water. If the civil–military friction, however, occurs in private, it would follow that this mechanism would not provide information to the adversary. This is similar to the dynamic Lai outlines with respect to private military mobilizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0095327X11430610">41</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In short, there appears to be many causal pathways through which mid-range civil–military friction could positively impact military effectiveness and, by extension, crisis bargaining outcomes. Friction, otherwise thought of as the presence of civil–military conflict that is not too intense, aids in military fighting and may provide necessary information to civilian leaders and bargaining adversaries. Without any friction, the military is likely too micromanaged or controlled to be effective. Too much friction, however, and there is the real risk of a lack of civilian control, leading to a military ineffectiveness. This theoretical argument implies the following testable hypothesis:<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Civil–military conflict has a curvilinear or inverse <italic>U</italic>-shaped relationship with crisis bargaining success. At mid-levels, civil military conflict can increase the probability of crisis bargaining success.</p>

<sec id="section8-0095327X11430610">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>To examine the validity of the above hypothesis, the author constructs a new data set of civil–military conflictual intensity from 1990 to 2004 to evaluate the way civil–military conflict impacts crisis outcome success. Below, the author first outlines the variables and model specification used in this project. The author then discusses the results of the statistical tests and examines the robustness of these results.</p>
<sec id="section9-0095327X11430610">
<title>Key Independent Variable</title>
<p>Nuanced data concerning the degree or level of civil–military conflict, as the key independent variable, is necessary. No existing work moves far enough beyond a simple dichotomous presence/absence of civilian control distinction. In fact, very little quantitative work is done in the area of civil–military relations; much of the existing quantitative work focuses exclusively on military spending or the military history of civilian elites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0095327X11430610">42</xref></sup> These measures, though useful in looking at other aspects of civil–military relations, do not adequately capture the key concept of interest for this project. As such, a measure of the amount of conflict from military leaders to civilian leaders is necessary.</p>
<p>To construct indicators of the key concept necessary for this project, the author relies on events-data approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0095327X11430610">43</xref></sup> Events-data approaches have been previously used to examine everything from the strategic interactions of forces during the Bosnian conflict to the impact of human rights nongovernmental organizations worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0095327X11430610">44</xref></sup> For this project, the author utilizes the publicly available events-data from the Integrated Data for Events Analysis (IDEA) project.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0095327X11430610">45</xref></sup> This data set focuses on all Reuters Global News Service reports from 1990 to 2004. The raw data set is organized in a “who” did “what” to “whom” manner for each particular event; there are over ten million events in the complete data set. To capture the concepts necessary for this project, the larger data set was restricted to only events that capture an interaction where (1) the source of the interaction (who) is the military and the target (to whom) is the civilian leadership in the same country. In other words, the author restricts the data set to events from a military actor to his or her civilian authorities.</p>
<p>For the final indicators of civil–military conflict, however, the author cannot just rely on counts of all events by country-year. It is likely, for example, that the events captured in this restricted data set could indicate subjective control. For example, we could see events where the military commends or extols the civilian leadership in hopes of gaining postservice appointments, as was the case in Greece in 1996. Luckily, within studies of events-data, there is a well-established scoring method for both the presence or the absence and the degree of conflict or cooperation between the source and the target actor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0095327X11430610">46</xref></sup> This method, advanced first by Joshua Goldstein in 1992, relies on what the source “did,” or the form of the event, and whether the event form is determined to represent conflict or cooperation between the source and target. Therefore, for each event pertinent to this project, an indicator of whether each event was conflictual was added to the data set. Then, using scores first developed by Goldstein, a continuous indicator of the relative degree of cooperation or conflict in each event was also added. This score ranges from −10 for the most conflictual events, such as a military coup, to +10 for the most cooperative events, such as the military praising a decision of the civilian leadership. The final variables used here, therefore, measure <italic>the total number or count of civil</italic>–<italic>military conflictual events</italic> in a country-year and, more precisely, the <italic>total weight or intensity of all civil–military events</italic> in a country-year. This total weight measure is the total Goldstein score of all civil–military events in the country-year.</p>
<p>The count measure is a good first cut at the overall amount of conflict within the country at a given time. Among countries that have a crisis during this time period, this variable ranges from zero to eighteen, with the greatest number of conflictual events occurring in Yugoslavia in 1999, Pakistan in 1999, and Haiti in 1994, for example. Given the coup or defeats that occurred in each of these countries in this year, this measure appears to have a lot of face validity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0095327X11430610">47</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The overall Goldestein intensity measure also has a lot of face validity. For the sample used in this project, this variable ranges from −77.8 to 15.6. Again, lower values represent more overall civil–military conflict, while higher values would be indicative of a military that is largely supportive of everything the civilian leadership is doing. Countries at the low end of the spectrum include Yugoslavia and Pakistan in 1999. Countries at the high end of the spectrum include North Korea in 1996, the Philippines in 1995, Greece in 1996, and Democratic Republic of Congo in 1998. Again, these are all countries and time periods were subjective military control seems likely to have been occurring.</p>
<p>Given that the hypothesis listed above contends that the effect of civil–military conflict is curvilinear (i.e., the Goldilocks hypothesis), these variables are normalized around a mean of zero and squared in the analyses. Following convention, the author also includes the normalized constituent term.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0095327X11430610">48</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Though an events-data approach to the study of civil–military relations adds much to the empirical literature, the author does recognizes some of the shortcomings of utilizing events data. As Azar et al. and Bond et al. have stated, events data focus only on what makes it to the page.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0095327X11430610">49</xref></sup> Though this is theoretically important for the information mechanism to work, the author was concerned about the potential effects of any media bias. Therefore, for all statistical models, the author includes a control for the total number of events concerning the country as reported in Reuters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0095327X11430610">50</xref></sup>

<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>The central argument of this article concerns the role civil–military friction plays in military effectiveness and, ultimately, bargaining success. Unfortunately, there is not an ideal ranking of overall military effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0095327X11430610">51</xref></sup> Data at the battle success level is also not available for the time period for which the author has data on civil–military relations. As an proxy, therefore, the author uses crisis actor success as the dependent variable in the model presented here. This variable, coded from the International Crisis Behavior (ICB) Project data set, captures whether an individual state actor in an international crisis is able to reach an ultimate outcome that is deemed a “victory” from the crisis situation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0095327X11430610">52</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In addition to the negative crisis outcomes of “stalemate” and “defeat” in the ICB data set, there is a mid-range category of “compromises.” Therefore, as a robustness check, the author both runs an ordered probit analysis on all four categories of crisis outcome and a probit analysis where the dependent variable is the dichtomous indicator of victory/compromise in the crisis. As highlighted below, results remain consistent as to sign and significance in both specifications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0095327X11430610">53</xref></sup> The author thinks the coding of crisis events as successful for only ICB victories provides the harder empirical test and, thus, the author utilizes that coding of the dependent variable as the baseline in this project. This is similar to Gelpi and Griesdorf.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0095327X11430610">54</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Because military effectiveness can theoretically impact crisis bargaining without actual war, as discussed above, using a sample of all international crises allows him to examine the usefulness of civil–military friction short of war. Additionally, because the argument above concerns the impact at the state actor level, the actor level of analysis in this data set is useful here. The author measures all independent variables at their levels at the start of the crisis. This best reflects the information mechanisms through which civil–military friction impacts bargaining success.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0095327X11430610">
<title>Model Specification</title>
<p>Many additional factors could also impact crisis bargaining success. Whenever possible, the author tried to control for variables which could be related to both the key independent and the dependent variables. First, the author controls for democracy, utilizing a dichotomous indicator for whether the state’s revised Polity IV score (−10 to 10 scale) at the beginning of the crisis was six or greater.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0095327X11430610">55</xref></sup> The author also includes a control for the gravity of threat from the ICB data set.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0095327X11430610">56</xref></sup> This variable captures on a scale from zero to six the intensity of the “gravest” threat during the crisis. The author also includes a control of military capability from the Correlates of War project. This measure, a composite index of military capabilities, captures “total population, urban population, iron and steel production, energy consumption, military personnel, and military expenditure” of the crisis state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0095327X11430610">57</xref></sup> Higher values equal a more capable military. Like mentioned, the author also includes a control for the total number (log) of reports of the crisis state in the IDEA data set. When these variables were added, the final data set included 102 crisis actors from 1990 to 2004.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0095327X11430610">58</xref></sup> Due to the dichotomous nature of the dependent variable, the author uses a probit model with robust standard errors clustered on the crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0095327X11430610">59</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Though the Correlates of War capability data are the best proxy of military power, it does reduce the sample size from 126 to 102. Below, the author also shows that the results as to the key civil–military variables are consistent with or without the capabilities measure.</p>
<p>Though constrained by the limited time period for which I have data on the key independent variable, this model specification provides a useful first test of the central hypothesis that flows from the theoretical argument outlined above.</p>

<title>Results and Analysis</title>
<sec id="section13-0095327X11430610">
<title>Baseline Results</title>
<p>The basic hypothesis is confirmed in a number of the statistical models and robustness checks: civil–military friction can increase the probability of crisis bargaining success. If civil–military conflict is too low, it is likely that the military is under subjective control and will not be effective. Like discussed prior, however, if civil–military conflict is too high, it is likely that civilian control is in question, also leading to a lack of crisis bargaining success. Below, the author outlines these results and discusses their substantive importance.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095327X11430610">Table 1</xref>
provides the baseline results when capability is included as a control. First, column 1 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095327X11430610">Table 1</xref> provides the results of the baseline model where the key independent variable is the squared normalized count of the number of strictly conflictual events between the military and civilians. As can be observed, the coefficient on this variable is negative and statistically significant. This indicates that both high and low levels of civil–military conflict result in a decreased probability of winning a bargaining crisis. All statistically significant controls are in the expected direction.</p>

Like before, the square of this indicator is statistically significant and in the negative direction.

highlights this finding graphically.

Although the upper bound of the confidence level is very large on the left-hand side of this graph, this visual representation is still striking in that it highlights the diminishing returns of more cooperative civil–military relationships on the right-hand side of the figure.

<p>Also mentioned above, the baseline results presented here all concern the likelihood of crisis victory for the state actor. However, there are situations in the ICB data set coded as “compromises.” As a robustness test, therefore, the author recodes my dependent variable to define success as either crisis victory or crisis compromise (i.e., not crisis stalemate or crisis defeat). As columns 3 and 4 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0095327X11430610">Table 2</xref> show, the nonlinear impact of civil–military conflict remains identical in these additional specifications.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Do civil–military relations impact crisis outcome? The results shown here indicate that civil–military conflict has a nonmonotonic relationship with crisis success. Like Goldilocks and porridge, conflict can be either “too hot” or “too cold.” However, mid-level civil–military friction does appear to improve the likelihood of crisis bargaining success. This project thus serves as a reminder of the importance of both halves of Feaver’s “problematique”: the military has to be both under the control of the civilian leadership but still emboldened in its mission directive. Unlike Feaver but very similar to Huntington, the author argues that a military too complacent to the civilian leadership limits military effectiveness by diminishing military fighting and limiting the information both the civilian leadership and the adversary has in a crisis bargaining situation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0095327X11430610">61</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The author tests this argument using a new and somewhat novel events-data set. Though publicly available data have limited the focus of this project to just the years 1990–2004, perhaps future coding projects could extend this approach to cover a longer time series. Additionally, future work could focus on the impact of civil–military conflict on other measures of military effectiveness or crisis outcomes.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the take-away message of this article for civilian leaders and international observers is a powerful one: the impact of civil–military relations on crisis outcomes is more complex than just ensuring civilian control. Some leeway has to be provided to the military in order to maximize their role in creating successful crisis outcomes.</p>

<p>Huntington states “The Simplest Way of Minimizing Military Power Would Appear to be the Maximizing of the Power of Civilian Groups in Relation to the Military” (p. 80). Similarly, Schiff’s concordance theory sees optimal civil–military decision making like a corporation or team with “Respect for Individual Opinions, and Encouragement of Professional Skills” (p. 140). See Huntington, <italic>The Soldier and the State;</italic> Schiff, <italic>The</italic> 
<italic>Military and Domestic Politics.</italic> The author also thanks Dr. Schiff for discussing the relationship of concordance theory to the theoretical argument presented here at the 2010 IUS Conference,Toronto. Any errors in application remain the author's.</p>

<label>47.</label>
<p>Worth mentioning, the United States, due to an over-abundance of Reuters news stories, is omitted from the analyzes. This omission is consistent with statistical tests for outliers and is consistent with other recent work utilizing events data methods. The inclusion of the United States does not result in a change in the sign of the results but does, as to be expected, result in a loss of statistical significance at conventional levels. The results are consistent if large multilateral actions are omitted or if any crisis where the United States was an actor is omitted as well.
