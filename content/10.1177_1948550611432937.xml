<abstract>
<p>The idea of prejudice as a tendency that can be generalized from one target to another and the personality–prejudice relationship have been widely examined using explicit measures. However, less is known about this tendency and its relation to personality for implicit prejudice measures, like the implicit association test (IAT). Three studies including explicit and corresponding implicit prejudice measures toward various target groups confirmed a generalized factor for both types of measures with a stronger common component for the explicit factor. Personality was significantly related to the explicit measures only. Also, the personality and prejudice measures were <italic>un</italic>related to explicit and implicit attitudes toward an irrelevant target which rules out potential method confound. These results indicate that explicit and implicit prejudice measures tap different psychological constructs relating differently to the individual’s self-reported personality. The findings have implications for the debate on whether IAT scores reflect personally endorsed attitudes.</p>

<p>The implicit association test (IAT) is probably the most widely used instrument to assess implicit intergroup biases and stereotypes. The IAT is aimed to measure the strength of associations between mental representations (e.g., gay people and good/bad). In stereotyping and prejudice research, there has been a lively debate on the reliability and validity of IAT as a measure of intergroup bias (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611432937">Blanton &amp; Jaccard, 2006</xref>). For example, researchers have discussed whether implicit (IAT) and explicit (self-report) attitude measures assess the same underlying construct. Empirical findings indicate that the two types of measures tap two distinct but correlated concepts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611432937">Hofmann, Gawronski, Gschwendner, Le, &amp; Schmitt, 2005</xref>). A more challenging question is whether IAT scores reflect familiarity or cultural associations rather than personally endorsed associations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611432937">Blanton &amp; Jaccard, 2008</xref>). Specifically, it has been argued that IAT scores reflect associations in the culture and say little about the individual’s personal attitudes toward the studied social target (e.g., Bluemke &amp; Fiedler, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611432937">Olson &amp; Fazio, 2004</xref>). In contrast, it has also been argued that all associations in memory are potentially influential on behavior regardless of their label as social or personal (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611432937">Nosek &amp; Hansen, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>When explicit measures are used, prejudices toward a variety of target groups are found to be highly correlated indicating a generalized tendency (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550611432937">Akrami, Ekehammar, &amp; Bergh, 2011</xref>). Importantly, the observation of such a generalized tendency across targets laid the very foundation for the personality approach to prejudice (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611432937">Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, &amp; Sanford, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611432937">Allport, 1954</xref>). The guiding idea here is quite simple: If individuals displaying prejudice toward one out-group also do it toward other out-groups (including nonexisting ones, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611432937">Hartley, 1946</xref>) then it makes sense to start looking for an explanation <italic>within</italic> the individual.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is extensive support for <italic>explicit</italic> prejudice being related to individual differences in personality and ideological beliefs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550611432937">Sibley &amp; Duckitt, 2008</xref>). Initially, explicit prejudice was linked to right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO). Recent research has also linked prejudice to core personality, like the Big-Five factors agreeableness and openness to experience (henceforth openness). These factors are considered to be fundamental traits that guide social behavior and their substantial heritability and stability is well documented (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611432937">McCrae &amp; Costa, 2008</xref>). Empirically, these personality factors have been found to explain about 30% of the variance in generalized explicit prejudice (an index of several prejudices; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611432937">Ekehammar &amp; Akrami, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Whereas the notion of generalized prejudice is firmly established for explicit scores, the generality of implicit prejudice has not received much attention. Notably, the implicit attitude literature has focused much more on the generalization across exemplars within a social category than the generalization across categories/social groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550611432937">Ranganath &amp; Nosek, 2008</xref>). To our knowledge, there are only two published articles examining generalized implicit prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611432937">Cunningham, Nezlek, &amp; Banaji, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611432937">McFarland &amp; Crouch, 2002</xref>). These articles reported an implicit factor explaining the intercorrelations between different IATs. Notably, some researchers argue that these intercorrelations might reflect a cognitive skill confound and method-specific variance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611432937">Mierke &amp; Klauer, 2003</xref>). However, several studies have demonstrated that these confounds are much reduced by using an improved scoring algorithm when analyzing IAT results (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611432937">Cai, Sriram, Greenwald, &amp; McFarland, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies on the relation of implicit prejudice with personality and ideology variables are scarce too. In two articles, Rowatt and colleagues found RWA and SDO to be significantly correlated with explicit but not implicit prejudice toward Muslims and gay people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611432937">Rowatt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611432937">Rowatt, Franklin, &amp; Cotton, 2005</xref>). Also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611432937">Cunningham et al. (2004</xref>) found ideological beliefs (including RWA) and cognitive rigidity to be significantly related to both implicit and explicit ethnocentrism. Interestingly, the correlation of ideology with explicit prejudice was significantly higher than that with implicit and the correlation between rigidity and implicit prejudice was low and only marginally significant. To our knowledge, there are no studies on the link between core personality and implicit prejudice and this article constitutes the first exploration of this relationship.</p>
<p>We suggest that the pattern of support for the within-individual approach to explicit prejudice can provide a framework for examining the extent to which IAT scores reflect personally endorsed attitudes. Specifically, we argue that the question about personal endorsement in both explicit and implicit attitudes can be addressed by asking two questions: (a) Can the prejudiced attitudes be generalized across targets? (b) Is this generalized tendency related to stable dispositions? The first question is analogous to a fundamental premise in personality psychology; that personality effects are based on the observation that different behaviors (or attitudes) in one situation will reoccur in different contexts (prejudice targets in this case). The second question addresses what characteristics of the prejudiced individual might be involved. We examined these questions in three studies where we included explicit and implicit prejudice measures toward various social groups. In all three studies, we included the Big-Five factors agreeableness and openness as measures of core personality. In Study 3, we examined a possible effect of common method variance by including implicit and explicit measures of attitudes toward irrelevant targets (Coca-Cola &amp; Pepsi).</p>

<title>Measures and Procedure</title>
<p>A test session started with participants responding to three<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1948550611432937">1</xref>
</sup> IAT sets, one related to Race (Black people—White people) and two related to sexuality bias (lesbian/gay couples—straight couples). These IATs measure the strength of association between two concepts (e.g., lesbian/straight couples) and evaluative attributes (pleasant/unpleasant). The order of the three IATs was randomized for each participant. The procedure for constructing the IATs followed that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550611432937">Lane, Banaji, Nosek, and Greenwald (2007</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611432937">Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji (2003</xref>), we calculated a <italic>D</italic>
<sub>6</sub> score reflecting bias toward Black people, lesbians, and gay men for each participant. Split-half reliabilities for the IAT were calculated based on a <italic>D</italic>-score derived from Blocks 3 and 6 and a second <italic>D-</italic>score based on Blocks 4 and 7. We used Rulon’s formula to estimate the reliability of the test as the two <italic>D</italic>s can be considered nonparallel (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611432937">Crocker &amp; Algina, 1986</xref>). The reliabilities were .46, .72, and .64 for the race, gay men, and lesbian IATs, respectively.</p>
<p>Further, participants responded to scales measuring agreeableness and openness from the NEO-PI-R (48 items each; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611432937">Bergman, 2003</xref>), prejudice toward immigrants/ethnic groups (8 items; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611432937">Akrami, Ekehammar, &amp; Araya, 2000</xref>), and sexual prejudice—assessing prejudice toward gay men and lesbians (7 items each; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611432937">Ekehammar, Bergh, &amp; Akrami, 2010</xref>). Personality and prejudice items were answered on a 5-step Likert-like scale ranging from 1 (<italic>Is absolutely not true/Do not agree at all</italic>) to 5 (<italic>Is absolutely true/agree fully</italic>). After reversing appropriate items, scale scores were formed by averaging across items. Cronbach α reliabilities were .88, .86, .83, .80, and .70, for agreeableness, openness, and explicit attitudes toward immigrants/ethnic groups, gay men, and lesbians, respectively. Participants completed the study individually in the laboratory.</p>

<title>Results and Comments</title>
<p>Correlation analyses revealed a mixed pattern of results with significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) correlations between explicit measurers (<italic>r</italic>s between .22 and .71). The implicit measures were also significantly correlated except for that between IAT-race and IAT-lesbian (<italic>r</italic>s between .13 and .38). The correlations across implicit and explicit measures varied between .06 and .21 and reached the conventional level of significance in one case only (explicit gay—implicit lesbian). Personality–prejudice correlations varied between .06 and −.40 and were significant for all personality–explicit prejudice correlations except for that between agreeableness and explicit prejudice toward lesbians. No correlations with implicit prejudice were significant. For the complete set of means, standard deviations, and correlations, see Supplementary Online Materials.</p>
<p>Generalized prejudice was examined by assessing the common variance of the prejudice measures. Principal components analyses (PCA) on the explicit measures revealed one component with an eigenvalue above 1, explaining 62% of the total variance in the three measures. Loadings on this component varied between .53 (ethnic prejudice) and .90 (attitudes toward gay men). Analysis of the implicit measures also yielded one component with an eigenvalue above 1. This component explained 50% of the total variance in the three measures and loadings varied between .54 (IAT-race) and .80 (IAT-gay men).</p>
<p>The relationships between personality and implicit/explicit prejudice were examined by employing structural equation modeling (SEM). We tested a model consisting of four latent variables, <italic>Agreeableness</italic>, <italic>Openness, Explicit Prejudice</italic>, and <italic>Implicit Prejudice</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611432937">Figure 1</xref>). Openness and agreeableness were attached to two parcels of manifest variables by randomly assessing half (24) of the items measuring respective factor to each parcel. Explicit prejudice and implicit prejudice were attached to their respective (three) manifest variables, that is, either the three explicit or the three IAT measures. The results revealed that the model fit the data very well, χ<sup>2</sup>(29) = 31.97, <italic>p</italic> = .32, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) =.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) [.00, .09]. The analysis revealed that openness was a significant predictor of explicit, but not implicit, prejudice. However, agreeableness was unrelated to both explicit and implicit prejudice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611432937">Figure 1</xref>). Finally, the SEM revealed a significant relationship (<italic>r</italic> = .29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) between the explicit and implicit prejudice factors. For the complete SEM analyses, see Supplementary Online Materials.</p>

</fig>
<p>Testing the personality–explicit against personality–implicit relationships, we ran a model where we constrained the personality–explicit path to be equal to the corresponding personality–implicit paths. This model had a fit to the data that was close to the original one, χ<sup>2</sup>(31) = 33.76, <italic>p</italic> = .34, RMSEA = .03, 95% CI [.00, .08] and the difference was nonsignificant, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 1.79, <italic>p</italic> = .41. This outcome shows that, overall, the personality–explicit paths are not significantly different from the personality–implicit paths.</p>
<p>The nonsignificant path from agreeableness to explicit prejudice was somewhat surprising, yet an explanation can be found in the choice of the target groups in this study. Two of the three explicit measures targeted gay people, so a general index based on these could be expected to have a bias toward specific aspects of sexual prejudice. In other words, our generalized factor may not have been that “general” after all. As indicated in recent research, basic personality is mainly related to abstract aspects of prejudice where the unique aspects of specific targets weight lightly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550611432937">Akrami et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550611432937">Sibley &amp; Duckitt, 2008</xref>). In this light, the finding appears less perplex. Also, if agreeableness “underperformed” in predicting explicit prejudice in this study, a significantly better prediction of explicit than implicit prejudice becomes less likely.</p>
<p>In terms of explained variance, canonical correlation analyses revealed that the personality variables significantly explained 22% of the variance in the explicit prejudice measures, χ<sup>2</sup>(6) = 30.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Corresponding analysis showed that personality explained only 3% of variance in the implicit measures with the overall test being nonsignificant, χ<sup>2</sup>(6) = 4.9, <italic>p</italic> = .56.<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p>In sum, the PCA showed that the common component of the implicit measures was smaller than that of the explicit measures. The SEM and canonical correlation analyses offered support for core personality being related to explicit, but not implicit, prejudice. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in fit between models with free versus equal paths from personality to explicit and implicit prejudice in the SEM analyses. Also, the two sexual orientation prejudice measures were closely related which restricts the analyses to Black people/immigrants and gay people rather than to prejudice more broadly. Thus, some findings were indicative of more personal endorsement in explicit than implicit attitudes, but overall the results were not clear enough to reach firm conclusions in this matter. In Study 2, we aimed to address these limitations with an improved index of generalized prejudice based on biases toward four social groups that are clearly distinct. Based on the expectation that agreeableness should be more predictive of prejudice in Study 2, we also predicted a more pronounced difference between the personality correlates with explicit versus implicit prejudice.</p>

<title>Measures and Procedure</title>
<p>Participants in this study completed four IATs related to race (Black people—White people), age (young people—old people), weight (fat people—thin people), and sexuality (gay couples—straight couples). The race and sexuality IATs were the same as those used in Study 1. The construction of the age and weight IATs was equivalent to that of the race and sexuality tests. As in Study 1, the order of the four IATs was randomized for each participant and we calculated a <italic>D</italic>
<sub>6</sub> score for each participant—reflecting bias toward gay men, Black people, fat people, and old people. The reliabilities for the IAT scores, computed as in Study 1, were .66, .32, .50, and .49 for the race, age, weight, and gay IATs, respectively.</p>
<p>Further, participants responded to scales measuring agreeableness and openness, prejudice toward immigrants, and prejudice toward gay men, all identical to those used in Study 1. Moreover, participants responded to scales measuring prejudice toward elderly and obese people (17 and 11 items, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611432937">Bergh &amp; Akrami, 2011</xref>). Response alternatives and scale score calculation followed that of Study 1. Cronbach α reliabilities were .88, .88, .87, .80, .82, and .82, for agreeableness, openness, and explicit attitudes toward immigrants/ethnic groups, gay men, and obese and elderly people, respectively. Participants completed the study individually in the laboratory.</p>

<sec id="section10-1948550611432937">
<title>Results and Comments</title>
<p>Correlation analyses of participants’ prejudice scores revealed a mixed pattern of results with the explicit measurers being significantly intercorrelated (<italic>r</italic>s between .21 and .55). The correlations among the implicit measures varied between .10 and .33 with only three of the six coefficients being statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The correlations across implicit and explicit measures varied between −.02 and .16 and were all nonsignificant. The personality–prejudice correlations varied between .08 and −.57 and were significant for personality–explicit prejudice only, except for the correlation between openness and explicit prejudice toward gay men. This lack of a significant correlation between openness and explicit prejudice toward gay men is surprising considering the results in Study 1 and previous research. The analyses also revealed a significant correlation between openness and IAT-age (<italic>r</italic> = −.20, <italic>p</italic> = .04). For the complete set of means, standard deviations, and correlations see Supplementary Online Materials at http://spps.sagepub.com/supplemental.</p>
<p>Examining generalized prejudice, a PCA of the explicit measures revealed only one component with an eigenvalue above 1. This component explained 56% of the total variance in the four measures. Loadings on the component varied between .53 (attitudes toward gay men) and .83 (ethnic prejudice). Analysis of the implicit measures also yielded one component with an eigenvalue above 1, explaining 41% of the total variance in the four measures. Loadings varied between .47 (IAT-race) and .72 (IAT-weight).</p>
<p>SEM, conducted as outlined in Study 1, revealed that the model had an excellent fit to the data, χ<sup>2</sup>(48) = 39.15, <italic>p</italic> = .81, RMSEA = .00, 95% CI [.00, .04]. The model had significant path coefficients from personality to explicit, but not implicit, prejudice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611432937">Figure 1</xref>). Again, testing the differences between the personality–explicit against personality–implicit paths, we ran a model with personality–explicit paths constrained to be equal to the respective personality–implicit paths. The results showed that, although this model had a good to fit to the data, χ<sup>2</sup>(50) = 56.85, <italic>p</italic> = .24, RMSEA = .04, 95% CI [.00, .08], it was significantly worse than the original model tested above, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(2) = 17.70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. This outcome shows that the personality–explicit paths are significantly higher than the personality–implicit paths. Finally, the correlation between the explicit and implicit prejudice factors (<italic>r</italic> = .08) was not significantly different from 0. For the complete SEM analyses, see Supplementary Online Materials.</p>
<p>Canonical correlation analyses revealed that the personality variables significantly explained 40% of the variance in the explicit prejudice measures, χ<sup>2</sup>(8) = 54.4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Corresponding analysis showed that personality explained only 6% of the variance in the implicit measures with the overall test being nonsignificant, χ<sup>2</sup>(8) = 8.4, <italic>p</italic> = .40.<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p>In line with Study 1, the present study showed that there is a stronger common component in explicit compared to implicit prejudice and that the former is significantly related to core personality factors. Compared to Study 1, this study provides a more clearly pronounced support for a stronger personality–explicit relationship as the personality–explicit paths in the SEM model were significantly higher than those for personality–implicit prejudice. The present findings provide strong support for explicit prejudice being more related to the individual’s self-reported basic personality tendencies. However, these conclusions can be questioned on the basis of shared method variance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611432937">Campbell &amp; Fiske, 1959</xref>). Specifically, the personality and explicit prejudice variables were assessed in a similar fashion (self-reports) whereas implicit prejudice was assessed with a fundamentally different technique (response times). That is, stronger correlations with personality for the explicit measures could be due to methodological similarity rather than conceptual relations. To address this issue, we conducted a third study in which we introduced both explicit and implicit control measures that should be conceptually unrelated to prejudice (attitudes toward Coca-Cola and Pepsi). Thus, we examined the relation between each type of prejudice measure and the corresponding control variables in order to estimate possible shared method variance in the explicit and implicit measures.</p>

<title>Measures and Procedure</title>
<p>This study adopted the same measures and design as Study 2 with the addition of control variables for attitudes toward Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Two explicit scales for attitudes toward Coca-Cola and Pepsi were developed. These were mirror instruments and had six items each (e.g., Coca-Cola [/Pepsi] should be served at all restaurants). Three items in each scale were reversed and the scales were answered on the same 5-step Likert-like scale as the prejudice measures. After reversing appropriate items, scale scores for each participant were formed by averaging across items indicating positive attitudes toward Coca-Cola and Pepsi (which in the following are referred to as explicit soda attitudes).</p>
<p>For the Coca-Cola/Pepsi IAT we used the same evaluative words as in the prejudice measures and introduced four Coca-Cola and four Pepsi items (pictures of two cans, a bottle, and the company brand). For each participant, we calculated a <italic>D</italic>
<sub>6</sub> score reflecting implicit bias toward Pepsi (which in the following are referred to as implicit soda attitudes).</p>
<p>Cronbach α reliabilities for the personality and explicit prejudice/irrelevant measures were .90, .87, .81, .81, .73, .84, .87, and .82, for agreeableness, openness, and explicit attitudes toward immigrants/ethnic groups, gay men, the elderly, obese people, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi, respectively. The reliabilities for the IAT, computed as in Study 1, were .50, .35, .19, .43, and .20, for the race, gay, age, weight, and Coca-Cola/Pepsi IATs, respectively.</p>

<title>Results and Comments</title>
<p>Preliminary analyses showed that the explicit measure for prejudice toward gay men was highly skewed in this sample (Pearson’s skewness = 3.66) and was dropped from all subsequent analyses. Analyses of the remaining measures showed that the explicit prejudices were significantly correlated (<italic>r</italic>s between .30 and .50). The correlations between the implicit prejudice measures were weaker and only three coefficients were statistically significant (<italic>r</italic>s between −.01 and .22). The correlations across implicit and explicit measures varied between −.04 and .20 of which only two were significant. The personality–prejudice correlations varied between .01 and −.54 and were significant for personality–explicit prejudice only (<italic>r</italic>s between −.21 and −.54). Explicit attitudes toward Coca-Cola and Pepsi were significantly positively correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) but were unrelated to explicit prejudice and personality (<italic>r</italic>s between −.07 and .12). Also, except for its correlation with race-IAT (<italic>r</italic> = −.17, <italic>p</italic> = .04, two-tailed), the soda IAT was unrelated to the implicit prejudice measures (<italic>r</italic>s between −.07 and .12). Overall, these findings were in line with those of Study 1 and Study 2 and indicate very limited effects of shared method variance on the correlations. For the complete set of means, standard deviations, and correlations, see Supplementary Online Materials.</p>
<p>Examining generalized prejudice, a PCA with the explicit measures revealed only one component with an eigenvalue above 1. This component explained 62% of the total variance in the three measures. Loadings on the component varied between .75 and .86. A similar analysis of the implicit measures yielded two components with an eigenvalue above 1. However, the second component passed the default criterion for eigenvalues with the least possible marginal (1.01) and we therefore reran the analyses with a slightly higher threshold. A single component explained 36% of the total variance and the loadings varied between .32 (IAT-gay) and .70 (IAT-age). With a minor divergence, the present outcome is in line with those of Study 1 and 2.</p>
<p>The SEM was performed in the same way as in Study 1 and Study 2, with the exception that new latent and manifest variables for explicit and implicit soda attitudes were included in the model. Hence, the explicit soda factor had two indicators, attitudes toward Coca-Cola and attitudes toward Pepsi. The Coca-Cola/Pepsi-IAT served as a manifest control variable on the implicit side. As noted above, including attitudes toward soda was done in order to estimate shared method variance between the prejudice and the personality variables. Thus, we added paths from agreeableness and openness to explicit as well as implicit soda attitudes. For the same purpose, we included a correlation between the explicit prejudice and explicit soda attitudes and implicit prejudice and the implicit soda factors. Once more, our model showed an excellent fit to the data, χ<sup>2</sup>(67) = 69.15, <italic>p</italic> = .40, RMSEA = .02, 95% CI [.00, 05] and the model had significant path coefficients from personality to explicit, but not implicit, prejudice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611432937">Figure 1</xref>). The complete SEM analyses can be found in the Supplementary Online Materials.</p>
<p>Testing the differences between the personality–explicit against personality–implicit paths, we ran a model with personality–explicit paths constrained to be equal to the respective personality–implicit paths. The results showed that, although this model had a good fit to the data, χ<sup>2</sup>(69) = 80.21, <italic>p</italic> = .17, RMSEA = .03, 95% CI [.00, .06], it was significantly worse than the original model tested above, Δχ<sup>&gt;2</sup>(2) = 11.06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Once again, this outcome shows that the personality–explicit paths are significantly higher than the personality–implicit paths.</p>
<p>Canonical correlation analyses revealed that the personality variables significantly explained 34% of the variance in the three explicit prejudice measures, χ<sup>2</sup>(6) = 64.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. A corresponding analysis showed that personality explained only 2% of the variance in the four implicit measures with the overall test being nonsignificant, χ<sup>2</sup>(8) = 5.7, <italic>p</italic> = .68.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>In line with the findings from Study 1 and Study 2, the personality variables significantly predicted explicit, but not implicit, prejudice. As it was the case in Study 2, the paths from personality to explicit prejudice were significantly stronger than those from personality to implicit prejudice. The correlation between explicit and implicit prejudice was once again found to be nonsignificant. Examining the method variance, we found all relations between implicit and explicit soda attitudes to any of the attached variables to be nonsignificant. These findings indicate a very small impact of shared method variance. Thus, the disclosed relationships between various prejudices and the personality–explicit-prejudice relationship can be considered conceptual rather than methodological.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present studies provided head-to-head comparisons of the variance explained by a generalized prejudice factor in explicit and implicit prejudice, which has not been done in previous studies. Our results revealed a stronger common component for explicit than for implicit prejudice in all three studies. This suggests that prejudice is more readily generalized from one target to another for explicit than implicit measures. As generalization across targets is essential for implying person (rather than culture/situation) explanations of prejudice (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611432937">Allport, 1954</xref>), this outcome indicates greater person effects in explicit prejudice measures than in the IAT. In line with this perspective, we also found significant relations between the core personality variables and explicit, but not implicit, prejudice in all three studies. Further, Study 3 demonstrated that these conclusions are not artifacts of shared method variance.</p>
<p>Considering the low reliabilities in the implicit measures it is hardly surprising that the intercorrelations were weaker between the implicit prejudice measures than the explicit ones. Some would argue then that we should have corrected these for attenuation before any fair evaluation could be made about the strength of a general prejudice factor in explicit and implicit measures or relations with personality. On the other hand, the most crucial analyses for the article, those concerning the relation between personality and prejudice, were done with latent variables by using SEM and canonical correlations. Here, we found personality to explain a large part of the variance in explicit but hardly any of the shared variance in the implicit measures. Thus, even after factoring out the error variance from the IAT, the relations with personality were weak and nonsignificant for implicit prejudice. These finding supports the view that explicit and implicit prejudice measures tap different constructs with different psychological underpinnings.</p>
<p>Discussing personal endorsement in the IAT it also becomes relevant to ask the following: If powerful predictors of explicit prejudice are irrelevant for the implicit bias, then what accounts for the individual differences in the IAT? Here, critics have offered a number of cognitive accounts for the IAT effects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611432937">Klauer &amp; Mierke, 2005</xref>) that could explain the lacking relationships with self-reported personality. However, these perspectives do not explain why the IAT displays reasonable predictive validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550611432937">Greenwald, Poehlman, Uhlmann, &amp; Banaji, 2009</xref>). More specifically, if the true variance in the IAT only reflected variations in cognitive functioning then they would be unlikely to predict behaviors such as political preferences or discrimination. Also, considering the somewhat limited reliability in the IAT it is actually impressive that the IAT matches (or even outperforms) self-reported measures of prejudice in predicting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550611432937">Greenwald et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Another relevant question here concerns what kind of behavior that the IAT primarily predicts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611432937">Neumann, Hülsenbeck, and Seibt (2004</xref>) found that implicit prejudice toward people with AIDS predicted spontaneous avoidance behavior whereas explicit attitudes predicted reflective behavior intentions toward the same group. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611432937">Asendorpf, Banse, and Mücke (2002</xref>) found that an IAT measurement of a shy personality predicted spontaneous shy behaviors whereas explicit personality predicted controlled shy behaviors. Thus, the explicit–implicit distinction in attitudes also seems to have a correspondence in personality and behavior as well. This could explain why we did not find any relation between explicit personality and implicit prejudice. Implicit personality measures might perform better in predicting implicit prejudice and this possibility should be highly relevant for future research in this area. Here, it would also be theoretically important to explore a dual-process model for the whole causal chain from personality to prejudice and eventually discrimination or hostile intergroup behaviors. More specifically, our results combined with previous findings suggest that the links between personality, prejudice, and discrimination may follow two distinct paths, one that is controlled and one that is automatic.</p>
<p>Some researchers have suggested that self-favoring biases in explicit prejudice are the main reason why the outcomes of explicit and implicit prejudice measurements differ (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611432937">Olson, Fazio, &amp; Hermann, 2007</xref>). Previous research has also shown that self-reports of socially valued person characteristics, such as agreeableness, are confounded with self-favoring biases (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611432937">Bäckström, Björklund, &amp; Larsson, 2009</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611432937">Graziano &amp; Tobin, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, it is known that behaviors may depend on the expectancies of others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611432937">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 2005</xref>). Thus, self-favoring biases could be apparent in all three steps in the chain from self-reported personality and prejudice to controlled behaviors. As a consequence, some might question the use of self-report measures in any setting associated with social desirability. Indeed, this was also an important reason to search for implicit attitude measures (see von Hippel, Sekaquaptewa, &amp; Varga, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550611432937">1997</xref>). On the other hand, not all behaviors are spontaneous. Thus, the dual-process model as indicated by this and previous research points to the importance of explicit measures for understanding the controlled aspects of human behavior. After all, extreme behavioral consequences of prejudice (e.g., ethnic cleansing) are probably more readily understood from explicit personality and prejudice than from automatic associations.</p>
