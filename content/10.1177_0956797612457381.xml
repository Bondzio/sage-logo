<abstract>
<p>Do infants reared in poverty exhibit certain physiological traits that make them susceptible to the positive and negative features of their caregiving environment? Guided by theories of differential susceptibility and biological sensitivity to context, we evaluated whether high baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) operates as a susceptibility factor among infants reared in poverty (<italic>N</italic> = 73). Baseline RSA at 5 months, the quality of the attachment relationship at 17 months, and the interaction of these two factors were included in our models as predictors of problem behavior at 17 months. Consistent with theory, results showed no significant differences in problem behavior among infants with low baseline RSA; however, infants with high baseline RSA exhibited the lowest levels of problem behavior if reared in an environment that fostered security, and they exhibited the highest levels of problem behavior if reared in an environment that fostered disorganization. These results have important implications for the psychological health of infants living in poverty.</p>

<body>
<p>Developmental psychologists have identified a discrete group of children who, despite similar biological or behavioral susceptibilities, either wither or bloom depending on the environments in which they are reared. The differential-susceptibility hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612457381">Belsky, Bakermans-Kranenburg, &amp; van IJzendoorn, 2007</xref>) and the related theory of biological sensitivity to context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612457381">Boyce &amp; Ellis, 2005</xref>) contend that within the right rearing environments, individuals with traits that make them susceptible to environmental influences will achieve levels of adaptation that regularly exceed those of their less susceptible, presumably hardier peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612457381">Ellis, Boyce, Belsky, Bakermans-Kranenburg, &amp; van Ijzendoorn, 2011</xref>). However, if susceptible individuals are born into environments that afford constant diets of adversity, their susceptibilities will function principally as vulnerabilities that predispose them to many of the worst outcomes possible.</p>
<p>Because of the provocative nature of such theorizing, the search is on for specific susceptibilities as well as for specific environments that foster or fetter such traits. Recent tests of these theories using physiological indices of susceptibility have been limited mostly to older children, which limits researchers’ ability to identify these susceptibilities earlier in life when children are presumably most responsive to experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612457381">Beauchaine, Neuhaus, Brenner, &amp; Gatzke-Kopp, 2008</xref>). In the present study, we investigated infants’ physiological susceptibilities in the context of what is arguably the most important early human environment, the primary attachment relationship.</p>
<p>How a baby reacts and recovers physiologically to environmental conditions is prognostic of later adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0956797612457381">Rothbart, 2011</xref>). One physiological measure that has received a great deal of attention in the regulatory literature because of its association with attentional and emotional systems is respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a noninvasive measure of vagal (parasympathetic) influences on the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956797612457381">Porges, 2007</xref>). Previous work has shown that high baseline RSA buffers older children against their parents’ marital conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612457381">El-Sheikh, Harger, &amp; Whitson, 2001</xref>) and prenatal substance exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0956797612457381">Sheinkopf et al., 2007</xref>). However, such associations are much less straightforward in infancy. On the one hand, baseline RSA appears to be a particularly sensitive marker of the degree to which infants are attuned to their environment for better <italic>and</italic> for worse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612457381">Beauchaine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612457381">Propper, 2012</xref>). Infants with higher baseline RSA tend to express more negative reactivity to arm restraint, cry more in response to complex stimuli, and exhibit more pain reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612457381">Fox, Schmidt, &amp; Henderson, 2000</xref>). On the other hand, infants with higher baseline RSA exhibit greater levels of sustained visual attention, express more interest and positivity toward strangers, and smile more while playing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612457381">Fox et al., 2000</xref>). Higher baseline RSA thus may be a type of biological susceptibility that makes infants sensitive to both the affordances and perturbations of their early rearing environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612457381">Beauchaine, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Although a genetic basis for RSA has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612457381">Kupper et al., 2005</xref>), baseline RSA appears to be remarkably sensitive to early caregiving experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612457381">Propper, 2012</xref>). We believe that emotion-regulatory processes within the primary attachment relationship shape infants’ physiological response to and recovery from stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612457381">Calkins &amp; Hill, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612457381">Conradt &amp; Ablow, 2010</xref>). In the study reported here, we examined the attachment relationship as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612457381">Bowlby (1969/1982</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612457381">Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, and Wall (1978)</xref> defined it, specifically, as an index of the qualities of the early caregiving environment rather than as a measure of individual differences.</p>
<p>We chose to examine secure and disorganized attachment environments because they are an ecologically valid indicator of the caregiving environment in which the infant is raised that takes into account both positive and negative rearing conditions, an essential step in examining processes of susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612457381">Belsky &amp; Pluess, 2009</xref>). Caregiving environments that foster security and disorganization also represent caregiving extremes and may interact very differently with infants’ physiological susceptibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0956797612457381">Solomon &amp; George, 2011</xref>). In the one instance, increased engagement with the environment may be adaptive, enabling some young children to take advantage of positive rearing conditions. In the other instance, increased engagement may reflect vigilance that, in the short term, protects young children from the distressing aspects of their caregiving environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612457381">Ellis et al., 2011</xref>). However, this increased vigilance can come at a cost. Chronic exposure to stress taxes the system in the form of bodily wear and tear and increased likelihood of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612457381">McEwen &amp; Stellar, 1993</xref>) and psychopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612457381">McEwen, 2003</xref>). Thus, children who are more physiologically attuned to a negative or harsh caregiving environment may be unable to cope with the effects of their heightened sensitivity, which would lead to poor developmental outcomes.</p>
<p>Beyond the immediate caregiving environment, infants’ biobehavioral development is deeply embedded in broader psychosocial contexts with known effects on long-term outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0956797612457381">Shonkoff, Boyce, &amp; McEwen, 2009</xref>). Poverty is one such environmental circumstance that can augment the effects of early attachment conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612457381">Belsky &amp; Fearon, 2002</xref>). Caregivers living in poverty often experience levels of stress that compromise their efforts to provide children with warm and supportive parenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0956797612457381">Repetti, Taylor, &amp; Seeman, 2002</xref>). It is unclear whether infants’ biological characteristics will operate as added forms of susceptibility (i.e., in a manner for better and for worse) against the pernicious backdrop of poverty. There may be conditions of poverty that both trump the most secure caregiving environments and have no affordances that can interact adaptively with heightened forms of susceptibility.</p>
<p>Previous research has found that infants with greater negative emotionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797612457381">Pluess &amp; Belsky, 2009</xref>), infants with specific allelic variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612457381">Bakermans-Kranenburg &amp; van Ijzendoorn, 2006</xref>), and children who are more physiologically reactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0956797612457381">Obradovic, Bush, Stamperdahl, Adler, &amp; Boyce, 2010</xref>) are more susceptible to their rearing environments. The central aim of the current study was to extend this search for specific forms of susceptibility that operate during infancy. It is of critical importance to determine whether (a) these traits are both present and detectible early in life, when they are presumed to be most dependent on early experience for their finished form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612457381">Boyce &amp; Ellis, 2005</xref>), and (b) whether these traits are predictive of later problems in adaptation. We tested the hypothesis that, compared with infants with lower baseline levels of RSA, infants with higher baseline levels of RSA would display low levels of problem behavior in toddlerhood if raised in environments that foster security but display high levels of problem behavior if raised in environments that foster disorganization.</p>

<p>Participants were drawn from a prospective longitudinal study that followed 105 women at risk for parenting problems and their infants across the perinatal period. Details on enrollment and exclusion criteria are described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612457381">Conradt &amp; Ablow, 2010</xref>). We examined data from 95 dyads that participated in a laboratory visit when the infants were 5 months old (<italic>M</italic> = 20.99 weeks, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.55; 53 female, 42 male) and from 86 of the dyads that returned when the toddlers were 17 months old (<italic>M</italic> = 17.6 months, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.76; 48 female, 38 male). At the prenatal assessment, mothers’ mean age was 24.11 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.77, range = 18−38). Mothers were primarily European American (81.0%), with 2.9% African American, 5.8% Hispanic, 3.8% American Indian, 1% Asian, and 5.7% identifying themselves as “another group.” Detailed information regarding the demographics of our sample is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612457381">Table 1</xref>.

<title>Procedure</title>
<sec id="section4-0956797612457381">
<title>Baseline RSA at 5 months</title>
<p>When infants were 5 months old, dyads watched a 2-min Baby Einstein video from the <italic>Baby Mozart Discovery Kit</italic> (The Baby Einstein Co., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.babyeinstein.com">http://www.babyeinstein.com</ext-link>) while the infant sat on the mother’s lap. This assessment was used to examine infants’ RSA while in a relaxed state that did not involve contending with a stressful stimulus.</p>
<p>Infant physiological responses were collected with a 21-channel Bioamplifier (JCA-09; James Long Co., Caroga Lake, NY). Physiological channels were sampled continuously with low-pass filtering at 1000 Hz. High-pass filtering was recorded at 0.03 Hz. Epochs containing artifacts were edited manually for each channel. Editing the files included identifying outlier points relative to adjacent data and replacing them by determining the time between successive interbeat intervals (IBIs). Data files in which more than 2% to 3% of the data needed to be edited were not included in the analyses. The data were then scanned graphically using the Statistical Analysis System (Version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and outliers were removed. Outliers that were more than 3 standard deviations above or below the mean were removed and replaced with the mean of the episode. Infants with and without complete, usable physiological data did not differ in age or gender.</p>
<p>RSA was computed using respiration and IBI data according to Grossman’s peak-valley technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612457381">Grossman, Karemaker, &amp; Wieling, 1991</xref>). The difference between the minimum IBI during inspiration and the maximum IBI during expiration, in seconds, was used to calculate RSA. The difference was computed twice for each respiration cycle; once for each inspiration and once for each expiration. Using this method, RSA was computed without being affected by arrhythmia due to baroreceptor, thermoregulation, and tonic shifts in heart rate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0956797612457381">1</xref></sup></p>

This procedure consists of a series of episodes in which the mother and her infant are separated and reunited. The procedure is designed to activate the infant’s attachment system (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612457381">Ainsworth et al., 1978</xref>, for a full description). This procedure was videotaped, and the tapes were coded by E. Carlson and L. A. Sroufe at the University of Minnesota. Eight percent of infants were classified as avoidant, 67% as secure, 5% as resistant, and 20% as disorganized.</p>

The IBQ-R consists of 191 items on 14 scales.

<title>Preliminary analyses</title>
<p>Relations between baseline RSA and temperament were examined to test the hypothesis that baseline RSA is reflective of both sensitivity to and engagement with environmental conditions. Baseline RSA was significantly and positively correlated with the following IBQ-R scales: Duration of Orienting, Perceptual Sensitivity, and Vocal Reactivity—these correlations provided support for our hypothesis (<italic>rs</italic> = .223–.229, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .05). To validate our measure of attachment security as an index of the type of environment in which the child was raised, we examined the relation between attachment security and cumulative risk. An independent-samples <italic>t</italic> test revealed that infants raised in an environment that fostered disorganization had risk indices that were significantly higher (<italic>M =</italic> 3.11, <italic>SD =</italic> 1.49) than the risk indices of infants raised in an environment that fostered security (<italic>M</italic> = 1.76, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.43), <italic>t</italic>(74) = −3.47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; this finding supports the theory that a disorganized attachment classification is reflective of an environment of greater instability during the early months of life than a secure attachment classification does.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0956797612457381">2</xref></sup> We then tested associations between baseline RSA and additional covariates.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The theory of differential susceptibility posits that some organisms are more susceptible than others to the positive and negative features of the environment; however, little is known about the early forms of differential susceptibility and whether these early markers of susceptibility are related to later problems in adaptation. This is the first study to identify a neurobiological marker of susceptibility that already by 5 months of life is sensitive to experience. These data both support and extend the theories of differential susceptibility and biological sensitivity to context in several important respects.</p>
<p>First, we have identified a physiological marker of susceptibility that is operational at 5 months when the stress response is forming and potentially most malleable to both negative <italic>and</italic> positive environmental input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612457381">Ellis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612457381">Pluess &amp; Belsky, 2011</xref>). Second, high baseline RSA has previously been conceptualized as a protective factor in environments of risk (e.g., marital conflict, prenatal substance exposure). When capitalizing on the full variability of environmental conditions—both positive and negative—we found instead that high baseline RSA may be better viewed as a susceptibility factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612457381">Belsky &amp; Pluess, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612457381">Ellis et al., 2011</xref>). Third, we have extended the theory of differential susceptibility by investigating whether infants with susceptible traits can reap the benefits of a positive caregiving environment despite living in poverty. Although all infants in this study were reared in poverty, those with high baseline RSA raised in caregiving environments that fostered disorganization fared worse than comparably susceptible infants raised in caregiving environments of security and infants with low baseline RSA who were reared in environments of disorganization.</p>
<p>Most surprising to us was the detection of a biobehavioral susceptibility factor that operated in a “for better and for worse” manner, despite sample-wide levels of significant socioeconomic disadvantage. Although born into disadvantaged conditions, infants with high baseline RSA who were raised in contexts of security were buffered from the deleterious effects of the broader environmental context. This finding supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612457381">Propper’s (2012)</xref> hypothesis that family functioning and support can mediate the effect of poverty on developmental outcomes, and it speaks to the idea that poverty is not a uniform stressor, particularly for children raised by nurturing caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797612457381">Miller et al., 2011</xref>). For the developing infant who is particularly susceptible to environmental influences (i.e., one who has high baseline RSA), the best possible environment is one of support, whereby the infant learns to regulate using a sensitive, responsive teacher. Presumably, this physiological susceptibility enables these infants to be more attuned to—and affected by—a sensitive caregiver who aids the infant to self-regulate despite being raised with fewer economic resources. In fact, our results suggest that infants with high baseline RSA who were raised in environments that fostered security had the lowest levels of problem behavior, even falling below the community norms reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612457381">Briggs-Gowan &amp; Carter, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, infants with high RSA who were raised in caregiving environments characterized as disorganized were faced with two obstacles: an insensitive caregiver and poverty. If high baseline RSA reflects greater engagement with the environment, then this group of infants were presumably more engaged with—and responsive to—negative parenting experiences. This engagement might have adaptive significance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612457381">Pluess and Belsky (2011)</xref> speculate that, in the context of exceptionally harmful environments, the neonate learns to allocate more attentional resources in the form of increased vigilance. Under such suboptimal rearing conditions, high baseline RSA may lead to the consolidation of coping strategies that portend problems later in development. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612457381">Ellis and colleagues (2011)</xref> argue that infants reared in stressful environments are not vulnerable or resilient per se, but instead learn to adapt—for better or for worse—to this harmful environment through increased vigilance, which may come at a cost, as evidenced by increased problem behavior. These infants are most likely deprived of the conditions needed to acquire and consolidate effective self-regulatory capacities. Instead, they might rely more heavily on maladaptive physiological mechanisms to regulate, which could lead to the chronic overactivation of these physiological systems and subsequent significant mental- and physical-health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0956797612457381">Shonkoff et al., 2009</xref>). By the time these infants become children, they will have to depend on maladaptive methods of coping, which could potentially lead to an increase in problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612457381">Fearon, Bakermans-Kraneburg, Van IJzendoorn, Lapsley, &amp; Roisman, 2010</xref>). In the sample analyzed in the present study, infants raised in environments that fostered a disorganized attachment with high baseline RSA fared the worst, as shown by problem-behavior scores that were far above clinical risk indices.</p>
<p>There were no differences in problem behavior among infants with low baseline RSA from either secure or disorganized caregiving environments. These infants typically are not as responsive to environmental variations—positive or negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612457381">Ellis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612457381">Pluess &amp; Belsky, 2011</xref>). In the present study, however, both groups of infants with low baseline RSA had problem-behavior scores that were above the mean for community samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612457381">Briggs-Gowan &amp; Carter, 2002</xref>); this finding suggests that they were exhibiting significant levels of problem behavior. Our results sharpen the theory of differential susceptibility by raising the possibility that less-susceptible infants can still be affected by broader environmental factors. For infants with low baseline RSA, poverty may be a more powerful predictor of problem behavior than the immediate parenting context. In this group of infants, the increased stress of living in poverty combined with a physiological profile that made them less susceptible to environmental influences may have affected their coping abilities, which resulted in higher levels of problem behavior.</p>
<p>Although this study provides some answers about how risk may be mitigated in contexts of poverty and whether physiological differential-susceptibility processes are at work in infancy, it also raises further questions. First, the durability of the independence between baseline RSA and quality of the early caregiving environment as indexed by attachment is unclear. Although the two were independent in this sample, it is possible that, with canalization and development, the association could become stronger. This reasoning fits with the theory of differential susceptibility; people are born with biological susceptibilities, but these susceptibilities might develop with environmental input and experience. If true, this is precisely the type of plasticity that developmentalists and interventionists are seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612457381">Boyce, 2006</xref>). Another limitation of these data is that we only had maternal report of infant temperament. Thus, laboratory observations of negative emotionality may be related to infant baseline RSA, a possibility that should be explored in future studies.</p>
<p>This study is the first to identify a biological marker of susceptibility to environmental influences in infancy, when the infant is learning through interactions with caregivers how to effectively respond and cope with environmental demands. High baseline RSA was predictive of later adaptation; it appeared to buffer certain infants from the effects of poverty if they were raised in contexts defined by supportive, sensitive caregiving. Among infants developing in the context of poverty, the ability to successfully adapt and regulate at biological and behavioral levels in response to a multitude of environmental pressures appears to differentiate children who develop more successfully from those who develop less successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797612457381">Propper, 2012</xref>). We believe that early identification and prevention of risk is of extreme importance given the plasticity of the neurobiological stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612457381">Beauchaine et al., 2008</xref>). By identifying those children who are most vulnerable to developing problem behavior given biological and environmental risk factors early in life, it may be possible to halt the progression of psychological disorder.</p>
