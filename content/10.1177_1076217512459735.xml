<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alicia Johnson sat at her desk and stared out her classroom window. It was Friday of the 3rd week of school and as she watched the children at Hoover Elementary School boarding the buses at the close of the day, she reflected on what she had observed in her classroom that week. She was feeling rather discouraged. She wondered why Mauricio and Ana Maria had been silent all week long. She was also troubled by Marisol’s lack of progress in language arts, yet she had noticed her writing short poems in Spanish in her journal. She thought back to how Alejandro’s eyes lit up each day when she announced that it was time for science, yet he had barely uttered 10 words since his arrival in her classroom. During her math lessons, she had noticed that Luis could calculate remarkably well, yet he was struggling to understand word problems. She saw that all five of these new children were well mannered and respectful, yet they seemed to shy away from the other children in the class. They sat together in the lunchroom and isolated themselves on the school playground at recess.</p>
<p>For the first time in her 12 years of teaching third graders, Alicia had a small contingent of Hispanic students in her classroom and she was feeling as though she was not able to connect with these new children. The community had experienced an influx of unskilled laborers from various regions of Mexico, and the local college had seen an increase in the number of Hispanic faculty members from South and Central American countries. With the arrival of these new families in the community, the population of students at Hoover Elementary School was changing, and Alicia Johnson wondered whether she was professionally equipped to address the challenges facing her new students. She sighed as she watched the school buses pulling out from the front of the building and decided that she would put this issue aside and begin to focus on her weekend plans.</p>

<p>“High-quality children’s literature and picture book biographies of Hispanics enable educators to address the social and emotional . . . Hispanic children.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Sitting at her desk and reviewing her grocery shopping list for the week, she was interrupted by her colleague Marissa Kirkwood as she swept into Alicia’s classroom with her characteristic smile and undying energy. Marissa was a new teacher at Hoover Elementary School that year who was hired to facilitate an innovative program for second language learners. Although Alicia found Marissa a bit overwhelming at times, she recognized that this young new colleague had much to offer the faculty and staff at Hoover. She set aside her grocery list, turned to Marissa, and said, “Oh, how I need your help!” She went on to describe her observations of the Hispanic children in her classroom and asked for her colleague’s advice. Marissa responded with an understanding smile and assured Alicia that she would help her in any way she could. She also shared a collection of picture books in her classroom that Alicia might want to consider infusing into her third grade curriculum. Marissa explained, “One of the best things you can do for these children is to let them know that you realize that they are smart and that you value them in your classroom.” “By sharing these picture books featuring Hispanic children and having discussions about the children in the stories, you will be creating an atmosphere in your classroom that is supportive and inviting.” As Alicia listened quietly to Marissa, she felt encouraged. She put aside her thoughts on her grocery shopping and followed Marissa to her classroom. As she left the building that day, she carried a large stack of Marissa’s picture books that included inspirational stories about Hispanic children and biographies of Hispanic individuals. She planned to study them over the weekend and think seriously about how she would incorporate them into her teaching.</p>

<p>The scenario above highlights an important challenge facing elementary grade teachers. The discussion below addresses this challenge by presenting scholarly literature that examines the need to understand the issues that gifted Hispanic students face in school. Following that discussion, methods of using children’s literature and picture book biographies to honor the cultural backgrounds of Hispanic children and to support their social and emotional development are discussed. An annotated bibliography of high-quality picture books featuring Hispanic children along with picture book biographies of prominent Hispanics is provided, and two sample lesson plans are presented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1076217512459735">
<title>Related Literature</title>
<p>Hispanics are now the largest (41.3 million), fastest growing, and youngest minority group in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1076217512459735">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>). Current projections are that within the next two decades, Hispanics will comprise one fourth of all public school students in this country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1076217512459735">Suarez-Orozco &amp; Paez, 2002</xref>). In addition, Hispanics are more likely to live in poverty and less likely to graduate from high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217512459735">Blanco-Vega, Castro-Olivio, &amp; Merrell, 2008</xref>). Drop-out rates for Hispanic students are overwhelmingly large as well, having the greatest drop-out rate when compared with other racial/ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1076217512459735">National Center for Education Statistics, 2010</xref>). Hispanic students, therefore, are a population that needs our attention.</p>
<p>Hispanics include a diverse group of people from 22 Spanish-speaking countries throughout the world. Hispanic is derived from the Latin word <italic>Hispania</italic> and describes people who trace their origins to Spain and Spanish-speaking countries of South America, Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. They include immigrants and native born (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1076217512459735">Castellano, 2004</xref>). The census bureau notes that people who identify their origin as Hispanic may be of any race; therefore, Hispanic refers to ethnic background and not race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1076217512459735">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>). The terms <italic>Hispanic</italic> and <italic>Latino</italic> are commonly used as synonyms. Latinos, however, are people of Latin American origin, including those who do not speak Spanish. The term <italic>Latino</italic> is considered more inclusive, and an attempt to dissociate from Spain, and preferences over usage of these terms vary from person to person.</p>
<p>Many Hispanics share a common language and many common traditions, including religious beliefs and practices, family structure, and dietary customs but are nonetheless a very heterogeneous group. This makes generalizations about this group difficult to assume. Hispanic children will differ in attitudes and beliefs as a result of the interaction with their families, their culture of origin, and the American culture.</p>

<sec id="section3-1076217512459735">
<title>Issues Central to the Well-Being of Gifted Hispanic Children</title>
<p>The following discussion examines scholarly literature on Hispanic children and addresses several issues that are central to their social and emotional well-being. They include being bilingual, being bicultural, ethnic identity, pride in one’s culture, the importance of <italic>la familia</italic>, the need for supportive adult relationships, and having a sense of belonging in school.</p>
<sec id="section4-1076217512459735">
<title>Being Bilingual</title>
<p>Many students of Hispanic descent are bilingual, but not all. For those who are, being encouraged to speak their native language can be beneficial for their self-esteem and academic achievement. Bilingualism and maintenance of the home language play a very important part in children’s social and emotional development and contributes to the development of resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1076217512459735">Oades-Sese &amp; Esquivel, 2006</xref>). In addition, code switching, defined as the use of more than one language in conversation, is often viewed as an indicator of giftedness. This ability is thought to be a sign of greater cognitive and social flexibility, and maintaining one’s native language is understood to be beneficial for cognitive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1076217512459735">Hughes, Shaunessy, Brice, Ratliff, &amp; McHatton, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1076217512459735">
<title>Being Bicultural</title>
<p>Being bicultural is defined as maintaining certain skills from one’s original culture while learning new skills from a new culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217512459735">Blanco-Vega et al., 2008</xref>). Researchers have indicated that children who adjust to a new culture while retaining their cultural heritage are more adaptive and experience greater school success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1076217512459735">Kaplan, Turner, Piotkrowski, &amp; Silber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1076217512459735">Smokowski, Buchanan, &amp; Bacallao, 2009</xref>). Students from diverse cultures, therefore, should be encouraged to learn the new culture without entirely replacing their original culture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1076217512459735">
<title>Ethnic Identity and Being Proud of One’s Culture</title>
<p>Having a positive image of one’s culture can also positively influence self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1076217512459735">Castellano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1076217512459735">Gándara, 2005</xref>). Ethnic identity is typically based on cultural affiliations, including language, country of origin, and religion. Individuals with a positive ethnic identity have a positive view of their culture of origin, appreciate their membership to the group, are familiar with its history and culture, and follow cultural practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1076217512459735">Worrell, 2007</xref>). Research has indicated that understanding one’s ethnic identity supports positive self-esteem in Hispanic children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1076217512459735">Worrell, 2007</xref>); therefore, it becomes important to acknowledge the specific cultural traditions and practices specific to each group and appreciate those differences, while also celebrating the cultural characteristics that are commonly shared.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1076217512459735">
<title>La Familia</title>
<p>Hispanic culture values close relationships, cohesiveness, and cooperation with family members. Family always comes first. Researchers have noted that <italic>la familia</italic> is the most powerful protective force for many Hispanic children, and family involvement has a positive influence on their social and emotional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076217512459735">Altschul, Oyserman, &amp; Bybee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1076217512459735">Smokowski et al., 2009</xref>). Hispanic children are taught and encouraged to be best friends with siblings, cousins, and other extended family members of their age group. Moreover, making their families proud can be a great motivator for these students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1076217512459735">
<title>Need for Supportive Adult Relationships</title>
<p>All students benefit from having positive relationships with their teachers, so it is no surprise that such encouragement has been associated with better academic outcomes for Hispanic students. Researchers have found that encouragement from teachers and other adults had a direct positive association with academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1076217512459735">Martinez, DeGarmo, &amp; Eddy, 2004</xref>). A lack of trust and confidence in teachers inhibits Hispanic students to ask for help when needed. Educators who maintain a good rapport and supportive relationships with Hispanic children while serving as their advocates are critical to their success in school.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1076217512459735">
<title>Sense of Belonging in School</title>
<p>Children are more successful in environments where they feel appreciated. Schools may be one of the only sources that children who have recently immigrated to this country have to learn traditional social and cultural aspects of American life. Hispanic students who immigrate to this country and are able to adapt to their new school setting are more likely to experience healthy social and emotional well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217512459735">Blanco-Vega et al., 2008</xref>). Researchers have indicated that for Hispanic children who have immigrated to the United States, the longer amount of time in the country is often an advantage when forming a bond with their new school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1076217512459735">Smokowski et al., 2009</xref>). Hispanic children who feel more comfortable and welcome to express their cultural values in school have contact with staff who are bilingual, bicultural, or value such traits are more likely to feel like they are a part of the school. Schools that support Hispanic cultural values can help these students’ experience a sense of school belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217512459735">Blanco-Vega et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Using Books That Guide and Inspire</title>
<p>Educators such as Alicia Johnson and Marissa Kirkwood are teachers who want to do what is best for gifted Hispanic children. Alicia left her school on Friday armed with a large collection of picture books featuring Hispanic children. She also had selected several picture book biographies of prominent Hispanic individuals. She would work hard to make meaningful connections between her students and the picture books Marissa had helped her discover. Good teachers like Marissa have long maintained that authentic interactions with literature contribute to overall social and emotional well-being. Such an approach is referred to as <italic>bibliotherapy</italic>, defined as the use of reading to bring about affective change and promote personality growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1076217512459735">Lenkowsky, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Alicia realized that the time was right for her to make an affective connection with the five Hispanic children in her classroom. She saw this approach as an opportunity to guide and inspire them. As a teacher, she could facilitate good discussions with her third graders. In doing so, she could help them draw parallels between their experiences and those of the main characters in the picture books or biographies she would offer them. She could also help them listen to their classroom peers as they shared their feelings about personal experiences related to the focus of the picture book lesson. Alicia would simply attempt to help her students understand themselves and cope with the challenges in their lives by providing them stories relevant to their personal situations and developmental needs as young children.</p>
<p>Teachers of gifted students using this approach believe that reading can influence thinking and behavior, and that guided discussions centered on selected picture books can focus on specific needs of children. In conducting such discussions with her students, Alicia could focus on issues that many gifted students experience more intensely and in different ways. Moreover, she could select to focus on issues that were particularly important for her Hispanic students. For example, literature can help young children appreciate their emotional sensitivity and intensity, and when Alicia prepared to facilitate a discussion of a picture book centered on pride in one’s cultural background, she would be able to provide an outlet for that sensitivity within her Hispanic students. Other important topics might include the importance of family support, being proud of being able to speak more than one language, feeling at home in school, and important adults in our lives who can support us in developing our talents.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1076217512459735">Halsted (2009)</xref> maintained that literature can engage gifted students emotionally. The therapeutic experience begins when children select a book and discover characters very similar to themselves. This interaction is known as identification, and the more the children have in common with the people they meet in books, the stronger the identification becomes. With that identification comes a sense of tension relief, or catharsis, a feeling that lets young children know that they are not alone in facing a challenge in their lives. As they join their classmates in the enjoyment of the story, they learn vicariously through the book’s characters. As a result of the healthy class discussion that follows, they gain new ways of looking at troublesome issues and develop insight. With this new understanding, changes in behavior may evolve as they confront real-life situations similar to those experienced by the book’s characters. Teachers who use this approach acknowledge that the selected book, in and of itself, is not therapeutic. The therapeutic effect depends on the response of the readers to the literature as it is facilitated through group discussion, and that change takes place within the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1076217512459735">Hynes &amp; Hynes-Berry, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Alicia Johnson realized that in the discussions of the picture books she would select, the goal of the discussion was to have the children share their feelings and listen closely to themselves as well as each other. Her goal was to have the children leave the classroom with an awareness that others have experienced the same feelings. She wanted all of her third graders including her Hispanic students to understand the universality of experience—a feeling of “we are in this together.”</p>
<p>Marissa helped Alicia to understand that in facilitating such discussions, she would need to incorporate meaningful follow-up activities. She realized that in conducting enjoyable follow-up activities, the children would be more apt to continue their discussion among themselves about the issues talked about earlier with the larger group. As they engaged in the activities, they would have the opportunity to continue to provide each other with supportive feedback. Follow-up activities that Alicia could consider offering her students might include creative writing, journaling, writing song lyrics, designing television commercials, role-playing, cartooning and other art activities, or self-selected options for children to pursue individually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1076217512459735">Hébert &amp; Kent, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to selecting fictional stories, Marissa encouraged Alicia to consider infusing picture book biographies of prominent Hispanic individuals into the curriculum. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1076217512459735">Fears-Floyd and Hébert (2010)</xref> highlighted several benefits of using biographies with culturally diverse students. They indicated how important it is that all children see themselves as students with high potential, and through exposure to biographies, young gifted Hispanic children are provided mirror images of themselves. Exploring the life stories of individuals who look like them enables gifted Hispanic students to become more connected to the classroom curriculum. They also pointed out that biographies help to inspire and motivate young children. As Hispanic children study the lives of people who overcame serious adversity, reached high levels of achievement, and made important contributions to society, they should draw parallels to their lives and recognize their potential to do the same. Fears-Floyd and Hébert also highlighted how the use of literature and biographies focusing on diverse populations benefits all students. As children of various ethnicities and races interact in a classroom, it is essential that they see not only themselves but one another as all having equally high potential. As we saw in the opening scenario, Marissa Kirkwood recognized this and supported her colleague Alicia Johnson. She understood that they would be shortchanging all students at Hoover Elementary School if they did not provide education about the multicultural society in which we live.</p>
<p>Alicia left school that Friday afternoon with renewed energy and a commitment to address the needs of her new Hispanic students. She had enjoyed her search through Marissa’s collection of picture books. As she browsed through the collection, Marissa kept saying, “You’ll want to touch their hearts.” When Alicia questioned what she meant by this, Marissa helped her to reflect on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1076217512459735">Charles Smith’s (1986)</xref> reminder to teachers when using books therapeutically. He points out that children trust their teachers when they select books, and therefore teachers must be aware of their influence. He explains, “Along with this trust comes a responsibility for the teacher to select books of great worth that provide rich metaphors and help children understand themselves and others, books that touch the heart” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1076217512459735">Smith, 1986</xref>, p. 45). To support educators in their search for high-quality children’s literature that addresses the needs of gifted Hispanic students, we include an annotated bibliography (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1076217512459735">Appendix A</xref>) of picture books featuring Hispanic children that are appropriate for the elementary classroom. We also provide a collection of picture book biographies of prominent Hispanics (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1076217512459735">Appendix B</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1076217512459735">
<title>Sample Lessons</title>
<p>In our search for children’s picture books featuring Hispanic children, we discovered many high-quality books that would enable educators to easily design appropriate lessons using the approach we have described. In designing a lesson, educators will want to consider a few helpful strategies to facilitate the lesson. First, we recommend that teachers plan a menu of 10 to 12 discussion questions to use in facilitating the conversation with children. It may also be helpful to have significant passages in the book actually bookmarked should teachers decide to use them as prompts for discussion. In designing the menu of questions, we believe it is important to begin the discussion with nonthreatening questions that simply have the children explain the events that took place in the story. Following this, teachers will want to incorporate questions that link the children to the book’s main characters. After drawing the parallels between the students and the characters in the book, teachers will need to ask the more sensitive questions that evoke emotional feelings within the children as they discuss the significant lessons they have learned from the literature. Following the discussion, teachers will want to provide sufficient time for students to enjoy follow-up activities through which they continue to process through their feelings, represent their understanding of the important lessons learned, and provide support to each other as they continue to chat about the book. Below are sample lessons using picture books from our collection; the first features a selection of fiction, and the second lesson presents an inspirational biography.</p>

<title>Lesson 1: <italic>Tomás and the Library Lady</italic></title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1076217512459735">Pat Mora’s (2000)</xref> <italic>Tomás and the Library Lady</italic> is an inspirational story of Tomás, a young child from a family of migrant workers who travel throughout the country helping farmers harvest their crops. While traveling with his family, Tomás enjoys his beloved grandfather’s colorful stories and is able to recite them by heart. His grandfather encourages him to go in search of new stories to tell and sends him to explore the public library in town. When he visits the local library, Tomás befriends a librarian who nurtures his passion for learning more about dinosaurs and wild jungle animals. While his family spends their day in the fields, Tomás spends his time devouring books and then entertaining his family in the evenings with many new stories he has to share from his reading. As a result of his days spent in the library, he develops a warm friendship with the library lady and teaches her to speak Spanish. When it is time for his family to move on, the library lady presents Tomás with his first shiny new book. His grandfather is now more proud than ever of his grandson, the family’s new storyteller.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076217512459735">Veronica Chambers’ (2007)</xref> <italic>Celia Cruz, Queen of Salsa</italic> offers young children a realistic glimpse into the difficult childhood of Celia Cruz. The author not only describes Celia’s early life growing up in an overcrowded household but also highlights her love of learning, her dedication to music, and her devotion to her country. As a child in Havana, Celia became known as a songbird who mesmerized her neighbors with her sweet sounding voice. Although her father advised her to focus on her studies, one of her teachers encouraged her to pursue her passion for music and compete in music contests. Her melodious voice led her to international fame as the most influential female salsa singer and performer of her time.</p>
