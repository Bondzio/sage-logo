<p>The Brundtland Report of 1987 defined sustainability as the achievement of ecological integrity, economic well-being, and social justice. If we accept this definition, then how does culture fit into the picture? In this ambitious book Sacha Kagan begins by proposing that culture – defined both as art forms and as sets of norms and values – can play an important role in moving us toward an alternative worldview based on complexity and a systems-oriented approach. In the chapters that follow, Kagan provides both the theoretical grounding for this thesis and examples from the world of contemporary art of how artists are experimenting with environmental art and working toward social change.</p>
<p>Kagan sees modernity as representing a culture of unsustainability. Following Ervin Laszlo, he believes a philosophical divide exists between classical modernity, with its worldview that saw objects and people as separate from each other and their environments, and a more systems-oriented approach emphasizing connections and communication between people and between people and nature. As an important manifestation of classical modernity, the world of high art has contributed to this unsustainable culture in its own way. First, it has promulgated the idea of a romantic order in which artists are viewed as extremely gifted people engaged in creating works of ‘sublime purposelessness’. This appreciation of the individual artist is then paired with a view of the institution of art as a technological system that treats art as autonomous from the rest of society. As a result, the world of high art has become, for Kagan, ‘a romantic ghetto, an escapist pressure-valve regulating the tensions created by formal rationality’s structural hold on modern and hypermodern societies’ (p. 70).</p>
<p>Kagan sees systems theory, complexity theory, and transdisciplinarity as providing the theoretical frame for an alternative to this culture of unsustainability. The chapter on systems theory is devoted largely to the work of Fritjof Capra, who, as a physicist and founding director of the Center for Ecoliteracy in Berkeley, drew out connections between the systems view of life in the sciences, which views living systems as networks characterized by metabolism and membranes, and a systems view of society in which organizations are considered as living and learning beings; in this thesis the importance of networks, communication, and cybernetics is emphasized.</p>
<p>Systems theorizing makes specific contributions to thinking about sustainability, most importantly in seeing it as the property of an entire web of relations. Complexity theory, as put forward in the work of Edgar Morin, goes further in this direction by exploring the interconnections among disorder and order, interactions, and organizations. Nature exhibits relationships that can be at one and the same time complementary, concurrent, and antagonistic. Transdisciplinarity, a theoretical tendency that has been gaining in popularity, continues along the same lines by eschewing any unitary theory and emphasizing instead the coexisting and intersecting levels of reality. The upshot of all this, for Kagan, is that there can be no one ‘culture of sustainability’ nor even a ‘multiplicity of cultures of sustainability’. Instead, he writes, ‘Sustainability requires a diversity of cultures of sustainability, but also a common set of characteristics which are common to these cultures, i.e., a culture-on-a-meta-level, a meta culture with its characteristics of sustainability’ (p. 212). He also proposes the concept of <italic>autoecopoïesis</italic>, which refers both to a system’s ability to exhibit relative autonomy by participating in its own reconstruction (‘auto’) and to do so in the context of open communications and co-evolution with its environment (‘eco’).</p>
<p>Before moving on to considering actual art works and artistic tendencies that might correspond to these abstract concepts, Kagan adds another theoretical chapter, one focused on aesthetic issues. He takes his cue from John Dewey’s emphasis on aesthetics as not inherent in the object but rather as relating to lived experience. He draws as well on anthropologist Gregory Bateson’s search for <italic>the</italic> pattern that connects different life forms and processes (though, given his emphasis on complexity, Kagan prefers ‘patterns’ to ‘pattern’). Overall, this chapter makes the argument that ‘The contribution of art to a culture of sustainability is to be found especially in its potential to create experience, make relationships, [and] expand mental activity beyond the linear confines of purposive consciousness’ (p. 218).</p>
<p>With the stage thus set, Kagan turns to present a range of art works and tendencies that lay claim to ecological aesthetics or seek to raise awareness of sustainability issues. In Chapter 5 he considers some of the precursors and pioneers of what has become known as environmental or ecological art even as he demonstrates that there is no explicit agreement on what constitutes one or the other. Indeed, the specific examples provide a sense of the quite different directions these artistic tendencies may take. For example, US visual artist Alan Sonfist has experimented with growing micro-organisms and staging natural environments in the un-natural settings of art galleries, while prominent German artist Joseph Beuys has explored the connection between humans and nature in his performance art by, for example, swimming through swamps to draw attention to the value of endangered marshes and spending several weeks locked up with a coyote in a New York gallery. The work of US artist Mierle Laderman Ukeles, considered a form of ‘social-ecological art intervention’, emphasizes the art and importance of maintenance in its personal, social, and ecological dimensions. In 1979 and 1980, for example, she performed her ‘Touch Sanitation’ project, which involved shaking the hands of 8500 New York City sanitation workers and saying ‘Thank you for keeping New York City alive’. Lynne Hull takes quite a different direction. Seeing her clients as including hawks, spider monkeys, bees, frogs, bats, and a host of other species, Hull tries to create art works that improve their lives. Sometimes this has involved creating etchings in rock surfaces in deserts that also serve to provide water or snow-melt for animals to drink; at other times she has created habitat sculptures to help restore habitats damaged by human activities. Kagan draws heavily on the writings of ecologically minded art critic Suzi Gablik to make sense of the common currents and ecological commitments in this great diversity of activity, but questions whether or not the work and related criticism succeed in developing an overall ‘aesthetics of complexity’ (p. 343).</p>
<p>In contrast to the historical development of environmental/ecological art discussed in Chapter 5, Chapter 6 focuses specifically on developments within the past decade. The time frame is narrower but the sweep is broader as Kagan discusses how sustainability and ecology have become keywords used by many artists who might not necessarily be identified as ecological artists. He shows how these two keywords have been translated into themes of desire, newness, power, nature, globalism, and even ‘death, dirt, and decay’. As an example of the last theme, Catherine Chalmers stages cockroach executions, placing single cockroaches in miniature electric chairs or pretend burnings at the stake, in order to ‘further reflections about the human–cockroach relationship’ (p. 361). Kagan is rightly dubious about the ecological impact of such creations, and even more critical about a number of well-publicized exhibitions mounted during the decade such as the so-called ‘post-environmental art’ Greenwashing exhibition mounted in Turin in 2008.</p>
<p>Do any of these works result in anything more than critical insights shared among the ecological and environmental artists? The final chapter takes up the question of whether these art forms have the potential to create social change. Kagan focuses on the potential role of artists as cultural entrepreneurs capable of encouraging others to question conventions. In particular, he promotes the concept of a ‘double entrepreneurship’ through which artists break out of conventions within their particular art worlds while challenging larger social conventions. While the potential for change is clearly there, the reader is left wondering about how real and widespread the impact of ecological and environmental art is outside the particular art worlds. For example, Philip Smith has argued in a colloquium presentation (Stony Brook University, 23 March 2011) that exhibitions such as those discussed by Kagan have a very shallow impact, compared to, for example Al Gore’s film <italic>An Inconvenient Truth</italic>, whose fame derives in no small measure from Gore’s personal saga. In his conclusion, Kagan argues that, ‘The degree to which specific art projects/interventions can be transformative . . . is a difficult question which, at best, can only be assessed on a case-by-case basis and qualitatively’ (p. 470).</p>
<p><italic>Art and Sustainability</italic> is thus a dense book rich in theoretical argumentation and illustrative examples. It is unfortunate, however, that the text is accompanied neither by illustrations of some of the art nor by an index. Nevertheless, this is an important book by someone with an impressive depth of knowledge in the field and that should serve to inspire further research and debate.</p>
