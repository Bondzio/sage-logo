<abstract>
<p>Social support for adolescent mothers, particularly from mother figures, can buffer risks and promote well-being. To date, no longitudinal research has investigated how the dimensions of social support may change during the transition from pregnancy to parenthood for adolescent mothers. This study examined stability and change in dimensions of social support from the third trimester of pregnancy to 2 years postpartum among 191 dyads of Mexican-origin adolescent first-time mothers and their mother figures. Perceptions of social support received from a mother figure shifted from a single dimension (i.e., global support) to three distinct factors (instrumental, emotional, and companionship support) during this transition; however, social support provision as reported by mother figures remained stable. Measurement equivalence was established across interview language (English and Spanish) and across two time points postpartum. Bivariate correlations provided support for the convergent and divergent validity of these measures. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.</p>

<p>Adolescent mothers disproportionately experience low educational attainment and are more likely to live in poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0739986312470636">Hoffman, 2008</xref>); furthermore, their children are at risk for poorer developmental and health outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739986312470636">Borkowski et al., 2002</xref>). More important, social support may promote well-being and buffer risks associated with adolescent parenthood, ameliorating future disadvantage for these teens. Although social support is conceptualized in many different ways, for the purposes of this article it includes an array of interpersonal supporting behaviors, including emotional, tangible, cognitive guidance, positive feedback, social reinforcement, and social participation. Research on social support with adult mothers suggests that social support is related to fewer mental health problems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0739986312470636">Dunkel-Schetter, Sagrestano, Feldman, &amp; Killingsworth, 1996</xref>). Similarly, research with adolescent mothers suggests that social support from parental figures is associated with better mental health, more positive educational outcomes, and more effective parenting practices (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0739986312470636">Gordon, Chase-Lansdale, Matjasko, &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0739986312470636">Kalil, Spencer, Spieker, &amp; Gilchrist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0739986312470636">Sadler, Anderson, &amp; Sabatelli, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Mexican-origin adolescent mothers, in particular, are an important subpopulation to study given that women of Mexican origin have the highest national adolescent birthrate in the United States (88.7 per 1,000 women; Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention, 2011). Thus, understanding potential buffers of risk for this population—and establishing good-quality measurement for this work—is important for intervention development. Similarly, understanding the nature of social support from mother figures is particularly important for this population because <italic>mother figures</italic> are frequently identified as a salient source of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0739986312470636">Contreras, Mangelsdorf, Rhodes, Diener, &amp; Brunson, 1999</xref>). Recent work involved the development of a measure of social support from mother figures during pregnancy for Mexican-origin adolescents that was developed in both Spanish and English and assesses support from the perspective of multiple reporters (Global Support From Mother Figure During Pregnancy Scale [GSMF-P]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739986312470636">Umaña-Taylor, Updegraff, White, Herzog, Pflieger, &amp; Madden-Derdich, 2011</xref>). However, this six-item measure is cross-sectionally limited to the social support received during pregnancy and does not examine how dimensions of social support may change after the transition to parenthood.</p>
<p>Given that parenthood likely includes different stressors and needs compared to pregnancy for adolescent mothers, identifying whether the dimensions of social support (e.g., emotional, instrumental, or practical companionship) differ or remain constant throughout this critical transition period as reported by both adolescents <italic>and</italic> their mother figures is of particular interest. For instance, drawing from the literature on adult mothers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0739986312470636">Cutrona (1984)</xref> found that adult mothers reported lower levels of three dimensions of social support in their third trimester of pregnancy compared to 1 year postpartum: Mothers reported lower levels of reassurance of worth (persons’ skills and abilities are acknowledged), attachment (sense of security and safety), and social integration (a network of relationships joined by shared interests). More important, these results point to the need to examine whether and how dimensions of social support change during this transition; however, the scale used to measure social support in Cutrona’s study of <italic>adult</italic> mothers was a global measure that was intended to assess support received from multiple providers (e.g., a partner or spouse, parent(s), grandparents(s), friends), rather than specifically from a mother figure. Moreover, the study by Cutrona assumed that the measurement structure of social support was equivalent across time (i.e., pre- and post-partum) and did not specifically examine whether or not the actual dimensions of social support differentiated during the transition to parenthood. In another study, researchers found that the summed score of eight possible types of social support from parents during the transition to parenthood remained relatively stable for adult mothers; however, this study used a <italic>total</italic> score for possible types of support instead of examining whether these eight dimensions of support changed over the course of the transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0739986312470636">Goldstein, Diener, &amp; Mangelsdorf, 1996</xref>). That is, even though Goldstein and colleagues collected information about eight different types of support (e.g., emotional support, practical support), this information was summed instead of examined separately by type of support. Thus, research is needed that (a) focuses on how the dimensions of social support from mother figures may differentiate (or remain stable) during the transition to parenthood for adolescents and (b) examines this transition among Mexican-origin adolescent mothers given their heightened risk for teenage pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0739986312470636">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, given the salient role that family plays in Mexican culture, including an emphasis on family members as a prominent source of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739986312470636">Cauce &amp; Domenech-Rodríguez, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0739986312470636">Umaña-Taylor &amp; Updegraff, 2013</xref>), understanding mother figure support during this transition period is a particularly important focus of study.</p>
<p>The current study examined two waves of data from an ongoing longitudinal study of Mexican-origin adolescent mothers that were collected postpartum and builds on initial cross-sectional work that was limited to examination of the GSMF-P scale during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739986312470636">Umaña-Taylor et al., 2011</xref>) to examine (a) whether dimensions of perceived social support when infants were 10 months old (Wave 2) were similar to the social support measure that was originally developed during the third trimester of pregnancy (Wave 1, GSMF-P; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739986312470636">Umaña-Taylor et al., 2011</xref>), and (b) whether the measurement of social support established postpartum (Wave 2) remained stable when the child was 24 months old (Wave 3).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we examined the convergent (i.e., whether the measure is correlated with another construct in theoretically consistent ways) and divergent validity (i.e., whether the measure is uncorrelated with another construct when there is no conceptual reason for an association) of the finalized measures (adolescent and mother figure reports) of social support at Wave 2 and Wave 3. Given that previous research demonstrates positive associations between social support and psychosocial adjustment and a negative association between social support and engagement in risky behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0739986312470636">Kuo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0739986312470636">Reid &amp; Meadows-Oliver, 2007</xref>), we utilized adolescent-reported assessments of depressive symptoms, self-esteem, and engagement in risky behavior to assess convergent validity for adolescent reports of social support. To assess the convergent validity of mother figure reports of social support, we utilized mother-reported assessments of the parent–adolescent relationships (i.e., warmth/acceptance) and familism, given that previous research has established positive associations among these constructs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739986312470636">Borcherding, SmithBattle, &amp; Schneider, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0739986312470636">Garcia-Preto, 1996</xref>). To assess discriminant validity for both adolescent and mother figure reports, we utilized assessments of adolescent-reported ethnic identity centrality, given that there is no conceptual reason to expect an association between these variables for either reporter.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>The current study utilized data from Waves 1 through 3 of an ongoing community-based longitudinal study of 204 Mexican-origin adolescent mothers and their mother figures (e.g., mother, grandmother). Because the current study focuses on the transition to parenthood, we limited the sample to include only dyads where the adolescent became a mother for the first time at Wave 1 of the study (<italic>n</italic> = 191). At Wave 1, adolescents were on average 16.19 years old (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.97, range = 15-18 years), and their mother figures were on average 40.78 years old (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.78, range = 21-78 years). Most adolescents were born in the United States (63.4%), whereas 68.6% of the mother figures were born in Mexico. The average household income of the adolescents (as reported by mother figures) was US$27,951 annually (<italic>SD</italic> = US$20,186), ranging from US$94 to US$114,000. Approximately 18% (<italic>n</italic> = 35) of the adolescents were employed, and their average hourly wage was US$6.91 (<italic>SD</italic> = US$3.53). Most of the adolescents (88.0%) coresided with their mother figures at Wave 1.</p>

<sec id="section3-0739986312470636">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Adolescents were recruited from community agencies and schools in a Southwestern urban region of the United States to participate in the study during their third trimester of pregnancy. Eligibility criteria for the study included that adolescents (ages 15-18) identify as Mexican origin, be pregnant, not be legally married, and have a mother figure who was also willing to participate in the study. Adolescents and their mother figures were interviewed separately and each interview lasted approximately 2.5 hr. Interviews were conducted in either Spanish (adolescents = 37%, mother figures = 69%) or English. Wave 1 interviews were conducted when the adolescent was in her third trimester of pregnancy (i.e., average of 30.79 weeks of pregnancy; <italic>SD</italic> = 4.49), Wave 2 interviews occurred when the adolescent’s child was 10 months old, and Wave 3 interviews took place when the child was 24 months old. Adolescents and their mother figures each received US$25 for participation in the home interviews at Wave 1, US$30 at Wave 2, and US$35 at Wave 3. The study protocol was approved by the university’s institutional review board. Nearly 98% of dyads were retained from Wave 1 to Wave 2, and 89% of the dyads were retained from Wave 1 to Wave 3, with at least one member continuing to participate in the study.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>Social support from mother figures was assessed from the perspective of <italic>both</italic> adolescents and mother figures with an adapted version of the 29-item GSMF-P Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739986312470636">Umaña-Taylor et al., 2011</xref>). At Wave 1, the items assessed support in relation to <italic>pregnancy</italic>; thus, the adaptation for Wave 2 involved changing the items to be relevant to support in relation to <italic>parenting</italic>. For example, for adolescents, the item, “I could get help related to my <italic>pregnancy</italic> from (my mom/mother figure name), such as a ride to the doctor or clothes for the baby,” asked at Wave 1 became, “I could get help related to my <italic>parenting</italic> from (my mom/mother figure name), such as a ride to the doctor or clothes for the baby,” at Wave 2. Items were rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 5 = <italic>very much</italic>. Wave 3 items were identical to Wave 2 items.</p>
<p>Convergent and divergent validity were tested using the following measures assessed at Wave 2: adolescent-reported depressive symptoms (20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression [CES-D] Scale; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0739986312470636">Radloff, 1977</xref>; α = .87), adolescent-reported self-esteem (10-item Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739986312470636">Rosenberg, 1979</xref>; α = .81), adolescent-reported engagement in risky behaviors (24-items; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0739986312470636">Eccles &amp; Barber, 1990</xref>; α = .89), adolescent-reported ethnic centrality (five items; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739986312470636">Fuligni, Witcow, &amp; Garcia, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739986312470636">Sellers, Rowley, Chavous, Shelton, &amp; Smith, 1997</xref>; α = .66), mother figure reports of warmth/acceptance toward the adolescent (eight-item short form of the Parental Behavior Inventory; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0739986312470636">Schwarz, Barton-Henry, &amp; Pruzinsky, 1985</xref>; α = .78), and mother figure reports of familism values (16-item subscale of the Mexican American Cultural Values Scale; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739986312470636">Knight et al., 2010</xref>; α = .82).</p>
<p>Two separate bilingual individuals translated all measures into Spanish and then back-translated them into English. Discrepancies that arose during this process were resolved following guidelines outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0739986312470636">Knight, Roosa, and Umaña-Taylor (2009)</xref>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section6-0739986312470636">
<title>Analytic Approach</title>
<p>The first step of the analysis used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test whether the unidimensional six-item structure of the GSMF-P scale that was identified at Wave 1<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0739986312470636">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739986312470636">Umaña-Taylor et al., 2011</xref>), when the adolescent was in her third trimester of pregnancy, adequately fit the data at Wave 2, when the target child was 10 months old. Because this initial step did not result in acceptable model fit, we then conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with geomin rotation, using procedures discussed in the initial publication of the scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739986312470636">Umaña-Taylor et al., 2011</xref>), to identify the best-fitting structure of social support at Wave 2 for both adolescents and mother figures. After Wave 2 measurement was established for both reporters, measurement equivalence by language of interview (English or Spanish) and the longitudinal equivalence of measurement from Wave 2 to Wave 3, when the target child was 24 months, were examined. Tests of language and longitudinal equivalence provide a stringent evaluation of a measure, which is particularly important when conducting work with different language versions of a measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0739986312470636">Knight et al., 2009</xref>) and in developmental studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0739986312470636">Hofer, Thorvaldsson, &amp; Piccinn, 2012</xref>). All analyses were conducted in Mplus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0739986312470636">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2010</xref>). After final measurement models were derived, we examined the validity of the measures via bivariate correlations.</p>
<p>Multiple indices were used to assess model fit, including the chi-square statistic, comparative fit index (CFI), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). Overall, model fit was considered good (or acceptable) when the chi-square statistic was not significant, when the CFI was greater than or equal to 0.95 (0.90), or when the RMSEA value was less than or equal to 0.05 (0.08; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739986312470636">Kline, 2011</xref>). Measurement equivalence by language of interview and the longitudinal equivalence of measurement from Wave 2 to Wave 3 were tested by establishing the tenability of invariance constraints (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0739986312470636">Little, Card, Slegers, &amp; Ledford, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0739986312470636">Little, Preacher, Selig, &amp; Card, 2007</xref>). Three levels of invariance were examined: configural invariance, loading invariance, and intercept invariance (described in depth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0739986312470636">Little, Card et al., 2007</xref>). Tests of invariance were evaluated by examining the change in chi-square statistic (where a nonsignificant change in chi-square suggests that the constraints are tenable) and the change in CFI (&lt;0.01 is acceptable; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739986312470636">Kline, 2011</xref>). Missing data were handled using full information maximum likelihood (FIML) in Mplus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0739986312470636">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2010</xref>), given that this approach maximizes statistical power and minimizes problems due to bias created by item missingness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0739986312470636">Schafer &amp; Graham, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0739986312470636">
<title>Initial Measurement Assessments With Wave 2 Reports</title>
<p>The initial CFA models with the six-item measure at Wave 2 resulted in different conclusions by reporter: The model achieved excellent fit for mother figures, χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>df</italic> = 9) = 8.93, <italic>p</italic> = .44, CFI = 1.00, RMSEA = 0.00, whereas the adolescent model had poor fit, χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>df</italic> = 9) = 61.698, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, CFI = 0.91, RMSEA = 0.18. Thus, the six-item measurement structure from Wave 1 was retained for mother figures at Wave 2 but not for adolescents (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0739986312470636">Table 1</xref> for Wave 2 items for mother figures in the second column).</p>
<p>EFA was used to determine a new structure for adolescents using the original 29 items (the content of the 29 items is available upon request). Items were dropped from the analysis that did not load at least 0.40 on any single factor or demonstrated substantial cross-loading among factors. Items that did not meet these criteria were removed one at a time and a new EFA was conducted at each step of the model until a final model was achieved that met item criteria and had an interpretable solution. After a series of models were tested, a model with 15 items and 3 factors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0739986312470636">Table 1</xref>, Column 2 for specific items for adolescents) was determined to have the best fit, χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>df</italic> = 87) = 187.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, CFI = 0.94, RMSEA = 0.08. The first factor had seven items and was consistent with notions of emotional support. The second factor had four items and was consistent with conceptualizations of instrumental and informational support. Finally, the third factor had four items and was consistent with notions of companionship support. Notably, the model fit of this 15-item social support structure with 3 factors for <italic>mother figures</italic> was poor, χ<sup>2</sup>(<italic>df</italic> = 87) = 248.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, CFI = 0.79, RMSEA = 0.10, suggesting that the 6-item measure that was presented above is the most appropriate structure for mother figures.</p>

<p>We also explored whether our measurement of social support was equivalent from Wave 2, when the child was 10 months old, to Wave 3, when the child was 24 months old. Configural invariance was evident from Wave 2 to Wave 3 for adolescents. The test of loading invariance resulted in a significant difference in chi-square values, Δχ<sup>2</sup>(Δdf) = 30.88 (12), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, for adolescents; however, the change in CFI was less than .01 suggesting that longitudinal loading invariance was established (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739986312470636">Kline, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the test for intercept invariance resulted in a nonsignificant difference in chi-square values, suggesting that measurement properties did not vary for adolescents from Wave 2 to Wave 3 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0739986312470636">Table 2</xref>). Finally, tests of configural, loading, and intercept invariance for mother figures resulted in nonsignificant differences in chi-square values, suggesting that measurement did not vary for mother figures from Wave 2 to Wave 3 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0739986312470636">Table 2</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results suggest that as Mexican-origin adolescent mothers transition from pregnancy to parenthood, their perceptions of the dimensions of social support that they receive from their mother figures become more differentiated, whereas mother figures’ perceptions of the types of social support they provide to their daughters remain stable. Given that social support is considered to be an important promotive and protective factor for Latina adolescent mothers and because teen mothers often rely heavily on families of origin for support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0739986312470636">Contreras et al., 1999</xref>), these findings have important implications for future research (e.g., use of these newly developed and validated measures in future research on adolescent mothers and their family relationships during the transition to parenthood) and for future prevention and intervention efforts (e.g., programs to boost these different facets of social support after the birth of a child). Furthermore, these results provide initial evidence for the validity and reliability of the adapted version of the GSMF-P scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739986312470636">Umaña-Taylor et al., 2011</xref>) for use with Mexican-origin adolescent mothers and their mother figures <italic>postpartum</italic>—from this point forward referred to as the GSMF—Postpartum Scale (GSMF-PP).</p>
<p>Overall, the GSMF-PP Scale demonstrated strong internal consistency for both adolescents and mother figures, and more important, measurement equivalence was established across language of interview (English and Spanish) and across the initial years of parenting (i.e., from infancy to toddlerhood). Language equivalence is critical for measurement validation in research with Latino populations given that the majority of Mexican-origin individuals in the United States speak Spanish at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0739986312470636">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>). Thus, to maintain the credibility of the measure and the statistical and conceptual inferences drawn from its use, the items must conceptually and empirically have the same meaning across Spanish and English (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0739986312470636">Knight et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with previous work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0739986312470636">Sieger &amp; Renk, 2007</xref>), we found that adolescents who reported higher levels of all three dimensions of support also reported higher self-esteem and lower levels of depressive symptoms. Furthermore, adolescent mothers who reported higher levels of emotional support also reported less engagement in risky behaviors; however, there was not a significant association between risky behavior and the other two dimensions of support (instrumental and companionship support). Emotional support, when compared to instrumental or companionship support, may be more saliently related to engagement in risky behavior given that this type of support involves behaviors such as asking their mother figure for advice about personal problems or involving the mother figure in problem solving during a personal crisis. Thus, the emotional support items may best capture the possibility that mother figures are providing advice to avoid risk-taking behaviors, whereas the features present in the instrumental support (e.g., providing information related to parenting) or companionship support (e.g., going shopping together) subscales may not influence risk-taking behaviors. This is consistent with previous research on social support, which suggests the importance of delineating the features of contexts of social support when considering links to well-being (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0739986312470636">Rook &amp; Underwood, 2000</xref>). For mother figures, social support was positively related to warmth/acceptance and familism values, a finding that was consistent with previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739986312470636">Umaña-Taylor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739986312470636">Borcherding et al., 2005</xref>). Taken together, these findings provide initial support for the construct validity of our adapted measures and provide additional evidence that social support from a mother figure is a critical construct to assess in this population given that it has implications for adolescent well-being and engagement in risky behavior. That is, future prevention and intervention efforts that focus on Mexican-origin adolescent mothers should consider including a focus on bolstering social support from a mother figure during the transition from pregnancy to parenthood.</p>
<p>Most notably, our findings also suggest that the conceptualization (and measurement) of social support from mother figures varies as a function of the transition to parenthood for adolescent mothers. This is the first study to empirically examine <italic>how</italic> the dimensions of social support change for adolescent mothers during this transition. That is, whereas only a single dimension of social support emerged in the initial study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739986312470636">Umaña-Taylor et al., 2011</xref>) for both adolescents and their mother figures when the adolescents were in their third trimester of pregnancy, adolescent reports of social support differentiated into three distinct dimensions of support after the birth of their child whereas mother figure reports remained stable. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that the dimensions of social support provided by a mother figure during the initial months of the child’s life (i.e., Wave 2 in the current study) remain stable as her child transitions into the toddler years (i.e., Wave 3). The mother figure and adolescent conceptualizations differentiated <italic>after</italic> the birth of the child, suggesting that although mother figures tended to view the social support they provided to the adolescent more globally (i.e., there were not distinct subscales of support in the original six-item scale), adolescents tended to compartmentalize the types of social support they perceived from their mother figures after the birth of their child (i.e., three unique factors emerged only for adolescents). This finding has important implications for future research on social support during this transition period and for understanding the complex dyadic relationship between adolescent mothers and their mother figures, such that future research could benefit from examining how these different types of postpartum support may be differentially related to the adolescent’s well-being, her parenting skills, and her child’s development.</p>
<sec id="section11-0739986312470636">
<title>Limitations and Future Directions for Research</title>
<p>Although our study had several strengths (e.g., prospective longitudinal design, multiple reporters, inclusion of both Spanish and English speaking participants), it is important to recognize the limitations of the current research. First, our study is limited in its generalizability to other Latino groups (i.e., individuals with national origins other than Mexico), and thus future research and measurement validation is needed to examine how appropriate the measure is for use with other subpopulations. Nonetheless, because Mexican-origin adolescent females demonstrate the highest risk for teenage pregnancy in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0739986312470636">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011</xref>), this limitation is also a strength of the study given the need to develop culturally sensitive measurement tools to build a base of knowledge that can inform prevention and intervention efforts with this high-risk population (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0739986312470636">Knight et al., 2009</xref>). Second, our focus on mother figures as providers of social support is limited in that it does not take into account the social support the adolescent mother may be receiving from the baby’s father, romantic partners, other family members, community support agencies, or other sources. Thus, future research should examine whether the measurement tools developed in this study to assess social support during parenting of infants and toddlers is applicable to assess support from other sources. Nonetheless, given that research has identified that mother figures are a prominent source of support for Latina adolescent mothers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0739986312470636">Contreras et al., 1999</xref>), this is also a strength of the current study.</p>
<p>Beyond examining whether this measure works similarly in other Latino subpopulations and across different providers of support, it is also important for future research to continue to examine whether or not the dimensions of social support remain stable throughout the course of the child’s development. For instance, do the dimensions of social support perceived by adolescent mothers change once the child is enrolled in school? Furthermore, do mother figure reports of the social support they provide to adolescent mothers remain stable throughout the course of their grandchild’s development? These questions will be important to address as social support is related to parenting practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0739986312470636">Gordon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0739986312470636">Kalil et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0739986312470636">Sadler et al., 2001</xref>), which are in turn related to children’s developmental and health outcomes. Given that children of Mexican-origin adolescent mothers are at increased risk for poor developmental outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739986312470636">Fuller et al., 2009</xref>), understanding processes that may buffer this risk and promote positive development are important. Future investigations could examine how the different dimensions of social support from mother figures as reported by adolescent mothers are associated with parenting self-efficacy, which then likely inform children’s development.</p>
