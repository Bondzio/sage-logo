<abstract>
<p>Recent evidence suggests a potential role for honeys in mediating clinical inflammation and tissue damage. Here, we investigated the anti-inflammatory activity of a selection of previously untested indigenous New Zealand (NZ) honeys. We found that several, but not all, New Zealand rewarewa, manuka and kanuka honey samples exhibited potent, dose-dependent reduction of human neutrophil superoxide production <italic>in vitro</italic>. This inhibitory activity did not correlate with levels of known phenolic-based free radical scavengers. Furthermore, the active honeys did not scavenge superoxide generated in a cell-free xanthine/xanthine oxidase assay. In C57BL/6 J mice, topical application of manuka and rewarewa honey samples with the highest <italic>in vitro</italic> activity suppressed arachidonic acid-induced ear oedema, and rewarewa honey suppressed both oedema and leukocyte (monocyte and neutrophil) infiltration<bold>.</bold> Together, these findings demonstrate that some indigenous NZ honeys exhibit clinically relevant anti-inflammatory activity. Further investigation is warranted to identify the active component(s) and mechanisms responsible for these activities and to determine potential applications for anti-inflammatory honeys in the topical treatment of clinical inflammation.</p>

<p>There is a growing body of evidence to indicate that honey also exhibits beneficial immunomodulatory activities for the treatment of inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753425911422263">15</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753425911422263">17</xref></sup>Acute inflammation caused by oxidative stress is associated with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by cells such as neutrophils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425911422263">18</xref></sup> Honeys have been shown to exhibit antioxidant, or ‘ROS-scavenging’, properties that have been predominantly attributed to the presence of phenolic compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425911422263">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425911422263">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425911422263">20</xref></sup> Clinically, the oral application of manuka honey has been shown to reduce inflammation in rodent models of inflammatory bowel disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753425911422263">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425911422263">22</xref></sup> and indomethacin-induced gastritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753425911422263">23</xref></sup> Recently, clinical trials have demonstrated that oral administration of undiluted honeys can significantly decrease the extent of radiation-induced oralmucositis in head and neck cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753425911422263">24</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753425911422263">27</xref></sup> Together, thesefindings indicate that honeys have thepotential to exhibit multiple anti-inflammatory effectsthat could be exploited for the treatment of inflammation.</p>
<p>The unique NZ flora lends itself to the production ofhoneys containing components with new anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate the ability of different florally-defined indigenous NZ honey samples to suppress: 1) superoxide production by human neutrophils <italic>in vitro</italic>; and, 2) topical inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic>. The results of this study showed that different, florally-defined indigenous NZ honey samples were able to suppress neutrophil superoxide production of independent of ROS-scavenging activity. Furthermore, topical application of specific samples of manuka and rewarewa honeys resulted in abrogated ear oedema and leukocyte infiltration <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

Human neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood by sedimentation over a Polymorphprep density gradient, as described by the manufacturer. Neutrophil superoxide production was measured in 96-well plates as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753425911422263">29</xref></sup> Briefly, neutrophils (10<sup>6</sup>/ml) were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 0.2 µg/ml) in the presence of different concentrations of honey and the colorimetric dye WST-1 (0.25 mg/ml) in Hank's balanced salt solution. The WST-1 reduction to formazan dye by superoxide was measured in real time by absorbance at 450 nm at 37°C using a Versamax spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Surrey, VIC, Australia).

<p>All 21 honey samples inhibited superoxide production by PMA-stimulated neutrophils with IC<sub>50</sub> values between 3.1 and 44.4 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753425911422263">Table 1</xref>). The four kanuka honeys (H15–H18) and the single rewarewa honey (H21) exhibited the highest activities (6.1, 5.1, 3.1, 4.6 and 4.3 mg/ml respectively), whereas general pasture honey (H20) and commercially-produced UMF30+ manuka (H19) honeys exhibited low anti-inflammatory activity (20.8 and 44.4 mg/ml respectively). Manuka honeys showed variable activities (4.2–37.9 mg/ml) with both regional and inter-regional variability (data not shown).</p>
<p>To determine whether higher anti-inflammatory activity correlated with honey components of known bioactivity, IC<sub>50</sub> values for neutrophil superoxide inhibition were plotted against phenolic (ROS scavenging) and methylglyoxyl (MGO; antimicrobial) content as reported by Stephens et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753425911422263">28</xref></sup> No correlation between superoxide inhibition and phenolic content was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425911422263">Figure 1D</xref>). Surprisingly, a significant inverse correlation was observed between the anti-inflammatory activity and MGO content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425911422263">Figure 1D</xref>). To determine if MGO could be blocking the anti-inflammatory activity, neutrophils were treated with H17 (low MGO) at the IC<sub>50</sub> for superoxide suppression and spiked with increasing amounts of MGO. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425911422263">Figure 2</xref>, MGO concentrations up to 0.01 mg/ml did not alter the inhibitory effect of H17. At higher MGO concentrations, decreased superoxide production by MGO- and H17/MGO-treated neutrophils was observed for MGO in association with neutrophil death. These data indicated that the inverse correlation of MGO content and suppression of neutrophil superoxide production by the honeys was not caused by MGO-dependent inhibition of the anti-inflammatory activity.

<p>Next, we investigated whether the observed decrease in neutrophil superoxide production following low dose honey treatment was the result of cell death. The three most active honey samples (H10, H17, H21) and one comparatively inactive honey sample (H20), independent of floral origin or MGO content, were selected for further study.

<p>Based on the neutrophil superoxide screen described above, three high activity honeys (H10, H17 and H21) and the low activity pasture honey (H20) were tested for additional anti-inflammatory activities in a mouse model of acute local inflammation.

<p>To determine the impact of honey treatments on AA-induced cellular infiltration, all ear tissue, including biopsy material, from each treatment group were pooled, digested and the infiltration of monocytes (Ly6G<sup>-</sup>/CD11b<sup>+</sup>/Gr-1<sup>low</sup>) and neutrophils (Ly6G<sup>+</sup>/CD11b<sup>+</sup>/Gr-1<sup>high</sup>) into the tissues was analysed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753425911422263">Figure 5A</xref>).

<p>Our results identify a new subset of indigenous NZ honeys that exhibit anti-inflammatory activity on human neutrophils <italic>in vitro</italic> and can suppress oedema and leukocyte infiltration in a mouse model of topical acute neutrophilic inflammation.</p>
<p>A decrease in neutrophil superoxide production by honeys <italic>in vitro</italic> has been reported previously whereby the activity of other honey samples was attributed to the inhibition of ROS formation, either by inhibitingthe respiratory burst of neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425911422263">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753425911422263">17</xref></sup> or by direct ROS scavenging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425911422263">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425911422263">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425911422263">20</xref></sup> Inoue et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425911422263">20</xref></sup> have reported that free radical scavenging in their honey samples was mediated by methyl syringate. However, methyl syringate levels in our honey samples did not correlate with anti-inflammatory activity. In fact, the inhibition of neutrophil superoxide production by the NZ indigenous honeys in thisstudy did not correlate at all with free radical scavenging activities nor was honey activity linked with neutrophil death. Together, these data indicate that the anti-inflammatory activity of the indigenous NZ honeys was likely caused by the inhibition of the neutrophil respiratory burst.</p>
<p>MGO is the primary component associated with the antimicrobial activity of manuka honey but it did not appear to contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity observed in this study. The inverse correlation between honey anti-inflammatory activity and the MGO content of the samples tested suggested that a high MGO content could be blocking anti-inflammatory activity. However, the addition of MGO to low MGO-containing kanuka honey with high anti-inflammatory activity did not alter the suppression of neutrophil superoxide production. This demonstrates that high MGO levels do not suppress anti-inflammatory activity of the honeys. The inverse correlation between anti-inflammatory activity and MGO was not an artefact of MGO and anti-inflammatory agents being present in the nectar at the same time as honeys with high anti-inflammatory activity exhibited low MGO-dependent antibacterial activity, regardless of floral origin.</p>
<p>Leukocyte infiltration is a strong correlate of inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this study, manuka and rewarewa samples, H10 and H21, were each able to suppress established AA-induced leukocyte infiltration <italic>in vivo</italic>, with the majority of this suppressive effect caused by decreased neutrophil infiltration. Whether honey treatment abrogates neutrophil trafficking by shutting down the resident cells responsible for initiating the inflammatory response, or by inhibiting infiltrating neutrophil activation and self-recruitment <italic>in vivo</italic>, is worthy of future study.</p>
<p>Interestingly<italic>,</italic> of the honeys tested <italic>in vivo</italic>, only the rewarewa honey reduced both inflammatory leukocyte infiltration and AA-induced oedema. This result indicates that rewarewa honey has the potential to abrogate inflammation by hitting multiple inflammatory targets: neutrophil respiratory burst, neutrophil recruitment and swelling. However, more rewarewa honey samples fromdifferent regions in NZ need to be tested before any claims can be made about the superiority of honey of rewarewa origin with respect to anti-inflammatory activity.</p>
<p>To date, the component(s) responsible for the anti-inflammatory honey activities observed in this study remain to be determined. As such, it is not clear whether a single molecule within the honey samples is responsible for both the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> activities, or if the anti-inflammatory activities arise from different compounds. However, diacyl compounds, found to be high in rewarewa honeys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1753425911422263">34</xref></sup> may provide a logical starting point for further anti-inflammatory testing.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings demonstrate that a subset of indigenous NZ honeys exhibit novel and therapeutically-relevant anti-inflammatory activities that may have benefit as a topical treatment for inflammation. Further investigation into the anti-inflammatory effects of indigenous honeys is warranted to identify the component(s) and mechanisms involved in the inhibition ofneutrophil superoxide production <italic>in vitro</italic> and the inhibition of oedema and leukocyte infiltration <italic>in vivo.</italic></p>
