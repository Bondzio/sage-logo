<abstract>
<p>Drawing on an empirical study of environmental policies in Manchester (UK) and Saint-Etienne (France), this article attempts to provide a periodization of the evolution of the management of urban environmental issues. The periodization traces the shift in discourse from a focus on ‘local environment’ to ‘sustainable urban development’. Three main sequences are identified corresponding to three different ways of tackling environmental issues covering a period from the late 1970s up to the present. The aim of this article is twofold. First, it will use environmental policies as a tool to understand the transformations of urban governance, and in particular the transformations of the actors involved in policy-making. Second, it will show how sustainable development policies are used by local elites to neutralize urban conflicts by excluding environmental grassroots movements from the management of environmental issues. Finally, the article will discuss how this marginalization should be considered as a sign of the emergence of a post-democratic era.</p>

<p>Putting together a governing coalition involves more than identifying compatible partners; it also means working out the terms on which cooperation can occur, including the resources that each partner brings to the relationship. Governing means also attracting passive allies and taking into account potential sources of opposition and how to keep them at a minimum. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0969776411428562">Clarence Stone, 2006</xref>: 30)</p>
<p>Much of the sustainability argument has evacuated the politics of the possible, the radical contestation of alternative future socio-environmental possibilities and socio-natural arrangements, and silences the radical antagonisms that are constitutive of our socio-natural orders by externalising conflict.

<p>Over the last two decades, sustainable development has steadily become one of the leading themes of urban policy. Most European cities now have some sustainable development policies and have included sustainability as a meta-objective in their urban and economic redevelopment strategies. This omnipresence may appear to contradict the spread of urban entrepreneurialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969776411428562">Harvey, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969776411428562">Hall and Hubbard, 1998</xref>). In fact, the reappraisal of the Keynesian–Fordist compromise during the 1970s brought about dramatic changes in local government activities and in urban policies. Previously, the economy was regulated at the national scale: as regulationist authors have pointed out, a specific state/economy relationship took place at that time, creating a stable accumulation regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969776411428562">Aglietta, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969776411428562">Boyer, 1986</xref>). The reappraisal of this accumulation regime has enhanced the role of cities in the regulation of the economy and of socio-environmental contradictions. During the Golden Age, the main activity of local authorities was to implement the welfare policies designed at the national scale. Currently, cities are said to be ‘spatial fixes’, that is, spaces through which economic competition is organized, and they play a crucial role alongside other territorial scales in the regulation of the economy of the post-Fordist era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969776411428562">Le Galès, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969776411428562">Brenner, 2003</xref>). The ‘Fordist city’, with its standardized demand-side policies, gave way to the ‘entrepreneurial city’, which is characterized by more diverse supply-side policies and by an overt willingness to attract businesses and upper and middle-class people. Whereas some have stressed the subordination of social and environmental policies to economic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969776411428562">Logan and Molotch, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969776411428562">Mayer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0969776411428562">Moulaert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0969776411428562">Novy, 2011</xref>), others have shown that current urban policies not only are an outcome of economic strategies per se, but also are characterized by a new investment in social and environmental dimensions of urban development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0969776411428562">Peck and Tickell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969776411428562">Keil and Boudreau, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0969776411428562">Raco, 2007</xref>). According to the latter argument, Western cities are witnessing a new period of neoliberalization – the ‘roll-out of the state’– which came about as a new neoliberal regime to remedy the effects of the ‘growth first model’ of urban development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969776411428562">Brenner and Theodore, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>This article argues along with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0969776411428562">Whitehead, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0969776411428562">While et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969776411428562">Krueger and Gibbs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969776411428562">Keil and Whitehead, 2012</xref>) that this context of urban restructuring explains the change within urban environmental policies. Although environmental protection was largely absent from the Fordist compromise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969776411428562">Lipietz, 1987</xref>), it has been included as an important feature of the post-Fordist economy. The new common goal of enhancing urban environments – through the creation of quality spaces and diversified quarters, through the emphasis put on urban amenities and heritage, through the green branding of cities and through the regulation or the displacement of environmental degradations (pollution, congestion, carbon emissions, etc.) – is a central element of the post-Fordist city. It shows how the transformations of capitalism and the evolution of the relationships between capital and space have affected the way in which environmental issues are tackled at the urban scale. The environment is increasingly considered as an extra-economic factor of urban growth and as a tool to enhance urban competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969776411428562">Jessop, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0969776411428562">Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969776411428562">Béal, 2009</xref>). As a consequence, the environment should be seen not only as an alternative to neoliberalism any more, but also as an advanced part of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969776411428562">McCarthy and Prudham, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This article attempts to understand the transformations induced by the rise of environmental issues on contemporary urban agendas, and explores these transformations through the lens of political economy and urban political science. Specifically, it will consider environmental regulation as a good starting point for thinking through questions of urban governance. The argument developed is twofold. First, it is argued that there has been a dramatic change in the way environmental issues have been tackled at the urban scale in the last 30 years. Where environmental policies in the 1970s and 1980s had been part of a broader movement of politicization and democratization of urban policy-making, current environmental policies are now incorporated into mainstream competitive strategies. In other words, early urban environmental policies were structured around the ‘politics’ dimension of local government activities, whereas today these policies are structured by the ‘policy’ dimension of these activities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0969776411428562">1</xref></sup> Second, the article will show that environmental issues are a powerful way of understanding the changes made within urban democracy, by considering contemporary environmental policies as vanguards of the rise of a post-democratic era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969776411428562">Crouch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0969776411428562">Swyngedouw, 2009</xref>). Against the argument that sustainability can revitalize urban democracy by including stakeholders in spaces of participation and deliberation, this article will demonstrate that environmental decision-making is increasingly dominated by urban oligarchies. The elite consensus around the new way of defining and tackling environmental issues has two main consequences for urban democracy. First, it has been synonymous with a process of selection and prioritization of environmental issues within the loosely defined framework of urban sustainability. Second, it has generated important changes in the composition of policy networks mobilized around environmental issues, and in particular has marginalized grassroots actors and groups.</p>
<p>To support the argument empirically, two cases have been chosen: Manchester (UK) and Saint-Etienne (France).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0969776411428562">2</xref></sup> There are at least two main arguments behind this choice. First, Manchester and Saint-Etienne could both be considered as part of the category of ‘European cities’ – that is, cities with a population of between 200,000 and 2 million – that have some common characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969776411428562">Le Galès, 2002</xref>). Since the 1980s, these cities have faced a similar set of constraints and opportunities, which led to the emergence of new urban policies and new modes of governance. As a consequence, one could consider that these two cities are comparable, which does not mean that they are identical. In fact, and this is the second point, they have different profiles. Whereas Saint-Etienne is a medium-sized French city, Manchester is a regional capital with an increasingly internationalized economy. Moreover, Saint-Etienne is considered to be a shrinking city – demographic loss, economic decline, middle-class flight from the city centre, for example – where entrepreneurial ideas and policies have arrived only lately, whereas Manchester is often depicted as a booming city – redevelopment of the city centre, vibrant cultural and knowledge economy, for example – and as a paragon of urban entrepreneurialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0969776411428562">Peck and Ward, 2002</xref>). Finally, Saint-Etienne and Manchester are part of two different national urban policy frameworks. Since the 1980s, British urban policies have experienced a spectacular neoliberal restructuring and local governments have seemed to be increasingly constrained by the pressures of capitalism and the control of the central state. In contrast, French cities continue to enjoy relative autonomy and to be partially protected by a residual welfare state. Hence, it is possible to say that French cities embraced entrepreneurial and neoliberal agendas later and more weakly than their British counterparts. These differences explain why the two cases might at some point deviate temporally or even materially from the general argument but, in turn, they make them more representative of the general evolution of environmental policies and governance in European cities.</p>

<title>The evolution of the management of environmental issues at the urban scale</title>
<p>In order to understand the evolution of the management of environmental issues in European cities, the analysis is based on an ideal-typical periodization that draws on Peck and Tickell’s work on neoliberalization (2002). According to Peck and Tickell, the process of neoliberalization needs to be broken down into two phases. First, ‘roll-back neoliberalism’ occurred in the 1980s and the 1990s, whereby the state tried to dismantle the institutions and practices inherited from Keynesianism. Second, since 2000, ‘roll-out neoliberalism’ has taken place, whereby the state and local authorities have tried to compensate and regulate the contradictions and the crisis tendencies of the first market-led phase. This roll-out phase has been characterized by investment in social and environmental policies. Concerning environmental issues, some authors have already made connections between ‘roll-out neoliberalism’ and the way in which these issues are tackled at the urban scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0969776411428562">Raco, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969776411428562">Keil and Boudreau, 2006</xref>). This article is an attempt to refine the work of Peck and Tickell and to adapt it to environmental issues. Three different phases will be analysed corresponding to three different ways of tackling environmental issues (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0969776411428562">Table 1</xref> below). The first period (1975–90) can be called ‘grassroots environmentalism’, in which environmental issues emerge at the urban scale. The second period (1990–2000) is called ‘roll-back environmentalism’ to reflect the anaesthetization of environmental goals by the new imperative of competitiveness. The latest period (2000–10), ‘roll-out environmentalism’, corresponds to a stronger investment by urban elites in the management of environmental issues and to a more entrepreneurial way of tackling those issues.</p>

<title>Grassroots environmentalism: the invention of urban environmental policies</title>
<p>During the 1950s and 1960s, urban environmental issues were relatively unimportant areas of local policy-making in Western Europe. If one could identify proto-environmental policies, especially in the UK, environmental issues were mainly defined as technical issues and indirectly tackled through public health and planning policies (air and water quality, preservation of green fields, and so on). A range of factors made environmental policies politically more important in the 1970s. The post-1968 new social movements – feminism, gay and lesbian movements, youth revolts, environmentalism, and so on – were instrumental in politicizing environmental issues at the urban scale, and helped environmental and quality-of-life issues to emerge on urban agendas. This period was also characterized by the emergence of a new urban political elite. The new urban left in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969776411428562">Gyford, 1985</xref>) and the ‘<italic>élus militants</italic>’ in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969776411428562">Borraz, 1998</xref>) set up a progressive agenda based on post-materialist aspirations and centred around issues such as housing, quality of life, environmental protection and the democratization of urban political process. It tried to create and maintain support in the population (especially among the middle class) for electoral competition through environmental policies. As a consequence, environmental groups, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and organizations were strongly involved in the policy process. Their expertise and their links with the population were essential for local governments. In this period, environmental regulations were centred on politics logics, that is, the search for resources for electoral competition, and were used in input-oriented legitimacy strategies. So, it was more an extension of the ‘class/welfare-based system of politics and parties’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969776411428562">Andrew and Goldsmith, 1998</xref>) than a reappraisal of this system.</p>
<p>Manchester was deeply hit by the economic crisis of the 1970s, which had led to deep economic and demographic recession. The 1970s were also characterized by the emergence of ‘new social movements’ in the city. Feminism, gay and lesbian activism, anti-nuclear campaigns and environmentalism became more important within the urban society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969776411428562">Doherty, 2002</xref>). At that time, there was not any willingness in the city council to create political links with these movements. Local political elites just contented themselves with their traditional electoral base, that is, the working class and the trade unions. There was a dramatic change in 1984, when a group of young radical councillors – led by Graham Stringer – successfully contested the leadership of the old guard of Labour. This new generation of left-wing councillors brought about the emergence of a progressive and radical agenda centred on post-materialist issues such as the empowerment of ethnic and sexual minorities, nuclear disarmament and the democratization of urban policy-making. The position of environmental issues on this agenda was less important than in other British cities such as Bristol, Leeds or Leicester. However, the environment was used strategically by local political elites to exercise their ideological opposition to the Thatcher government and to enhance their political base.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0969776411428562">3</xref></sup> The public funds distributed through the Urban Programme – particularly those of the Inner Area Programme – were very important in this strategy. They allowed the council to create numerous programmes such as Impact or a Community Initiatives Fund in order to support local community groups and NGOs in the implementation of environmental projects. In 1989, approximately £1 billion had been distributed to local groups. This had two main consequences. First, it allowed local political elites to compensate in part for the dismantling of the welfare state, which was, during the Golden Age, the main vehicle for creating and maintaining political support among the working class.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0969776411428562">4</xref></sup> Second, it allowed the new urban left to forge contacts within the environmental movement. These links were facilitated by the Manchester Socialist Environment and Resources Association, which operated as an intermediary between the council and the public around environmental issues. Thus, at that time, environmental groups were important in policy-making. Manchester Friends of the Earth (MFoE), Manchester Wildlife or even radical activists – who, in the 1990s, gathered under the banner of Earth First! – were included in decision-making and participated in the elaboration of urban environmental policies.</p>
<p>In Saint-Etienne, the emergence of environmental issues took a different path from that of Manchester. In the 1970s, local struggles in the city were mainly focused on economic and social issues because of the bankruptcy of key companies (for example, Les Houillères, Manufrance, Creusot-Loire, Thomson). For different reasons, such as the industrial characteristics of the city, the strong presence of the state in the local economy and the social structure of the city, the new urban elites described in Manchester appeared only in the mid-1990s. In the 1980s, the environmental policies of Saint-Etienne were very weak. In a planning document dating from 1989, the right-wing mayor explained what he considered to be the environmental policy of Saint-Etienne. This was the creation of a municipal golf course and the laying out of green spaces for recreation on the periphery of the city. However, the environmental agenda increased steadily during the 1990s. The creation of an environmental administration within the municipal bureaucracy and the establishment of an inter-municipal structure of cooperation (<italic>communauté de communes</italic>) played a significant role in the improvement of this environmental agenda. In 1995, after the election as mayor of Michel Thiollière – a young right-of-centre politician who experienced a lot of difficulty in asserting his leadership – key local ecological figures were included in the municipal and metropolitan teams. Several contacts were established with local environmental networks and groups – for example, the Fédération Rhône-Alpes de Protection de la Nature (FRAPNA) and the Ligue de Protection des Oiseaux (LPO) – and the municipality created an extra-municipal environmental commission to bring together local politicians, officials and groups from civil society. However, the impact of these efforts was limited and the policies designed at both the municipal and the metropolitan level were weak. Owing to a deep-seated conflict between the mayor and the cabinet member in charge of the environment, environmental policies were neutralized in order to prevent the rise of a political rival within the municipal team. So, based on this, it is evident that politics logics are important here because, first, the environment was used by the mayor to differentiate himself from the previous administration – which was not environment friendly – and to create electoral support among middle-class groups, and, second, the neutralization of environmental policies served the goals of the mayor, allowing him to assert his leadership by marginalizing an influential cabinet member of his team.</p>

<sec id="section3-0969776411428562">
<title>Roll-back environmentalism: the emergence of sustainable urban development</title>
<p>During the early 1990s, there was a shift in the treatment of urban environmental issues. Most European cities started to design entrepreneurial policies in this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969776411428562">Harvey, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969776411428562">Hall and Hubbard, 1998</xref>). The hegemony of economic development objectives led to a dismantling of the grassroots framework of environmental management. It is important to note that this sequence was a transitional one, a period of restructuring characterized by a discursive shift from the management of ‘the local environment’ to the management of ‘urban sustainability’. This discursive reshaping usually took place through the development of Local Agenda 21 (LA21) and it had several effects. First, there was a process of environmental mainstreaming through sustainability. Environmental objectives were weakened by their integration in various urban policies, such as transport, housing and regeneration. Second, there was a profound change in the actors involved in environmental policies, such that the role played by local environmental NGOs, groups and organizations in the policy process was in constant decline. This marginalization often occurred as a result of conflicts between environmental protection and economic development. Contrary to this, however, there was an emergence of new actors characterized by an entrepreneurial ethos within environmental policy-making, such as chambers of commerce, utilities, urban developers and consultants. Finally, local elected officials and officers who worked on environmental issues also lost their room for manoeuvre. They were increasingly limited by the new constraints on European cities (state restructuring, globalization, urban competition, and so on) and by the ‘executive shift’ in urban governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0969776411428562">Quilley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969776411428562">Borraz and John, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0969776411428562">Pinson, 2009</xref>). This period is termed ‘roll-back environmentalism’ because the shift from ‘local environment’ to ‘urban sustainability’ created a favourable context leading to the renewal of actors, networks of actors and practices around the management of environmental issues.</p>
<p>In Manchester, the organization of the Global Forum in 1994 – the first Forum after the Rio Earth Summit – triggered the emergence of sustainable development as a policy theme.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0969776411428562">5</xref></sup> It is debatable whether this event was successful; however, it had a strong influence on Manchester’s environmental policies. Urban elites were interested in strengthening the image of the city and as a consequence they gave responsibility for elaborating a scheme to the planning committee of the city council, which was renamed the Environmental Planning Committee. It produced a document for the Forum – the ‘Manchester 100’ – which was the first attempt to link environmental policies and the overall goal of improving the image of the city through urban marketing. After 1995, two main conflicts between environmental objectives and economic development objectives occurred and accelerated the transition towards a period of roll-back environmentalism. The first concerned air pollution, after a public inquiry stressed that the city centre of Manchester was the most polluted in Britain. At that time, the council had refused to make the outcome of this inquiry public. However, the local media – the <italic>Manchester Evening News</italic> – encouraged by some of the local NGOs, and especially MFoE, decided to make this information public and started to publish articles on the theme ‘The most polluted city in Britain’. The second conflict concerned the building of a second runway at Manchester Airport, to allow a tripling of the number of passengers between 1995 and 2005. This triggered a campaign protesting against this decision, and it opposed on the one hand the council, the private actors of the North West region, the government and its agencies, and on the other hand some local and national environmental activist groups and several NIMBY groups. The protestors stressed the destruction of listed buildings and of wildlife areas and the disregard of Green Belt legislation.</p>
<p>These two conflicts created some controversies surrounding environmental issues and led to a public conflict between the leader of the council and the chair of the planning committee. The strong media coverage of these two conflicts also tended to reinforce the ‘fears’ of local political elites around environmental issues. These elites did not want to create a bad image for the city, which had just started to be considered in governmental and economic circles as a model for urban regeneration and governance. The executive leadership therefore rejected the draft LA21 because of it mentioned support for an aviation fuel tax. The LA21 Forum – the group of actors in charge of the development of the LA21 strategy – was dissolved and a new group was created, comprising mainly economic actors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0969776411428562">6</xref></sup> Even though many local and regional environmental champions (the Co-operative Bank, United Utilities, Amec Plc, for example) and environmental experts (for example, Sustainability Northwest) were involved in this group, sustainability never became an important issue. The new LA21 was more a document that allowed economic elites to communicate about their actions and as a consequence to enhance their environmental image. The group did not manage to bring about a broad mobilization through LA21, and the final draft met with total indifference in 2002. It is argued therefore that the executive shift in environmental decision-making was a means to neutralize environmental conflicts, which in turn would also stabilize the overall entrepreneurial strategy of the city.</p>
<p>In Saint-Etienne, an important shift in environmental policy-making has also taken place since 2001. The way of conceptualizing the urban crisis and of thinking about the redevelopment of the city changed. Whereas previously the response to the recessionary period in Saint-Etienne had been centred on economic development and real estate policies, after 2001, local elites started to redirect their approach towards regeneration and marketing policies. This change in policy for redeveloping the city triggered the emergence of sustainable development. The elaboration of an LA21 started and, in spite of a weak political commitment to this project, sustainability was immediately identified as a tool to enhance the attractiveness of the city. The deputy leader of the metropolitan structure who works on environmental issues claimed that: ‘Our territory is concerned about attracting investment and wealth flows. It is the reason we need to improve our sustainable development policies to be competitive at the national and the international levels’ (interview, 19 April 2005). Thus, sustainability objectives were included in the priorities identified by urban political elites for the redevelopment of the city. This process went hand in hand with an evolution of the networks of actors involved in environmental policies. Apart from local politicians and officers, the main actors involved in the elaboration of environmental policies between 1995 and 2001 were from the local environmental activist sector, namely the FRAPNA and the LPO. However, after 2001 these actors were marginalized, and new actors began to take a leading role. They were mainly environmental consultancies such as the Centre International de Ressource et d’Innovation sur le Développement Durable (CIRIDD) and the Réseau Conseil en Développement (RCT).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0969776411428562">7</xref></sup> As in Manchester, these new actors worked closely with the business community and were characterized by an entrepreneurial ethos.</p>

<title>Roll-out environmentalism: the antinomies of the coming era of urban environmentalism</title>
<p>A third sequence started in the early 2000s. This was a period of ‘roll-out environmentalism’ which saw a stronger investment by urban elites (both political and economic) in the management of environmental issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969776411428562">Keil and Boudreau, 2006</xref>). It also corresponds to an entrepreneurial and neoliberal way of tackling those issues. Since 2000, environmental issues have been seen by urban actors not as an end in themselves, but rather as risks that threaten economic growth. The process of ecological modernization at the urban scale fuses with the dynamics of neoliberalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969776411428562">Desfor and Keil, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969776411428562">Keil, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0969776411428562">8</xref></sup> Urban elites are in search of a ‘sustainability fix’ to ensure the strengthening of the competitiveness of the city by improving the quality of life and respect for the increasingly restrictive European and national environmental requirements, without threatening the good business climate created during the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0969776411428562">While et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, the new urban environmental policies are seen less as alternatives to neoliberal economic development policies and more as stabilizing complements to these policies. This roll-out has also been synonymous with a strong evolution in the activities of urban political elites. In the grassroots phase, they were strongly involved in ‘politics logics’, whereby their legitimacy was based on their ability to respond to changing urban demands and to involve some part of the population or some representative groups in the policy-making. In contrast, the roll-out phase is characterized by a new investment by urban political elites in ‘policy logics’. They have started to use environmental issues and their new frame as a way to elaborate strategies, build coalitions and marginalize actors, and generally speaking create a capacity to govern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0969776411428562">Stone, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>In Manchester, the roll-out environmentalism phase began in 2005. The city had already achieved an impressive – but uneven – physical transformation of its urban infrastructure. The city centre had been repopulated and gentrified and it is considered – with its cultural industries, its café culture and its vibrant night-life – to be a model of urban renaissance. In this context, a new priority emerged for the city council, in that it had to maintain and perpetuate the mobilization that gave birth to the influential public–private coalition that governs the city. This coalition was very successful in the 1990s and it was characterized by its extraordinary capacity to grab grants and to deliver major projects, such as the two Olympic bids, the Hulme city challenge, the city centre regeneration after the IRA bomb and the organization of the Commonwealth Games. However, urban elites considered that, in order to maintain its efficiency, this coalition had to evolve, to restructure its market-led agenda – which was previously limited to property-led regeneration, competitiveness and urban marketing in the 1990s – and to adapt to the new urban context. This context triggered the rise of environmental issues, which took three different directions. First, the city designed ‘environmental regeneration’ schemes with the incorporation of environmental standards in construction, specifically with the objective of creating several eco-districts, which played the role of flagship environmental projects in rebranding derelict spaces.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0969776411428562">9</xref></sup> Second, there has been an overt goal to enhance the environmental performance of the city, which can be seen in the project called ‘Manchester Green City’. This project was a partnership comprising a broad set of actors such as urban developers (for example, Urban Splash, ASK Developments), the universities, quasi-autonomous non-governmental organizations (for example, Manchester Knowledge Capital) and consultants (for example, Sustainability Northwest, Creative Concern). Third, there was a goal to position Manchester as a new green model of urban policies. This objective can be seen in the Green City Project, but it is arguably more visible in the climate change strategy, which was launched in 2008, and in the project to implement a congestion charge scheme.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0969776411428562">10</xref></sup> These policy strategies demonstrate how Manchester council has tried to position itself at the top of the hierarchy of environmental cities:
<disp-quote>
<p>A clearly articulated policy position is needed with respect to climate change legislation. There is a choice between ‘going with the flow’ and taking a strategic decision to harness assets to position the city-region at the forefront of the global environmental industry. The latter is more likely to lead to first mover advantage, which is likely to confer greater economic benefits. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969776411428562">Deloitte, 2008</xref>: 10)</p>
<p>As the world economy is hit by recession, rather than shelving or delaying action, there is increasing recognition of the potential for a ‘green new deal’ that drives economic recovery, environmental improvement and helps to alleviate poverty and strengthen social inclusion . . . Across the world successful, modern, confident, outward-looking cities are beginning to develop different responses to climate change in tune with their core values and objectives. Cities like New York, Stockholm, Vancouver and Melbourne are finding that action they take to move towards lower carbon ways of living also has positive benefits for the city’s quality of life and attractiveness to people to live, work and invest. The recent Manchester ‘Mini-Stern’ Review highlights the economic advantages of setting out a positive agenda for climate change action in Manchester over simply ‘going with the flow’ . . . Manchester led the world in driving social progress through innovation. Within the UK and perhaps beyond, the field is open to take a lead on climate change action and, where it makes sense to do so, to pre-empt and influence rather than follow the path of national legislation and policy and market changes. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969776411428562">Manchester City Council, 2009</xref>: 3–4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These two quotes exemplify the Manchester attitude towards environmental issues, which is nothing more than an extension of the attitude it developed in regeneration policies during the 1990s. In fact, speaking about Manchester in the 1990s, Kevin Ward stressed how the council had understood that ‘if it could complete its entrepreneurial turn before any of its competitors, then it might benefit from, although not of course challenge, the change in the rules and norms of the game’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0969776411428562">Ward, 2004</xref>: 277). Urban political elites seem to be developing the same reasoning process around environmental issues, considering them as a new niche for revitalizing urban governing arrangements and for maintaining the tradition of grant-grabbing in the city.</p>
<p>In Saint-Etienne the situation was slightly different. The redevelopment of the city has been less successful and local elites thought that environmental issues were less important than economic development and urban regeneration objectives. However, there was a change around 2005. At that time the mayor chose to bid for the European Capital of Culture in 2013. The selection was made by the European Commission after a competition between most of the medium and large cities (for example, Lyons, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Strasbourg). In 2005, a study trip was organized to prepare the bid. The mayor and his closest followers went to London in order to examine London’s bid for the Olympic Games and to scrutinize some regeneration schemes such as Bedzed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0969776411428562">11</xref></sup> The group returned with the conviction that London was successful because of its environmental and sustainable development policies, and, as a result, this study trip contributed to upgrading the environmental agenda in Saint-Etienne. This led to the signing of the Aalborg Charter on sustainable development, the publication of an LA21, and so on. Sustainability was also identified as a central concept that could differentiate Saint-Etienne from the other cities. Although the bid was unsuccessful (Marseilles was the successful contender), it nevertheless influenced how environmental issues were defined and tackled, and it contributed to a strengthening of the city’s environmental policies with the building of an eco-district. The city also entered a ‘Concours Eco-quartiers’ competition launched by the national government in order to present awards to several eco-district and eco-city schemes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0969776411428562">12</xref></sup> This new investment in environmental issues intensified the shift from community and grassroots partnerships to elite partnerships and generated significant changes in the composition of the policy networks mobilized around environmental issues. As a result, the involvement of grassroots actors in the new environmental policies of Saint-Etienne is very limited and these groups have been marginalized by the change in the political resources required in urban governance.</p>

<title>Roll-out environmentalism or roll-back of democracy?</title>
<p>Urban environmental policy-making has often been considered to be a vehicle for political innovation, and the emergence of sustainable development has been regarded by academic and policy circles as a catalyst for democracy. Although scholars have highlighted the role of environmental policies in the development of urban democracy, they have largely failed to understand how these policies are relevant to the transformation of urban democracy. This section of the article analyses the shift in democracy generated by the current vogue for environmental issues, which has been described as ‘environmental populism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0969776411428562">Swyngedouw, 2009</xref>). Two main characteristics of urban democracy will be analysed: the pluralism of policy ideas and solutions; and the involvement of environmental grassroots movements in current urban decision-making.</p>
<sec id="section6-0969776411428562">
<title>Urban sustainability as a process of selection and prioritization of environmental issues</title>
<p>The recent consensus around environmental issues has given way to a new realism in the urban management of the environment. This evolution has gone hand in hand with a loss of pluralism in terms of policy solutions and this section will examine the proposition that the ‘roll-out environmentalism’ phase is characterized by a strong strategic selectivity of policy ideas and solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969776411428562">Jonas et al., 2004</xref>). It is important to understand that ‘nature’, the ‘environment’ and, more obviously, ‘sustainable development’ are social and political constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0969776411428562">Smith, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969776411428562">Harvey, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969776411428562">Heynen et al., 2006</xref>). These sociopolitical constructs tend to “naturalize” particular visions of nature. During the 1980s, there was a plurality of such visions and of political solutions to protect the environment, whereas the emergence of sustainable development led to a decrease in this pluralism. Different kinds of issues – urban sprawl, ‘eco-urbanism’ (for example, eco-building and waterfront regeneration), community-building and, more recently, climate change – have been prioritized and considered as prerequisites in most urban environmental policies (without questioning their environmental effectiveness or their social equity). This process is a permanent feature of environmental policies:
<disp-quote>
<p>[E]nvironmental regulation will always be selective in terms of objects, subjects, spaces and scales of environmental and ecological regulations. This is partly because there is no single object of environmental regulation, but rather a range of potential – and potentially competing – objects of environmental and ecological governance. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0969776411428562">While et al., 2010</xref>: 81)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, this tendency has increased with the emergence of the loosely defined concept of sustainable development and it is visible both in Manchester and in Saint-Etienne, where the reframing of environmental policies in the 2000s has privileged a small number of environmental problems.</p>
<p>Although local actors have had an influence on this process, the selection and prioritization of environmental issues have mostly been externally imposed on local authorities. The state has played a major role in this selection. Recent works on state restructuring have highlighted the increasing capacity of the state, as well as transnational organizations, to define priorities and to explain the terms of the politically feasible and deliverable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969776411428562">Jessop, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969776411428562">Brenner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969776411428562">Le Galès and Scott, 2010</xref>; Theodore and Peck, 2012). Regarding environmental issues, three main factors could explain this selection and prioritization.</p>
<p>First, there has been the influence of ‘locational policies’, which serves the global agenda of urban competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969776411428562">Brenner, 2003</xref>). In French and British cities, these incentives to redirect environmental policies towards urban growth and competitiveness are visible in the emphasis placed upon the quality of urban spaces and building (for example through the new environmental standards or indicators) or in the new interest in city centre redevelopments, which seems to be justified by the desire to stop urban sprawl.</p>
<p>Second, urban environmental policies have been shaped by the need to keep debates about environmental policies well away from questioning the productive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0969776411428562">Smith, 2007</xref>). As such, some new niches have been created for economic actors in the energy, building or transport sectors. The recent interest of urban developers in environmental issues can be seen as a strong sign of this.</p>
<p>Last but not least, urban environmental policies have been selected in terms of what is considered to be politically feasible and deliverable, which is largely externally imposed. On the one hand, what is politically feasible and deliverable has been framed by the ‘supply’ of policy solutions produced by different international or national think tanks such as the Atelier projet urbain in France or the Urban Task Force in the UK. These are just a few examples, but this transnational consultocracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0969776411428562">Saint-Martin, 2000</xref>) seems to be more and more influential in the production and policy transfer of so-called ‘best practices’ and in the definition of what is feasible. On the other hand, it has been influenced by national policies in which the way to tackle urban environmental issues is increasingly linked to what can be measured and quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969776411428562">Bevan and Hood, 2006</xref>). This evolution is very visible in the UK, where a new ‘bureaucratic revolution’ is taking place through the rise of new public management tools of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969776411428562">Le Galès and Scott, 2010</xref>). It has just started in France, where the Grenelle de l’Environnement has been a tipping point in the reshaping of environmental policies around performance indicators on issues such as energy and climate change.</p>

<sec id="section7-0969776411428562">
<title>In search of ‘responsible partners’: Changing patterns of civil society involvement in policy-making</title>
<p>Alongside the decrease in the range of choice in urban environmental policy-making, the roll-out phase has been synonymous with a dramatic change in the actors involved in policy-making. Because the environment is considered by local authorities to be a top priority issue, the networks of actors mobilized around these issues are increasingly elitist. Indeed, during the first phase, grassroots groups or NGOs played an important role in environmental urban decision-making and they adopted a particular stance of both cooperation with and criticism of local authorities. They also had a significant role in the politicization of local environmental issues through inquiries and campaigns. For example, in Saint-Etienne, the FRAPNA, in spite of its cooperation with the council, decided to launch court cases on controversial issues such as water pollution. It was the same in Manchester, where, for example, green groups were instrumental in the politicization of the controversy over runway building in the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>During the 1990s, involvement by grassroots groups became weaker and the transformations in urban management – the need to involve business actors, the desire to design proactive economic development strategies, the need to work behind closed doors in order to facilitate cooperation between actors, and so on – have contributed to make their stance inappropriate for the new way of framing urban environmental problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969776411428562">Mayer, 2007</xref>). This evolution had also been reinforced by the rise of ecological modernization theories within environmental circles. Furthermore, the increasing involvement of urban political elites in policy-making networks has contributed to marginalizing the resources – such as links with the population, the fact that these groups were intermediaries between the claims of social groups and the council – held by these ‘traditional’ environmental groups. As a consequence, from about 2000, if these groups were involved in the design of environmental policies, it was too frequently a symbolic inclusion aimed at contributing to the legitimacy of these policies, but devoid of real influence on the policy process. So, if there is a desire to encourage participation by civil society and social movements, it is more, to quote Crouch, a wish to ‘encourage the maximum level of minimal participation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969776411428562">2004</xref>: 112). In contrast, these environmental groups have been replaced by environmental consultants (CIRIDD and RCT in Saint-Etienne, Sustainability Northwest and Creative Concern in Manchester) and by private actors – such as the developer Urban Splash in the case of the ‘environmental’ regeneration of New Islington in Manchester – who have provided expertise around environmental issues.</p>
<p>This transformation of the composition of the policy networks mobilized around urban environmental issues has been induced by two main factors. First, urban governance is more and more characterized by the need to prevent the emergence of urban conflicts. In Manchester, environmental conflicts that in the 1980s could be considered as conflicts over particular issues have tended to become more and more conflicts over the regulatory structure and the principles of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969776411428562">Dahl, 1982</xref>). They were increasingly linked to the global entrepreneurial strategy of the council and they were one of the main threats to the legitimacy of this strategy. In order to displace or avoid the emergence of such conflicts, urban political elites have tended to select what Crouch describes as ‘responsible partners’, that is, actors who could participate in debates and express disagreement but who operate within an overall model of consensus and agreement on the general objectives of urban market-oriented redevelopment. Secondly, there has been a change in the nature and forms of political legitimacy. As urban political elites have increasingly oriented their legitimacy strategies towards the outputs of their action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0969776411428562">Scharpf, 1999</xref>), they have given priority to actors who own resources that could be used in the production of urban policies, for example, fund-raising skills, money and the capacity to understand the new language of governmental officials.</p>
<p>In Manchester as well as in Saint-Etienne, environmental groups have been confronted with a sharp dilemma: to continue to be radical and to be excluded from policy-making, or to adopt an accommodationist stance and to accept the new rules of the game in terms of consensual urban politics. The case of MERCi is a good example of this new constraint. MERCi is an independent charity working on urban sustainability. This organization was set up by a group of green activists who took part in environmental protests in the 1990s. At first, and owing to its activity in contesting the construction of a second runway for Manchester Airport, the group had a marginal role in environmental policy-making. In the early 2000s, MERCi started to attract a lot of public funds from the central government and from the European Union.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0969776411428562">13</xref></sup> This capacity to attract money was crucial in the creation of links with local authorities. Local political actors started to reconsider MERCi as a responsible partner with the capacity to attract money and to deliver projects. Like MERCi, some other groups in Manchester and in Saint-Etienne have now adopted a ‘self-limiting stance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969776411428562">Arato and Cohen, 1992</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0969776411428562">14</xref></sup> in order to maintain their influence over policy-making. This evolution has led to a ‘de-radicalization’ of these groups as regards urban environmental issues, which often takes the form of a shift from ‘campaigning’ to ‘lifestyle’.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has been centrally concerned with tracing the evolution of environmental governance and regulation at the urban scale. It has argued that the politics of urban sustainability should be seen as a specific form of urban environmental regulation that has dominated the 1990s and the early 2000s because of the particular context. One of the key aspects of this sustainability framework was the insertion of environmental policies within the logics of ecological modernization, which promote urban competitiveness as a central imperative. This implied a deep restructuring of urban environmental problems, which are no longer considered as an end in themselves and which are increasingly dominated by an elitist vision. As a consequence, some actors – especially grassroots or radical ones – and social groups tend to be marginalized or ignored.</p>
<p>One of the key aims of the article has been to contribute to the literature on urban environmental regulation and governance, particularly in terms of thinking through the selectivity of urban sustainability concerning the targets of environmental management and the actors involved in this management. Even though sustainability seems to be more and more superseded by the rise of climate change and carbon control as new ‘master concepts’ of environmental regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969776411428562">Bulkeley and Betsill, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0969776411428562">While et al., 2010</xref>), the trends outlined here could continue in the future. Recent urban environmental restructuring around climate change seems to be closer to an intensification of the sustainability logics than to a reconsideration of these logics. The prominence of market-based solutions, the weight of symbolic strategies of green marketing, the executive shift in environmental management, the prioritization – produced both by the state and by local elites – of certain issues over others and the obsessive fear of conflicts and adversarial behaviour seem to be becoming stronger within the climate change framework.</p>
<p>Although one can say that environmental issues are now taken more and more ‘seriously’ by local authorities, their reshaping in terms of both contents and urban policy-making is far from unproblematic in terms of democracy. In a stimulating book, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969776411428562">Colin Crouch (2004)</xref> stresses how contemporary Western societies are characterized by an elitist consensus between ‘responsible partners’ around market-oriented policy packages. He stresses that the historical peak of democracy is now over, and that Western societies are witnessing a post-democratic era characterized by the rise of political communication, the disempowerment of the masses, the rise of the flexible firm as the key model of organization and the marginalization of social movements and trade unions. Erik Swyngedouw – influenced by the invigorating insights of post-Marxist philosophers such as Zizeck or Rancière – shows in some of his recent works that the contemporary political framing of environmental issues contributes to the consolidation of a post-political condition and that sustainability policies seem to be in the vanguard of the rise of this post-democratic era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0969776411428562">Swyngedouw, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0969776411428562">2009</xref>). The Manchester and Saint-Etienne cases have revealed a similar evolution at the urban scale. The shift from demand-side policies to supply-side policies, the influence of economic actors in environmental governance, the eviction/marginalization of urban environmental grassroots movements and the attempt to avoid and displace conflicts are all strong signs of the emergence of post-democratic urban environmental policies and are also the darkest side of the new involvement of urban elites in environmental issues.</p>

<p>It is argued that two main logics can be identified in the activities of local government: a ‘politics logic’, driven by electoral competition and the construction of an electoral base, and a ‘policy logic’, aimed at producing urban policies and strategies and addressing urban problems. These two different kinds of activity correspond to two different sources of legitimacy for local political elites: an input-oriented legitimacy and an output-oriented legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0969776411428562">Scharpf, 1999</xref>).</p></fn> <fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0969776411428562">

<p>Generally speaking, the process of ecological modernization relates back to a fundamental change in the way of thinking about and tackling environmental issues at the national scale. During the 1980s, central governments moved from a bureaucratic and curative stance to a proactive stance in which environmental issues are seen not as a curb on economic growth but as one of its driving forces. For example, from this point of view, technological innovation is one of the main tools used to tackle the ecological crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969776411428562">Hajer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969776411428562">Harvey, 1996</xref>). It is now obvious that a similar evolution has also started in cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969776411428562">Desfor and Keil, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0969776411428562">Pickvance, 2011</xref>).</p></fn> <fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-0969776411428562">

<p>One good example of this is the regeneration of Cardroom Estate in Ancoats, now called New Islington. In 1999, this estate was integrated into the Millennium Community Programme, a programme used to raise private investments by ‘de-risking’ key parts of the city for investors.</p></fn>

<p>Some members of Angenius – an organization created by Thanh Nghiem and some influential businessmen and experts in 2002 – were present during this study trip. The main goal of this organization was to provide resources to local authorities and businesses to implement sustainable development strategies. This organization is very close to WWF and BioRegional. It was the instigator of the One Planet Living standards in France.</p></fn>

<p>This programme followed the Grenelle de l’Environnement organized by the French government in 2007. It was a large consultation of politicians, scientists, business people and academics on environmental issues that led to the creation of a new French environmental strategy. One of the outcomes of the Grenelle de l’Environnement was the Plan Ville Durable (‘Sustainable City National Strategy’) launched by the French Minister for the Environment, Jean-Louis Borloo, in 2008.</p></fn>

<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969776411428562">Arato and Cohen (1992)</xref>, self-limiting radicalism relates back to the stance of social movements that try to change society without challenging the main economic and political order. The aim of these new social movements is not revolutionary. They want to pursue reforms through existing political structures. This stance seems to be widespread among environmental urban activists in the context of the emergence of sustainability and of neoliberal hegemony.</p></fn>
