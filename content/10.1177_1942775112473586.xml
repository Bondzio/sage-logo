<p>The spring issue of <italic>Journal of Research on Leadership Education</italic> (JRLE) is both exciting and fresh. The issue highlights various innovative approaches to pedagogy, such as in the Cranston and Kusanovich article on “The Drama in School Leadership: An Arts-Based Approach to Understanding the Ethical Dimensions of Decision Making for Educational Leadership” and the Diem and Carpenter article on “Examining Race-Related Silences: Interrogating the Education of Tomorrow’s Leaders.” The issue’s lead article by Hackmann and McCarthy on “What Constitutes a Critical Mass? An Investigation of Faculty Staffing Patterns in Educational Leadership Programs” lays out how the faculty staffing patterns in 217 university-based leadership preparation programs mark notable staffing pattern changes in the hiring practices at different types of institutions with a general and overall trend to replace outgoing tenured faculty lines with clinical faculty hires. The Clayton, Sanzo, and Myran article on “Understanding Mentoring in Leadership Development: Perspectives of District Administrators and Aspiring Leaders” underscores an area that interferes with successful mentoring, which is the increasing time pressures on seated principals for accountability measures today, and second, how to unpack what to do at the university level to create a more meaningful internship experiences for mentees that take into account the development and sustainability of the mentor/mentee relationship. Interestingly, the Zambo and Isai article on “Action Research and the Education Doctorate: New Promises and Visions” illustrates the growth and development of one doctoral student in a newly designed educational leadership doctorate that engaged the student in applying action research and involving others in inquiry to address a problem of practice. The final article in the issue, by Scott and Webber, “Entrepreneurialism for Canadian Principals: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow,” examines the past, present, and future anticipated social and political pressures on principals in Canada and elsewhere and expands the authors’ Life Long Learning Leader (4L) leadership framework. The article links findings from the International Study of the Preparation of Principals (ISPP) to demonstrate the utility of the 4L framework beyond Canada and explores implications for leadership development in other cultural contexts.</p>
<p>As we reflected on the quality and scope of the work presented in this issue, we were impressed by the pedagogical innovations and ongoing program development and improvements described by these scholars. Clearly, changes are occurring in a number of ways in how professors approach their teaching and relationships with students and school districts and how they think about the work students engage. For example, teaching the ethical dimension of decision making through drama in which students act out their roles and experience with the felt ambiguity of making a difficult and ethical decision (see Cranston &amp; Kusanovich)—a kinesthetic approach to learning that involves much more than reading a case—is an innovative pedagogical practice. Moreover, the importance of engaging in difficult conversations about race (see Diem &amp; Carpenter) necessitates that we challenge our own silences around White Privilege, palpable in the data shared in the examples in the article. We must acknowledge how silence is anything but “golden.” Although an adage of an era past, an adage we must call into question today, the article tackles how we interrogate these silences in fresh ways. We also see from the Clayton et al. article how important it is to devise “mutual projects to concretely benefit the school district.” Our mentors and mentees may be well matched but to connect in meaningful work that sustains the relationship, the work must be integral to the school district and life of the principal. We learned from Scott and Webber being a “cultural traveler” (as cited in Slater et al., 2007, see article) applies to both Canadian and international perspectives of how “to overtly teach and promote the development of entrepreneurial capacities emphasizing instructional, entrepreneurial, and inclusive approaches.” We applaud programmatic changes described by Zambo and Isai to connect action research to doctoral-level work where students grapple with real problems. Finally, Hackmann and McCarthy’s findings cause concern about more recent staffing patterns and other practices.</p>
<p>We invite you to read the issue with joy! There is much to learn.</p>
