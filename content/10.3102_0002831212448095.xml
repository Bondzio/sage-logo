<p>Despite its centrality in teaching, what it takes to identify the goals of instruction and use those goals to manage the work has yet to be articulated in ways that it can be adequately studied or taught. Using data from preservice teachers’ mathematics lessons, this study identifies and illustrates seven central tasks of “steering instruction toward the mathematical point”: attending to and managing multiple purposes, spending instructional time on mathematical work, spending instructional time on the intended mathematics, making sure students are doing the mathematical work, developing and maintaining a mathematical storyline, opening up and emphasizing key mathematical ideas, and keeping a focus on meaning. Findings can inform teacher education, research on teaching, and the design of curriculum materials.</p>

<p>The ambitious vision of mathematical proficiency for all students requires skillful instruction that is rare in U.S. classrooms. The literature is replete with examples of teachers who adopt surface features of new curricula but do not use these materials to teach for understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002831212448095">Cohen, 1990</xref>), efforts to “make math fun” that result in art projects instead of mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002831212448095">Hill et al., 2008</xref>), motivating examples and representations that distort the mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002831212448095">Heaton, 1992</xref>), and problems intended to engage students in high-level mathematical thinking that deteriorate into lower-level or routine tasks as they are implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831212448095">Stein, Smith, Henningsen, &amp; Silver, 2000</xref>). In short, a significant gap exists between reformers’ aspirations for students’ mathematics learning and modal instructional practice. Although many rue this gap, few studies have examined in detail what is involved in teaching for mathematical proficiency. But a closer look reveals an important clue: In each of these examples, teachers seem to miss the mathematical point of the task or lesson or have difficulty maintaining the mathematical focus once an activity is in motion with students.</p>
<p>Teachers are responsible for organizing time and resources so that what students do actually leads to learning. Yet what it takes to “teach to the point”—that is, to have a clear understanding of the goals of instruction and to use those goals to manage the work—is not well understood. This study used data from mathematics lessons taught by 17 preservice teachers to examine what is involved in “steering” instruction toward its mathematical goals, a component of teaching practice that I argue is foundational to high-quality mathematics instruction.</p>
<sec id="section1-0002831212448095">
<title>Goals of the Study</title>
<p>Although it is clear that teaching matters for improving student learning, <italic>how</italic> it matters has been more difficult to document (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831212448095">Hiebert &amp; Grouws, 2007</xref>). “Opportunity to learn” has been identified as one of the most important concepts linking teaching and student achievement:
<disp-quote>
<p>The emphasis teachers place on different learning goals and different topics, the expectations for learning they set, the time they allocate for particular topics, the kinds of tasks they pose, the kinds of questions they ask and responses they accept, the nature of the discussions they lead—all are part of teaching and all influence the opportunities students have to learn. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831212448095">Hiebert &amp; Grouws, 2007</xref>, p. 379)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, teachers shape the mathematical learning opportunities available to students through the identification and prioritization of learning goals and through the design and implementation of instruction to meet those goals. Understanding the work of identifying goals and using them to guide instruction could therefore enable more nuanced study of the connection between teaching and student achievement.</p>
<p>Articulating what is involved in identifying and using goals in instruction also has implications for the preparation and ongoing education of teachers. The ineffectiveness of traditional approaches to teacher education has prompted a growing awareness of the need to focus teacher education on practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002831212448095">Ball &amp; Forzani, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831212448095">Franke, Kazemi, &amp; Battey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002831212448095">Grossman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002831212448095">Grossman &amp; McDonald, 2008</xref>). This shift places new demands on teacher educators, including the need to specify the complex and integrated work of teaching so it can be studied, analyzed, and rehearsed. Such “decomposition of practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002831212448095">Grossman et al., 2009</xref>) requires frameworks and tools for parsing practice, as well as language for describing it—both of which are lacking in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002831212448095">Grossman &amp; McDonald, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite its centrality in teaching, the work of identifying and using goals in instruction has yet to be specified in such a way that it can be adequately studied or taught. This study probed this core aspect of teaching, in particular, the work of using mathematical goals to steer instruction during a lesson’s enactment. Three questions framed the research:</p>

</list>
<p>Although grounded in empirical data, it is important to note that this is a study of <italic>teaching</italic>, not <italic>teachers</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831212448095">Hiebert &amp; Grouws, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002831212448095">Stigler &amp; Hiebert, 1999</xref>). That is, even though I analyzed data from lessons taught by particular teachers, I am not trying to make claims about what these teachers know or can do or whether they had goals or taught to them. My aim is to describe the <italic>work</italic> of teaching, in particular, the work of steering instruction toward the mathematical point.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0002831212448095">
<title>Theoretical Foundations</title>
<p>Teaching is, at its heart, being responsible for getting other people to learn something. Doing this requires knowing what that “something” is and deliberately designing and steering instruction so that learners can learn it. In other words, teaching is <italic>purposeful</italic> work.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831212448095">Hiebert and Grouws (2007)</xref> define teaching as consisting of “classroom interactions among teachers and students around content directed toward facilitating students’ achievement of learning goals” (p. 372). In this triadic relationship, teachers interact directly with their students and directly with the content; they also mediate the student-content relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002831212448095">Cohen, Raudenbush, &amp; Ball, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002831212448095">Lampert, 2001</xref>). The “work of teaching” is what is involved in managing these dynamic relationships as students “do the complementary work of making a relationship with the content to learn it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002831212448095">Lampert, 2001</xref>, p. 423). These interactions occur simultaneously and over time and are influenced by the contexts in which they occur.</p>
<p>This study focuses on one aspect of the work of mathematics teaching: “steering” instruction so that students are engaged in the intended mathematical work. I view steering instruction as a component of “teaching to the mathematical point” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002831212448095">Sleep, 2009</xref>), which I define as three interdependent types of work: (a) articulating the mathematical point, (b) orienting the instructional activity, and (c) steering the instruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0002831212448095">Figure 1</xref>). The first two are centered on the specification and coordination of goals and plans, or what I call “mathematical purposing.” The result of mathematical purposing, which can occur both before and during instruction, is an articulation of the mathematical learning goals for students, an understanding of how the activity is intended to move students toward those goals, and a detailing of the task and possible teacher moves that position the activity so it is more likely to engage students with the intended mathematics. Steering instruction involves deploying teaching moves during an activity’s enactment in order to keep students engaged with the intended mathematics. There is a temporal, cyclic relationship between the work of mathematical purposing and steering instruction: To steer instruction toward the mathematical point, the mathematical point must be known. The work of steering then informs the work of mathematical purposing, for example, the mathematical point might change or the connection between the activity and the intended mathematics become clearer. In decomposing the work of steering instruction, I seek to identify subcomponents of the work, which I refer to as “tasks of steering instruction toward the mathematical point.”</p>

</fig>
<p>The conceptualization of instruction as interactions between the teacher, students, and content does not assume a particular type of pedagogy or “teaching style,” curriculum use or nonuse; nor does the conceptualization of teaching to the mathematical point. However, in this study, I do make assumptions about the nature of the mathematical learning goals that are part of “the mathematical point”: I assume that the ultimate goal of mathematics instruction is to develop the mathematical proficiency of all students. I adopt the definition of “mathematical proficiency” proposed by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831212448095">National Research Council (2001)</xref>, which has achieved wide consensus in the mathematics education community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831212448095">Franke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831212448095">Hiebert &amp; Grouws, 2007</xref>). In this definition, mathematical proficiency reflects what “is necessary for anyone to learn mathematics successfully” and consists of the following five “interwoven and interdependent” strands: conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, strategic competence, adaptive reasoning, and productive disposition. In analyzing the work of steering instruction toward the mathematical point, I consider ways in which the work supports the development of students’ mathematical proficiency.</p>

<title>Data and Methods of Analysis</title>
<p>To decompose the work of steering instruction toward the mathematical point and identify its concomitant challenges, I analyzed data from 17 mathematics lessons taught by preservice elementary teachers. Because novices are likely to have difficulty steering instruction, preservice teaching might seem a peculiar site for this study. However, such “bumps and bruises” make visible aspects of the work that might “go unnoticed in the smoother practice of more experienced teachers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002831212448095">Heaton, 2000</xref>, p. 16). In other words, “the neophyte’s stumble becomes the scholar’s window” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002831212448095">Shulman, 1987</xref>, p. 4).</p>
<sec id="section4-0002831212448095">
<title>Participating Teachers</title>
<p>The 17 participants were undergraduates in their student-teaching semester of a teacher education program at a large public university in the Midwestern United States. Preservice teachers were selected based on their scores on a survey of mathematical knowledge for teaching (MKT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002831212448095">Ball, Thames, &amp; Phelps, 2008</xref>) developed and validated by the Learning Mathematics for Teaching (LMT) project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002831212448095">Hill, Rowan, &amp; Ball, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002831212448095">Hill, Schilling, &amp; Ball, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002831212448095">Schilling &amp; Hill, 2007</xref>). The survey contained multiple-choice questions reflecting common mathematics problems encountered in elementary school classrooms. To ensure that the sample for this study reflected a range of MKT, all preservice teachers in their final year of the program (<italic>n</italic> = 50) were invited to take the survey; 30 participated. To select the sample, the surveys were anonymized and scored, and then the average IRT scores (i.e., the estimate of each participant’s ability) were sorted, with scores ranging from −1.0698 to 1.9529. The top six formed the high-score group, the middle six the middle-score group, and the bottom six scores the low-score group. All 18 of these teachers agreed to participate in the next phase of the study; however, one preservice teacher ultimately had to drop out, leaving a sample of 17.</p>
<p>Although selection was based on MKT scores, I am not trying here to make claims about the relationship between MKT and steering instruction. Instead, participants with a range of MKT were selected because subject matter knowledge has been shown to influence teachers’ interpretation and use of curriculum and their teaching practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002831212448095">Borko, Livingston, McCaleb, &amp; Mauro, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002831212448095">Hill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002831212448095">Kahan, Cooper, &amp; Bethea, 2003</xref>). I hypothesized that differences in MKT might make different aspects of the work of teaching visible in the data.</p>

<sec id="section5-0002831212448095">
<title>Data</title>
<p>Each preservice teacher was observed teaching one mathematics lesson and was interviewed, that same day, both before and after teaching. Recordings were made of all interviews (audio) and lessons (video), and all recordings transcribed. Any curriculum materials and written lesson plans were collected.</p>
<sec id="section6-0002831212448095">
<title>Pre-lesson interviews</title>
<p>The semi-structured pre-lesson interview had four parts. It began with questions about preservice teachers’ goals for the lesson. The second part asked preservice teachers to walk through their plan for the lesson. As they described each activity, their rationales for decisions, their understanding of key mathematical features, and the activity’s main point were probed. The third part returned to global questions about the lesson’s main point(s) and what they were most confident or unsure about. The fourth and final part of the interview focused on how they prepared for the lesson.</p>

Fifteen of the lessons were based on the <italic>Everyday Mathematics</italic> curriculum; two (Andrea’s and Mia’s) were not textbook-based. As I observed each lesson, I identified episodes in which the teacher did not seem to act in accordance with her or his stated goals (e.g., choosing an example that did not align with the expressed mathematical point or not taking up a student comment that was directly related to one of the lesson’s mathematical goals). Such “goal shifts” have been found to be useful sites for investigating teacher decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002831212448095">Aguirre &amp; Speer, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Post-lesson interviews</title>
<p>The post-lesson interview began with preservice teachers’ reactions to the lesson followed by general questions, including what they thought students had learned. In most cases, we then watched short video clips (e.g., 2 to 3 minutes each) of the episodes identified during the lesson observation. Preservice teachers were instructed to interrupt the video at any point to explain what they were thinking or why they made particular decisions; I frequently stopped the video to ask questions as well. The interview concluded with additional questions about their goals. All post-lesson interviews occurred the same day that the lesson was taught. Most began within 20 minutes of the lesson’s conclusion; some occurred later in the day (e.g., at lunch or after school).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0002831212448095">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>I began the analysis by identifying general themes—based on the literature, my own teaching and teacher education experience, and my observations during data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002831212448095">Ryan &amp; Bernard, 2000</xref>)—about what is involved in determining mathematical goals and using those goals to design and steer instruction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002831212448095">1</xref></sup> I organized these ideas into preliminary categories, which were used in an initial coding of the entire data set. During this analysis, categories and subcategories were reorganized and added, in particular, to accommodate teaching moves or responses to interview questions that did not fit the initial categories.</p>
<p>The next stage of analysis was a focused coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002831212448095">Charmaz, 2006</xref>, p. 58) of a subset of the data with the revised categories. Because I thought variation in MKT would make different aspects of the work visible, I selected a subsample of eight lessons based on MKT scores, which created a manageable size for in-depth analysis while still maintaining adequate variation. This stage of analysis had two purposes: (a) to ensure the categories developed in the initial coding sufficiently captured the data and (b) to further decompose the work through a more detailed unpacking of the “insides” of each category. Having already made an initial pass through all of the data, I knew what preservice teachers’ stated goals were and how their lessons unfolded, which enabled me, at this point, to code the interview and lesson transcripts turn by turn. First, I analyzed each pre-lesson interview transcript, coding examples in each category. Second, I watched the lesson video and analyzed each turn in the transcript using the following questions: (a) What is the teacher doing (or could be doing) at this moment to steer students toward her or his mathematical learning goals? and (b) What does this moment have to do with the mathematical point of the lesson? Next, I analyzed the post-lesson interview for additional insight about these questions and then fit the moves into the categorization scheme. With each iteration, the coding framework became increasingly stable; by the time I coded the entire subsample, I was no longer adding categories and subcategories. This final coding scheme reflects the tasks of steering instruction reported in this study.</p>
<p>The last stage was to apply the coding framework to the remaining lessons in the data set. In addition to marking instances in which preservice teachers could be interpreted as engaging in a task of steering instruction, when applicable, I noted whether the move seemed to steer instruction toward the mathematical point or move things off track. After coding all of the data, I compiled these instances and identified patterns, which are discussed in the next section.</p>

<title>Results: Tasks of Steering Instruction Toward the Mathematical Point</title>
<p>Based on my analysis, I decomposed the work of steering instruction toward the mathematical point into seven central tasks:</p>
<list id="list2-0002831212448095" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>attending to and managing multiple purposes,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>spending instructional time on <italic>mathematical</italic> work,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>spending instructional time on the <italic>intended</italic> mathematics,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>making sure <italic>students</italic> are doing the mathematical work,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>developing and maintaining a mathematical storyline,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>opening up and emphasizing key mathematical ideas, and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>keeping a focus on meaning.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Some of the tasks focus on the strategic use of instructional time, including the need to manage competing purposes while still steering instruction toward the mathematical point and the need to ensure that students are engaging in the intended mathematical work; other tasks reflect the importance of coherence and meaning in purposefully steering instruction. As a set, these tasks constitute key components of steering instruction toward the mathematical point. In this section, I use examples from the data to illustrate strategies for enacting each task and problematic issues that can arise when trying to do so.</p>
<p>Four additional points are important to keep in mind. First, I am not claiming that all of these tasks, strategies, or issues are new. Having drawn initial categories from the literature, this study builds on and synthesizes prior work, situating it in the practice of steering instruction. Thus, the main contribution of this study is conceptualizing “steering instruction toward the mathematical point” and bringing these practices together to decompose this central aspect of the work of teaching. Second, because my purpose is an analytic decomposition, I focus on each task of steering instruction independently; however, during instruction, tasks overlap and occur simultaneously. Third, a particular task of steering instruction is not associated with a specific set of teaching moves; similarly, a particular teaching move can be used to enact multiple tasks. And fourth, some of the problematic issues that arise when trying to steer instruction toward the mathematical point might be attributable to the situation (e.g., the curriculum being used) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002831212448095">Kennedy, 2010</xref>). Because this study aims to decompose the <italic>work</italic> of steering instruction, I do not consider the causes of particular issues at this time. However, in practice, the role of situation—as well as other factors such as MKT—in helping (or not helping) to steer instruction is crucial.</p>
<sec id="section11-0002831212448095">
<title>Attending to and Managing Multiple Purposes</title>
<p>A central task of steering instruction toward the mathematical point is attending to and managing multiple purposes. A recurrent theme in the literature is that teaching requires managing multiple purposes and that these purposes are often in conflict (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002831212448095">Kennedy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831212448095">Lampert, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002831212448095">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002831212448095">Leinhardt, 1993</xref>). When steering instruction toward the mathematical point, not all instructional decisions will be—or should be—decided for mathematical reasons; yet decisions made to achieve nonmathematical purposes can impact whether a lesson stays on its intended mathematical course. Thus, a key strategy for attending to and managing multiple purposes in ways that steer instruction toward the mathematical point is choosing to address nonmathematical purposes in ways that not only achieve those nonmathematical purposes, but also simultaneously support, or at least do not detract from, the intended mathematical work.</p>
<p>For example, a common nonmathematical purpose is to motivate and engage students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002831212448095">Kennedy, 2005</xref>). In some cases, a decision made to engage students has no impact on the mathematics. For instance, to foster student engagement in her second-grade lesson, Courtney changed the textbook’s word problems to use names of her students, which did not impact the mathematics available in those problems. In other cases, though, decisions made for nonmathematical purposes do impact the mathematical work. For example, decisions made to increase student engagement can enhance the mathematics of a lesson. For instance, in her lesson on reading and interpreting bar graphs, two of Mia’s nonmathematical purposes were to increase student engagement and to gain access to students’ thinking. To accomplish these, she routinely asked students to explain how they got their answers. Thus, although giving mathematical explanations was not one of her explicit learning goals, because Mia asked for explanations to further her nonmathematical purposes, students were given opportunities to develop this aspect of mathematical proficiency.</p>
<p>Decisions made to foster student engagement can also detract from the mathematical point. For example, Hannah taught a lesson on equivalence in which students placed different combinations of seven unifix cubes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002831212448095">2</xref></sup> on each side of a pan balance and recorded the resulting equations (e.g., 4 + 3 = 7, or 5 + 1 + 1 = 7). In her launch of the activity, Hannah tried to pique her first graders’ interest: “Watch me. I have two magical sticks of unifix cubes. Do you know why they’re magical? . . . Because they are equivalent.” Throughout the activity, Hannah repeatedly referred to the “magical balance” or commented that it was “like magic” that the two sets of cubes were equal. Whether Hannah’s talk about magic impacted student learning is not known; however, it seems that a mathematical, rather than magical, framing would better support the development of mathematical proficiency.</p>
<p>Efforts to manage mathematical and nonmathematical purposes can also distort the mathematics or degrade the mathematical learning goals. For example, in Nicole’s lesson on decimals, her nonmathematical purpose of alleviating students’ anxiety led to a reduction in both the quality and quantity of mathematics in her lesson. Although the lesson was designed to develop students’ understanding of the relationship between tenths and hundredths, because she thought the lesson was “developmentally inappropriate” for her third-grade students (N-Pre, R21),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0002831212448095">3</xref></sup> Nicole focused on telling students the names of the places and that it is acceptable to say “and” when naming decimals. Thus, Nicole’s nonmathematical goal of “not stressing students out” resulted in impoverished mathematical goals and an essentially decimal-free lesson.</p>

<title>Spending Instructional Time on Mathematical Work</title>
<p>The second task of steering instruction toward the mathematical point—spending instructional time on <italic>mathematical</italic> work—is in many ways an obvious part of the work: To learn math, students need to spend time on math. Yet, it is worth explicitly naming because the literature is filled with examples of mathematics instruction that is <italic>not</italic> spent on mathematics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002831212448095">Kennedy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831212448095">Stein et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Lessons necessarily involve some nonmathematical work (e.g., distributing materials, transitioning between activities, etc.). One way to ensure that more time is spent on mathematical work is to reduce time spent on such necessary but nonmathematical elements. For instance, teachers can organize materials in advance and transition quickly between activities, perhaps using well-established routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002831212448095">Leinhardt, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002831212448095">Leinhardt, Weidman, &amp; Hammond, 1987</xref>). When an activity involves cutting out or coloring materials, teachers can reduce the amount of instructional time spent on such nonmathematical work by doing some of the cutting or coloring for the students. For example, in Rachel’s second-grade lesson, students folded paper squares to explore fraction concepts. Although the teacher’s guide suggested that students cut out their own squares, Rachel decided to cut the squares in advance, which meant students did not have to do this nonmathematical work during the lesson. A similar move can be made during instruction. For instance, in Larkin’s fifth-grade lesson on symmetry, her students folded and cut out kites. When most students were ready to move on, there was still one student who had not cut out his kite. Instead of having the class wait, Larkin discreetly cut out his kite while transitioning students to the next part of the lesson. This move reduced class time spent on nonmathematical work, yet because the work Larkin completed for the student was nonmathematical, it did not take away his opportunity to engage with the intended mathematics.</p>
<p>Some seemingly nonmathematical work may in fact engage students with the intended mathematics, which means that to steer instruction toward the mathematical point, teachers would not want to reduce time spent on these aspects of an activity. For example, once students had their paper squares, Rachel led the class through one of the lesson’s main activities— folding the squares in halves, fourths, and eighths in multiple ways. She elicited different ways to fold and used the activity to emphasize that fractions require equal parts. Although much instructional time was spent folding squares, this was part of the <italic>mathematical</italic> work of the lesson. Thus, it would not have served her mathematical purposes to reduce time spent folding.</p>
<p>Sometimes a teacher’s effort to reduce time spent on nonmathematical work can steer instruction away from the mathematical point. For instance, the next part of Rachel’s lesson used the folded squares to introduce naming and writing fractions. The textbook suggested that students color a given number of parts on one of their squares and then name the fraction of the square that is colored and not colored. Rachel decided <italic>not</italic> to have students color because she thought “it would have been chaotic” (R-Post, T131). Instead, she held up a folded square, covered some of its parts with her hand, and asked students to name the fraction represented by the uncovered region. Although in most cases students could answer her questions correctly, there were times when it was unclear to which part of the square she was referring. Thus, Rachel’s decision to reduce nonmathematical work (i.e., coloring) adversely impacted students’ engagement with the intended mathematics.</p>
<p>Another reason that time is spent on nonmathematical rather than mathematical work is student (and teacher) confusion. This happened in Sydney’s first-grade lesson when she used the same names—Lou and Lisa—in the first two problems she posed to her class:</p>
<list id="list3-0002831212448095" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Problem 1: <italic>Lou saved four cents. Lisa saved six cents. Who saved more money? How much more?</italic></p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Problem 2: <italic>Lou saved three pennies and Lisa saved six pennies. Who saved more pennies and by how much more?</italic></p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Compounded by the fact that she did not write the second problem on the board and that she read it incorrectly, both Sydney and her students could not keep track of how many pennies each person had, which resulted in wasted time and detracted from the mathematical point.</p>
<p>Situating a mathematics activity in a nonmathematical context can also reduce the amount of time spent on mathematics and make it harder to steer instruction toward the mathematical point. In Beth’s second-grade lesson, a nonmathematical context (food groups) was used to gather data for a subsequent mathematical activity. Beth expressed concern about the nonmathematical aspects of her lesson and made a number of modifications aimed at reducing the amount of time spent on nonmathematical work. Surprisingly, though, it was not in the food group part of the lesson where Beth spent more time than anticipated on nonmathematical issues. When trying to make their bar graphs, students were confused by the given template, and Beth ultimately had to interrupt the lesson to explain where the bars were supposed to be drawn. In the post-lesson interview, Beth reflected that it would have been preferable to spend more time before students began working to talk explicitly about how to use the representation (B-Post, T29-39). She also noticed that the explicit discussion of the representation enabled her to point out key ideas about working with bar graphs. Thus, not only can familiarizing students with representations increase time spent on mathematical work by reducing later confusion, it can further students’ engagement with the intended mathematics by creating an opportunity to discuss important mathematical ideas and simultaneously work on multiple mathematical goals.</p>
<p>Steering instruction toward the mathematical point does not imply that nonmathematical work should always be minimized. For example, Courtney intentionally <italic>added</italic> time to the transitions between her lesson’s activities by teaching different activities in different parts of the classroom. She argued that this nonmathematical time provided her second graders an opportunity to move during the lesson, which enabled them to better focus on the mathematics.</p>

<title>Spending Instructional Time on the Intended Mathematics</title>
<p>Spending more instructional time on mathematics does not ensure focus on the mathematical point. Even when students are engaged in mathematical work, they may not be moving toward the intended learning goals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002831212448095">Hill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002831212448095">Kennedy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831212448095">Stein et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, a third task of steering instruction toward the mathematical point is spending time on the intended—rather than unintended—mathematics.</p>
<p>One key strategy for spending time on the intended mathematics is the strategic selection of problems and examples. Such examples can be used to “draw attention to relevant features” or “attend to students’ errors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002831212448095">Zodik &amp; Zaslavsky, 2008</xref>). For instance, Jordan was concerned that her fifth graders had overgeneralized the “two negatives make a positive” rule that had been introduced by her cooperating teacher because, in a previous lesson, many students argued that −4 − 4 equals zero because there are two negatives. Therefore, throughout her lesson, Jordan focused on problems with two negative signs in varying places (e.g., −3 − 2; −3 + [−2]; 3 − [–2]), which kept her lesson in the intended mathematical territory.</p>
<p>Another way teachers can spend time on the intended mathematics is by raising a mathematical idea or method that is not offered by students. For example, in Jordan’s lesson, when discussing the problem −4 − 4, students did not make the error she had hoped to discuss (i.e., that it equals zero), so she brought up this incorrect answer herself. Similarly, when Courtney’s second-grade class was discussing number sentences that could represent the problem <italic>Avery scored 14 points. Ross scored 8 points. How many more points did Avery score than Ross?</italic>, her students volunteered 8 + ? = 14, but did not offer any other equations. Therefore, Courtney used a targeted question (“How could we use subtraction for a comparison problem?”) to elicit a subtraction number sentence.</p>
<p>Many factors can cause an activity to shift toward unintended mathematics. One common cause is that the cognitive demand of the activity is reduced during its set up or enactment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831212448095">Stein et al., 2000</xref>). For example, the use of leading questions or overly supportive representations can change the content of the mathematical work, resulting in students inadvertently doing less mathematically substantial work than intended or engaging with different mathematical ideas than the intended focus. Both of these issues were seen in Nicole’s third-grade lesson, which involved using base 10 blocks<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0002831212448095">4</xref></sup> to introduce decimals. After leading students to record that one rod and six little cubes corresponds to <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0002831212448095">
<mml:math display="inline" id="math1-0002831212448095">

</mml:mfrac>
</mml:mrow>
</mml:math>
</inline-formula>, Nicole tried to elicit how to represent this number as a decimal, asking if there is “another way that we could write it.” When this prompt did not evoke the desired response, she tried again using money:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Nicole:</speaker>
<p>This is really tricky guys, and I know it’s new, so we’re going to work on a different way to write it today. I want you to think about money. If this [the flat] is a dollar and these little cubes are pennies.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Mike:</speaker>
<p>Pennies.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Nicole:</speaker>
<p>How many pennies would we have?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Students:</speaker>
<p>Six.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Nicole:</speaker>
<p>Six pennies, so this [the rod] would be what? Ten pennies make what?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Students:</speaker>
<p>A dime.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Nicole:</speaker>
<p>A dime. So if I have one dime and six pennies, how much money do I have?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Paul:</speaker>
<p>A dime and a nickel and . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Vicki:</speaker>
<p>Sixteen cents.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Nicole:</speaker>
<p>Sixteen cents. Thank you, Vicki. Well, what if I had one dollar and sixteen cents, how would we write that? Show me on your slates, how we would write one dollar and sixteen cents?</p>
</speech>
<p>Base 10 blocks can be a powerful representation for place-value concepts. However, Nicole relied on money to name and describe the numbers represented by the blocks, and because students were familiar with money, they could record the number represented by the blocks without thinking about tenths and hundredths. Nicole did not prompt them to think about cents in relation to a dollar (e.g., a dime as one-tenth of a dollar). As a result, the cognitive demand was reduced, and the mathematical work shifted from place value and decimals to practice with dollars and cents.</p>
<p>In other cases, time is spent on <italic>unintended</italic> mathematics not because the cognitive demand is reduced, but because the work goes in a different mathematical direction than anticipated. This can happen when a student solves a problem using a method that draws on mathematical ideas different from the intended focus or asks a question that shifts the lesson’s mathematical course. It can also happen when the numbers selected for problems and examples lend themselves to methods unrelated to the intended mathematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831212448095">Rowland, 2008</xref>). For example, in Andrea’s fifth-grade lesson on division, the numbers in the warm-up problem did not set up the desired mathematical discussion. One of the goals of her lesson was for students to learn to use rounding to estimate how many times a two-digit divisor “goes in” at each step in the long division algorithm. For example, when using long division to divide 8,760 by 18, the first step is to divide 87 (hundreds) by 18. Andrea wanted students to complete this step by rounding 18 to 20, estimating that 87 divided by 20 is about 4, and concluding that 87 divided by 18 must also be about 4. She planned to introduce rounding the divisor using the following warm-up problem: <italic>A rope measuring 87.6 meters long is cut into 12 equal pieces. Estimate the length of each piece. Be prepared to explain your estimation strategy.</italic> She selected this problem because it asked students to “estimate,” which she saw as related to her goal of rounding. However, many students solved the problem by rounding 87.6 to 84 and using the known fact 12 × 7 = 84. Thus, although students were engaged in productive mathematical work, the warm-up problem did not initially steer the lesson toward rounding the divisor to 10 as Andrea had intended.</p>
<p>Another way the choice of numbers can steer a lesson toward unintended mathematics is when they are generated randomly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831212448095">Rowland, 2008</xref>). This was seen in Sydney’s lesson when she introduced “The Difference Game,” a partner activity in which each player draws a number card and counts out the corresponding number of pennies. The players then compare pennies, and the player who has more keeps the difference. To demonstrate, Sydney randomly drew two cards—3 and 0—from the deck. The random selection of 0 was problematic for the initial example because it did not support students’ learning how to set up the pennies or do the matching. Furthermore, the fact that 3 was both one of the original numbers and the difference between them was potentially confusing for students just learning what “difference” means. Obscuring the intended mathematics through numbers playing dual roles was an issue in one of Sydney’s other examples as well (i.e., 6 and 3 pennies have a difference of 3).</p>
<p>Another issue that can shift an activity toward unintended mathematical work is when it gets bogged down in a complicated mathematical idea or procedure that is not the intended focus. This was seen in Gillian’s fourth-grade lesson on metric measurement during which the class discussed the names and relationships among metric units of length and solved a few basic conversion problems (e.g., <italic>How many centimeters are there in 3 meters?</italic>). At the end of the lesson, Gillian had students complete a problem that asked them to measure two line segments (with lengths of 9 cm and 12 cm) to the nearest centimeter.</p>
<p>As students began working, Gillian spontaneously added that they should also convert their answers to decimeters, meters, and millimeters. Students were immediately confused about how to convert nine centimeters to decimeters. Many students said the answer was zero or that it couldn’t be done. Gillian tried to explain, but had trouble:
<disp-quote>
<p>So, could everyone pause for a moment and have a seat. What are we doing here? Okay, let’s try it one more time. Could everyone please have a seat? I’m going to explain what I mean, okay? So for the first one, let’s say the answer is nine centimeters. I’m thinking, in fact, let’s just do the first one if you haven’t done it yet, okay? So I’m thinking, how many decimeters are in nine centimeters? It’s just like our slate problems. And you might think zero, but zero would mean nothing and nine centimeters is not equal to nothing. Actually, I have centimeters and I know that one decimeter equals ten centimeters. So if I’m thinking okay, problem, I have less than ten, I’m thinking okay, how many do I have? In one whole decimeter is ten centimeters, that means ten out of ten centimeters equals one decimeter. But if I don’t have ten out of ten centimeters, then I have nine centimeters so I have nine out of ten centimeters, er, decimeters, because, okay. Ten out of ten is a whole, so ten out of ten decimeters equals one decimeter. This is a little bit confusing isn’t it?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Gillian’s decision to ask students to write their centimeter measures in decimeters, meters, and millimeters was certainly within the mathematical terrain of the lesson and is a task that could provide a rich context for mathematical work. However, this was not a task that could be easily completed by her students in the last 2 minutes of class. Gillian did not seem to recognize the significance for learners of switching the direction of the conversion and, because this was not her intended mathematical focus, was not prepared to explain the calculation. As a result, the lesson got bogged down in unproductive confusion.</p>
<p>In identifying the task of spending time on the intended mathematics as a component of steering instruction toward the mathematical point, I am not arguing that teachers must always adhere to their original plans. Teachers do intentionally change the mathematical course of their lessons, and in these situations, students <italic>are</italic> still engaged with the intended mathematics; the intended mathematics has just changed. Thus, steering instruction toward the mathematical point does not require teachers to always follow their plans. It does, however, require having a mathematical point and trying to steer instruction toward it—regardless of whether it is the original point or one that emerged during instruction.</p>

<title>Making Sure Students Are Doing the Mathematical Work</title>
<p>This task of steering instruction foregrounds the important idea that mathematics instruction is about student learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831212448095">Hiebert &amp; Grouws, 2007</xref>). If instructional time is <italic>not</italic> spent on the intended mathematics, then students will certainly not be engaged with it.

Asking questions that engage students in mathematical reasoning can help address this issue.

</inline-formula> was pre-labeled, students could generate correct fractions for the blanks simply by counting by fourths, without having to consider the number of equal parts into which the unit interval was divided. This is exactly what happened when Keri asked a student how she knew the number line was divided into fourths:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Keri:</speaker>
<p>So how did you know it was divided up into fourths?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Eliza:</speaker>
<p>Because the first problem is done for you.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Keri:</speaker>
<p>Okay, so they gave you one-fourth here. What if they didn’t give you this number at all and they just gave you these blank spaces, how might you know it’s in fourths still?</p>
</speech>
<p>In this episode, when Eliza responded that she knew the number line was divided into fourths because “the first problem is done for you,” Keri asked a strategic “what if” question to engage students in reasoning about the fraction concepts that were the mathematical point of her lesson. Asking questions that require students to reason can help ensure that it is the students—not the task—doing the mathematical work.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, another issue that can arise is that the teacher’s questions give away the answer, making it so students do not have to engage with the intended mathematics to respond correctly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002831212448095">Brousseau, 1997</xref>). Examples of leading questions doing the work for students could be seen throughout Irene’s first-grade lesson, which used dominoes to generate addition-subtraction fact families (e.g., the 3|5 domino corresponds to the 3-5-8 fact family; i.e., 3 + 5 = 8; 5 + 3 = 8; 8 − 5 = 3; 8 − 3 = 5). In her pre-lesson interview, Irene expressed multiple mathematical goals for her lesson: She had overarching goals of developing students’ understanding, as well as a conceptual learning goal for students (i.e., to understand the relationship between addition and subtraction), which she distinguished from the procedural goal of computing answers to addition and subtraction facts. Irene seemed to have thoughtfully analyzed the mathematics made available by the domino and decided it worked well for her purposes. During the lesson, though, instead of engaging students in thinking about relationships, she asked questions that simply required counting the number of dots to which she was pointing (e.g., “If I take away three, how many do I have here?”). Of course, it is possible that students were noticing the relationships themselves; however, Irene’s leading questions did not help steer attention toward her mathematical point.</p>
<p>It is important to note that what might be considered doing the work for students in one context can be seen as students engaging with the intended mathematics in another. In other words, what counts as “doing the work for the students” depends on the mathematical point. For example, when Andrea posed the warm-up problem to her fifth-grade students, she “gave away” that it could be solved using division:
<disp-quote>
<p>The first problem I want you to think about is this: If I have a rope that is eighty-seven and six-tenths long, meters long, so it’s a really long rope, and I want to cut it into twelve pieces, approximately how much, how long is each piece? So estimate how long each piece is. Do it on your paper. The rope is eighty-seven and six-tenths meters long. I want to estimate how long each of the twelve pieces is. So don’t solve eighty-seven and six-tenths divided by twelve, I want you to estimate. Estimate how long each one is.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, Andrea’s expressed mathematical point of this problem was to introduce rounding the divisor and estimating as a strategy for long division with two-digit divisors, not, for example, to discuss when division is an appropriate operation. As discussed earlier, the numbers were not ideal for her purposes, nor is it clear why she used a contextualized problem. And certainly, this can be seen as a missed opportunity to simultaneously work on multiple mathematical learning goals (e.g., developing students’ understanding of the meaning of division). But given Andrea’s point, telling students to use division did not do the intended mathematical work for them.</p>
<p>A common teaching strategy to get students into mathematical work is to complete examples together as a class. In some cases, however, this can take away students’ opportunities to do work on their own. In the data, this often occurred when teachers introduced a worksheet meant for independent work by doing some of the problems from the worksheet as a class. In extreme cases, the introduction of a task can leave no mathematical work for students to do on their own. This was seen in Beth’s second-grade lesson, which involved categorizing students’ favorite foods and then graphing the results. When Beth explained how to make a tally table from data represented in a picture graph (which was part of her expressed learning goals), she filled in a table at the overhead, having students “draw tallies in the air” as she recorded. Once Beth had recorded the tallies on the projected table, she asked students to complete an identical table on their worksheet, which then became an exercise in copying off the overhead.</p>
<p>The distribution of mathematical talk in a lesson also has implications for whether students are doing the mathematical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002831212448095">Chapin, O’Connor, &amp; Anderson, 2003</xref>). This does not mean that students should always talk more and teachers talk less; rather, the distribution of talk should be informed by the mathematical point. For example, in Jordan’s fifth-grade lesson on adding and subtracting integers, when a student gave a “real world” example for 5 + (−7) that actually corresponded to 5 – 7, Jordan explained the distinction herself because she thought it was important for students to hear a clear example for modeling the addition of a negative number. However, because mathematical reasoning is a component of mathematical proficiency, making mathematical arguments, giving explanations, making connections, and using mathematical language are, in fact, part of the <italic>content</italic> of mathematics instruction. Therefore, if teachers are the only ones giving explanations or making connections, <italic>students</italic> are not engaging in these mathematical practices.</p>

<title>Developing and Maintaining a Mathematical Storyline</title>
<p>A fifth task of steering instruction toward the mathematical point is developing and maintaining a mathematical storyline. Mathematics lessons need to be coherent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831212448095">Fernandez, Yoshida, &amp; Stigler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002831212448095">Leinhardt, 1989</xref>). One way to develop coherence is to design and maintain a “mathematical storyline”—a deliberate progression of the mathematical ideas. This involves making connections across mathematical work, both within and across lessons, and conveying the mathematical storyline to students.</p>
<p>One issue that can arise when developing a mathematical storyline is that it can be difficult to identify mathematical connections across a lesson’s activities. Furthermore, even if mathematical connections are identified, the activities need to be sequenced and implemented in ways that highlight the mathematical coherence. Both of these issues were seen in Larkin’s fifth-grade lesson on symmetry. Larkin’s lesson engaged students in a number of activities. First, the class discussed the previous day’s homework, which involved measuring angles. Larkin then described the homework students would complete that night on symmetry—the topic the lesson was intended to introduce. Next, each student folded and cut out a symmetrical kite. Larkin elicited students’ observations about the kite and their initial ideas about symmetry. There were a number of premade points on one side of the kite, which students reflected over the kite’s line of symmetry using a mirror. After marking the points, students measured the distance between the line of symmetry and selected points to conclude that corresponding points were equidistant from the line of symmetry. Students then completed and discussed a worksheet in which they drew the missing half of symmetrical shapes. To end, Larkin revisited the homework and introduced a mixed-review worksheet. If students finished, they could design their own kite.</p>
<p>Not only was the order of the activities confusing, Larkin did not make many <italic>mathematical</italic> connections across them. Certainly, all of the activities were related to symmetry; however, a coherent mathematical storyline requires more than topical connections. For example, when discussing the missing-half-of-symmetrical-shapes worksheet, Larkin could have asked students to explain why their answers were correct. This would have created an opportunity for students to use the properties of symmetry (in particular, the equal-distance property they investigated with the kite) to justify the placement of their reflected points. In fact, the missing-half problems were on grid paper, so distance could have been easily measured.</p>
<p>A “story” implies not only coherence, but also a plot—something “happens.” This might involve learning something new, or it might mean solidifying or deepening understanding of previously worked on ideas or skills. Thus, another strategy for developing and maintaining a mathematical storyline is progressing the mathematical storyline. One issue that can prevent the progression of the mathematical storyline is when activities or problems are redundant. In the data, this often happened when discussing problems as a whole class before students worked independently or when teachers “went over” problems students had already completed. In these cases, it can be helpful to shift the mathematical point of the activity to developing mathematical reasoning and practices—for example, by raising the level of expectation for students’ use of mathematical language or pressing for more complete explanations.</p>
<p>Steering instruction toward the mathematical point does not require everything in a lesson to be connected. For example, as seen in Larkin’s lesson, there are often routines, such as correcting homework, which may not relate to the lesson’s main focus. There are also cases when it is a stretch to make mathematical connections across the range of activities included in a textbook lesson. This issue was seen in Rachel’s second-grade lesson on fractions. After the fraction work, the teacher’s guide included a worksheet that asked students to “find all possible combinations of three pairs of pants and three shirts.” In this case, developing mathematical coherence across all of the textbook’s activities would have been difficult, as there is not an obvious mathematical storyline connecting the “outfits” page to the earlier work on fractions. Finding all the ways to fold a square into eighths could have been connected to finding all of the possible pants-shirts combinations; however, this is not a mathematical storyline that would have helped Rachel teach to her mathematical point, which was introducing fraction concepts. Thus, steering instruction toward the mathematical point does not mean that a mathematical storyline should be developed for the sake of having a storyline. The storyline should be developed in service of better engaging students with the intended mathematics.</p>
<p>When there is no connection, one option is to omit the activity from the lesson. However, there are reasons a teacher might use an activity despite its disconnect from the mathematical storyline—for example, as an assessment or to lay the foundation for future work. In such cases, the mathematical storyline of the lesson might be better maintained by concluding the first line of work before introducing the unrelated activity.</p>
<p>Because mathematical proficiency develops over time, the mathematical point necessarily extends beyond an individual lesson. So too does the mathematical storyline. This means that developing mathematical coherence and progression <italic>across</italic> lessons is also a key strategy for steering instruction toward the mathematical point. Even when such connections across lessons are less obvious, it is still important to look for ways lessons fit with others in the unit. This was an issue in Beth’s second-grade lesson on graphing, which was situated in a unit focused on subtraction. At first glance, Beth’s lesson might seem disconnected from the other lessons in the unit; but from her interview, Beth also did not seem to have sought ways that graphing could be connected. For example, one way to connect the graphing work to the rest of the unit would be to ask comparison questions about the graphs (e.g., How many more students’ favorite foods were in the dairy group than the bread group?). Another mathematical storyline that can almost always be developed across lessons is work on mathematical practices.</p>
<p>Another issue that can interfere with the development of an across-lesson storyline is not understanding how topics are connected—both mathematically and in the trajectory of students’ learning. For example, Nicole did not capitalize on the connection between fractions and decimals to create the storyline for her third-grade lesson. Instead, she treated fractions and decimals as separate topics and developed a storyline using money. And, as described previously, this storyline resulted in students not engaging with much decimal content.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831212448095">Fernandez et al. (1992)</xref> present evidence showing that “coherent lessons lead to more coherent representations [for students], which in turn lead to greater learning” (p. 363). A key strategy for helping students develop coherent representations is to make the mathematical storyline explicit. This requires more than simply writing “today’s objective” on the board. Making the storyline visible involves deploying moves <italic>throughout</italic> a lesson to frame and summarize the mathematical work and to narrate where things are headed.</p>
<p>One of the issues that can arise when there is no mathematical framing or narration is the feeling that students are being “dragged” through the steps of an activity. In these instances, students may appear to be doing mathematics, but are not actually engaging with the intended mathematical point. Examples of this could be seen throughout Irene’s first-grade lesson, which, as described earlier, used dominos to generate addition-subtraction fact families. Although Irene had articulated conceptual learning goals and thoughtfully analyzed the mathematics made available by the domino, during the lesson, she had difficulty engaging students with the mathematics. These difficulties seemed related to the fact that she did not clearly convey the mathematical storyline to students, as seen in her introduction to the lesson:
<disp-quote>
<p>We’ll be working with dominos today. Do you remember dominos? I know we’ve been using a lot of dominos in our lessons. So I’m going to draw a domino up on the board, okay? Let’s see. [<italic>Draws a 3|5 domino on the whiteboard</italic>.] So, let’s see here. How many, what’s the number, what’s the, let’s see, how many dots are on this side?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although she did tell students they would be using dominos, there was no mention of the <italic>mathematics</italic> on which they would be working. Furthermore, her initial question did not provide students with a mathematical reason for counting the number of dots on one side of the domino. After recording the fact family for the 3|5 domino, Irene immediately began the next example. There was no summary, nor was there an explanation of why they were writing number sentences. After the second example (a 4|6 domino), Irene tried to introduce the idea of fact families by eliciting patterns from students:
<disp-quote>
<p>Okay now. I want you to take a look at this. This, this one and this one. [<italic>Pointing to the two sets of fact families.</italic>] So this problem and this problem, so what, do you notice a pattern? Owen, do you notice a pattern here? Look at the numbers that we used. What pattern do you notice?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Students started naming random “patterns” they noticed across the problems (e.g., that the numbers counted by twos), a common response to an unclear request for patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002831212448095">Heaton, 2000</xref>). Throughout her lesson, Irene continued to have difficulty asking questions that framed the work and helped convey the mathematical point to students. Instead, her questions were at the extremes: general questions that elicited tangential responses or leading questions that dragged students through the work. In either case, the mathematical storyline is not visible to students.</p>

<title>Opening Up and Emphasizing Key Mathematical Ideas</title>
<p>The next task of steering instruction toward the mathematical point identified is opening up and emphasizing key mathematical ideas. Opening up and emphasizing key mathematical ideas, of course, requires an understanding and articulation of what the key ideas are. But once identified, there are many strategies for opening up and emphasizing these ideas during an activity’s enactment.</p>
<p>One strategy for opening up and emphasizing key ideas is “intentional redundancy,” or the deliberate repetition or unnecessary use of mathematical language to emphasize key ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831212448095">Sleep, 2007</xref>). One type of redundancy is using unnecessary language to emphasize a mathematical point, for example, Jordan referred to 43 as “positive forty-three” to emphasize the number’s sign. Other types include the deliberate overuse of new vocabulary and saying a term immediately followed by a description of its meaning in more familiar language.</p>
<p>A major issue that can arise with respect to intentional redundancy is when the language that is repeated is mathematically imprecise or in some way problematic. For example, in Mia’s lesson, she emphasized repeatedly that “‘how many more’ . . . always, always means subtraction.” Another issue with intentional redundancy is that it can be difficult to maintain repetitive language use, in part because it is unnatural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002831212448095">Ball &amp; Forzani, 2009</xref>) to say the same words over and over. It also takes more time to say the “full name” and, therefore, is easier and quicker to take shortcuts with language, an issue I return to in the next section. Furthermore, intentional redundancy can be difficult to manage when there are multiple key ideas a teacher wants to emphasize. This issue was seen in Rachel’s second-grade lesson on fractions.</p>
<p>When students were folding squares in half, Rachel mentioned both “half” and “two equal parts” repeatedly, sometimes in the same sentence. Learning that fractions have equal parts was one of Rachel’s main mathematical points, and her redundant language steered attention toward these ideas. However, as the lesson progressed, Rachel rarely used “equal” when discussing “parts.” For example, in her introduction of how to label halves and fourths, although she repeatedly defined the “number on the bottom” as “the number of parts we have” and the “number on the top” as “the number of parts that we’re talking about,” she did not once mention the parts need to be equal. Thus, when Rachel began to emphasize numerator and denominator, she lost track of one of the key concepts—that the parts need to be equal.</p>
<p>Two often overlapping strategies for emphasizing and opening up key ideas are to make mathematical ideas explicit and to “dwell” in strategic places during the lesson. Being explicit about key ideas can occur, for example, by pointing out the use of a focal skill during an explanation or by providing a definition for a new term. “Dwelling” occurs when the instruction lingers on a key idea, for example, by giving or asking for more detailed explanations, revoicing a student’s comment, or asking multiple students versions of the same question.</p>
<p>There were many instances in the data when teachers did not dwell on or make explicit an idea they had identified as central. In Larkin’s lesson, this occurred because she thought many of the ideas were obvious, and dwelling therefore felt redundant and unnecessary (L-Post, T203-209). In such cases, a more detailed unpacking of the mathematical terrain, a clearer articulation of what there is to learn about the key ideas, and a better understanding of how learners conceive of the ideas might make more visible what there is to emphasize or open up.</p>
<p>Another issue that can arise is that what is said or done to be explicit about or dwell on a key idea is mathematically problematic. For instance, in her lesson on fractions, Keri dwelled on the meaning of “the whole”—a key idea—but her language and examples lacked clarity:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Keri:</speaker>
<p>Um, one thing I wanted to add is that when you’re talking about fractions, it’s really important to think about the whole. So what is the whole unit that I’m measuring? Pizza, I had one slice of pizza. That means that the whole is going to be what?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Student:</speaker>
<p>Eight slices.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Keri:</speaker>
<p>Eight slices or the whole piece of pizza. If I had, um, let’s say I’m working with some geometric numbers, oh I’m sorry, geometric figures, and I have half of a hexagon, well what is the whole that we’re measuring? Yeah?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Student:</speaker>
<p>The hexagon.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Keri:</speaker>
<p>The hexagon is the whole. So this concept of what is the whole, what is the whole thing we’re measuring, is important.</p>
</speech>
<p>Another issue that can arise is dwelling with language that is not geared toward the learners. This was seen throughout Gillian’s fourth-grade lesson on metric conversion. To emphasize key ideas, Gillian dwelled on the solutions to conversion problems. For example, when students gave correct answers, she asked them to explain their thinking and then followed up with her own detailed explanation at the board. However, during her explanations, Gillian spoke of “conversion factors” and “doing things to both sides,” as if she were talking herself through her own solution methods, not giving explanations to her students. Thus, although a teacher “thinking aloud” can be a useful strategy for emphasizing and opening up key mathematical ideas, in order to engage students with those ideas, the language and reasoning need to be accessible to the learners.</p>

<title>Keeping a Focus on Meaning</title>
<p>The last task of steering instruction toward the mathematical point that I identified in these data is keeping a focus on meaning. Because the ultimate goal of mathematics instruction is to develop mathematical proficiency, which intertwines conceptual understanding and reasoning with procedural fluency, mathematics instruction needs to help students attend to mathematical meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831212448095">Hiebert &amp; Grouws, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831212448095">National Research Council, 2001</xref>). Although there is some overlap between keeping a focus on meaning and some of the other tasks identified (in particular, with opening up and emphasizing key mathematical ideas), these tasks are not the same. For example, emphasizing a key idea does not require a focus on meaning (e.g., the idea being emphasized could be about developing skills or a more efficient procedure), and a teacher can focus on meaning even when an idea is not being emphasized (e.g., by using conceptual language or quickly defining a new term).</p>
<p>Written records and representations are a key component of mathematics teaching and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002831212448095">Ball, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002831212448095">Ball &amp; Bass, 2003</xref>) and can be used to keep a focus on meaning. Courtney’s second-grade lesson provided many examples of deploying representations to focus on meaning. For example, when modeling a problem using multiple representations, she lined up the components of her diagrams to make more visible the correspondences between them and then used this to highlight their mathematical meaning.</p>
<p>One issue that can arise when using records and representations to focus on meaning is when students cannot see what is displayed. This happened in Mia’s lesson on graphing. To emphasize the importance of reading a graph’s labels, she designed an activity in which students compared two bar graphs with identical shapes but different labels. However, because she used the overhead projector, she was unable to display the graphs simultaneously. This made it difficult for students to compare the graphs and thus detracted from her mathematical point.</p>
<p>Another issue that can occur is that what is recorded inadvertently obscures or confuses the mathematics. For example, in her lesson on decimals, Nicole tried to emphasize the names of the places by recording them on the whiteboard. Because she wanted to highlight the –th sound in “tenths” (N-Post, T115-124), she labeled the tenths column with “Th.” In this case, Nicole’s use of recording to emphasize the –th sound may have confused students because “Th” is often used to label the thousands place. Thus, when making records to emphasize a particular idea, it is also important to consider the potential impact of the recording on its conveyance of meaning.</p>
<p>Another issue that can arise is inherent in using representations: Students might attend to mathematically irrelevant features of the representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002831212448095">Nolder, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002831212448095">Sierpinska, 1994</xref>). One way teachers can manage this is by being explicit about what students are supposed to attend to (and not attend to) in a given representation. For example, as Courtney was drawing little lines to model the numbers in a comparison problem, one of her students commented that she needed to use a slash to group five tallies. Courtney acknowledged this confusion by clarifying, “I’m not doing tallies I’m just doing little marks.” Whether this resolved the issue and steered the student toward the intended mathematical point is unknown, and it could be argued that it would have been clearer to use another representation (e.g., small dots); however, this example illustrates the importance of not assuming students are attending to the intended mathematical meaning.</p>
<p>A related issue that can arise when using representations to focus on meaning is that the referent is unclear to students. Unclear referents can cause confusion and obfuscate intended meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002831212448095">Rowland, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002831212448095">Sierpinska, 1994</xref>). For instance, in Rachel’s lesson, when she asked students to name fractions of a folded square, it was often unclear to which portion of the square she was referring. Similarly, in Irene’s fact families lesson, she covered one side of the domino and then asked students what was taken away, hiding the number to which she was referring.</p>
<p>Another strategy teachers can employ to keep a focus on meaning is to use “meaning-focused language.” One type of meaning-focused language is saying “full names”—that is, not taking shortcuts with language when naming mathematical objects or definitions. For example, Courtney used full names when referring to components of the diagram she was using for comparison problems (e.g., saying “bigger quantity box” rather than “the big one” or simply pointing). When the mathematical point of a lesson is to develop procedural fluency, meaning-focused language can help keep concepts in play, enabling simultaneous work across strands of mathematical proficiency. For example, the purpose of Andrea’s fifth-grade lesson was to develop procedural fluency with the long division algorithm. Although her lesson was not focused on decimals, she read 87.6 as “eighty-seven and six-tenths” rather than “eighty-seven point six,” language that makes more visible the underlying place value structure and connection to fractions.</p>
<p>Teachers can miss opportunities to use meaning-focused language to engage students with the intended mathematics, and in some cases, <italic>not</italic> using meaning-focused language can interfere with steering an activity toward its mathematical point. For example, in her third-grade lesson on decimals, Nicole rarely read fractions and decimals using the language of “tenths” and “hundredths” (e.g., she read <inline-formula id="inline-formula6-0002831212448095">
<mml:math display="inline" id="math6-0002831212448095">
<mml:mrow>
<mml:mfrac>
<mml:mrow>
<mml:mn>16</mml:mn>
</mml:mrow>
<mml:mrow>
<mml:mn>100</mml:mn>
</mml:mrow>
</mml:mfrac>
</mml:mrow>
</mml:math>
</inline-formula> and .16 as “sixteen out of a hundred” rather than “sixteen-hundredths”), which was problematic because place value with decimals was the lesson’s focal topic (contrast this with Andrea’s lesson on division that happened to use decimals).</p>
<p>Not using meaning-focused language can also distort the mathematical point. For example, in her graphing lesson, Beth repeatedly characterized the activity as “changing our information from our table to our graph.” While such statements may not have interfered with student learning, it is not true that the data changed; they were just represented differently. When students use imprecise language, the task of keeping a focus on meaning becomes even more complicated. One strategy is to offer a quick correction without taking up the imprecision. For example, when a student in Jordan’s class started explaining how to calculate 8 – (–4) by saying “there’s two negatives and that’s not possible,” Jordan quickly commented, “Well it’s possible, but it’s just, we want to think about it a different way,” and the student continued his explanation. In this case, Jordan did not dwell, but she did not allow the student’s mathematically imprecise statement to stand untroubled.</p>
<p>Another strategy for keeping a focus on meaning is to explicitly connect the activity back to the intended mathematics. For example, a teacher can connect student responses back to the problem being solved. Courtney made this type of move throughout her discussion of comparison problems. For instance, when a student correctly answered “eight” to one of her questions, she connected this back to what the problem was asking: “Eight is the smaller quantity. And we’re trying to find the difference.” When such connections are not made, the mathematical reasons for doing an activity can be unclear. In Courtney’s case, the teacher did the connecting; however, teachers can also support students in making these connections themselves.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Steering instruction toward the mathematical point is crucial for teaching that supports the development of students’ mathematical proficiency. Inability to skillfully steer instruction risks wasted time, unproductive confusion, incoherent instruction, and superficial mathematical work—all conditions that can hinder students’ progress toward the intended learning goals. Yet simply stating that teachers need to steer instruction toward the mathematical point does not identify what is involved in doing this work. Needed are decompositions of practice that articulate and break apart key components of the work so they can be taught to and practiced by beginners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002831212448095">Grossman et al., 2009</xref>). During instruction, these components are integrated—and such recomposition is also the ultimate goal in teacher education—however, to support beginners in learning how to enact the whole it is necessary to articulate its parts. This study made a first step in decomposing the work of steering instruction toward the mathematical point by identifying its central tasks, strategies that can be used to enact those tasks, and issues that can arise when trying to do so.</p>
<p>Although there are other frameworks and observation protocols in the field that also decompose aspects of the work of teaching (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002831212448095">Danielson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002831212448095">Junker et al., 2006</xref>), none focus on articulating the work of steering instruction toward the mathematical point. Furthermore, although aspects of the work of steering instruction can be inferred from other frameworks, other frameworks and observation protocols often focus exclusively on describing <italic>qualities</italic> of the teaching or student engagement, not on articulating what the work of teaching is. Or, in cases when the work of teaching is identified (or can be inferred), it is not decomposed at a grain size that is fine enough to be able to directly use the framework to teach beginners what to <italic>do</italic>. Thus, a major contribution of this study is an articulation of a key aspect of the work of teaching at a grain size that is directly usable in the design of practice-based teacher education.</p>
<p>In addition to identifying practices that beginning teachers need to learn, results from this study can be used to develop tools to support preservice teachers’ learning in and from practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002831212448095">Lampert, 2010</xref>). Such tools could be used in teacher education courses to study records of practice, support preservice teachers’ reflection on their own teaching, or assist field instructors when debriefing observed lessons. For instance, a lesson planning tool might prompt preservice teachers to identify places to dwell on the mathematical point or to analyze whether selected numbers are likely to engage students with the intended mathematics; an observation/debriefing tool might help field instructors or mentor teachers observe preservice teachers’ lessons for the tasks of steering instruction and then facilitate conversation about the strategies used and issues that arose during the lesson. Case studies could be developed around the tasks of steering instruction to help preservice teachers identify strategies that can be used to productively steer instruction and issues that can arise that cause a lesson to get off track. Creating such tools would require additional development and validation work, but this study helps move the field in this direction.</p>
<p>Findings from this study can also be used as a lens for research on teaching, revealing aspects of practice that might be missed with other lenses. For example, even when a preservice teacher’s enactment seems to steer an activity in an unproductive mathematical direction, using the tasks of steering instruction as a lens can help illuminate productive instincts and sensibilities. For instance, although Nicole’s recording of “Th” for “tenth” in her decimal lesson was potentially confusing mathematically, her use of recording to emphasize a key mathematical idea can be a productive teaching move. By naming these types of moves, this study helps observers of practice distinguish between the intent of a move and the way in which it is implemented. Findings from this study can also inform the design of educative curriculum materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002831212448095">Davis &amp; Krajcik, 2005</xref>) by providing insight into the types of supports curriculum designers might include to help teachers steer instruction toward the mathematical point.</p>
<p>The conceptualization of steering instruction toward the mathematical point developed in this study could also be extended to subjects other than mathematics. For example, in history instruction, one could conceive of “steering instruction toward the historical point.” Although the overall conceptualization of “steering instruction” seems readily extendable to other subject areas, further research is needed to examine more closely the analogous work and to identify specific tasks, strategies, and issues. If there are aspects of steering instruction that are similar across the teaching of different subjects, this would be a way to help identify which tasks and strategies are more “high leverage” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002831212448095">Ball, Sleep, Boerst, &amp; Bass, 2009</xref>) for preservice elementary teachers. In other words, overlapping components would help identify aspects of the work of steering instruction that apply across subjects, which can be strategic sites for elementary teacher education because of the need to prepare beginners to teach all subjects in a limited amount of time. At the same time, while many of the tasks may be parallel, there may also be important subject-specific differences in implementation that would need to be identified.</p>
<p>This study has a number of limitations. First, although the sample was varied in important ways (e.g., grade level, MKT, lesson topic), there were similarities that likely influenced the characterization of the work of steering instruction toward the mathematical point. For example, all of the preservice teachers were in the same teacher education program and almost all lessons used the same mathematics curriculum. Thus, the findings are likely missing aspects of the work that were not visible in the settings observed or were not apparent in single lessons. Another set of limitations emerges from the methods of analysis. Research like this is necessarily interpretive, and the findings reflect only what I was able to “see” in the data. Whether the distinctions made prove useful will ultimately be determined by whether and how the ideas can be taken up and used in future research and teacher education. Lastly, this study does not take up questions such as: How can preservice teachers learn to steer instruction toward the mathematical point? Are teachers with stronger MKT more skilled at steering instruction? Does skill in steering instruction toward the mathematical point improve the mathematical quality of instruction and lead to increased student learning? Though this study takes an important initial step, these crucial questions remain unanswered and point to directions for future research on steering instruction toward the mathematical point.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Teacher education must prepare teachers with the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve the bold vision of mathematical proficiency set by current K-12 standards and curricula. Doing so requires a better articulation of the work of teaching. This study decomposed and specified a central aspect of mathematics teaching: the work of steering instruction toward the mathematical point. The tasks of steering instruction indentified in this study, along with strategies that can be used to enact these tasks and issues that can arise when trying to do so, can inform the design of teacher education, research on teaching and teacher education, and the design and study of educative curriculum materials.</p>
