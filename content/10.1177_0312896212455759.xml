<title>Special section on corporate social responsibility and topical issues in finance, accounting and management</title>
<p>I am pleased to include in this Issue a Special Section on The Interface between Finance and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). This is an area of growing interest, but limited formal knowledge. As such, I believe that the Special Section will make an important contribution in the development of this field. The Special Section is supplemented by a number of papers which tackle a range of other topical subjects.</p>
<p>We have nine manuscripts in this Issue, reflecting the growing number of high quality manuscripts that the Journal is attracting, combined with our determination to not let this increased interest increase either the turnaround times in review or the interval between manuscript acceptance and the appearance of papers in print.</p>
<p>The lead article in this Issue, opening the Special Section on the Finance-Corporate Social Responsibility Interface, by Humphrey, Lee and Shen, examines a number of financial performance measures as a function of firms’ environmental, social, and governance indicators in the UK market. This is an important area, and one that has attracted considerable debate around whether such activity enhances, detracts from, or has no effect on the returns of the firm. Plausible arguments can be advanced for any of the three effects. By teasing out the three inter-related variables, the authors are able to show, in the context of the UK, none of the three is significantly related to systematic risk, book-to-market ratio, or momentum exposures. Their conclusion that investors can select a portfolio with ‘ethical’ shares without paying a premium, can equally well be seen as being ethical has no special financial returns. That is, there is merit in the old adage, ‘virtue is its own reward’.</p>
<p>Bird, Momenté and Reggiani follow with a cross-national study of market reaction to corporate responsibility across six regions. The paper is highly useful in attempting to strengthen the external validity of findings in this area. Much of the published work based in individual countries shows mixed results. An important distinguishing feature of this paper is the use of a common scoring method to measure corporate responsibility activity across countries and recourse to an extensive international database. Europe, divided into the UK, Nordic countries and /central/southern Europe, is contrasted to the US, Japan, and Australia. Both one-year and two-year returns to CSR are stronger in all three regions of Europe than these other three countries with weak one-year effects in the US and Australia (but no two-year effects), and no effects in Japan. While this is consistent with much of the press coverage and policy debate in these countries, the results stand in interesting contrast to those of the first manuscript of this Special Issue. There may be many good reasons for this including different data sets, methods of analysis and variable operationalization. The findings show just how rich this area is for us to develop a more nuanced understanding of the effects of CSR activities.</p>
<p>Cotter and Najah provide us with an interesting change of emphasis. In their paper they examine the effect of institutional shareholders on disclosure practices with respect to global climate change. Institutional investors represent a highly influential stakeholder group for publicly listed firms and the authors trace whether their participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project is related to the disclosure that firms make in their annual reports (as measured by the Carbon Disclosure Leaders Index), after allowing for the effect of a number of control variables. The Carbon Disclosure Project represents 534 institutional investors and thus participation in it forms a proxy of large listed firms’ engagement with them. The authors find a strong association between participation in the project and disclosure, but note that this association may be due to omitted variables. Thus, the association forms an important phenomenon for future research to probe in terms of the causal mechanisms that underlie it.</p>
<p>The previous research looks at the nature of returns to firms embarking on extensive CSR activities and how they reveal this to the market. Investors vary in their concern for this type of investment and Pérez-Gladish, Benson and Faff investigate the nature of investors for which this behaviour is important. In terms of preferences, unsurprisingly these investors have high social consciences and interest in social health issues. Interestingly, more so than environmental concerns. Firms regarding investors as a key set of stakeholders need to understand the drivers of their behaviour in terms of both preferences and characteristics. Such investors tend to be middle-aged, middle income, and highly educated.</p>
<p>The final paper in this Special Section, by Galbreath and Shum introduces another key set of stakeholders into understanding the link between firm activities and financial performance. The authors suggest that one reason why research investigating the relationship between CSR activity and firm financial performance has come up with mixed results is that there are mediating variables that will determine the effectiveness of such strategies. In particular, Galbreath and Shum posit that customer satisfaction and firm reputation may mediate the effect of undertaking CSR. While they find that CSR does affect customer satisfaction and reputation, it is only via reputation that this is translated into financial performance. That is, reputation is found to fully mediate the effect of CSR activity on the firm’s financial performance, while customer satisfaction does not provide a significant route.</p>
<p>Concerns about equity and environmental degradation constitute one form of turbulence and the corporate social responsibility activity investigated in the previous section throws some light on our knowledge of the financial aspects of firms’ activity in the area. The next paper, by Powell and Treepongkaruna, looks at a different form of turbulence; the effect of economic cycles and market perceptions of them. The authors find no relation between ex ante fears of a recession and stock market returns but that ex ante fears are associated with future reduced output. The authors suggest that one potential causal mechanism for this may be a self fulfilling spiral of actions taken on pessimistic forecasts.</p>
<p>The seventh paper in this Issue examines an area where results have been mixed and there has been an apparent divergence between the evidence from US and Australian markets. The three factor asset pricing model of Fama and French has received strong support using US data, but a spread of findings when applied to Australian data. Brailsford, Gaunt and O’Brien posit that incomplete and inconsistent data sets may provide an explanation for the Australian findings. By achieving better and more complete coverage with a large, purpose-built data set, they are able to demonstrate that the Fama-French model does pertain in Australia, and that differences in the appropriate model between the US and Australia disappear using their database; consistent with evidence from the US, they provide support for the superiority of the Fama French model over the capital asset-pricing model (CAPM).</p>
<p>The penultimate paper in the Issue moves to a methodological problem. Zhu suggests that many findings linking the structure of debt to firm characteristics are a result of model mis-specification. In particular, she argues that the use of ratios distorts the findings of effects. By using first differences, she avoids this problem and after considering, fixed effects and endogeneity, she finds the major explanatory variable of current debt is past debt and firm characteristics are no longer significant.</p>
<p>The Issue closes with an article by Allen and Powell looking at the default probabilities of Australian banks during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). Conventional wisdom has the Australian banks faring better than their global counterparts during the GFC and the authors are interested to investigate whether this is due to lower probabilities of default, a reason commonly advanced. While Australian banks did fare better than their global counterparts during the GFC, the difference in default probabilities was only slight.</p>
<p>Finally, allow me to direct your attention to a new feature in the Journal, the Subject Area Editorial Statements. These are intended to assist our growing pool of authors in ascertaining the types of papers that subject area Editors are seeking, as well as, an overall statement on the quality of scholarship and research required of submitted papers.</p>
<p>I do hope that you enjoy the Issue.</p>
