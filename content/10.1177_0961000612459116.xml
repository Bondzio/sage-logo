<p>In <italic>The Future of Archives and Recordkeeping: A Reader</italic>, editor Jennie Hill, Lecturer in Archives and Records Management at the Department of Information Studies at Aberystwyth University, offers a compilation of essays on contemporary archival challenges. The book, created specifically for postgraduate archival students, has a broad enough scope for anyone seeking to understand the profession’s issues. Written by practitioners and academics, the anthology concentrates on a single archival theme per chapter, ‘a defined argument in its own right’, allowing readers to choose what they want to read (p. xviii). Divided into four parts – ‘Defining archives’, ‘Archives and its development’, ‘Archives in society’, and ‘The role of archivists’ – the book centres on the complexities of archival practices in the digital age.</p>
<p>As Hill states in the introduction, ‘the role of the archivist is a privileged one, often misunderstood by those outside of our discipline, and occasionally much maligned … Archives are finally on the larger agenda and it is imperative that the archival community engage with these debates and discussions if we wish to ensure that our discipline is heard’ (p. xviii). She continues, ‘There has never been a more interesting time to be an archivist … Archives are moving from a profession predicated on the unquestioning repetition of routine towards a more self-aware, self-reflexive professional outlook, which can only be of benefit to the archival profession’ (p. xvii). This optimistic view of the occupation is refreshing, as in the last couple of decades, the nature of archives and the position of archivists have changed significantly. The most considerable transformation is that Hilary Jenkinson’s positivistic proposition that archivists are impartial guardians of records has been questioned from inside and outside the profession. Works such as Jacques Derrida’s <italic>Archive Fever: A Freudian Impression</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000612459116">1998</xref>), for example, have introduced archival concepts to the fields of literature, philosophy, and psychology, thus familiarizing the discipline’s theories to a larger group of intellectuals. Web 2.0 has revitalized the debate on the objectives of archives and records management, and technological development and unparalleled data creation and distribution have revolutionized archives. In this environment, archivists need to consider their users’ increasing expectations and expertise in shaping the vocation’s future.</p>
<p>Compilations of this kind often have excellent introductions, but lack conclusions that create connections between sections. The first chapter attempts to remedy this common omission by foreshadowing the themes of postmodernism, the role of archivists, digital technologies, and the considerable interest in the archives throughout the humanities, which are explored in the rest of the book. In ‘Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going? Situating the archive and archivists’, Hill and Victoria Lane, project archivist at the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, discuss the evolving ideology regarding archives and archivists. The records continuum model, archivists as active record creators, and the loss of context for online records have shown how changeable the archives truly are. The authors conclude, ‘Moving out of the shadow of Jenkinson has afforded us the opportunity to re-think much that has previously been taken as given, and yet we continue to carry that tradition with us. The conflict between new and old ways of viewing archives should not see us separate into our individual camps—that is the very nature of the postmodern archive’ (p. 20).</p>
<p>While the volume includes well-known archival writers, such as Richard Cox on appraisal, Luciana Duranti on diplomatics, and Verne Harris on archives and power, lesser-known writers offer the most useful and universal chapters in the book. In ‘Interactivity, flexibility and transparency: Social media in archives 2.0’, Kate Theimer, author of the ArchivesNext blog and the Archives 2.0 wiki, begins with a literature review on archival websites, noting that the profession was writing about the potential of the Internet to enhance archives as early as 1995. She states, ‘Because information about archival collections is now showing up in the results pages of Google searches, it is likely that we are experiencing the beginnings of the democratization of archives users … The existence of most collections is discoverable on the web by anyone who enters the right search terms’ (p. 126). Repositories utilize websites not only for general information, but also as part of their outreach program to display previously hidden collections or to offer more insight into their activities, such as processing collections or creating exhibits. Regarding social networking applications such as Twitter, podcasts, Flickr, YouTube, Facebook, Wikipedia, and Second Life, Theimer writes, ‘The use of these kinds of new web tools is both evidence of change in the archival mindset and a catalyst for bringing those changes about’ (p. 134). Rather than the traditional archival attitude of presumed expertise and neutrality, Archives 2.0 offers interactivity, flexibility, and transparency, resulting in users with a greater appreciation for archival collections and a sense of investment in the archives.</p>
<p><italic>The Future of Archives and Recordkeeping: A Reader</italic> surveys developments in archives for those who want to deepen their understanding of the profession and reveals that archivists and record managers continue to have healthy dissension and debate about their field. Librarians unfamiliar with archival concepts or vocabularies will find this book useful, as many of the challenges of archives and record management, most notably the structure and distribution of knowledge caused by mass digitization, are shared between disciplines. Most importantly, all information professionals must change and adapt to remain relevant cultural forces in an increasingly automated world.</p>
