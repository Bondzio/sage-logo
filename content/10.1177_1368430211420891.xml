<abstract>
<p>Two studies examined the relationship between collective narcissism—an emotional investment in an unrealistic belief about the greatness of an in-group (Golec de Zavala, Cichocka, Eidelson, &amp; Jayawickreme, 2009) — and anti-Semitism in Poland. The results indicate that this relationship is simultaneously mediated by (a) a belief that the in-group is constantly threatened by hostile intentions of other groups (Polish siege beliefs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430211420891">Bar-Tal &amp; Antebi, 1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430211420891">1992b</xref>) and (b) a belief that the Jews are a particularly threatening out-group because they secretly aim to dominate the world (the conspiracy stereotype of Jews; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211420891">Bergmann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430211420891">Kofta &amp; Sędek, 2005</xref>).

<body>
<p>In a comprehensive meta-analytic review of research on the relationship between intergroup threat and prejudice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1368430211420891">Riek, Mania, and Gaertner (2006</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1368430211420891">Stephan &amp; Stephan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1368430211420891">Stephan et al., 2002</xref>) suggest that in order to better understand the etiology of prejudice it is important to identify variables that increase the likelihood of interpreting intergroup situations as threatening. We propose that collective narcissism—in-group identification tied to an emotional investment in an unrealistic belief in the exaggerated greatness of an in-group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala, et al., 2009</xref>)—is related to high susceptibility to signs of intergroup threat and enduring prejudice against out-groups stereotypically perceived as threatening. In the present paper we present empirical evidence demonstrating that collective narcissism is related to anti-Semitic prejudice <italic>because</italic> it increases sensitivity to intergroup threat and support for stereotypical perception of Jews as particularly threatening out-group.</p>
<p>The present studies attempt to fill in the gap in research on intergroup consequences of collective narcissism. On one hand, previous studies show that collective narcissism is reliably associated with prejudice. However, collective narcissists seem to be prejudiced only towards <italic>certain</italic> social groups. For example, Polish collective narcissism correlates with anti-Semitism but it is not related to chronic negative attitudes towards other out-groups such as the French or British people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala &amp; Cichocka, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, American national narcissism predicted negative attitudes towards Arabs but not towards Asians, Europeans, or Latinos (Lyons, Kenowrthy, &amp; Popan, 2010). On the other hand, previous studies in the context of intergroup conflict indicate that collective narcissism predicts support for intergroup violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala, et al., 2009</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1368430211420891">Kruglanski, Orehek, Belanger, &amp; Sasota, 2010</xref>). Collective narcissism predicts retaliatory intergroup hostility over and above such robust predictors of intergroup violence as social dominance orientation, authoritarianism, high in-group identification, or “destructive” forms of idealization of a national in-group such as blind patriotism, nationalism, or in-group glorification. Importantly, the relationship between collective narcissism and intergroup hostility in those studies is mediated by the perception of the actions of out-groups as threat to the in-group and its image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In this paper, we examine the hypothesis that collective narcissism is related to prejudice for reasons similar to those that drive its relationship with intergroup hostility in a conflict: Because of perceived intergroup threat. We present results of two studies that indicate that the relationship between collective narcissism and prejudice is driven by chronic beliefs that the in-group is exposed and vulnerable in intergroup relations (<italic>the siege beliefs</italic>) and that the particular out-group targeted by prejudice is a source of threat (<italic>the conspiracy stereotype</italic>). Our studies focus on the relationship between Polish collective narcissism and anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism is one of the most prevalent forms of prejudice in Poland and across Europe. It is particularly curious because in most countries it is prejudice against an almost non-existent minority. This minority is, however, almost universally stereotyped as threatening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211420891">Bergmann, 2008</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430211420891">Kofta &amp; Sędek, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1368430211420891">Krzemiński, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Collective narcissism and exaggerated regard for self</title>
<p>The concept of collective narcissism extends into the intergroup domain the concept of individual narcissism, a grandiose view of self that requires continual external validation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430211420891">Crocker &amp; Park, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211420891">Emmons, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1368430211420891">Morf &amp; Rhodewalt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1368430211420891">Raskin &amp; Terry, 1988</xref>), and is related to unstable and defensive personal self-esteem (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1368430211420891">Jordan, Spencer, Zanna, Hoshino-Browne, &amp; Correll, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1368430211420891">Kernis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1368430211420891">Zeigler-Hill, 2006</xref>). Individual narcissists are emotionally attached to the belief in their own greatness and they are preoccupied with protecting it. In contrast, collective narcissists believe in the unique prominence of the social group with which they identify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala et al., 2009</xref>). Collective and individual narcissism, although positively correlated, are functionally separate variables. Their relationship across studies ranges from weak to moderate (from <italic>r</italic> =.15 to <italic>r</italic> = .27; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1368430211420891">Lyons et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, collective narcissism predicts intergroup attitudes and behaviors that individual narcissism does not account for, and individual narcissism predicts interpersonal anger and aggressiveness that is not related to collective narcissism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala et al., 2009</xref>; Studies 2 and 3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1368430211420891">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Collective narcissism and exaggerated regard for an in-group</title>
<p>The concept of collective narcissism corresponds directly to the research that differentiates between “belligerent” versus constructive forms of positive regard for one’s nations. This research has been successful in describing several forms of “in-group love” that is systematically accompanied by “out-group hate” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211420891">Brewer, 1999</xref>): Such as nationalism, “<italic>a perception of national superiority and an orientation toward national dominance</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1368430211420891">Kosterman &amp; Feshbach, 1989</xref>, p. 261), blind patriotism, “<italic>a rigid and inflexible attachment to country, characterized by unquestioning positive evaluation, staunch allegiance, and intolerance of criticism</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1368430211420891">Schatz, Staub, &amp; Lavine, 1999</xref>, p. 153), or in-group glorification, “<italic>viewing the national in-group as superior to other groups and having a feeling of respect for the central symbols of the group (…)</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1368430211420891">Roccas, Klar, &amp; Liviatan, 2006</xref>; p. 700). However, the concept of collective narcissism is in several important ways distinct from the above conceptualizations of extensive in-group favouritism. In addition, previous studies indicate that people can be narcissistic about various in-groups, not only about their nation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala et al., 2009</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the only “belligerent” form of in-group attachment that has been empirically demonstrated to extend beyond international context.</p>
<sec id="section3-1368430211420891">
<title>Collective narcissism and nationalism</title>
<p>National collective narcissism and nationalism share the belief in the nation’s inherent superiority. However, narcissistic, unlike nationalistic, claims to superiority are not based on in-group’s power and intergroup dominance. Also unlike nationalism, narcissistic intergroup aggressiveness is defensive and retaliatory. It does not serve the purpose of achieving a dominant position in the intergroup hierarchy of power. This concern is, however, crucial for nationalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1368430211420891">Schatz et al., 1999</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430211420891">de Figueiredo &amp; Elkins, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Most importantly, unlike nationalism, the concept of collective narcissism does not assume out-group derogation in its definition. Thus, it offers an insight into the psychological mechanism underlying the relationship between the in-group’s preferential positivity and out-group hostility. It also helps to understand why idealization of an in-group conceptualized as blind patriotism or in-group glorification is related to rejection of criticism and out-group negativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1368430211420891">
<title>Collective narcissism and blind patriotism and in-group glorification</title>
<p>National collective narcissism, blind patriotism and national in-group glorification do overlap in the uncritical approach towards the national in-group and concern with protection of the in-group’ positive image. However, unlike blind patriotism and in-group glorification that avoid criticism; collective narcissism is preoccupied with it. Collective narcissism, just like the narcissistic idealization of self, is contingent on external validation. Therefore, collective narcissists are constantly vigilant to threat to the in-group’s image. In addition, only the narcissistic exaggerated image of the in-group is shadowed by internal doubts regarding in-group’s assumed greatness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala et al., 2009</xref>; Study 4).</p>
<p>Studies confirm that collective narcissism predicts intergroup hostility over and above other “destructive” national attachments and partially mediates the effects of blind patriotism and in-group glorification on intergroup negativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1368430211420891">Imhoff, Erb, &amp; Wohl, 2010</xref>). Moreover, when the common variance between collective narcissism and constructive patriotism is controlled the <italic>negative</italic> relationship between constructive patriotism (“<italic>an attachment to country characterized by</italic> ‘<italic>critical loyalty</italic>,’ <italic>questioning and criticism of current group practices that are driven by a desire for positive change</italic>”, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1368430211420891">Schatz et al., 1999</xref>, p. 153) and prejudice fully emerges. Thus, narcissistic aspect of “in-group love” (but not blind patriotism or nationalism) seems to be particularly tied to out-group negativity. It conceals the ability of constructive positive regard for an in-group to inspire out-group positivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala &amp; Cichocka, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Collective narcissism and Polish siege beliefs</title>
<p>We argue that it is the very nature of the collective narcissistic beliefs about the in-group that inspire the sensitivity to intergroup threat and link it to out-group hostility. People with contingent self-worth exaggerate failures and underestimate successes in the domains of contingency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430211420891">Baumeister &amp; Vohs, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430211420891">Crocker &amp; Park, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1368430211420891">Kernis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1368430211420891">Morf &amp; Rhodewalt, 2001</xref>). Therefore, collective narcissists rarely see the acknowledgement of the in-group by others as satisfactory. They quickly develop “tolerance” to known sources of external validation and are constantly on the lookout for new signs of anything that may undermine the in-group. They retaliate against what they perceive as a threat to the in-group’s positive image. We propose that collective narcissism, with its extraordinary sensitivity to anything that can undermine the in-group’s image, is likely to inspire the <italic>siege beliefs system</italic> about the in-group. The <italic>siege mentality</italic> prompts generally distrustful and negative attitudes towards other groups as it is “<italic>[a] belief held by group members stating that the rest of the world has highly negative behavioral intentions toward them</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430211420891">Bar-Tal &amp; Antebi, 1992</xref>a, p. 49; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430211420891">Bar-Tal, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Siege beliefs explain and justify hardships suffered in the name of the in-group in intergroup conflicts and legitimize the hostility and violence perpetrated by the in-group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430211420891">Bar-Tal &amp; Antebi, 1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430211420891">1992b</xref>). Importantly, people differ with respect to how much conflict they perceive (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430211420891">Golec &amp; Federico, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1368430211420891">Kruglanski, Bar-Tal, &amp; Klar, 1993</xref>) and how convincing they find the siege beliefs to be. The siege beliefs offer an explanation and justification for the constant monitoring of the signs of the mistreatment associated with collective narcissism. They are also likely to satisfy the narcissistic need to perceive the in-group as unique, of special status and morally superior. Siege beliefs maintain that the misunderstood and righteous in-group stands alone against the hostile and dissolute world. Most importantly, the siege beliefs may appeal to collective narcissists because they confirm what the narcissists seem continuously to suspect: That other groups do not properly acknowledge their greatness.</p>
<p>We propose that Polish national narcissism may be related to anti-Semitism <italic>because</italic> of its association with the siege beliefs about the nation. Polish Jews and Jews in general are perceived as an out-group. More than any other minority, this out-group is salient to Poles and inspires ambivalent emotions: Guilt, anger and fear. Importantly, the Jewish people are seen as a threat to the positive national image (because of their criticism regarding Polish anti-Semitism), to Poland’s national interest (because of the claims of Polish Jews or their families regarding financial retributions for the properties confiscated by the communist government in Poland), or to national security (because of the conspiracy beliefs attributing hostile intentions against the Polish state to Jews; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430211420891">Bilewicz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430211420891">Kofta &amp; Sędek, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1368430211420891">Krzemiński, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1368430211420891">Wójcik, 2008</xref>). Thus, collective narcissists are likely to be prejudiced against Jews because this is a particularly salient out-group in Polish national context. In addition, this out-group is seen as particularly threatening. As such it is well equipped to be seen as a model example of the hostile intentions of the external world towards the in-group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1368430211420891">
<title>Collective narcissism and the conspiracy stereotype of Jews</title>
<p>The relationship between collective narcissism and anti-Semitism is likely to be independently driven by stereotypical beliefs about the Jewish out-group. Intergroup threat can be embedded in a negative stereotype of an out-group. The stereotypical beliefs about this group can contain the prediction of its hostile intentions towards the in-group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1368430211420891">Stephan &amp; Stephan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1368430211420891">Stephan et al., 2002</xref>). Although anti-Semitic beliefs and attitudes in Europe are under-studied, several studies indicate that the Jewish minority is quite universally perceived as a threat to national identity, especially in regions where the Jewish minority was large prior to WWII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211420891">Bergmann, 2008</xref>). No matter how well assimilated, Jews tend to be perceived as a group that stands “<italic>outside the national order of the world</italic>” remaining “<italic>essentially alien to the surrounding societies</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211420891">Bergmann, 2008</xref>; p. 346). In addition, the in-group’s ambivalent position during the Holocaust is experienced as a threat to the national self-image (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211420891">Bergmann, 2008</xref>). Poland is an example of the ambivalent position towards the Holocaust. There are reported cases of pogroms (a violent mob attack on an ethnic group) of Polish Jews perpetrated by Poles during the WWII and shortly afterwards (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1368430211420891">Gross, 2008</xref>). At the same time many Polish soldiers (of the Home Army, <italic>Armia Krajowa</italic>) fought in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Poles represent the biggest number of people who rescued Jews during the Holocaust and were awarded the “Righteous among the Nations” medal by Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1368430211420891">Yad Vashem, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to being perceived as alien to the national in-group, in Poland and other European countries Jews are stereotypically perceived as a dangerous out-group. They are seen as motivated by a common intention to dominate the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211420891">Bergmann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211420891">Cohen &amp; Golub, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430211420891">Kofta &amp; Sędek, 2005</xref>). The alleged dominant and controlling intentions are executed by means of indirect and deceptive methods, hidden and non-obvious ways whose negative consequences can only be observed. This makes the Jewish out-group particularly dangerous. According to the conspiracy stereotype, past, present, and even future harm and hardship experienced by the in-group can be explained by the veiled actions of the Jewish out-group. The conspiracy stereotype of Jews predicts anti-Semitism in Poland, and support for this stereotype increases in times of elections and intense political campaign. The allegation of Jewish ancestry is used as a means of harming the reputation of politicians running for office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1368430211420891">Kofta &amp; Sędek, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>We expect that collective narcissists, sensitive to signs of potential threat to the in-group, will be likely to find the conspiracy stereotype of Jews convincing and threatening. A tendency to uphold this stereotype will mediate the relationship between collective narcissism and anti-Semitic prejudice. The mediation through the beliefs about the out-group will be parallel to and independent of the mediation through the siege beliefs that emphasize the vulnerable position of the in-group. In other words, we expect that collective narcissism will be associated with anti-Semitism either because it is related to perceived vulnerability of an in-group, because it is related to the perception of the out-group as threatening or for both reasons at the same time. This assumption is different than the expectation that collective narcissism is associated with perceived vulnerability of an in-group which leads to a tendency to construe the Jewish out-group as threatening.</p>
<p>Thus, we assume that the dual mediations—via the siege beliefs and via the conspiracy stereotype of Jews—are parallel, i.e., simultaneous and independent, rather than chain, i.e., consecutive and dependent. Even though the siege beliefs about the in-group and the conspiracy beliefs about the out-group may share common components, we assume that each of these variables should have a unique ability to mediate between Polish national narcissism and anti-Semitism above and beyond the other variable. Siege beliefs and the conspiracy beliefs about Jews are stereotypical beliefs that may exist in one’s socio-cultural repertoire separately and are two discrete reasons why collective narcissism is likely to be linked to prejudice. One reason pertains to the beliefs about the characteristics of the in-group, whereas the other pertains to attributes of the out-group.</p>

<p>In Study 1 we test the prediction that Polish collective narcissism is associated with Polish siege beliefs, the set of convictions indicating that the national in-group is constantly threatened by the hostile intentions of other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430211420891">Bar-Tal &amp; Antebi, 1992a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430211420891">1992b</xref>). We expect that Polish siege beliefs will mediate the relationship between collective narcissism and anti-Semitism. In Study 2 we test the hypothesis that the relationship between collective narcissism and anti-Semitism is independently mediated by the siege beliefs and the conspiracy stereotype of Jews. In addition, in Study 2 we seek to demonstrate that collective narcissism, rather than the mere strength of national group identification (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430211420891">Bizman &amp; Yinon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430211420891">Branscombe &amp; Wann, 1994</xref>), predicts the perception of intergroup threat and out-group negativity.</p>

<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>Participants of Study 1 were 148 Polish, undergraduate students. Their mean age was 23.12 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.89). There were 135 women and 13 men.</p>

<title>Measures <italic>Collective narcissism</italic></title>
<p>(α = .77, <italic>M</italic> = 3.26, <italic>SD</italic> = .67) was measured by the means of the 9-item Collective Narcissism Scale was used. The items reflect the belief in the in-group’s greatness and lack of proper recognition (e.g., “I wish other groups would more quickly recognize authority of my group”). Participants were instructed to think about their national group while responding to the items using a 6-point scale (1 = <italic>I strongly disagree</italic> and 6 = <italic>I strongly agree</italic>).</p>
<p>The convergent, discriminant and predictive validity of the concept of collective narcissism has been demonstrated in multiple studies. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses in three different samples demonstrated the Scale’s one-factor structure, high factor loadings (over .60) and very good fit of the items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala et al., 2009</xref>). The concept of collective narcissism was theoretically and empirically differentiated from such related concepts as individual narcissism, self-esteem, in-group identification, nationalism, patriotism (constructive and blind), national in-group glorification, superiority beliefs, collective self-esteem, positive in-group identity, social dominance orientation, and right wing authoritarianism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala &amp; Cichocka, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Siege beliefs</title>
<p>(α = .77, <italic>M</italic> = 2.81, <italic>SD</italic> =.76) were assessed by the 12-item General Siege Mentality Scale. One-dimensional structure, convergent, divergent and predictive validity of this scale were demonstrated in previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430211420891">Bar-Tal &amp; Antebi, 1992a</xref>). The scale was translated from English to Polish by a bilingual translator. It was then back translated by a bilingual expert in social psychology in order to ensure the equivalence of meaning of items on both scales. The scale contains items reflecting the belief that the in-group is constantly threatened (e.g., “Most nations will conspire against us, if only they have the possibility to do so”) and has to protect itself in this time of need (e.g., “Only unity will save us from external enemies”). Participants were asked to indicate how much they agree with each statement using a 7-point scale from 1 = <italic>definitely disagree</italic> to 7 = <italic>definitely agree</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1368430211420891">
<title>Anti-Semitism</title>
<p>(α = .71, <italic>M</italic> = 2.37, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.02) was assessed following an extensive tradition of research in psychology of intergroup relations, in terms of social distance, i.e., unwillingness to engage in contact with the Jewish out-group (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368430211420891">Bogardus, 1925</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430211420891">Goff, Steele, &amp; Davies, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1368430211420891">Struch &amp; Schwartz, 1989</xref>). We used a 4-item scale measuring preferred social distance from Jews: “Would you like a Jew to be your neighbor?” (reverse coded), “Would you like a Jew to be your friend?” (reverse coded), “Would you mind your child playing with a Jewish child?”, and “Would you mind your child marrying a person of Jewish origin?”. Participants were asked to respond to these items using a 7-point scale (1 = <italic>definitely no</italic> and 7 = <italic>definitely yes</italic>.)</p>
<p>The concept of collective narcissism has not yet been empirically differentiated from the siege beliefs concept. The two concepts overlap in the assumption about the negative or unsatisfactory reactions of the out-groups to the in-group. In order to confirm that the three sets of items used in Study 1 correspond to three separate variables, a confirmatory factor-analytic model was estimated using MPlus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1368430211420891">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2010</xref>). Since the dimensionality of the items used in Study 1 was established in previous studies and the sample size was relatively small, the analyses were performed on standardized and parcelled items. The parcels of two to three items were computed following the random assignment procedure recommended by Little and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1368430211420891">Little, Cunningham, Shahar, &amp; Widaman, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with our assumptions, maximum-likelihood estimation revealed that a three-factor model—with collective narcissism, siege beliefs and anti-Semitism items specified to load onto separate but correlated factors—fit the data better than a two-factor model—with collective narcissism and siege beliefs loading on one factor (χ<sup>2</sup> (51) = 100.88, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, for the two-factor model, and χ<sup>2</sup> (53) = 194.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), other tests pointed toward the superiority of the three-factor model. In particular, the comparative fit index—relatively less sensitive to sample size and model complexity than other indices—indicated a good fit for the three-factor model, CFI = .92. In contrast, the fit of the two factor model fell below conventional levels of adequacy, CFI = .78. Other indices also point to the better fit of three factor model; RMSEA for three factor model = .08 versus for two factor model = 13; SRMR for three factor model = .09 versus for two factor model = .12.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In the first step of data analysis we computed zero-order correlations among variables. Collective narcissism was significantly positively related to the Polish siege beliefs (<italic>r</italic> (147) = .48, <italic>p</italic> = .001) and anti-Semitism (<italic>r</italic> (146) = .20, <italic>p</italic> = .02). Siege beliefs were significantly correlated with anti-Semitism (<italic>r</italic> (147) = .37, <italic>p</italic> = .001).</p>
<p>In order to test the main hypothesis that siege beliefs mediate the relationship between collective narcissism and anti-Semitism, we used the bootstrapping method recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1368430211420891">Preacher and Hayes (2004)</xref> to obtain bias corrected 95% bootstrap confidence intervals for the indirect effect of the mediator. Bootstrapping does not require assumptions about the shape of the sampling distribution of the indirect effect and is considered as a suitable method for assessing indirect effects in smaller samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1368430211420891">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2004</xref>; for information on required sample size for detecting effects with the use of different tests of mediation see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430211420891">Fritz &amp; MacKinnon, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The mediation model is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430211420891">Figure 1</xref>. The total effect of collective narcissism on the tendency to keep one’s distance from Jews was positive and significant and indicated by the dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430211420891">Figure 1</xref>. The relationship between collective narcissism and anti-Semitism was reduced and became non-significant after the mediator was added to the model. The direct effect is indicated by the continuous, horizontal line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430211420891">Figure 1</xref>. Collective narcissism was positively associated with siege mentality. Siege mentality was positively associated with anti-Semitism (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430211420891">Figure 1</xref>). The difference between the total and direct effects of collective narcissism on anti-Semitism is the total indirect effect via the siege beliefs. We computed its confidence interval with 10.000 bootstrap samples. The indirect effect had a 95% bootstrap bias corrected confidence interval of .12 to .40, which indicates that the indirect effect of the mediator was significant. The whole mediation model was also significant, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .14, <italic>F</italic> (4,142) = 5.66, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001.

<title>Discussion of Study 1</title>
<p>The results of Study 1 confirm that collective narcissism, siege beliefs and anti-Semitism are distinct phenomena. The results corroborate previous findings indicating the positive relationship between collective narcissism and anti-Semitism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala, Cichocka, &amp; Bilewicz, 2011</xref>). The present results extend the previous findings revealing that this relationship is mediated by siege beliefs, which portray the national in-group as constantly threatened by the hostile intentions of other groups. Thus, collective narcissism is linked to the perception of the in-group as exposed and vulnerable in the context of intergroup relationships. This association is responsible for the relationship between collective narcissism and prejudice against Jews: The out-group stereotypically perceived as threatening.</p>
<p>In Study 2 we test the assumption that the stereotypical belief that the Jewish out-group is particularly threatening and hostile mediates the relationship between collective narcissism and anti-Semitism, over and above the mediation through the siege beliefs. We expect that a belief that the in-group is particularly threatened and a belief that the out-group is especially threatening will mediate the relationship between collective narcissism and prejudice independently. Nevertheless, we test the parallel against the chain multiple mediation hypothesis.</p>
<p>In Study 2 we use more direct indicators of anti-Semitism in order to conceptually replicate the results of Study 1, namely hostile behavioral intentions towards Jews. In Study 2 we also compare the role of collective narcissism and the strength of in-group identification as predictors of perceived intergroup threat and anti-Semitism.</p>

Negative emotions and evaluations of Jews (α = .95, <italic>M</italic> = 3.57, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.41) were measured following the procedure proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1368430211420891">Wright, Aron, McLaughlin-Volpe, &amp; Ropp (1997)</xref>.

Higher Aggressive behavioral intentions towards Jews (α = .92, <italic>M</italic> = 1.45, <italic>SD</italic> = .99) were measured by four items adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1368430211420891">Struch and Schwartz (1989)</xref>. Hypothetical aggressive acts towards Jews were listed, e.g., refusing to hire Jews or convincing friends not to rent flats to Jews.

<p>In order to test the hypothesis that siege beliefs and the Jewish conspiracy stereotype independently mediate the relationship between collective narcissism and anti-Semitism we used the bootstrapping method suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1368430211420891">Preacher and Hayes (2008)</xref>. This approach allows us to assess the extent to which each of these variables mediates the effect of collective narcissism on anti-Semitism, conditional on the presence of the other variable in the model. Since siege beliefs and conspiracy stereotype were positively correlated, analyzing them simultaneously in a multiple mediator model teased apart their individual mediating abilities that could be attributed to their content overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1368430211420891">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess the independent indirect effects of collective narcissism on anti-Semitism via the siege beliefs and the conspiracy stereotype of Jews, we used bootstrapping to obtain the bias corrected 95 % confidence intervals for the total indirect effect and the specific indirect effects of each mediator analyzed together.

<p>The total effect of collective narcissism on anti-Semitism was significant. It is represented by the dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1368430211420891">Figure 2</xref>. Its direct effect is non-significant, represented by the continuous horizontal line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1368430211420891">Figure 2</xref>. The difference between the total and direct effects is the total indirect effect via the two mediators. It had a 95% bootstrap confidence interval of .25 to .69, i.e., the total indirect effect of both mediators is significant. The path from collective narcissism to siege mentality was significant and the path from collective narcissism to conspiracy stereotype was significant. The effects of the mediators on anti-Semitism were also significant. There were no significant effects of age or gender. The predictors included in the full model accounted for a significant portion of variance in anti-Semitism, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .30, <italic>F</italic> (5,81) = 7.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1368430211420891">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>An examination of the specific indirect effects indicated that both siege beliefs and the conspiracy stereotype of Jews were statistically significant and independent mediators of the effect of collective narcissism on anti-Semitism. The specific indirect effect via the siege beliefs had a confidence interval of .05 to .40 and the specific indirect effect via the conspiracy stereotype had a confidence interval of .13 to .41.</p>
<p>In order to establish whether the effects of mediators differ significantly in magnitude we conducted a pairwise contrast of the two indirect effects. Since the siege mentality minus conspiracy stereotype contrast had a confidence interval of −.18 to .26, we cannot infer that the two effects differed in magnitude.</p>
<p>Since siege mentality and the conspiracy stereotype of Jews were positively correlated, it is also plausible that they influenced each other in driving anti-Semitic sentiments. For example, one could argue that collective narcissism is related to siege mentality, which in turn leads to conspiracy stereotyping and, thus, to hostility towards Jews. To verify this possibility we tested the multiple-step multiple mediator model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368430211420891">Hayes, Preacher, and Myers (2010)</xref>. In the first analysis we tested the collective narcissism → the siege beliefs → conspiracy stereotyping → anti-Semitism multi-step mediation. While the independent specific indirect effects of siege mentality and the conspiracy stereotype remained significant, the indirect effect of both mediators became insignificant (95% bootstrap confidence intervals ranged from −.01 to .16). Similar results were obtained when we tested a model with collective narcissism → conspiracy stereotyping → siege beliefs → anti-Semitism multi-step mediation. Both indirect effects of single mediators were significant and the indirect effect of the two mediators was not significant (its 95% bootstrap confidence intervals ranged from −.01 to .05). These analyses provide further support for our hypothesis that the siege mentality and conspiracy stereotype are two independent links between collective narcissism and anti-Semitism.</p>

<title>Discussion of Study 2</title>
<p>The results of Study 2 replicate the findings of Study 1. In addition, they confirm the hypothesis that siege beliefs and the belief that Jews secretly conspire to achieve economic and political power and dominate the world independently mediate the relationship between Polish collective narcissism and anti-Semitism. Collective narcissism is associated with a tendency to perceive the in-group as threatened and the out-group as particularly threatening. However, only one set of beliefs is needed to link collective narcissism with anti-Semitism: that in-group is vulnerable or that out-group is threatening.</p>
<p>The strength of in-group identification is not related to prejudice against Jews. It is related to the Polish siege beliefs but this relationship is driven by the overlap between the strength of in-group identification and collective narcissism. Once the narcissistic aspect of positive in-group identification is teased out, the relationship between the strength of in-group identification and siege beliefs disappears. These results support our claim that it is not the strength of in-group identification in general, but rather the individual level of specific, narcissistic in-group identification that is related to the perception of intergroup threat. Consequently, it is not the strength of in-group identification but collective narcissism that is related to out-group negativity.</p>

<title>General discussion</title>
<p>According to social identity theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1368430211420891">Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1986</xref>), a tendency to derogate out-groups intensifies under perceived threat to the social identity and increased salience of group membership. An intergroup threat may be realistic and concern group interests (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430211420891">Brown, Maras, Masser, Vivian, &amp; Hewstone, 2001</xref>) or symbolic and concern differences in worldviews, values and beliefs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430211420891">Esses, Dovidio, Jackson, &amp; Armstrong, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430211420891">Greenberg et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1368430211420891">McGregor et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1368430211420891">McLaren, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1368430211420891">Pyszczynski et al., 2006</xref>). It can result from out-group aggression, embarrassing rejection, unjustified discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368430211420891">Britt, Boniecki, Vescio, Biernat, &amp; Brown, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430211420891">Corenblum &amp; Stephan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1368430211420891">Stephan &amp; Stephan, 1985</xref>) or uncertainty and awkwardness in the presence of out-group members (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1368430211420891">Islam &amp; Hewstone, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1368430211420891">Stephan &amp; Stephan, 2000</xref>). Importantly, intergroup threat can be embedded in a negative stereotype of an out-group that attributes threatening features and intentions to the out-group and its members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1368430211420891">Stephan &amp; Stephan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1368430211420891">Stephan et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the strength of in-group identification is one of the important antecedents of perceived intergroup threat. It has been argued that the more people identify with their group, the more they are chronically aware of their group membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430211420891">Branscombe &amp; Wann, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1368430211420891">Tausch, Hewstone, Kenworthy, Cairns, &amp; Christ, 2007</xref>) and the more sensitive they are to anything that can harm the in-group (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430211420891">Corenblum &amp; Stephan, 2001</xref>). High identifiers have been also thought to be more likely to see the threats to the in-group as personally threatening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430211420891">Bizman &amp; Yinon, 2001</xref>). However, the meta-analytic review indicates that the relationship between the strength of in-group identification and perceived intergroup threat, although statistically significant, is inconsistent and rather weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1368430211420891">Riek et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, the relationship between in-group identification and prejudice is not consistent. Across numerous studies averages close to zero (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368430211420891">Hinkle &amp; Brown, 1990</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1368430211420891">Jackson, Brown, Brown, &amp; Marks, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1368430211420891">Pehrson, Brown, &amp; Zagefka, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>We propose that it may be not the strength of in-group identification that reliably predicts the perception of intergroup threat and prejudice, but rather its specific, narcissistic form. The results of two studies presented here confirm that people who narcissistically identify with their national in-group perceive more intergroup threat, stereotype a stigmatized out-group as particularly threatening and report more prejudice. Results of Study 1 show that Polish collective narcissism is related to siege mentality: the beliefs that the national in-group is threatened by hostile intentions of other groups and stands along against the world. This relationship mediates the link between collective narcissism and anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>Results of Study 2 replicate these findings. In addition, they indicate that the relationship between collective narcissism and anti-Semitism is independently mediated by the stereotypical perception of Jews as a particularly threatening out-group that conspires to dominate and rule the world. The perceptions of the in-group as vulnerable to intergroup threat and the out-group as threatening each have a unique potential to drive the relationship between collective narcissism and anti-Semitic prejudice.</p>
<p>The present results complement earlier findings that collective narcissism predicts retaliatory hostility in response to the threat from out-group aggressiveness, out-group rejection of the out-group criticism of the in-group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala &amp; Cichocka, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala et al., 2009</xref>). The present results go beyond the earlier findings indicating that collective narcissism predicts enduring prejudice against certain social groups, not only retaliatory hostility in threatening intergroup contexts. The present results reveal an intriguing novel aspect of the relationship between collective narcissism and out-group negativity. They indicate that collective narcissists are sensitive to intergroup threat embedded in out-group stereotype. Collective narcissism predicts prejudice because the out-group is stereotyped as threatening and collective narcissists’ feel that their in-group is vulnerable to external threats.</p>
<p>The present results confirm the suggestion that anti-Semitism is related to threat and narcissistic national pride (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211420891">Bergmann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1368430211420891">Krzemiński, 2004</xref>). They indicate that anti-Semitism is grounded in insecure and narcissistic beliefs in national superiority and fuel the sense of the in-group’s vulnerability in an intergroup context. We suggest that a similar mechanism generalizes to the relationship between collective narcissism and prejudice against other threatening out-groups.</p>
<p>Majority of out-groups with whom the in-group shares long and competitive relations are likely to be perceived as threatening. In such relations the opportunities to injure the collective pride are plenty. Collective narcissists neither forget nor forgive wrongs done to the in-group by out-groups. Thus, they are likely to see the out-groups that in the past transgressed against the in-group as potential threats, even if the transgression was mostly in “the eye of the beholder”. The more frequent and less unequivocally positive the intergroup relations with an out-group have been, the greater the chance that this out-group will be perceived as threatening. Examination of the generalizability of the present mediation model beyond anti-Semitic prejudice would be an important direction for further research.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the previous and present results indicate that collective narcissism is not universally associated with prejudice. Instead, collective narcissism seems to describe a combination of group-based feelings that can fuel hostility in certain intergroup situations and in response to certain out-groups. We propose that the relationship between collective narcissism and the sensitivity to intergroup threat can be explained by the nature of narcissistic in-group evaluation. Collective narcissism is related to high regard for the in-group contingent on external recognition and accompanied by internal doubts. Collective narcissists are easily convinced that the image of their in-group is undermined. Intergroup hostility in response to the perceived threat serve as means of protecting the in-group’s image and maintaining the in-group’s positive esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala et al., 2009</xref>). Present results reveal that collective narcissism is a better predictor of the perception of intergroup threat embedded in stereotype and prejudice than the mere strength of identification with the in-group. The positive relationship between the strength of in-group identification and perceived intergroup threat was reduced and became non-significant after collective narcissism was taken into account.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The present studies provide support for the hypotheses derived from the concept of collective narcissism. However, they have several shortcomings that should be considered. First, in both samples, there are a disproportionate numbers of women among the participants. However, in all analyses we adjusted for and found no significant effect of gender. In addition, we do not have any theoretical reason to assume that men and women differ with respect to levels of collective narcissism. Secondly, the present findings are based on university student samples, which may not be representative of the population as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1368430211420891">Sears, 1986</xref>). Future studies should extend the investigation of collective narcissism and its correlates and effects to different populations. However, it is worth noting that we found remarkably consistent patterns of relationships across both presented studies.</p>
<p>In addition, although the present studies provide support for the mediation hypotheses derived from the concept of collective narcissism, they are based on correlational data and do not allow for unequivocal conclusions about causality and order of the variables. In the present paper, we provide sound theoretical reasons to justify our assumption that collective narcissism is related to siege beliefs and the conspiracy stereotype of Jews and through these beliefs to anti-Semitism. In addition, most research in the social sciences confirm the direction of causality assumed in the proposed model. It suggests that broader ideological orientations and basic in-group identification constrain specific attitudes and beliefs, such as the siege belief or the conspiracy stereotype of Jews, and out-group hostility (rather than vice versa; see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368430211420891">Cohrs, Moschner, Maes, &amp; Kielmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211420891">Duckitt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430211420891">de Figueiredo &amp; Elkins, 2003</xref>). However, further experimental studies are needed in order to examine the role of collective narcissism in eliciting increased sensitivity to intergroup threat and prejudice. Such studies will deepen our understanding of individual difference variables and situational conditions, increasing the likelihood of out-group negativity and intergroup hostility.</p>
<p>Finally, in Study 2 we compared collective narcissism and in-group identification as predictors of prejudice. Our results indicate that when the overlap between the two variables is controlled for, only collective narcissism is a significant predictor of prejudice. However, in-group identification was measured by the single-item, whereas collective narcissism was assessed by the 9-item scale. The use of multi-method measure of one concept and a single item measure of another concept may bias the analysis in favour of the concept assessed on a multi-item measure if the reliability of the single-item measure is unknown. However, validity and reliability of the Inclusion of In-group in the Self used in Study 2 was confirmed in previous studies. This measure assesses a uni-dimensional construct and its predictive validity was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368430211420891">Cronbach, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430211420891">Gorsuch &amp; McFarland, 1972</xref>). Moreover, using a visual representation measure of in-group identification and multi-item self report scale to assess collective narcissism and semantic differentials and action preferences scale to assess anti-Semitism allows us to avoid the common methods bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1368430211420891">Williams, Cote, &amp; Buckley 1989</xref>). It increases, rather than decreases, the reliability of our findings. Finally, the results comparing the effects of collective narcissism and in-group identification on prejudice were replicated with multi-item measures of in-group identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala &amp; Cichocka &amp; Bilewicz, 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>Empirical studies confirm that collective narcissism is distinct from social dominance orientation or authoritarianism and independently predicts out-group negativity. Collective narcissism and social dominance orientation overlap in preoccupation with the in-group’s greatness. However, for collective narcissists, any excuse, not only power, social status, or economic dominance, is sufficient to support the belief in the uniqueness and greatness of the in-group. Collective narcissism and authoritarianism are related because of concern with the coherence and homogeneity of the in-group. For authoritarians, cohesiveness secures a predictable social environment and reduced cognitive uncertainty. For collective narcissists, it confirms the assumed, unanimously accepted greatness of the in-group. Authoritarians aggress against others to protect the group as a predictable social environment. Collective narcissists aggress to protect the in-group’s positive image. Collective narcissism has been also empirically differentiated from nationalism, blind and constructive patriotism, personal and collective self-esteem and positive in-group identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430211420891">Golec de Zavala et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430211420891">2011</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>We tested the mediation model using the multiple regression approach and bootstrapping method considered the best approach to analyze mediation in small samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430211420891">Fritz &amp; MacKinnon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1368430211420891">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1368430211420891">2008</xref>). The structural equation modeling is an alternative approach that allows incorporating the measurement error of the mediator into the equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430211420891">Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986</xref>). These analyses performed in MPlus indicates that the mediation model with three latent variables fits the data very well (e.g., CFI = .92, RMSEA = .07, SRMR = .09) and the effects are in line with those indicated by the path analysis. However, the sample size in Study 1 is too small to warrant sufficient power to structural equation analysis according to rules of thumb (e.g., ten observations per parameter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430211420891">Barrett, 2007</xref>) or more sophisticated formulae proposed in literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1368430211420891">MacCallum, Browne, &amp; Cai, 2006</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>Analysis controlling for group identification was also conducted. The pattern of results remained the same. The sample size in Study 2 was even smaller than in Study 1. Therefore, we did not perform structural equation modeling on this sample.</p></fn>
