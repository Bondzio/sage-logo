<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Active safety systems promise significant gains in traffic safety but can have a beneficial impact if and only if drivers use the systems. Driver acceptance of the alerts they issue will therefore be a major development target. In this article, we investigate the influence of context on drivers’ willingness to accept alerts issued by a pedestrian detection active safety system with the aim of informing the development of alerting strategies.</p>
<sec id="section8-0018720812437411">
<title>Driver Acceptance of Alerts</title>
<p>A prerequisite for a good pedestrian warning system is reliable detection of pedestrians in a wide variety of traffic contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812437411">Himanen &amp; Kumala, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812437411">Schmidt &amp; Färber, 2009</xref>). However, meeting this need is not likely to be sufficient to ensure driver acceptance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812437411">Farber &amp; Paley, 1993</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018720812437411">Farber and Paley (1993)</xref> proposed that the ideal warning system would activate in “alarming” situations even if the driver were able to avoid the accident without the alert. Such alerts would give drivers a better appreciation of the function of the system and would tune their expectations for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018720812437411">Parasuraman &amp; Riley, 1997</xref>). Although driver acceptance of alerts is likely tightly coupled to the perception of risk in the traffic context, risk perception may not be associated with the actual risk of collision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018720812437411">Sheridan, 2008</xref>). These considerations lead us to suggest that for a pedestrian warning system to become widely accepted, it must implement alerting strategies that take into consideration drivers’ attitudes to the situations in which alerts are being issued.</p>
<p>The perception of risk is hard to measure, but we can measure alert acceptance relatively easily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812437411">Källhammer, Smith, Karlsson, &amp; Hollnagel, 2007</xref>). We therefore use alert acceptance as a proxy for the perception of risk and to analyze the influence of contextual factors on driver acceptance of active safety systems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0018720812437411">
<title>The Research Agenda</title>
<p>In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018720812437411">Marshall, Lee, and Austria (2007)</xref>, who found that the rated appropriateness of alerts depends on the driving context, the purpose of this study was to identify factors that influence driver acceptance of pedestrian alerts.</p>
<p>Our selection of factors to consider was based in part on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812437411">Himanen and Kumala (1988)</xref>, who developed a model of the interaction between drivers and pedestrians in a variety of traffic contexts. Their purpose was to find factors that influence pedestrian safety. They included factors in their model that describe the locale and road environment, vehicle speed and approach direction, and pedestrian demographics. The pedestrian’s distance from the curb was a central factor in their model. Another factor we investigated was the direction of the pedestrian’s motion relative to the vehicle. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812437411">Schmidt and Färber (2009)</xref> found that pedestrians facing an approaching car are likely to cross the road at greater distances and longer time gaps.</p>
<p>The model by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812437411">Himanen and Kumala (1988)</xref>, the observations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812437411">Schmidt and Färber (2009)</xref>, and the fact that we did not have knowledge of pedestrian demographics led us to focus this investigation on five factors: (a) the locale (urban, suburban, or rural), (b) pedestrian location, (c) direction of pedestrian motion, (d) the vehicle’s path, and (e) the curvature of the road. Our aim was to identify factors that influence driver acceptance of alerts and that, by extension, should influence the alerting criteria used by the active safety system.</p>
<p>Our hypotheses are that each of the these contextual factors influences drivers’ acceptance of alerts to pedestrians. All other factors being equal, we expect alerts to pedestrians in rural locales to receive higher ratings than alerts to pedestrians in urban or suburban settings. We expect ratings to be higher when pedestrians are seen to be within or moving toward the driver’s field of safe travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812437411">Gibson &amp; Crooks,1938</xref>). We also expect ratings to alerts to be higher when a pedestrian is encountered while the driver is making a turn or is on a winding road than while driving straight down a straight road.</p>
<p>The study has two parts: a field operational test (FOT) that gathered a set of 57 video clips of pedestrian alerts and a tabletop laboratory exercise in which volunteers rated the acceptance of those alerts.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section10-0018720812437411">
<title>Field Study</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018720812437411">Lerner, Dekker, Steinberg, and Huey (1996)</xref> investigated drivers’ annoyance at randomly issued alerts in naturalistic driving conditions. They hypothesized that the frequency with which drivers accept alerts is likely to depend on traffic conditions. They proposed a conceptual field study to test that hypothesis. One of the many aims of the FOT reported in this article was to implement such a field study.</p>
<p>As part of the FOT, we collected drivers’ responses to alerts generated by a prototype pedestrian warning system. We restrict our discussion of the FOT to the drivers’ real-time interaction with the system and a two-button response unit. Drivers used the response unit to indicate whether they accepted the issued alert. We used automatically recorded video clips of the events, with both accepted and rejected alerts, as stimuli in the subsequent experiment.</p>
<sec id="section11-0018720812437411">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>For this FOT, 10 male drivers (age, <italic>M</italic> = 49.2 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.8, range = 40 to 59) participated. All had considerable driving experience (<italic>M</italic> = 30.9 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 6.8, range = 22 to 41), had corrected-to-normal vision, and reported driving at least 25,000 km annually (<italic>M</italic> = 34,800 km, <italic>SD</italic> = 5,996, range = 25,000 to 40,000). The drivers were recruited at the Autoliv research facilities in Vårgårda, Sweden, and applied voluntarily to the study. Participation conformed to the ethical guidelines established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812437411">Vetenskapsrådet (2002)</xref>, the Swedish Research Council.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0018720812437411">
<title>Task</title>
<p>Volunteers drove their own instrumented vehicles every day and without restrictions for a period of approximately 2 months. The drivers were familiar with the vehicles and were free not to use the system if they chose. Frequency of use was not collected for privacy reasons. We did not prime the drivers in any way or define criteria for situations that might constitute acceptable alerts. No structured questionnaire was used to collect driver feedback.</p>
<p>While driving, the drivers could press a button to mark a perceived miss, that is, a situation that justified an alert when none was issued.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0018720812437411">
<title>The Instrumented Vehicles</title>
<p>A prototype long-wave, or far infrared (FIR), night vision system was installed in recent-model-year Volvo S80, Volvo V70, and Saab 9-5 vehicles. The system consists of a camera mounted in the grille of the vehicle and a video display mounted on the upper part of the center console (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0018720812437411">Figure 1</xref>). The system contains integrated pedestrian recognition software that takes a vehicle-centric view: The alerting criteria are based solely on the location and motion of the pedestrians relative to the vehicle and do not consider the pedestrian’s location and motion relative to the street or road. The display screen was updated at 30 Hz with a black-and-white FIR image. The image was augmented by a flashing yellow alert symbol and red rectangle(s) that highlighted the pedestrian(s) whom the system had detected. A snapshot of a pedestrian alert is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812437411">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>A PC was mounted in the trunk. A GPS captured the vehicle’s location and provided timing information. The PC recorded the video clips in a time window before and after an alert or a button push and its time stamp to identify the exact location of the pedestrian event in the recorded FIR video stream. No video in the visual spectrum was recorded because of difficulties associated with blooming light sources.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0018720812437411">
<title>Video Clips</title>
<p>The systems flagged a total of 88 video clips with pedestrian encounters. After the FOT, the alerts were reviewed and a set of 57 video clips selected to be the stimuli in the subsequent tabletop laboratory experiment. Sequences with multiple pedestrians at different locations were eliminated to avoid ambiguity regarding which pedestrian had triggered the alert. Bicyclists were also excluded, as not enough cases were recorded to allow any separate statistical analysis on them. All remaining video clips were used. Each clip shows approximately 30 s of images from the FIR camera (like that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0018720812437411">Figure 2</xref>) roughly 20 s before and 10 s after the recorded alert. The 30-s length is a compromise designed to provide sufficient context for the alert while limiting the time of the experiment.</p>

<title>Experiment</title>
<sec id="section16-0018720812437411">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Two groups of participants took part in the experiment. The first was the group of 10 drivers from the field study. The second was a group of 25 volunteers (age, <italic>M</italic> = 43.5 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.4, range = 30 to 66) recruited from the same facility as the drivers. Most of the 25 had considerable driving experience (<italic>M</italic> = 24.2 years, range = 10 to 46). There was a wide spread of reported current annual mileage (<italic>M</italic> = 19,200 km, range = 2,000 to 50,000 km). None of the 25 had experience with the pedestrian alert system in his or her personal vehicle. Again, participation conformed to the ethical guidelines established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018720812437411">Vetenskapsrådet (2002)</xref>, the Swedish Research Council.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0018720812437411">
<title>Tabletop Equipment and Procedure</title>
<p>After reporting individually to the laboratory, the participants were told that the purpose of the study was to study factors that influence driver acceptance of issued alerts. The instructions covered the experimental procedure and equipment and the voluntary basis of participation and provided the opportunity to ask questions. Participants were informed that they would be asked to watch and rate a collection of infrared video clips, that the collection of clips included both issued alerts and situations perceived as not requiring an alert, and that they could quit or interrupt the experiment at any time for any reason at all. They were not provided with any feedback about the ratings of the video clips.</p>
<p>The laboratory setup consisted of a PC laptop connected to a video projector that presented the set of video clips on the wall at a distance of approximately 3 m and a horizontal field of view of approximately 40°. Immediately following the presentation of each clip, the projector screen showed the frozen last frame of the video clip, and the PC presented the response screen, which contained a scale bar and two buttons labeled <italic>Repeat</italic> and <italic>Next</italic>. No information about the collected traffic context other than the FIR video clips was provided to the participants.</p>
<p>The experiment was self-paced. As it was the participant who started each video clip, the experiment afforded opportunities to pause and exit the room. Each of the 35 participants rated all 57 clips. The clips were presented in random order. None of the participants used the repeat option. To avoid response bias, we did not query them on their thoughts regarding their criteria for acceptance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0018720812437411">
<title>Rating Method</title>
<p>Our approach to assess driver acceptance of alerts builds on the hazard perception test used in U.K. driving tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018720812437411">Jackson, Chapman, &amp; Crundell, 2009</xref>). We presented raters with a set of video clips of pedestrian events that they may or may not judge to warrant an alert. The video clips were shown without the alert icon. The flashing alert symbol was suppressed to avoid any indication about whether (and when) the event was triggered by the system or was flagged by the driver as a miss.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018720812437411">van der Laan, Heino, and De Waard (1997)</xref>, we quantified the relative level at which raters indicated they would accept an alert to the events in the video clips. To achieve a single measure of driver acceptance, as in the U.K. hazard perception test, we used a single scale anchored by <italic>completely reject</italic> and <italic>completely accept</italic> to condense the two components <italic>usefulness</italic> and <italic>satisfying</italic> used by van der Laan et al. By using a single measure, we sought to avoid any confound posed by individual differences in drivers’ interpretation of the different components of the van der Laan et al. metric. The scale was presented as a slider bar to obtain a continuous, but not necessarily interval, measure. The participant used the mouse to indicate the relative level of acceptance of an alert.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0018720812437411">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We cannot know whether the raters used the scale as an ordinal or an interval scale. We provided only two anchor points, no interval marks on the slider bar, and no instructions or other means to define a set of equal intervals between the anchors. Our intent was to treat the ratings as ordinal data and to follow the procedure prescribed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812437411">Siegel and Castellan (1988)</xref> for the analysis of ordinal data. This procedure converts the raw ratings into ranks within raters, assesses the concordance in those ranks across raters, and uses the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA for ranks to assess the statistical significance across categories of events. As there were 57 clips in total, the ranks varied in the range of 1 to 57, with 1 being the rank for the clip with the least accepted alert and 57 the rank for the clip with the most accepted alert. The motivation for the scale bar and other aspects of the ratings procedure is discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812437411">Källhammer et al. (2007)</xref>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, meaningful interpretations can be made with the use of parametric tests, such as ANOVA, even when the scale may not fulfill the requirements of an interval scale. As parametric analysis may facilitate broader understanding of the results, we analyzed the data using both parametric ANOVA on the raw ratings, which assumes the raters treated the slider bar as an interval scale, and the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on the rank of the rating, which treats the raw ratings as ordinal data.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section21-0018720812437411">
<title>Concordance in alert acceptance</title>
<p>Internal consistency across raters lends credence to the aggregation of the raw ratings or their rankings that is required for the analysis of whether context matters. We tested the internal consistency of the ratings provided by the 35 tabletop raters (the10 FOT drivers and the 25 who did not participate in the FOT) with both parametric and nonparametric tests. The parametric test was correlation. We found the mean rating for each event and found the correlations for each rater with those means. The median correlation was +.75. The nonparametric test was Kendall’s coefficient of concordance of the ranks of the raw ratings. This test of interjudge reliability assesses the degree of agreement in the rank ordering of a set of items (e.g., the 57 video clips) by <italic>n</italic> judges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018720812437411">Siegel &amp; Castellan, 1988</xref>). It imposes no categorical dimensions of similarity on rated items. After correcting for the numerous ties in the intrajudge ranks, we found them highly consistent, <italic>W</italic> = 0.55, χ2(56) = 1247, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001. On average, the raters, whether they had experience with the events or not, differentiated between them in a similar way. Both measures of internal consistency support using the mean values of either the ratings or the ranks in the analysis of contextual variables.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0018720812437411">
<title>Contextual variables</title>
<p>We investigated the influence of the five categories of contextual information listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018720812437411">Table 1</xref>. The video clips were classified into three locales: rural, suburban and urban. We differentiated urban (<italic>n</italic> = 17) from suburban (<italic>n</italic> = 22) by requiring continuous blocks of buildings. The presence of streetlights differentiated suburban from rural areas (<italic>n</italic> = 18).</p>

<p><italic>Note</italic>. Thirty-five participants rated the acceptance of alerts to 57 traffic events on a continuous scale (0 = <italic>reject completely</italic>, 100 = <italic>accept completely</italic>). Nonparametric ANOVA was calculated for the mean rank of the rating in each category and parametric ANOVA for the mean rating in each category.</p>

<p>The clips were also classified on the basis of location of the pedestrian: in street, left, right edge, and right side (<italic>n</italic> = 9, 10, 20, and 18, respectively). The category <italic>right edge</italic> was used for pedestrians walking on the edge of the road, whereas the category <italic>right side</italic> was used for pedestrians beyond the right edge of the road or on a sidewalk. There were insufficient cases on the left side and left edge to allow analysis of both categories separately.</p>
<p>Pedestrian motion was partitioned into four categories: same, opposite, into street, and standing (<italic>n</italic> = 12, 10, 10, and 25, respectively). The pedestrians classified as same and opposite were walking in a direction predominately parallel to the vehicle’s path in either the same or the opposite direction as the driver’s vehicle. <italic>Into street</italic> implied that the pedestrian was walking perpendicularly to the direction of vehicle travel and toward the center of the street. An example is a pedestrian approaching a zebra crossing. There were no cases in which the system issued an alert as a pedestrian walked perpendicularly away from the direction of vehicle travel.</p>
<p>The two categories of vehicle direction were vehicle straight (<italic>n</italic> = 47) and vehicle turning (<italic>n</italic> = 10). Similarly, road directions were classified as either straight road (<italic>n</italic> = 30) or turning road (<italic>n</italic> = 27). A vehicle turning in an intersection was classified as vehicle turning and straight road, whereas a vehicle traveling on a curved road was classified as vehicle straight and turning road.</p>
<p>Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA by ranks and one-way parametric ANOVA of the raw ratings were calculated to ascertain whether drivers’ acceptance of alerts varies across the various subcategories of traffic context. Both tests reject the null hypothesis of no differences across the four categories of both pedestrian location and pedestrian motion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0018720812437411">Figure 3</xref> shows the mean ratings for these contextual variables. As predicted by the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812437411">Himanen and Kumala (1988)</xref>, our participants responded much more positively to alerts to pedestrians in the street and on the right edge of the street than to alerts to pedestrians to the left of the vehicle and on the right sidewalk. These differences are supported by both parametric and nonparametric post hoc comparisons (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018720812437411">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0018720812437411">Figure 3b</xref>, the ratings for pedestrians walking in the same direction as the vehicle were much lower than they were for the other three categories of pedestrian motion. This finding may be discrepant with the observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812437411">Schmidt and Färber (2009)</xref>, who found that pedestrians facing a vehicle cross the road at greater distances. We were surprised that tests for the variable locale proved to be nonsignificant at an alpha level of .05. However, if we were to adopt an alpha of .10, the post hoc tests found that pedestrians in rural settings did elicit significantly higher levels of acceptance than did alerts in both the urban and suburban settings.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results suggest that as expected, pedestrian location and motion influence driver acceptance of alerts issued by our pedestrian detection system. Alerts are more accepted when pedestrians are close to or moving toward the vehicle’s path, that is, when they can be seen to infringe on the field of safe travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018720812437411">Gibson &amp; Crooks, 1938</xref>). The exercise of safe travel involves navigating through complex environments and, among other things, detecting and avoiding pedestrians. The driver’s perception of risk will direct his or her attention, resulting in greater attention to salient objects, such as pedestrians in the road.</p>
<p>Our data are equivocal in their support of the hypothesis that alerts to pedestrian encounters are more accepted when the driver is on rural roads. In coming studies, we will revisit the locale category and investigate whether locale information can be used to achieve alerting criteria with greater driver acceptance. Our data do not support the hypotheses that vehicle direction (turning or straight) and road geometry (curving or straight) influence driver acceptance. We do not have sufficient data at this time to investigate how the interaction of these factors may influence alert acceptance.</p>
<p>These findings support the argument that designers of the alerting criteria to be used by an active safety system should consider the contextual dependency of alert acceptance. Indeed, we suspect that the failure to consider contextual dependencies may explain why some emerging active safety systems have met with driver resistance. We argue that the acceptance of an alerting system is likely to be relatively high when, and only when, it issues alerts at times when and in situations in which drivers are likely to expect them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018720812437411">Källhammer et al., 2007</xref>). It should come as no surprise that these situations are contextually dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018720812437411">Himanen &amp; Kumala, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018720812437411">Schmidt &amp; Färber, 2009</xref>) and involve violations of the field of safe travel.</p>
<p>Pedestrians in the field of safe travel put themselves and the driver at risk. The quality of the driver’s risk assessment depends on the adequacy of the available information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018720812437411">Williams &amp; Noyes, 2007</xref>). Our findings lead us to suggest that drivers will assess the adequacy of a pedestrian alerting system by whether it contains alerting criteria that involve consideration of the field of safe travel. Such a system would issue alerts that drivers will be likely to both expect and welcome. By issuing alerts that drivers expect and welcome, the system would not only influence the drivers’ attention to potentially threatening situations but also shape their expectations and risk assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018720812437411">Neisser, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>A major challenge to FOT studies is that most of the observed events are unique in various ways. The everyday context makes it difficult to experimentally control and accurately repeat trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018720812437411">Walker, Stanton, &amp; Young, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, we have shown how we can efficiently investigate contextual factors that influence drivers’ acceptance of alerts to pedestrians by leveraging expensive FOT data within the confines of the laboratory. The laboratory review and rating of FOT data provides consistent measures of acceptance in a controlled environment and is a useful tool for developers of the alerting criteria used by active safety systems.</p>
<p>The FIR image used in this study provided participants with more contextual information than was available to the drivers looking through the windscreen. Not only are pedestrians more visible in the FIR image, but other ambient information is also clearly evident in the image. The FIR videos therefore preserve the context as well as a brief exposure can.</p>
<p>It remains an empirical question whether the length of our video clips (30 s) was sufficient to provide a full sense of the traffic context to our participants. From the standpoint of contextualization, nothing can match the FOT experience. However, it would be unrealistic and unproductive to expect participants in an experiment to sit through the video of an extended driving trip to set the stage for a random encounter with a pedestrian. The main limitation to our study may be that the 30-s duration of our clips deprives participants of useful contextual information.</p>
<p>Additional studies with participants with less experience and other demographic backgrounds are needed to test whether the results generalize to other nationalities and age groups of drivers.</p>
