<p><bold>Background and study aims</bold>. Various NOTES (natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery) hernia repair techniques have been described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a transumibilically introduced conventional double-channel flexible endoscope for performing preperitoneoscopy (FLEPP, flexible endoscopic preperitoneoscopy technique) and to perform totally extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernia meshplasty in an animal model. <bold>Material and methods</bold>. The study was done in 2 steps on 8 swines weighing 25 to 30 kg each: (1) establishing feasibility of preperitoneal dissection of the inguinal region using a conventional double-channel flexible gastroscope and making bed for mesh placement and (2) placement of a polypropylene mesh in the inguinal region to cover the myopectineal orifice. <bold>Results</bold>. The flexible endoscope provided good vision and maneuverability to identify preperitoneal structures—namely, the arcuate line, insertion of rectus abdominis on pubis symphysis, inferior epigastric vessels, deep inguinal ring, spermatic cord, pubic symphysis, and psoas muscle—without causing any damage to any of the structures. The spermatic cord could be dissected to identify the vas deference. A 9 × 7 cm<sup>2</sup> oval mesh was successfully placed over the myopectineal orifice of Fruchaud with good overlap. Average time required for the complete FLEPP procedure (including mesh placement) was 55 minutes (range 45-90 minutes). <bold>Conclusions</bold>.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The preperitoneal space is an avascular potential space, lined anteriorly by the double-layered fascia transversalis and posteriorly by the peritoneum; it continues medially into the suprapubic space of Retzius. Nyhus is credited with the term <italic>preperitoneal space</italic>, but the access to this space was first described by Bogros in 1823. Preperitoneal approaches to the groin began at the dawn of the 19th century with a new operation to manage aneurysm of the external iliac artery. This experience led to the discovery of the preperitoneal space of Bogros, which, in the 1870s, was used for the anterior repair of groin herniation. Work by Annandale (in 1876), Ruggi (in 1892), Lotheissen (in 1898), and Usher and colleagues (in 1958) helped evolve and popularize the anterior preperitoneal approach of inguinal hernia repairs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612458727">1</xref></sup> Crucial steps, eventually, resulted in extraperitoneal repair of primary and recurrent inguinal and femoral herniae becoming the preferred technique. The posterior preperitoneal approach became established in the 1920s to the 1960s, along with the use of prostheses. Stoppa and colleagues (in 1972)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612458727">1</xref></sup> reported on their giant prosthetic reinforcement of the visceral sac with large bilateral Dacron meshes, covering Fruchaud’s myopectineal orifice with extensive overlap. Laparoscopy was applied to the preperitoneal approach for hernia repair near the end of the last century. With Ger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612458727">2</xref></sup> being the first to report its application to herniology, the early 1990s witnessed many innovative surgeons embracing the transabdominal posterior preperitoneal approach, whereas Dulucq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612458727">3</xref></sup> and some other teams recommended a totally extraperitoneal (TEP) approach to avoid intraperitoneal complications. Preperitoneal approaches to the repair of primary, bilateral, recurrent, inguinal, and femoral herniae, the most common abdominal protrusions, now dominate techniques of repair. Besides hernia, preperitoneal approaches have been used for other surgical procedures, such as prostatectomies, surgery of urinary bladder diverticuli,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612458727">4</xref></sup> treatment of osteitis pubis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612458727">5</xref></sup> varicocelectomy for male-factor infertility,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612458727">6</xref></sup> and so on. The natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) approach for abdominal wall hernia repair has been widely studied in animal models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612458727">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612458727"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612458727"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612458727"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612458727"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350612458727"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612458727"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612458727">14</xref></sup> and it has also been described in a human case.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350612458727">15</xref></sup> NOTES inguinal hernia repair by intraperitoneal onlay meshplasty (IPOM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612458727">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612458727">17</xref></sup> has been reported in some animal experiments. Apart from still-unresolved issues such as viscerotomy closure and inadequate instrumentation, a common limitation for translation of these transvisceral procedures into clinical practice is the high infection rates of the polypropylene prosthesis. This is a stubborn problem, which remains unresolved even with special precautions, including gastric washing in the case of transgastric NOTES.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612458727">18</xref></sup> The umbilicus is perceived as an “embryological natural orifice” and as a natural scar on the abdomen. Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) surgery is gaining popularity as a valid alternative to conventional laparoscopy. Transumbilical flexible endoscopes have been used for LESS and hybrid NOTES procedures. New flexible endoscopic operating platforms are being developed to meet the newer demands of novel applications of flexible endoscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350612458727">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using a conventional double-channel flexible endoscope introduced transumbilically for performing preperitoneoscopy (FLEPP, flexible endoscopic preperitoneoscopy technique) and to fashion TEP inguinal hernia meshplasty in an animal model.</p>

<title>Material and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1553350612458727">
<title>Model</title>
<p>A nonsurvival porcine model with general anesthesia was used for this experiment. An inguinal hernia animal model does not exist, and it is not practical to create one, so we decided to reproduce the preperitoneal dissection of conventional TEP hernia repair followed by placement of an adequate size polypropylene mesh (without fixation) in the inguinal region using the flexible endoscope. There have already been survival experiments with NOTES hernia meshplasty, and we aimed to reproduce something that is routinely performed during laparoscopic hernia surgery, so we did not feel that survival of the animals was necessary. All procedures were performed by a single operator (PD) and video recorded. For stage 1, 4 animals were used for establishing feasibility of preperitoneal dissection of the inguinal region with a conventional double-channel flexible gastroscope, thus making the bed for mesh placement. After standardizing the steps for the FLEPP transumbilical access and gaining experience with preperitoneal dissection, 4 male swines were utilized for stage 2 of the study for placement of a polypropylene mesh in the inguinal region to cover the myopectineal orifice (reproduced from conventional TEP hernia repair).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1553350612458727">
<title>Operative Room Setup</title>
<p>The animal was in a supine position with flat decubitus, the endoscope column and the monitor were at the foot end of the table on the same side as the side of hernia surgery, and the operator stood on the opposite side of the patient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1553350612458727">
<title>Animal Preparation</title>
<p>The animals were managed according to the Directive of the European Community Council. In all, 8 medium-sized pigs weighing 25 to 30 kg were used under general anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with 1 mg/kg of propofol and 4 mg of pancuronium bromide. Endotracheal intubation was performed, and anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane, 2%. At the end of the procedure, lethal doses of propofol and potassium chloride were successively administered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1553350612458727">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>A conventional double-channel endoscope (Storz Endoskope, Tutlingen, Germany) with conventional flexible endoscopic instrumentation, including a grasper and insulated-tip diathermic knife (IT-knife2—KD-611L; Olympus Optical; Tokyo, Japan), was used for all the procedures. A HD LCD monitor by Karl Storz Endoscopy provided the image. An oval-shaped polypropylene mesh of size 9 cm × 7 cm without a slit was placed.</p>

<title>Stage 1</title>
<sec id="section9-1553350612458727">
<title>Access</title>
<p>Access to the preperitoneal space is gained as in the conventional TEP procedure. Using a curvilinear infraumbilical skin incision of approximately 1.5 to 1.8 cm lateralized on the side of the surgery, the paramedian anterior rectus sheath is reached by dissecting through the subcutaneous fatty layer. A vertical, paramedian 1.5-cm incision is fashioned on the rectus sheath to snugly fit the endoscope. The rectus abdominis muscle is then split vertically along its fibers with a Kelly artery forceps to enter the plain between the muscle fibers and posterior rectus sheath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612458727">Figure 1</xref>). With the small right-angled retractor in place, some space is created by blunt dissection with the little finger. The tip of the flexible endoscope is then introduced in this space and air insufflated.</p>

<sec id="section10-1553350612458727">
<title>Dissection</title>
<p>After the initial working space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612458727">Figure 2</xref>) is obtained, dissection is advanced by performing up-down and left-right bending of the endoscope tip while abutting the tip against the dissection plain, thus reproducing exactly the finger-like blunt dissection in the preperitoneal plain till the arcuate line (free edge of the posterior rectus sheath) is reached. On advancing beyond it, suddenly, we fall into a compartment with very flimsy tissue. By insufflating sufficient amount of gas and systematic blunt dissection with the endoscope tip, the space opens up and the inferior epigastric vessels are visible. That is our first landmark. The endoscope is retracted back until cranial to the arcuate line, and the dissection is continued laterally in the same way as described above till the psoas muscle, the lateral limit of dissection, is reached. The transilluminated light of the endoscope visible on the anterior abdominal wall serves as a guide till the anterior iliac spine is reached. Then, dissection is continued medial to the inferior epigastric vessels. One can clearly identify the ventral component of the preperitoneal fascia complex (also generally known as the posterior layer of transversalis fascia) below which lies the preperitoneal fatty tissue in the dorsal component of the preperitoneal fascia complex. Inferior epigastric vessels actually lie in between 2 layers of transversalis fascia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350612458727">Figure 3</xref>). The dissection is then advanced medially till the bony structure of the pubis symphysis is identified and the retropubic space is reached. The tip of the IT knife (without electrocoagulation) is very useful for blunt but precise dissection without causing peritoneal perforation. The posterior layer of the transversalis fascia needs to be disrupted to gain access to the preperitoneal fat, and it is actually in this layer that the hernial sac of the indirect hernia will be found that is to be dissected separate from the cord structures. The spermatic cord is identified, and the cord blood vessels are dissected along their length to identify a thick structure—vas deferens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1553350612458727">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1553350612458727">5</xref>). The limits of dissection are as follows:</p>

<title>Placement of mesh</title>
<p>The end of the mesh that is to be put medially is held with the endoscopic grasper (introduced through one of the operating channels of the flexible endoscope), and the mesh is rolled spirally over the tip of the endoscope. The preperitoneal space is inflated beforehand, and abdominal layers are lifted with the army-navy retractor. The whole assembly is then gently pushed under vision through the infraumbilical incision, so as to reach the groin area. Care must be taken not to perforate the peritoneum with the forceps holding the mesh by keeping the tip of forceps abutted to the rectus muscle. As soon as the arcuate line is negotiated, the forceps is then advanced straight to the pubic symphysis, and the mesh is delivered completely under vision in the same orientation as it would be finally placed. The mesh is then unfolded by rolling the endoscope tip over it and also by manipulating it with the forceps. It is completely unfolded and is placed exactly in the same way as it would be placed during the TEP procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1553350612458727">Figure 7</xref>). Positioning of the mesh is confirmed by aspirating air out of the preperitoneal space, and closure of the peritoneum over the mesh is confirmed as the preperitoneal space approximates.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All FLEPP procedures were completed successfully without conversion to standard laparoscopic or open surgery and without any complication. It was possible to correctly identify the posterior rectus sheath and gain access anterior to it. The true preperitoneal space could then be reached after blunt dissection with the flexible endoscope and by using pneumodissection. The operative space could be maintained using endoscopic air insufflation as and when needed without perforating the peritoneum. The flexible endoscopic vision was excellent in terms of obtaining good orientation of the preperitoneal space and identifying all the anatomical landmarks and was comparable to the conventional TEP image familiar to the surgeons.</p>
<p>In stage 1, it was possible to achieve adequate dissection spanning from midline to the iliac spine (confirmed from outside palpation) and till the retropubic space inferiorly. It was possible to identify structures—namely, the arcuate line (free edge of posterior rectus sheath), insertion of rectus abdominis on the pubis symphysis, inferior epigastric vessels, deep inguinal ring, spermatic cord, pubic symphysis, and psoas muscle—without causing any damage to any of the structures. The spermatic cord structures could be dissected and the vas deferens could be identified. The peritoneal edge could be pushed sufficiently down to prepare the bed for prosthetic mesh placement.</p>
<p>In stage 2, it was possible to deliver the prosthesis successfully in the inguinal region, under vision, without causing peritoneal perforation, as described. With the help of an endoscopic grasper and rolling movement of the endoscope tip, it was possible to completely unfold the mesh. The oval-shaped mesh of size 9 × 7 cm<sup>2</sup> was successfully placed over the myopectineal orifice of Fruchaud with good overlap on the medial side and completely covering the cord structures. The lie of the mesh was confirmed at the end of each procedure by aspirating all the gas out of the operating field. There was no intraoperative complication or mortality. The average time required for the complete FLEPP procedure with mesh placement was 55 minutes (range 45-90 minutes)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>LESS was rejuvenated initially as a stepping stone to NOTES, but it quickly gained popularity as a worthy innovation in its own right and for inguinal hernia as well. Later, surgeons added on by introducing the flexible endoscope in the peritoneal cavity through the single umbilical incision for attempting surgeries like cholecystectomy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350612458727">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350612458727"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350612458727">22</xref></sup> appendectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1553350612458727">23</xref></sup> The incorporation of NOTES into routine surgical practice, which will happen sooner or later, stimulates ongoing research in the field of flexible endoscopic platforms and instrumentation. Presently, transumbilical endoscopic hybrid procedures seem to be a feasible option, with some patient benefits to be expected, such as reduced postoperative pain and better cosmesis. Natural scar surgery through the umbilicus avoids the problems of access, closure, and infection (common with NOTES) while maintaining the benefits of scarless surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350612458727">22</xref></sup> This inspired us to devise the FLEPP technique. Because TEP hernioplasty does not necessarily involve control of any blood vessel or specimen retrieval and the whole procedure can be completed within the limited dissection space without the need of a stitch or ligature, it was the first surgical application of the FLEPP technique that we attempted. We performed the creation of an operating space and dissection using endoscopic insufflations and conventional flexible endoscopic instrumentation for the dissection of the cord structures. Other new modalities such as lasers can be of use as a dissecting/hemostatic tool for the FLEPP technique. The thulium laser has a wavelength of 2 µm and provides a continuous wave with a tissue penetration of 1 mm and a coagulation depth of 1 to 2 mm. The fiber can be introduced through the operating channel of the conventional flexible endoscope. Its use in transgastric NOTES partial nephrectomy without hilar clamping in the experimental animal model has been demonstrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1553350612458727">24</xref></sup> As already recommended by many authors, we did not fix our mesh. Alternatively, fibrin sealants or bioglue can be a noninvasive method for flexible endoscopic mesh fixation, as demonstrated by the authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612458727">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1553350612458727">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some studies have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of transvisceral NOTES inguinal hernia IPOM repairs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612458727">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612458727">17</xref></sup> They use specialized prosthetic materials to avoid adhesion formation, but adhesions cannot be completely prevented, and they have the potential to cause future complications. Superiority of the TEP over the transabdominal posterior preperitoneal approach in terms of safety has been established in many studies, including the Cochrane database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1553350612458727">26</xref></sup> The main argument behind the philosophy of NOTES hernia repair is the possibility of avoiding abdominal wall incision, which can itself give rise to hernia. But, we also know that systematic closure of the port site causes significant reduction in the occurrence of laparoscopic port-site hernia. One strong argument in favor of the use of the umbilical route as against natural orifice is that we have more effective measures to avoid and treat the contamination with <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> from skin, but the transport of a foreign body through a body cavity (colon, stomach, and vagina) may not be compatible with the long-held surgical principle of avoiding intestinal contamination of the peritoneal cavity and especially of any nonabsorbable prosthetic material. Fortelny et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612458727">14</xref></sup> described the hybrid-NOTES IPOM procedure for ventral hernia repair by transgastric access, but because of concerns about the high risk of contamination, they chose to introduce the prosthetic material through the transumbilical optical port. In addition, there is no foolproof closure system for viscerotomy created during NOTES hernia repair. The technology and instrumentation in the NOTES field is not adequate to solve these issues. All-in-all, NOTES hernia repair is not yet ready to be translated into clinical practice. Single-port surgery has emerged as an important technique that specifically addresses such issues of NOTES procedures.</p>
<p>We essentially used the existing endoscopic instrumentations for the FLEPP technique without CO<sub>2</sub> insufflations. The flexible endoscope is introduced in the umbilical incision without a special trocar, and the operating space during the FLEPP technique is always created under vision by the blunt tip of the endoscope and the air insufflations without using any balloon or endodissector, which is commonly used during the TEP technique. The procedures were safely completed in an average of 55 minutes without need for adding any extra transabdominal trocar. All the procedures were performed by a single operator with an assistant/nurse to manipulate the endoscopic instrumentation. All this should make the FLEPP technique a cost-effective procedure. From the personal experience of the authors, the level of flexible endoscopic skills acquired by the “modern-day” endoscopic surgeon should be sufficient for performing the FLEPP technique.</p>
<p>Apart from inguinal hernia repair, another potential clinical use of the FLEPP technique will be for bilateral endoscopic varicocelectomy, the most common correctable etiology found in adult men with infertility. Agarwal et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612458727">6</xref></sup> demonstrated the safety and feasibility of the TEP approach using laparoscopic instrumentation for bilateral varicocelectomy in infertile males without the use of any energy device. The authors claim that TEP varicocelectomy is superior to and safer than laparoscopic varicocelectomy. We demonstrate that the spermatic cord can be easily identified, and the spermatic vessels can be dissected by our technique. We found the flexible endoscopic IT-knife head (without electrocoagulation) to be suitable for performing blunt dissection of the spermatic cord structures. Endoscopic clips can be used to seal the feeders to the dilated varicocele veins. Alternatively, a thulium laser (2 µm) beam, a precise but relatively “cold” energy source, can be used to cut and coagulate the varicocele vessels as described by Osório et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1553350612458727">27</xref></sup> in transvesical pure NOTES bilateral varicocelectomy and Boylu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1553350612458727">24</xref></sup> for transgastric NOTES partial nephrectomy. Thus, theoretically though, TEP varicocelectomy can be entirely reproduced with the FLEPP technique.</p>
<p>During endoscopic TEP inguinal hernioplasty, complete reduction of the hernia sac is not always feasible because a sac could extend into the scrotum or be adhered. In such circumstances, ligation of the hernia sac appears to be a sound alternative to reduction, though clear identification and dissection of the hernia sac away from the vas deferens and the gonadal vessels is recommended before ligation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1553350612458727">28</xref></sup> Ligation of a difficult hernia sac should be possible using the FLEPP technique by introducing the absorbable endoloop (used in conventional laparoscopy) by the side of the flexible endoscope through the umbilical incision.</p>
<p>In the animal model, we did not have a “hernia sac” embedded in the spermatic cord structures to dissect. So, we aimed to identify the anatomical landmarks in the inguinal region and tested the utility of existing flexible endoscopic instrumentation for simulating the TEP procedure. The FLEPP technique, like any other newly introduced surgical technique, is not free from limitations. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of the FLEPP technique, but we lack a comparing arm for the TEP procedure, so we cannot comment about the benefits and drawbacks as compared to conventional TEP procedure. The flexible endoscopic instrumentation currently available is not strong enough to deliver sufficient force imaginably required for dissection of the adherent hernia sac. Such cases can be difficult even for the TEP approach. We believe that ANUBIS (Karl Storz Endoscope, Tuttlingen, Germany) developed in collaboration with our institute<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1553350612458727">29</xref></sup> and other newer flexible endoscopic platforms such as R-scope (Olympus Optical Co, Center Valley, PA), Direct Drive Endoscopic System (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA), EndoSAMURAI (Olympus Corp. Tokyo, Japan),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1553350612458727">30</xref></sup> and others will have some answers for the technical difficulties we face today. The issues regarding sterility of the flexible endoscopic system and safe introduction of the prosthetic material need to be addressed. Although we did not study survival of the animals and did not collect any microbiological data, logically, the risk of contamination of the mesh in the FLEPP technique should be less than that during transvisceral NOTES hernia repair. This has been corroborated by the randomized experimental study by Buck et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612458727">18</xref></sup> So it can be presumed that contamination risk of the FLEPP technique should be similar to as that in conventional TEP repair. Although it remains controversial whether sterile instrumentation is truly needed for surgery, sterility remains a cornerstone of modern surgical practice. It is difficult, but possible, to terminally sterilize flexible endoscopes and deliver them sterile to the operating field using a carefully designed protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1553350612458727">31</xref></sup> Spaun et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1553350612458727">31</xref></sup> in their exhaustive review about sterilization of the flexible endoscope, have recommended 3 possible techniques of sterilization of the flexible endoscope available for human use: prolonged soaking in high-level disinfectant/sterilant, automated liquid sterilization, and gas sterilization using ethylene oxide. Two additional sterilization modalities are currently being developed: hydrogen peroxide gas vapor sterilization (eg, STERRAD, Ethicon, Inc, Somerville, NJ) and ozone sterilization (TSO3 Inc, Dalton, Québec, Canada).</p>
<p>As described by Fong et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612458727">8</xref></sup> for NOTES, by thinking out of the box (and out of the lumen), we could come up with some novel ideas for sterile mesh delivery, such as a self-assembling mesh or endoscope-compatible mesh delivery system.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of the transumbilical FLEPP technique and its utility for performing TEP inguinal hernia repair with prosthetic mesh placement in a swine model. This technique looks promising for inguinal and extraperitoneal pelvic surgeries and can be a step forward in the direction of making minimally invasive surgery truly “scarless.”</p>
