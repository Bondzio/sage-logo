<p>The past really is another country. It's February 1978 and we are in <italic>The Times</italic> office at Gray's Inn Road. William Rees Mogg, the editor, has enterprisingly invited Margaret Thatcher to a lunch so she can meet union leaders. The 10-strong <italic>Times</italic> contingent includes the paper's three labour correspondents, all of them largely devoted to covering the country's many strikes, and of whom I am easily the most junior. We are at the aperitif stage and smoking is freely permitted.</p>
<p>Fumbling nervously in my jacket pockets for a box of matches which isn't there, I see out of the corner of my eye the radiantly smiling, 52-year-old Leader of the Opposition advancing across the room in my direction, her handbag, not yet as famous as it will become, already open. Out of it she fishes a gold – if I remember rightly – lighter which she presumably keeps for the benefit of Denis, a 60-a-day man, and lights my cigarette. I am, despite myself, beguiled as well as grateful. Embarrassingly this is my most vivid memory of probably the first and last occasion on which she can be said to have met senior representatives of the TUC socially.</p>
<p>Clearly she enjoyed it – in her own way. The union delegation included the bank employees' leader Leif Mills; the head of the Economic Department David Lea; and, less obviously, Jim Slater, the much travelled National Union of Seamen general secretary. He was a Geordie whose ship had been torpedoed when he was serving in the wartime Arctic Convoys, and he had come to prominence as a rank-and-file scourge of the previous leadership's cosy relationship with shipping employers, branded – unfairly – by Harold Wilson as one of a “tightly knit band of politically motivated men” behind the 1966 strike. (Slater always resented the implication that he had been acting under the influence of the Communist Party rather than from a simple desire to advance conditions for merchant seafarers). But Thatcher was hardly there to hear their life stories.</p>
<p>“It was most valuable having their views although there is obviously a diversity of views among themselves as well as in some cases between myself and them,” ran her characteristic thank-you letter to Rees Mogg. “In any case it was a wonderful discussion and I am most grateful.” Rees Mogg would recall later to John Grigg, historian of <italic>The Times</italic>, that there had actually been hardly any “discussion” and that she had mainly “lectured” the union guests.</p>
<p>Is it because it wasn't exactly fun that we think the Thatcher premiership was longer than it actually was? It was, after all, less than 12 years after that lunch, which took place a year before she became Prime Minister, that she was arguably past the peak of her power, if certainly not of her self-belief.</p>
<p>It's November 1989 and I am again in The Presence, this time in Downing Street to interview her for the short-lived <italic>Sunday Correspondent</italic>. The encounter had been fixed months ahead, but serendipitously occurred the week after Nigel Lawson's resignation, the heady climax of a row over the exchange rate – whether to float the pound or be in the ERM – which Nicholas Ridley would describe as the “single event in the whole of her period which led to her fall”. She was tired – she confessed to having been “so exhausted” the previous night – but also combative. It was Lawson, she said, and not she who had “moved away” from the pact they had reached after Lawson and Geoffrey Howe had confronted her on the issue in Madrid in June. She reeled off a dauntingly long list of figures for state subsidies to industry in Italy, Germany, France.</p>
<p>They demonstrated, she said, the lack of “fair competition” which would justify ERM membership. And then to my horror, after some 25 minutes, she got up, announcing it was time to end the interview. Clutching a piece of paper with a long list of unasked questions, I fell back in desperation on a chance meeting I had had with her closest adviser on the way in to her office. “Charles Powell told me you had a full hour, Prime Minister,” I stammered, my mouth dry from panic. She seemed to sway on her feet like a galleon in a gale. And then sat down again, heavily.</p>
<p>I left the meeting as if concussed. So much so that, though we had had the full hour, I could see no real story in it as we drove back to Clerkenwell. It was my photographer colleague Matt Ford who pointed out that the Prime Minister had never before said she would call it a day after one more election. Back in the office I looked at the transcript of the exchange which followed her saying that, if necessary – “I might fall out of a helicopter tomorrow” – there were “several people” who could take over.</p>
<p>“I've heard one or two of your colleagues say that it's not inconceivable that you would fight a fifth election if you won the fourth.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“That is nice of them, isn't it?”</p>
<p>“Do you think that is likely?”</p>
<p>“No, because I think people would think it was time for someone else to carry the torch, but I want the torch still to be burning and burning bright. It has done some wonderful things for our country, it really has.”</p>
<p>So this was our front page story: “Thatcher to go after election”. Afterwards some of those close to her suggested that as a journalist from the left I had devised a fiendish plot to trap her. If only. The truth was that one of her greatest cabinet admirers, Lord Young, had indeed told me some months earlier that he believed she was thinking of a fifth election (on any normal cycle, that would have meant 1996 or 1997). So why had she – lowering her head briefly as she did so, I now remembered – intimated her own political mortality?</p>
<p>In his biography of her, John Campbell presents a reason. “I had to say it, Kenneth,” Campbell records her telling Kenneth Baker. “When I said before the last election that I would go ‘on and on and on’ people accused me of being arrogant.”</p>
<p>In less than a month she changed her mind, correcting – indeed over-correcting – with a declaration to Independent Radio News: “They were calling me a lame duck. I have never been a lame duck in my life and I don't intend to be one now. In an interview with Robin Oakley of <italic>The Times</italic> she explained: “The question the <italic>Sunday Correspondent</italic> put to me was: ‘Was it likely that I would fight …’ was it likely? And I have had so many protests about my answer that by popular acclaim I am quite prepared to carry on.” When IRN asked if perhaps she would fight a sixth election, she said: “Well let us take two more first.”</p>
<p>In fact, her decision, as Campbell puts it, to “throw caution to the winds” like this so soon after ruling out a fifth election further undermined her position, already weakened by Lawson's resignation, by the divisions over Europe, and above all because of the Poll Tax. The present day carriers of “the torch” – including Charles Moore – insist that the real underlying argument which ended the premiership was the one over Europe. And of course it was crucial to the famous Geoffrey Howe resignation speech a year later, which became the catalyst for Michael Heseltine's leadership challenge.</p>
<p>But it is hard to believe that what Moore calls the cabinet “coup” against her after the first ballot would have been as cohesive without the Poll Tax, which a large majority of the cabinet opposed, her Chancellor Nigel Lawson most strongly of all.</p>
<p>Indeed the story we all missed, of course, as Lawson gleefully pointed out in his memoirs, was the absence – utterly abnormal in the case of a revenue raising measure – of the chancellor's name from the list of cabinet ministers sponsoring the community charge bill. But before Lawson, a strong opponent of the tax, resigned I do remember the words of a Treasury official: “The only two people left who believe in it are her and Nick Ridley. And Ridley's wobbling.”</p>
