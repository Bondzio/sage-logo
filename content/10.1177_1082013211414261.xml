<abstract>
<p>The proximate analysis (dry matter, protein, fat and ash), cholesterol, fatty acid and fat-soluble vitamin compositions of the tail muscle of wild caught and captive crayfish (<italic>Astacus leptodactylus</italic>) were investigated. Captive crayfish contained higher moisture and fat content than wild crayfish. In contrast, wild crayfish contained a higher level of crude protein, ash and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), particularly eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) than captive crayfish. Arachidonic acid (C20:4 <italic>n</italic>-6) was the major <italic>n</italic>-6 PUFA in wild <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic>, and linoleic acid (C18:2 <italic>n</italic>-6) was the major n-6 PUFA in captive <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic>. The percentages of total saturated fatty acids (SFA), PUFA, and <italic>n</italic>-3/<italic>n</italic>-6 ratio were higher in wild crayfish and total monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were lower. Although differences existed between wild and captive crayfish in vitamins A (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), δ-Tocopherol (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), α-Tocopherol acetate (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), no differences were found in vitamins D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, α- Tocopherol and K (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). The differences may be originated from the diet provided to captive crayfish. Since wild <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> contained higher <italic>n</italic>-3/<italic>n</italic>-6 ratio than captive <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic>, crayfish farms can potentially produce a better quality of crayfish meat by increasing the PUFA <italic>n</italic>-3 (especially DHA and EPA) in the diets of <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic>.</p>

<p>Many decapod crustaceans are cultivated and harvested from the wild for human consumption. They are a popular luxury food which commands high prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013211414261">Holdich, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013211414261">Ackefors, 2000</xref>). Freshwater crayfish are a luxury food in many West European countries. Much of the production is obtained from introduced North American crayfish species such as the signal crayfish, <italic>Pacifastacus leniusculus</italic> and the red swamp crayfish, <italic>Procambarus clarkii</italic> which have become established in the wild or are cultured in crayfish farms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013211414261">Harlıoğlu and Holdich, 2001</xref>). In Scandinavian and other north European countries, the native, noble crayfish, <italic>Astacus astacus</italic> is the preferred species, but this species is now more difficult to obtain, and consequently more expensive, due to the continuing impact of a fungal disease, crayfish plague, which has devastated populations since the last century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211414261">Holdich, 1999</xref>). In addition to these species, another native species of Europe, the narrow-clawed crayfish (popular name Turkish crayfish), <italic>Astacus leptodactylus</italic>, forms an important part of the market, either as imports or from introduced populations farms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013211414261">Harlıoğlu and Holdich, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Turkey was the largest supplier of <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> to Western Europe from 1970 (or possibly earlier) until 1986. Therefore, it constituted a major part of the European market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211414261">Köksal, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1082013211414261">Harlıoğlu and Güner, 2007</xref>). As a result of the crayfish plague the harvest of <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> was diminished severely in most populations in Turkey after 1985 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211414261">Köksal, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013211414261">Ackefors, 2000</xref>). The harvest was only 783 tonnes in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013211414261">Anonymous, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In Europe, the market demand for crayfish is not less than 10.000 tonnes per year. Scandinavia, Germany and France are the main consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1082013211414261">Wickins and Lee, 2002</xref>). Thus, it is highly likely that there will be an increase in the demand for crayfish in Europe, mainly satisfied by imports, as most native crayfish species populations still need time and support in order to fully recover from the crayfish plague (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013211414261">Harlıoğlu, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>At present, there is no crayfish aquaculture in Turkey. All production is obtained from wild harvest. However, it seems that <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> may be of interest for crayfish aquaculture especially in Turkey and in some European countries in near future because of its rapid growth and high fecundity rate, wide temperature and dissolved oxygen tolerance, and non-burrowing behavior. In addition, it easily adapts to formulated food and it can be cultivated in extensive and semi-intensive conditions. Furthermore, intensive aquaculture systems can be used in order to produce juveniles of this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013211414261">Harlıoğlu, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Nutritional value of aquatic species is the result of a complex set of characteristics involving factors such as chemical composition, vitamin and mineral content, texture and color, among others. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211414261">Fuentes et al. (2010)</xref> these quality parameters are influenced by intrinsic (species, size and sexual maturity) and extrinsic factors (source of nutrients, season, water quality, temperature, etc.). They also stated that the nutritional value and organoleptic characteristics of aquatic species are especially affected by rearing conditions, so that composition and sensory parameters are expected to be different between wild and farmed aquatic species.</p>
<p>The objective of this study is to investigate the differences in fatty acid composition, cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins between wild caught and captive <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic>.</p></sec>

<p>Twenty-one mature crayfish (average length and weight: 96.5 ± 1.4 mm and 28.6 ± 1.9 g, respectively, mean ± SD) were captived in the crayfish reproduction unit of Fisheries Faculty of Fırat University, Elazığ, Turkey between July 01, 2009 and November 01, 2009. Crayfish were stocked in a concrete tank (2 × 2 × 0.5 m<sup>3</sup>). Plastic pipes (20 cm in length and 7 cm in diameter) were placed in the tank to provide shelters for the crayfish. Crayfish were weighed and were fed 2% of their wet weight daily, divided into three separate feedings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013211414261">Ackefors et al., 1992</xref>) with a commercial trout pellet (Manufactured by Pınar, İzmir, Turkey). There are no commercial crayfish pellets in Turkey at present. The commercial trout pellet used for the present study contained 7.81% moisture, 39.81% protein, 20.66% fat, 8.48% ash and 86.75 ± 6.58 mg/100 g cholesterol content.

<p>Water flow was 0.2 L/s for the tank. Dissolved oxygen, pH and water temperature were measured daily. Ammonia, iron, copper, alkalinity, hardness, calcium and water flow were measured twice a week. Mean dissolved oxygen was 7.1 ± 1.1 mg/L; mean ammonia, iron and copper concentrations were less than 0.001 mg/L (for each parameter), mean alkalinity was 224.8 ± 1.9 mg/L as CaCO<sub>3</sub>; mean calcium was 42.4 ± 2.3 mg/L; mean hardness was 350 ± 30 mg/L as CaCO<sub>3</sub>; mean pH was 7.7 ± 0.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211414261">AOAC, 1995</xref>). Mean water temperature (°C) was 19.45 ± 0.7 in July, 21.8 ± 0.6 in August, 20.1 ± 0.4 in September and 16.2 ± 0.2 in October.</p>
<p>On November 01, 2009 (after 4 months), fifteen <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> were collected randomly from the tank (average length and weight (mean ± standard error): 100 ± 1.2 mm and 33 ± 3.1 g, respectively). It appeared that the crayfish in captivity grew 3.5 mm in length (from 96.5 to 100 mm) and 4.4 g (from 28.6 to 33 g) in weight in 4 months. In addition, in the same week, for the comparative purpose 15 mature <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> (average length and weight: 102 ± 1.7 mm and 34.7 ± 2.8 g, respectively) were caught from Keban Dam Lake population of <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic>. Tail muscle of wild caught and captive crayfish was dissected and was stored for approximately two weeks at −30 °C until analyzed.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1082013211414261"><title>Proximate analysis</title>
<p>Six wild caught and six captive <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> were used to determine proximate analysis and cholesterol content of the tail muscles. Proximate analysis of triplicate samples were made as follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211414261">AOAC (1995):</xref> dry matter, after drying at 105 °C for 24 h to constant weight in an oven; protein content was determined by Kjeldahl method (nitrogen × 6.25); fat was determined by soxhlet apparatus with petroleum ether; ash content was determined by weighing after burning at 550°C.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1082013211414261"><title>Fatty acid analysis and the fat-soluble vitamins</title>
<p>Ten wild caught and ten captive <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> were used to carry out fatty acid and fat-soluble vitamins analysis. Extraction of lipids: lipid extraction of tissue samples were extracted with hexane-isopropanol (3:2 v/v) by the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013211414261">Hara and Radin (1978)</xref>. One gram tissue sample was homogenized with 10 mL hexane-isopropanol mixture. The homogenate was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and parts of tissue remnants were precipitated. The supernatant part was used in the ADEK, cholesterol and fatty acid analysis.</p>
<p>Preparation of fatty acid methyl esters: fatty acids in the lipid extracts were converted into methyl esters including 2% sulfuric acid (v/v) in methanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013211414261">Christie, 1992</xref>). The mixture was vortexed and then kept at 50 °C for 12 h. Then, after being cooled to room temperature, 5 mL of 5% sodium chloride was added and then it was vortexed. Fatty acid methyl esters were extracted with 2 × 5 mL hexane. Fatty acid methyl esters were treated with 5 mL 2% KHCO<sub>3</sub> solution and then the hexane phase was evaporated by the nitrogen flow and then by dissolving in 0.5 mL fresh hexane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013211414261">Christie, 1992</xref>), they were taken to auto sampler vials.</p>
<p>Gas chromatographic analysis of fatty acid methyl esters: methyl esters were analyzed with the Shimadzu GC-17 Ver. 3 gas chromatography (Kyoto, Japan). For this analysis, 25 m of long Machery-Nagel (Germany) capillary colon with an inner diameter of 0.25 µm and a thickness of 25 µm film was used. During the analysis, the colon temperature was kept at 120–220 °C, injection temperature was kept at 240 °C and the detector temperature was kept at 280 °C. The nitrogen carrier gas flow was 1 mL/min. The methyl esters of fatty acids were identified by comparison with authentic external standard mixtures analyzed under the same conditions. After this process, the necessary programming was made and the necessary programming was made and the Class GC 10 software version 2.01 was used to process the data.</p>
<p>HPLC analysis of ADEK vitamins: five mL supernatant was taken to 25 mL tubes with caps and 5% KOH solution was added and immediately vortexed for 20 s. The tubes were placed in a water bath at 85 °C for 15 min. The tubes were then taken and cooled to room temperature and 5 mL of distilled water was added and mixed. Lypophlic molecules that did not saponify were extracted with 2 × 5 mL hexane. The hexane phase was evaporated with nitrogen flow. It was dissolved in 1 mL (50 + 50%, v/v) acetonitrile/methanol mixture and then was taken to autosampler vials and was analyzed.</p>
<p>The analysis was made with the Shimadzu brand HPLC device. HPLC conditions were as follows: mobile phase 60:38:2 (v/v/v): acetonitrile/methanol/water. The mobile phase flow rate was determined to be 1 mL. An UV detector was used for the analysis, and as a column the Supelcosil LC 18 (15 × 4.6 cm<sup>2</sup> 5µm; Sigma USA) column was used. For vitamin E and cholesterol 202 nm, retinol, 326 nm and for vitamin D and K, 265 nm was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211414261">Katsanidis and Addis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211414261">López-Cervantes et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

The wild caught crayfish had a higher protein, ash and cholesterol, but lower moisture and fat content than captive crayfish. However, the crayfish in captivity had a higher fat content than the crayfish caught from wild.

<p>In addition, the results revealed that captive <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> contained significantly higher proportions of 20:0, 20:2 <italic>n–</italic>6 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and significantly higher proportions of 14:0, 18:1 <italic>n</italic>-9, 18:2 <italic>n</italic>-6, 18:3 <italic>n</italic>-3, 20:1 <italic>n</italic>-9 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), but significantly lower proportions of 18:0 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), 16:0 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and 20:4 <italic>n</italic>-6, 20:5 <italic>n</italic>-3, 22:6 <italic>n</italic>-3 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) than wild caught <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic>. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1082013211414261">Wickins and Lee (2002)</xref> the fatty acid composition in crustaceans varies with habitats and readily reflects the composition of the diet. It was also reported that assimilation pattern of dietary fatty acids in fish muscle reflect the content of the dietary lipid sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013211414261">Ackefors et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1082013211414261">Wickins and Lee, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study it was determined that the total SFA content of lipids was 25.56% in wild caught <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> and 22.95% in captive <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic>. In addition, palmitic acid (C16:0) was the major SFA in both wild caught and captive <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic>, followed by stearic acid (C18:0). These contents were also found higher in some wild caught fish species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013211414261">Chen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211414261">Fuentes et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study it was also determined that oleic acid (C18:1 <italic>n</italic>-9) was the primary MUFA in wild caught and captive <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic>. Furthermore, the oleic acid content of captive <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> (22.51 ± 0.47) was significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) higher than that of wild caught <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> (15.10 ± 1.07) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013211414261">Table 3</xref>). In the present study, the oleic acid content of experimental diet was 23.56%. Similar to the findings of present study, the oleic acid content of farmed and wild caught sea bass (<italic>Dicentrarchus labrax</italic>) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211414261">Fuentes et al. (2010)</xref> in a study on the comparison of wild and farmed sea bass meat quality (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1082013211414261">Table 5</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211414261">Fuentes et al. (2010)</xref> concluded that the higher amount of oleic acid in cultured fish could be due to its dominance in its commercial diet. The oleic acid content of experimental diet in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211414261">Fuentes et al. (2010)</xref>’s study was 17.9%.</p>
<p>Linoleic (C18:2 <italic>n</italic>-6), linolenic (C18:3 <italic>n</italic>-3), eicosapentaenoic (EPA; C20:5 <italic>n</italic>-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 <italic>n</italic>-3) are particularly important dietary ingredients for crustaceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1082013211414261">Wickins and Lee, 2002</xref>). In the present study, among <italic>n</italic>-3 series of the fatty acids, the percentages of EPA and DHA in wild caught <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> lipids were significantly higher than those of captive <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), which is in good agreement with those previously reported for some wild fish species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1082013211414261">Rueda et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211414261">Fuentes et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of this study revealed that among <italic>n</italic>-6 series of the fatty acids, the primary fatty acid was arachidonic (C20:4 <italic>n</italic>-6) for wild caught <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic>, and linoleic acid (C18:2 <italic>n</italic>-6) for captive <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic>. Linoleic acid was also found in high amounts in the diet used for captive <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> in the present study. Therefore, it is thought that wild caught crayfish contained less amounts of linoleic acid than captive crayfish. Similar results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1082013211414261">Table 5</xref>) were found for some fish species by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1082013211414261">O’Leary and Matthews (1990)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1082013211414261">Rueda et al. (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1082013211414261">Mnari et al. (2007)</xref>. On the other hand, wild caught crayfish had higher levels of arachidonic acid in agreement with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013211414261">Gonzalez et al. (2006)</xref>. They reported that higher concentrations of arachidonic acid in wild fish (yelllow perch, <italic>Perca flavescens</italic>) when compared to the farmed fish. It was concluded that the high amount of arachidonic acid in wild caught crayfish was due probably to the diet of wild caught crayfish being rich in this fatty acid. However, in captive crayfish, levels of arachidonic acid were low because the diet used contained minimal amounts (0.33%) of this fatty acid.</p>
<p>The ratio of <italic>n</italic>-3 to <italic>n</italic>-6 fatty acids was significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) higher in wild caught crayfish than captive crayfish which shows that there is a reduction in the nutritional quality in the lipid components of captive crayfish. The lower proportion of n-3 PUFA in captive crayfish may reduce the nutritional quality of their lipid components. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013211414261">Alasalvar et al. (2002)</xref> found same results in a study on the differentiation of cultured (2.88) and wild sea bass (3.02; <italic>Dicentrarchus labrax</italic>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013211414261">D’Abramo and Robinson (1989)</xref> reported that the fatty acid composition of the tissue reflected the fatty acid composition of the diet, but other factors may also influence their fatty acid composition. Environmental factors such as the relative abundance of food sources, temperature, tissue, life cycle and moult stage and reproductive performance can affect fatty acid composition of freshwater and marine crustaceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013211414261">Eversole et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1082013211414261">Wickins and Lee, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>As regarding PUFA/SFA, it was found to be 1.79 and 1.56 for wild caught and captive crayfish. According to the nutritional guidelines of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013211414261">Department of Health (1994)</xref> of the UK, a ratio of 0.45 or more is recommended as a balanced fatty acid intake on healthy diet. Therefore, it can be concluded that the findings of present study show that wild caught crayfish and captive crayfish can be considered as appropriate for human diet (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013211414261">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec>

<p>The fat-soluble vitamins have been reported to show wide range of variations among fish and crustaceans species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013211414261">D’Abramo and Conklin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013211414261">Dias et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1082013211414261">USDA, 2005</xref>). For example, vitamin A content (µg/100 g) was found to be 16 and 15 in wild crayfish and farmed crayfish, 2 in wild blue crab (<italic>C. sapidus</italic>), 54 in <italic>Penaeidae</italic> shrimp, 21 in lobster (<italic>H. americanus</italic>), 5 in spiny lobster (<italic>Jasus</italic> ssp) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1082013211414261">USDA (2005)</xref>. In addition, vitamin E (α-Tocopherol) content (mg/100 g) was found to be 2.85 in wild caught crayfish, 1.10 in <italic>Penaeidae</italic> shrimp, 1.47 in lobster (<italic>H. americanus</italic>) and vitamin K (µg/100 g) was found to be 0.1 in wild caught crayfish and 0.1 lobsters (<italic>H. americanus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1082013211414261">USDA, 2005</xref>). In addition to this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013211414261">Dias et al. (2003)</xref> investigated the vitamin contents of fish and fish products consumed in Portugal. They found that vitamin A, D and E contents of mackerel meat were 64 µg/100 g, 9.3 µg/100 g and 1.5 mg/100 g, respectively. Those of salmon were found to be 33 µg/100 g, 11 µg/100 g and 4.0 mg/100 g, and those of rainbow trout were 8.8 µg/100 g, 19 µg/100 g and 0.13 mg/100 g, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013211414261">Dias et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec></sec>

<p>Wild caught and captive <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> may be differentiated using proximate composition, fatty acid proportions and the fat-soluble vitamins. The total saturated, polyunsaturated fatty acids and the <italic>n</italic>-3/<italic>n</italic>-6 ratios were higher in wild caught crayfish than captive crayfish. These differences may be attributed to the diet constituents of the crayfish. However, it can be concluded that in order to have higher <italic>n</italic>-3/<italic>n</italic>-6 ratios, to meet fatty acid requirement of <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> and to have a better quality of <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> meat PUFA <italic>n</italic>-3 (especially DHA and EPA) content in the diet of <italic>A. leptodactylus</italic> should be increased.</p></sec>
