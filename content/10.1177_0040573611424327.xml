<abstract>
<p>Kierkegaard declared that even his upbuilding discourses were communicated indirectly. This is somewhat surprising, since he published the upbuilding discourses veronymously, whereas his alledgedly aesthetic works were published pseudonymously. In my article, I analyse one of Kierkegaard’s early upbuilding discourses in order to examine whether, and if so in what way, it is an instance of indirect communication. I also discuss whether there are theological reasons for such indirectness. If Christianity for Kierkegaard was insolubly linked with the paradox does that explain why indirectness is an exigency when writing within a Christian context? The discourse analysed and discussed is the one called “Think about Your Creator in the Days of Your Youth.” Here, Kierkegaard launched his enigmatic notion of a phase in life he calls “the Retreat.” This notion appears to imply that it is too late if one attempts to attain true belief in old age and that youth therefore is a priviledged age when it comes to belief. But the paradox proves to challenge this implication in a paradoxical fashion. As a part of the investigation the emblem of the rose, which plays a part in the discourse, is also discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Kierkegaard’s upbuilding discourses were published veronymously and in <italic>The Point of View</italic> he famously declared that he had offered them to the world with his right hand (although the same—wicked—world went for the work, that he offered with his left hand, <italic>Either-Or</italic>). It could therefore be argued that they communicate directly and thus differ fundamentally from the pseudonymous and chiefly aesthetically oriented works, where the communication is indirect.</p>
<p>What Kierkegaard means by indirect communication—and how he practices this kind of communication—are of course extremely tricky questions. But at any rate the notion that the upbuilding discourses are instances of direct communication cannot be maintained.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0040573611424327"><title>The Indirect Nature of the Upbuilding Discourses</title>
<p>Such a notion was in fact already disclaimed by one of Kierkegaard’s pseudonyms, Johannes Climacus. In his commentary on various works by Kierkegaard in the first part of the <italic>Postscript</italic>, Climacus writes the following about the upbuilding discourses:
<disp-quote>
<p>Just as the pseudonymous books, in addition to what they are directly, are indirectly a polemic against speculative thought, so also are these discourses, not by being speculative, for they are indeed speculative, but by not being sermons. If the author had called them sermons, he would have been a rattlebrain. They are upbuilding discourses; in the prefaces the author repeats word for word “that he is not a teacher” and the discourses are not “<italic>for</italic> upbuilding,” a stipulation that already in the preface humorously revokes their theological significance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573611424327">1</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This is a remarkable statement. The word “speculative” is always related to the philosophy of Hegel and—especially—the thinking of Danish Hegelians like the aesthete Johan Ludvig Heiberg and the theologian Hans Lassen Martensen. Thus, the passage just quoted might be an ironic and polemical comment to the sermons of Martensen. But it is still somewhat unsettling that Climacus claims that that the discourses are speculative. In his <italic>Kierkegaard’s Upbuilding Discourses</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040573611424327">2</xref></sup> George Pattison argues that Climacus maybe indirectly states that the discourses are Socratic, something which, from Climacus’ perspective in <italic>Philosophical Fragments</italic>, would fundamentally exclude them from the Christian position.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040573611424327">3</xref></sup> As Pattison points out, however, the understanding of Socrates in the <italic>Fragments</italic> is somewhat limited when compared to that of the authorship as a whole.</p>
<p>But, whether his conception of Socrates in the <italic>Fragments</italic> is limited or not, would Climacus really indirectly connect his maieutic precursor with the derided category of speculation? As far as I can see, the claim that the discourses are speculative remains a provocation, no matter which way you try to explain it. Is this provocation is a kind of indirect way of pointing to the indirection of the discourses? When you are forced to come up with formulations like that, at least you know whom you are reading and discussing!</p>
<p>In Kierkegaard’s aborted lectures on communication, the exact title of which is “The Dialectic of Ethical and Ethical-Religious Communication,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040573611424327">4</xref></sup> it is unambiguously stated that all communication on matters related to human existence must of necessity be indirect. This, in other words, is a further affirmation written by Kierkegaard himself that the communication of the upbuilding discourses is indirect. But the best way of settling the matter is of course to demonstrate the indirectness by <italic>reading</italic> the discourses. This is what I will attempt to do here. I will, however, limit myself to one discourse, namely “Think about Your Creator in the Days of Your Youth,” (1844) which I find quite exemplary in this context.</p>
<p>Before I can commence my reading, however, there is another question I will have to address. It has to do with two different phases of Kierkegaard’s upbuilding writing. Is there a fundamental difference between the early discourses, the ones that it is possible for Climacus to refer to, and the later ones written after the <italic>Postscript</italic>? In fact, Climacus points to the importance of this question in advance, when he writes the following about the early discourses:
<disp-quote>
<p>Magister Kierkegaard most likely knew what he was doing when he called the upbuilding discourses <italic>Upbuilding Discourses</italic> and also knew why he refrained from using Christian-dogmatic categories, from mentioning Christ’s name etc., which otherwise in our day is done freely, although the categories, thoughts, the dialectic in the presentation, etc. are only those of immanence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040573611424327">5</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In his later discourses, Kierkegaard did <italic>not</italic> shy away from mentioning the name of Christ and using concepts belonging to Christian dogmatics. So is the communication of the later ones then direct, as opposed to the indirect communication of the earlier ones?</p>
<p>The answer to this question has to be a negative one, I believe, first and foremost because Climacus’ characterization of the early discourses simply is not true. As George Pattison has pointed out when discussing this question,
<disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, there is even a clear sense in which Climacus’ claim that the discourses “abstained from the use of a dogmatic Christian terminology, from mentioning the name of Christ” or from broaching the concept of sin, or the paradoxical element of authority, is simply wrong.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040573611424327">6</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Pattison follows up with a number of convincing examples.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040573611424327">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>One has to admit, though, that it is quite true that there is a difference between the early discourses and the later ones. Christ is mentioned and dogmatic Christian terminology used much more often in the later ones. But, as Pattison has shown beyond any shade of a doubt, the difference is a relative one. It is in no way absolute. Therefore, there is no reason to assume that the later discourses are not to some extent also communicated indirectly.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040573611424327"><title>Language?</title>
<p>I adhere to the view that all of Kierkegaard’s authorship, even including <italic>The Point of View</italic>, is communicated indirectly. Moreover, I think that this fact is a direct consequence of Kierkegaard’s understanding of language, an understanding he formed at an early stage of his career as a thinker and writer. I thus totally agree with Michael Strawser when he states that
<disp-quote>
<p>Kierkegaard … concludes early in his development—before his so-called proper production begins—that there can be no solution to the problem of language. This provides the necessary philosophical background to understanding why Kierkegaard embarked on the sea of “indirect communication.” When one reads Kierkegaard’s early writings closely, one finds that the pseudonymous writings were born of Kierkegaard’s reflections on the problem of language, and not of a need to rid himself of inauthentic perspectives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040573611424327">8</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As Strawser points out, the basic assumption of texts like <italic>The Concept of Irony</italic> and <italic>Johannes Climacus</italic> is that language is a medium of mediation, so to speak, and that immediacy therefore cannot find a voice in language. There is no natural connection between the linguistic sign and its referent and language first and foremost refers to itself even if it, of course, can be used referentially. A language of immediacy would be something like the Adamitic one spoken by Adam before the Fall. Human language as we know and speak it is postlapsarian, in other words.</p>
<p>Another scholar who has pointed out the importance of the question of language in Kierkegaard’s authorship is Steven Shakespeare in <italic>Kierkegaard, Language and the Reality of God</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040573611424327">9</xref></sup> In his own words, Shakespeare offers a reading of Kierkegaard’s work which “makes his commitment to writing inextricable from the account of language implicit within it.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040573611424327">10</xref></sup> He does offer such a reading, after initially charting the historico-philosophical background for Kierkegaard’s reflections on language.</p>
<p>However, I just quoted him as stating that Kierkegaard’s account of language was <italic>implicit</italic> within his work and that would appear to be a serious complication when attempting to use it as an interpretative tool. Perhaps this formulation should be slightly modified, though. Kierkegaard often wrote explicitly on matters relating to language—and he often does so in his upbuilding discourses. But he nowhere delivered a systematic philosophical account of his understanding of language. Apart from reading Kierkegaard’s texts very closely, one therefore has to piece together scattered remarks about language from various works and entries in his journals and papers in order to form an idea about this understanding. Needless to say, I do not have the time or space to do that here. Instead, and as mentioned, I hope that my reading of one of the upbuilding discourses will contain a few exemplary aspects.</p>
<p>I will therefore commence my reading of the discourse “Think about Your Creator in the Days of Your Youth.”</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040573611424327"><title>Youth?</title>
<p>The title of the discourse is an admonition or some words of spiritual instruction which can be found in Ecclesiastes (12:1), urging the reader to remember to think about his or her Creator in the days of his or her youth. Kierkegaard—or the speaker of the discourse, if one prefers to emphasize the possible indirection of the discourse, which I tend to do—supported this admonition. He expressed the view that when it comes to thinking about one’s Creator, it is “[I]n youth one does it <italic>most naturally</italic>” (<italic>KW,</italic> V, 242: <italic>SKS</italic>, 5, 241). And if one did not think about one’s Creator when young, one will, metaphorically speaking, not have any religious or Christian capital to draw upon when one later in life discovers the need to turn to God.</p>
<p>But does the speaker really think so? Does he really believe that from a Christian perspective youth is a privileged age in which the conditions for developing a genuine relation to God are especially favourable? Such a view would be significantly at odds with Kierkegaard’s basic Christian-religious idea that before God we are all equal—and all of us equally in the wrong. It would turn something which, according to Kierkegaard as we know him, is distinctly relative, a difference in age, into something much more absolute.</p>
<p>This is stated very clearly by the Danish theologian Anders Kingo in an essay which borrows its title from the discourse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040573611424327">11</xref></sup> Kingo writes,
<disp-quote>
<p>One does not have to read much in this upbuilding discourse by Søren Kierkegaard before one realizes that “youth” has not got anything to do with concrete age, but expresses the true and right relationship to God and oneself, which is indifferent to age but eternally youthful. If this was not the case, the upbuilding discourse would have made something merely differential, being young, into something religiously significant. But that would not be upbuilding!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040573611424327">12</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Still, if the term “youth” in the discourse is a metaphorical or allegorical expression, which denotes the true spiritual relationship to oneself and to God, then it denotes a state of mind in which one must be thinking about one’s Creator. In such a case the title of the discourse would be a tautology: “Think about your Creator when you think about your Creator.” Kingo’s suggestion does not really solve the difficulty presented by the discourse.</p>
<p>He does, in fact, admit that the discourse is far from being a straightforward text. According to him it is one of the most “singular”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040573611424327">13</xref></sup> of Kierkegaard’s discourses, even “the most cryptic one,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040573611424327">14</xref></sup> as it is filled with “strange expressions and turns of phrase,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040573611424327">15</xref></sup> But, according to the speaker, if the discourse is enigmatic, it must be due to himself, not because of the nature of the words from Ecclesiastes:
<disp-quote>
<p>This is how the words sound [about the importance of thinking about the Creator in the days of one’s youth, my comment], and even if you in lightness of spirit or in heaviness of spirit tried to beguile the Preacher, to trick him out of the admonition, which certainly would be lamentable, you would not succeed; the Preacher is not responsible for any ambiguity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040573611424327">16</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>He does, however, state his aim that his own text will also be clear. But at the same time he points out that the clarity he has in mind is of a rather special kind:
<disp-quote>
<p>In this way the Preacher admonishingly addresses the young, but anyone who wants to speak of those words just read will strive not only to make clear in his discourse the thought contained in the words but also to make the discourse itself clear … <italic>That the discourse is clear—what else does this signify except that it applies to someone, that it does indeed speak to some human being for upbuilding</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040573611424327">17</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The meaning of the discourse, in other words, will only be clear if it has an upbuilding effect upon a reader. The clarity of the meaning does therefore not only depend upon the efforts of the speaker but also—and maybe predominantly—upon those of the reader.</p>
<p>There is thus no guarantee that any scholarly efforts can assist in making the meaning of the discourse appear clear and transparent. Rather, we should heed the words of Anders Kingo who in the same essay intriguingly states that the discourse is a function of the paradox:
<disp-quote>
<p>But if one maintains the essence of Kierkegaard’s Christology just hinted at, that nothing and everything is new, and if one applies the paradoxico-religious category to the discourse, then one in my opinion will not only have discovered the very key to understanding the discourse, but one will in addition to this in this discourse find an extremely interesting expression of Kierkegaard’s singular art of preaching [<italic>prædikekunst</italic>]: that he does not discourse on or write discourses about the paradox, but lets the discourse become a function of the paradox.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040573611424327">18</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This fascinating suggestion cannot, however, be accepted without severe reservations. Kingo states that Kierkegaard exercised a special art of preaching or writing sermons and that is, as we have seen, in stark contradiction to Climacus’ claim that the early discourses are not sermons and their writer not an ordained preacher. Furthermore, Kingo writes that Kierkegaard’s upbuilding texts preach “under the authority which makes everything new.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0040573611424327">19</xref></sup> This is in quite stark contrast to Kierkegaard’s so often reiterated claim to write upbuilding discourses “without authority.”</p>
<p>I will therefore attempt to make a different sort of sense of Kingo’s idea that the discourse in focus here can be read as a function of the paradox. I will examine whether it can be read as such a function in a way which takes heed of the question of language in Kierkegaard as it has been discussed above.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040573611424327"><title>The Emblem of the Rose</title>
<p>A first—and <italic>in itself</italic> not sufficient—indication that the discourse could be such a function is the fact that the Old Testament context is discretely challenged or undermined from within as a consequence of the figurative language applied in a certain passage. The figurative language instigating this challenge or subversion is not in any way unusual or original. In fact, it has to do with one of the most traditional emblems in Western literature, secular as well as Christian, namely the rose. The figural rose in the discourse is imported via the apocryphal Book of Wisdom, which traditionally is ascribed to Solomon. I am referring to this passage:
<disp-quote>
<p>So, then, let “youth wear the crown of rosebuds before they wither” (The Wisdom of Solomon 2:8), but let no one teach this to youth, teach it to do this “as in youth” (Wisdom, 2:6) and thereby influence, or in any other way influence, youth to “reason unsoundly” (Wisdom 2:1), as if this were the only thing it had to do, because thought of the Creator is still youth’s most beautiful glory, is also a rosebud, but it does not wither.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0040573611424327">20</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The roses from the Book of Wisdom enter the discourse in the guise of conventional <italic>vanitas</italic> emblems. Young people are advised to take pleasure in the roses before they wither, because they are sure to do that, wherefore young people perhaps also should bear in mind that they will not stay young forever. Subsequently, the speaker slightly alters the allegorical implications of the emblem. The thought about their Creator carried by young people is also hailed as a young rose, but one that <italic>will not</italic> wither. On the contrary, this thought will prove to be the saving remembrance—or as I put it more prosaically earlier on: the necessary religious or Christian capital—when one later in life realizes that one is in a state of spiritual bankruptcy, that one has let oneself become separated from God.</p>
<p>This allegorical application of the emblem of the rose is repeated in the very last words of the discourse:
<disp-quote>
<p>[B]ut youth’s thought of the Creator is a rosebud that does not wither, because it does not know the time of year or of the years, and it is the child’s most beautiful ornament, and the bride’s most beautiful jewel and the dying person’s best garment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0040573611424327">21</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>On the one hand, this passage supports Kingo’s point that the discourse is not really about concrete ages or phases of human life, since the thought about the Creator of <italic>young people</italic> can paradoxically be both “the child’s most beautiful ornament” and “the dying person’s best garment.” Thus, the thought about the Creator, the rose that will never wither, is what counts, no matter whether you are a child, are young or are dying in old age.</p>
<p>The emblem of the rose is of course well known in a Christian context, for instance in the psalms of the pietistic period. An excellent Danish example is the psalm of Hans Adolf Brorson “Den Yndigste Rose er Funden” (<italic>The Prettiest Rose Has Been Found</italic>) from 1732. Brorson was one of Kierkegaard’s favourite psalm writers and he wanted a couple of lines from one of Brorson’s other psalms as an epitaph on his tombstone. A stanza from “Den Yndigste Rose er Funden” where the image of the rose plays a significant part is this one, which I have had to translate myself:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>O, seek out the lowly places,</italic> <italic>Cry in the dust before the Saviour,</italic> <italic>Then our Jesus will hear you</italic> <italic>Because the roses grow in valleys</italic></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In the psalm there is an initial reference to the Rose of Sharon from the Song of Solomon which, obviously, is the source of the imagery of it. So far, we remain within a context limited to the Old Testament and even to its “Solomonic” texts. But in Christian theology the rose of the Song of Solomon is traditionally read as prefiguring the figure of Christ, the Saviour. And this is precisely the case in Brorson’s psalm, where the congregation is advised to cry in the dust before <italic>the Saviour</italic>. Thus, the imagery of the very last words of the discourse could well be interpreted to mean the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>[B]ut youth’s thought of <italic>the Saviour</italic> is a rosebud that does not wither, because it does not know the time of year or of the years, and it is the child’s most beautiful ornament, and the bride’s most beautiful jewel and the dying person’s best garment.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This, to conclude, is how I think the context of the Old Testament is discretely challenged or undermined from within the discourse. Still, the way it happens is anything but revolutionary. On the contrary, one could hardly conceive of more traditional and emblematic imagery than what features here. Anyway, the figure of Christ lingers <italic>indirectly</italic> in the discourse, even if that figure ought to be wholly absent in such an early one according to Climacus. Moreover, we are faced with a new problem.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the speaker states that it is in the days of one’s youth that the thought about one’s Creator comes most naturally. The same hardly applies to the thought about Christ, the Saviour or Redeemer. God appearing in the shape of a humble servant, the paradox <italic>per se</italic> is conceived of as a sign of contradiction in Kierkegaard,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0040573611424327">22</xref></sup> and relating to him is therefore inextricably bound up with the possibility of taking offence in this sign.</p>
<p>It is thus indicated that the discourse could well be implicitly implicated in matters that have something to do with the paradox. This can be further demonstrated, if one follows how it writes itself towards and through the maneuver it enigmatically refers to as “the retreat” (<italic>Tilbagetoget</italic>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0040573611424327"><title>The Retreat</title>
<p>Already at an early stage of the discourse a fictive character is portrayed who did not succeed in maintaining or rediscovering the thought of the Creator of his youth:
<disp-quote>
<p>When a person’s life draws towards evening, when, weary and reflective, he associates with death as his one and only confidant, when his spirit has lost the strength to make an accounting in earnest and death has become the comforter, when his will and purpose no longer desire anything but his thought vaguely fumbles in the past, while forgetfulness like a busy day laborer works early and late in the service of the comforter and now youth flits by the soul like a dream—then such a person, musing on life’s most beautiful meaning as this once pertained to him, says to himself: Happy the one who did that!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0040573611424327">23</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Youth here hastily passes like a dream and there is nothing connected to it which this person can support himself with or just relate to. And this is, as the speaker points out, a sign that “the spirit wants to be extinguished.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0040573611424327">24</xref></sup> However, it might be that such a person never really made it to become spirit in the first place. Spirit is a category of reflection in Kierkegaard, which means that the becoming spirit of a person implies that difference is somehow operative. Not just the difference of being a relation that relates to itself—Anti-Climacus’ definition of the self from <italic>The Sickness unto Death</italic>—but also a temporal difference or distance. A laconic formulation of this temporal distance to oneself can be found in a journal entry: “Spirit is the second time.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0040573611424327">25</xref></sup> What is meant by this brief statement, I believe, is that in a certain sense genuine Christian faith makes everything new, but the one who believes as a Christian does not become an entirely new person. He or she does not leave behind the person he or she was before. Faith is an act which must be repeated because the person that one was is also repeated, one could say. If that sounds very cryptic, let me point out a striking example of this second time of spirit in Kierkegaard. My example is the apostle Paul in another early discourse, “The Thorn in the Flesh” (1844). The Paul of this discourse cannot rid himself of the person he was before a certain event befell him on the road to Damascus. He is still haunted by the memory of what he did to those Christians he persecuted before this event. The discourse interprets the thorn in the flesh as well as the angel of Satan, which hits the apostle in the face, as metaphors for this haunting memory that will not let go of him and which pulls him back from his blissful visit to the higher heavenly spheres. The spirit which is the second time thus must acknowledge that there is no getting absolutely rid of the first time, no possibility in this world of being spiritually born completely afresh. This is the fundamental antidote in Kierkegaard to the pride or vanity that could otherwise infect faith.</p>
<p>The person in the passage from the discourse, to return to him, just lets his or her youth pass by like an ephemeral dream. There is no indication of a second time in any profound sense. The spirit which is put out must therefore be of a very feeble kind. It is interesting to compare this case to a statement Kierkegaard makes about himself in <italic>The Point of View</italic>: “instead of having been young, I became a poet, which is youth a second time,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0040573611424327">26</xref></sup> in which the second time is not that of spirit but of youth—a youth that remarkably was absent the first time. So what is implied by the application of the terms “youth” and “second time” here? Kierkegaard’s claim that he has not been young must be connected to the stern upbringing he received from his father, presumably. But how can his becoming a poet be synonymous with the repetition of this youth that was absent in the first place? The youth of the poet’s second time must be of a more ideal sense, apparently, but it still is open to interpretation how this autobiographical note from <italic>The Point of View</italic> is related to the critique of the emblematic poet which often is voiced in Kierkegaard’s authorship.</p>
<p>This note points to a problem which could well haunt the discourse, “Think about Your Creator in the Days of Your Youth,” namely the following one: what if, like in the case of Kierkegaard, there was no genuine youth in which one <italic>naturally</italic> would be thinking about one’s Creator? Does one not find oneself in a serious spiritual predicament in such a case, where there is no spiritual or religious capital to draw upon, to stick to this dubious metaphor? If that is actually the case, “then one has not thought about the Creator in one’s youth and has lost not only youth but also the understanding [<italic>Forstanden</italic>, literally one’s mind, my comment] of youth’s thought of the Creator.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0040573611424327">27</xref></sup> Is one then in a situation where not even the grace of God can help one out?</p>
<p>In spite of the pertinence of such questions—not least to the Christian poet who himself was never young—the problem is not confronted until the end of the discourse. Before it happens, the possibility of the separation from the thought or consciousness about one’s Creator is mentioned, and this coincides with the introduction of the perhaps most singular and cryptic category in the discourse, the category of the “retreat”:
<disp-quote>
<p>When the separation is there, it is not so important to stare fixedly at the reason as to sorrow over the separation, which can manifest itself in such a different way when the evil days the Preacher speaks of have come or when the <italic>retreat</italic> is to begin. Just as the first book in the Old Testament has been called Genesis, the second Exodus, so it could very well be said that in human life there is a third book that is called Retreat. There is evident, then, a necessity to turn back to that which once was so beautiful but which since then has been disdained, forgotten, disregarded, defiled, and to which everyone nevertheless now has recourse with a certain shame.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0040573611424327">28</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Once this third phase of life, the retreat, begins, one experiences the necessity of a second time of spirit, of returning to the spiritual state or place where one once was but no longer is. It is stressed that when one returns it is decisive that the aforementioned spiritual or religious capital from one’s youth is still there for one to draw upon. We can further read, “but it is the Preacher who says: Therefore think about your Creator in the days of your youth, think about this for the sake of the retreat.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0040573611424327">29</xref></sup> It is even stated that “having thought about the Creator in one’s youth is the retreat’s rescuing angel.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0040573611424327">30</xref></sup> But then the retreat of the discourse itself as regards this issue begins:
<disp-quote>
<p>Now if there is anyone whom this meditation only painfully reminded of his lack, then it certainly would be unseemly and unworthy of an upbuilding discourse, indeed, all the worse for itself, if it remained unsympathetic, because in that case it would not be upbuilding, would not have found the universal, but would have been beguiled by the accidental [like a difference in age, my comment].<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0040573611424327">31</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>But which lack will the discourse have to address if it is to be truly upbuilding? The one which consists in not being able to recall the thought from one’s youth of one’s Creator, or the more radical problem that there was no genuine time of youth and therefore nothing to recall at all? Clearly, it is the latter possibility the speaker is really concerned with, and finally he does confront it directly:
<disp-quote>
<p>If, however, there is some person whose youth no loving solicitude has preserved for him, if he had got into life poorer than the son of poverty to whom the parents left their poverty, poorer than the one to whom the father at least left a blessing and the mother an admonition, helpless, forsaken, forsaken by himself because he had no youth—oh, there is no youth so godforsaken, but that the fragments, if collected so carefully that nothing is wasted, would not by the blessing of God become an overabundant compensation, and there certainly was no youth, however short it was, so godforgotten that the recollection or the deep and sorrowful longing for it would not be able to rejuvenate the person who was never young. Spiritually, the fulfilment is always in the wish, the calming of the concern in the concern, just as God is even in the sorrowful longing that is for him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0040573611424327">32</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A miracle is hinted at here which, at the spiritual level, can compare to a certain miraculous meal in the desert. If one gathers the crumbs or fragments of the time of youth that never was, then the result proves to be an overabundant compensation for—that which never was. This is indeed a radical act of renewal, renewing as something positive what is merely a lack or an absence.</p>
<p>That God is already in the genuine and truthful looking for him is of course a motif which permeates Kierkegaard’s upbuilding discourses. But that, I believe, is a specifically Christian idea which is not without affinity to the paradox and the bearing witness to love connected to it. But no new or renewed language corresponds to this idea about God who can redeem and renew in this radical way. Language remains the same and one could say that it consequently is cancelled out or broken apart in order that the paradox—and thus in a sense indirectly or negatively—can make itself heard. Because is that not what in effect happens when the discourse at the same time purports two ideas which are absolutely incompatible? We could call them A and B:
<disp-quote>
<p>A. Recollecting the idea of youth about one’s Creator is the redeeming factor, even the rescuing angel, in the time of crisis of the retreat, when one painfully discovers that one has let oneself become separated from God.</p>
<p>B. God is the Saviour and therefore he can make young again (= give faith to) even the one who never was young and thus never had a time of youth in which to think about his or her Creator, but who now genuinely and truthfully is looking to find God.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Possibility B is not accentuated until the final page of the discourse. This final page, however, not just renews what has been discoursed about up until then, it effectively revocates it. The ecclesiastical admonition, possibility A, is not simply renewed or proven to be a metaphor for a more radical perspective or state of affairs. It is called irrevocably back in order to make way so possibility B can take centre stage instead. No logical steps can lead from A to B. The difference between these two possibilities is not one that can be mediated—only indirectly announced by the Saviour’s lingering in the emblem of the rose. What language apparently keeps together is radically torn asunder in a way that the rational mind might well take offence at. One aspect of the discourse is thus that it is an attack on—or an offensive against—the rational and calculating mind which may well have to risk taking offence at or losing itself in the encounter with it.</p>
<p>The immediately most ironic formulation in the discourse is thus the statement that it will seek to discover what is most “universal”—or common or general—in order to be upbuilding. The universal aspect it discovers truly to come into its own as an upbuilding discourse is the singular—and <italic>un</italic>natural—case of the one who grew old without ever having been young. It is only if we take into account that we live in the reality of sin that something universal concerning this case can be identified. If the state of sin is our starting point, then we can only arrive backwards, so to speak, to the beginning of faith as a new—but therefore a second, a belated—immediacy. Perhaps the history or historicity of the single individual is related to what Peter Fenves, commenting upon a passage from <italic>A Literary Review</italic>, has characterized as “an asymmetrical structure of historicity, the articulation of which is not causal, certainly not ‘developmental,’ but instead <italic>repetitive</italic>—progressive regression repeating itself as regressive progression.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0040573611424327">33</xref></sup> A chiasm fit to characterize an upbuilding discourse as a function of the paradox.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0040573611424327">34</xref></sup></p></sec>
