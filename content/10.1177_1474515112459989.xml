<title>Background:</title>
<p>Coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality rates are higher among women, particularly black, than men. Women’s mortality rates may reflect difficulty in recognizing CHD prodromal symptoms (PS) but reliable screening instruments for women are scarce. The McSweeney Acute and Prodromal Myocardial Infarction Symptom Survey (MAPMISS) captures women’s PS presentation, but has limited testing among black women.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1474515112459989">
<title>Aim:</title>
<p>To assess the test–retest reliability of the MAPMISS PS section for black and white women.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1474515112459989">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The sample was recruited from women enrolled in a longitudinal study examining the predictive validity of the MAPMISS. The MAPMISS was re-administered to 42 women (22 white, 20 black) 3–5 days after baseline assessment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1474515112459989">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Women endorsed an average of 7.5 PS (SD 4.8; range 0–20) initially and 7.6 (SD 4.7; range 0–20) at retest. Over half of the women (54.8%) of both races endorsed the same number of PS at test and retest; for 69%, the number endorsed at both testings differed by no more than one. Percentage agreement and kappa statistics on the number ofPS endorsed were excellent overall and by race. PS test and retest scores, reflecting PS intensity and frequency, were highly correlated overall (<italic>r</italic> = 0.92, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and separately for white (<italic>r</italic> = 0.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and black women (<italic>r</italic> = 0.91,<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Racial differences were insignificant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1474515112459989">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Findings indicate (i) the MAPMISS PS score has excellent test–retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = 0.92) when administered to women without a history of CHD, and (ii) test–retest reliability is as strong for black (<italic>r</italic> = 0.91) as for white women (<italic>r</italic> = 0.93).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2008, an estimated 17.3 million people worldwide died from cardiovascular diseases (CVD), of which 7.3 million were from coronary heart disease (CHD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112459989">1</xref></sup> Globally, CVD is the number one killer in both sexes but CVD causes a larger number of deaths among women over 60 than men of comparable age (7.4 million vs. 6.3 million, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112459989">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the USA, CHD is the leading cause of death among both men and women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112459989">2</xref></sup> However, women’s CHD mortality rates vary by race as black women have higher mortality rates than white women and those from other minority groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112459989">3</xref></sup> One reason for women’s higher mortality rates may be related to women’s CHD presentation. Women may not recognize their symptoms as cardiac in nature and therefore not seek medical care in a timely manner. In fact, CHD in women is often unrecognized and undiagnosed, as reflected in women’s high rates of silent myocardial infarctions (MI). Sixty-four percent of women who experience sudden death attributed to CHD as compared with 50% of men had unrecognized CHD symptoms prior to death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112459989">4</xref></sup> Lack of recognition of the potential cardiac origin of women’s prodromal and acute symptoms can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112459989">5</xref></sup> contributing to women’s higher mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112459989">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many patients and providers consider chest pain to be the main prodromal symptom of CHD and impending MI; however, women are more likely than men to present with minimal or no chest pain, even during an acute MI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112459989">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112459989">7</xref></sup> Milner and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112459989">8</xref></sup> who studied 2073 patients admitted to the hospital for MI, reported that women were less likely than men to have a chief complaint of chest pain (54% vs. 69%, respectively). Patel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112459989">9</xref></sup> found that women more frequently experienced back, jaw and neck pain, nausea and/or vomiting, and dyspnea, while men more frequently presented with chest pain and diaphoresis. Other studies have also reported that women with MI often present to the emergency room complaining of back pain, shortness of breath, or vague symptoms such as fatigue and anxiety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112459989">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112459989"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112459989">12</xref></sup> Despite these findings, clinicians often do not recognize the difference in MI symptom presentation between genders and continue to assess for chest pain as the major MI symptom. In addition, many commonly used screening instruments, e.g. the Rose Angina Questionnaire (RQ), the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) and the recently developed Symptoms of Acute Coronary Syndrome Inventory (SACSI), focus primarily on prodromal chest pain related symptoms and have had very limited psychometric testing with women. The seven-item RQ was originally designed to be used with men and its validity has been tested for men only.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112459989">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112459989"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112459989">15</xref></sup> Although the instrument has been used extensively with both men and women, reliability data have not been published for women. The SAQ, perhaps the most widely used angina questionnaire, captures exertion and its relationship to the frequency and intensity of angina. Initial studies to establish SAQ validity were conducted primarily with male veterans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112459989">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112459989">17</xref></sup> No validity data have been reported for women. The SACSI, designed to capture the most common symptoms associated with chest pain, has been used in two separate studies; however, the validity and reliability of the instrument have not been established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112459989">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112459989">19</xref></sup> Thus, the most widely used instruments to assess for prodromal CHD and MI symptoms have been tested primarily with men and their usefulness in women has not been established. Because CHD is the number one cause of mortality in women, it is critical to have psychometrically sound screening instruments that are relevant and reliable for women in order to foster early recognition of CHD and early treatment to prevent or delay progression to MI or death.</p>
<p>The McSweeney Acute and Prodromal Myocardial Infarction Symptom Survey (MAPMISS) is one of the few instruments that capture women’s distinct presentation of acute and prodromal symptoms of CHD and MI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112459989">20</xref></sup> The MAPMISS was developed based on symptom reports from women of various ages, ethnicities and races, and employs the language women most commonly used to describe their symptom experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112459989">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112459989">22</xref></sup> It has been used with over 3000 racially diverse women in three studies funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research. Initial psychometric testing indicated that the MAPMISS has high content validity and acceptable test–retest reliability for women with known CHD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112459989">22</xref></sup> However, although the MAPMISS was developed for use with an ethnically diverse population, the initial psychometric study sample consisted primarily of white women and, to date, no further psychometric studies have been completed.</p>
<p>Test–retest reliability is of particular interest because the MAPMISS relies on women’s recall of their symptoms. It is especially important to assess the psychometric properties of the MAPMISS when administered to black women because they are at higher risk and have worse CHD outcomes than white women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112459989">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112459989">23</xref></sup> This article reports the test–retest reliability of the prodromal symptom (PS) section of the MAPMISS for black and white women without a diagnosis of CHD participating in an ongoing study of the instrument’s predictive ability. Because the sample was composed only of women who did not have a diagnosis of CHD or MI when their baseline assessment was made, evaluation of test–retest reliability was feasible for the PS section of the MAPMISS but not the acute symptom section.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-1474515112459989">
<title>Instrument</title>
<p>Development of the MAPMISS has been described in detail elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112459989">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112459989">24</xref></sup> Briefly, qualitative interviews were conducted with over 60 racially diverse women who had experienced a MI. During these interviews, women identified a variety of symptoms, which formed the basis of the MAPMISS. They described two categories of symptoms: those that were unrelenting during an acute episode of MI and did not resolve prior to treatment (acute symptoms) and those that developed and occurred intermittently before the MI (‘early warning’ or prodromal symptoms).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112459989">24</xref></sup> A series of studies were then completed to develop, pilot and refine the symptoms and questions. The resulting MAPMISS is composed of three sections: an acute symptom section, a PS section, and a section to elicit information on sociodemographics, comorbidities and risk factors. The MAPMISS PS section currently includes 30 PS. This section is of particular interest because it could be used to screen for early warning symptoms during a healthcare encounter, and thus potentially facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>When administering the MAPMISS, women indicate at each assessment whether they experienced each of the symptoms in the preceding 3 months (endorsed = 1, not endorsed = 0). They then rate the intensity (mild, medium, severe) and frequency (&lt; monthly to daily, 0.167 to 7;7 = daily) of each reported symptom. A PS score, based on the product of the intensity and frequency of a symptom, is then calculated (range 0–21). Finally, an overall PS scoreis calculated by summing the individual symptom scores (range 0–630).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1474515112459989">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The test–retest reliability assessment sample was recruited from among women taking part in a larger, multi-site longitudinal study of the predictive validity of the MAPMISS who did not have a current diagnosis of CHD. Institutional review board approval was obtained from all participating sites. Participants in the larger study were women who had been referred to a cardiologist for initial evaluation of symptoms suggestive of CHD but did not have a current CHD diagnosis. Women were referred for a variety of reasons including evaluation of symptoms suggestive of CHD, cardiovascular clearance prior to surgery, screening to establish a relationship with a cardiologist, etc. Eligibility criteria were (i) self-identification as black/African American or Caucasian, (ii) age 21 years or older, (iii) no previous diagnosis of heart disease, and (iv) access to a telephone. Recruitment sites were private practices and university-affiliated clinics in two southern US states, because women in the south are at greater risk of CHD than women in other regions of the USA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112459989">25</xref></sup> Recruitment from regional referral centers maximized the likelihood of being able to recruit black and white women from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds and from both rural and urban areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1474515112459989">
<title>Recruitment and data collection procedures</title>
<p>Women identified as potential participants for the parent study were contacted by a research assistant (RA) who explained the study, obtained verbal consent and HIPPA authorization, verified eligibility, and administered the Blessed Orientation Memory Concentration screen to ensure that potential participants were cognitively intact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112459989">23</xref></sup> Initially, every woman who completed the baseline interview was asked whether she was willing to be contacted for a retest within 3–5 days, an interval selected to maximize the likelihood of temporal stability in symptoms. Except in the case of women whose symptoms emerge for the first time or significantly change during the few days between test and retest, a woman’s 3-month experience would be expected to be much the same over 3–5 days.</p>
<p>For both the parent sample and the test–retest subsample, a trained RA administered the MAPMISS by telephone, using computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) technology. CATI programming prevents the interviewer from progressing to the next question until all fields have been completed, thus minimizing missing data. Baseline interviews, covering PS during the previous 3 months, comorbidities and risk factors, took approximately 60 minutes to complete. Retest interviews, covering only the PS questions, took approximately 20 minutes to complete. The average interval between test and retest administration was 3.10 days (SD 0.73, median 3.0, range 2–7 days). Participants received $40 for the baseline interview and $10 for the retest interview.</p>
<p>The final sample size for the test–retest was based on an <italic>a priori</italic> power calculation and interim analyses. The <italic>a priori</italic> power calculation, which assumed 80% power and a two-sided alpha of 5%, indicated that a sample of 70 women would be sufficient to detect a minimum kappa of 0.30 and a minimum concordance correlation coefficient of 0.30 when data from all women were analyzed together. Having 35 women in each race group would allow for detection of a minimum kappa of 0.42 and a minimum concordance correlation coefficient of 0.40. An interim analysis of data from the first 42 test–retest participants showed that observed kappas and concordance correlation coefficients substantially exceeded the values used in the power calculations. In that context, no further retest data were collected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1474515112459989">
<title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>At the completion of each assessment, which symptoms and the total number of symptoms (range 0–30) endorsed by each participant were tallied. Participants rated the intensity (1–3; mild, medium, severe) and frequency(&lt; monthly to daily, 0.167 to 7; 7 = daily) of reported PS. Next we calculated a PS score, the product of symptom intensity and frequency (range 0–21), for each symptom. Finally, we calculated an overall PS score by summing the individual PS scores (range 0–630).</p>
<p>We examined test–retest reliability separately for each of the following: (i) number of symptoms endorsed, (ii) overall PS scores, and (iii) symptom-specific measures (individual symptom endorsement [yes/no] and PS score. We evaluated test–retest reliability using four statistics: percent agreement, kappa statistics, Pearson correlation coefficients (<italic>r</italic>) and Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (CCC).</p>
<p>Percent agreement and kappa statistics were computed to assess the agreement between the number of symptoms endorsed at the baseline and retest administrations of the MAPMISS. Kappa, a measure of agreement on categorical outcomes, is considered a more robust indicator of agreement than simple percent agreement because it takes into account agreement that would be expected to occur simply by chance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474515112459989">26</xref></sup> Corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for kappa were computed using a bootstrap-based bias-corrected CI approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1474515112459989">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474515112459989">28</xref></sup> <italic>r</italic> and Lin’s CCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1474515112459989">29</xref></sup> were calculated to assess agreement and concordance between baseline and retest of variables measured in interval and continuous scale, paralleling the analyses that used percent agreement and kappa, respectively. Both agreement and concordance were examined for all women combined and for white women and black women separately.</p>
<p>Data management and analysis were performed using Stata® version 11.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1474515112459989">30</xref></sup> Kappa statistics and CIs were computed using the Stata program KAPCI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1474515112459989">31</xref></sup></p>

<p>The characteristics of the 42 women in the study are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112459989">Table 1</xref>. Participants averaged 52 years in age; the majority (54.8%) were over 50 years of age, and over half (52.4%) were married. The sample was fairly evenly divided between white women (53%) and black women (47%). The majority (57.1%) reported that they did not routinely participate in physical activity, and slightly over 30% were obese (BMI &gt; 30). Educational levels ranged from less than high school to postgraduate work; 45% of the women had a high school education or less. There were no significant differences between black and white women on any of these characteristics except for education. Black participants reported a broader range of educational achievement than did white participants.</p>

<title>Number of symptoms endorsed</title>
<p>The MAPMISS includes 30 PS. Those women referred for cardiovascular evaluation endorsed an average of 7.5 PS (SD 4.8; median 7; range 0–20) during the baseline interview and an average of 7.6 PS (SD 4.7; median 7; range 0–20) at retest. Only two women (4.8%) endorsed none of the MAPMISS symptoms at baseline. On average, black women endorsed fewer symptoms than white women at both baseline (test) and retest (means: 7.00 vs. 7.86 at test and 6.90 vs. 8.32 at retest). As can be seen from the percent agreement and kappa statistics in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1474515112459989">Table 2</xref>, test–retest reliability for the number of symptoms endorsed was excellent, overall and by race. The majority of the women (23/42, 54.8%) endorsed the same number of symptoms at test and at retest; for 69% (29/42), the number of symptoms endorsed at test and retest differed by no more than one. This was the pattern for both black women (45.0% [9/20]) and 70.0% [14/20]) and white women (63.6% [14/22]) and 68.2% [15/22]). Differences by race were not statistically significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Because the MAPMISS score is based on women’s self-reports of the number, intensity and frequency of symptoms experienced, the stability of those reports over time is critically important. Our earlier research showed that the PS score had good test–retest reliability with a sample of primarily white women who had experienced an acute MI in the previous 12 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112459989">22</xref></sup> The current study adds to this psychometric evidence in several important ways. First, it provides evidence that the MAPMISS PS score has excellent test–retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = 0.92)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1474515112459989">32</xref></sup> when administered to women without a history of CHD who have been referred for cardiovascular evaluation. This is especially important because it supports the usefulness of the MAPMISS PS in screening women at risk of adverse cardiac events. Second, the current study provides evidence that test–retest reliability is as strong for black women (<italic>r</italic> = 0.91) as for white women (<italic>r</italic> = 0.93), supporting the use of the MAPMISS PS scale with this highly vulnerable population.</p>
<p>Test–retest reliability was higher in this study than in the previous study of MAPMISS test–retest reliability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112459989">22</xref></sup> In that study, <italic>r</italic> was 0.72 for the PS score, nearly 20 points lower than the correlation coefficient for either black women or white women in the current study. Two major differences between the two study samples are likely to have contributed to this difference. Participants in the earlier study had all experienced an acute MI in the previous 12 months and were reporting on PS for that event, while participants in the current study had not experienced an MI and were reporting on symptoms that had led to their referral for cardiovascular assessment. In addition, the interval between initial and retest administration of the MAPMISS was longer in the earlier study (7–14 days) than in the current study (3–5 days).</p>
<p>The black women in this sample reported fewer PS than white women. Previous studies have reported the opposite. For instance, McSweeney et al. found in 2010 that black women reported significantly more PS than did white women (7.48 vs. 5.84, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112459989">6</xref></sup> However, all women in that study had experienced an MI. In the current sample, none of the women had been diagnosed with CHD at the time of the test or retest. It may be that fewer black women in this sample will be diagnosed with CHD than white women, but this can only be determined at the conclusion of the 2-year follow-up in the parent study.</p>
<p>Healthcare providers frequently must resort to expensive and often invasive diagnostic tools such as echocardiograms, stress tests, angiography and CT scans to assess CHD risk. Chest pain is the symptom that often triggers use of these tests and it may be essential for authorization of the tests by third-party payers. That reduces the likelihood that such tests will be ordered for women who have a non-chest pain presentation. The MAPMISS has great potential as a screening instrument that is easy to administer, can be used in any clinical setting, and reliably captures the severity and frequency of symptoms in women at risk for developing progressive CHD or MI. It assesses for a variety of non-chest pain symptoms reported by women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112459989">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112459989">24</xref></sup> and does not require authorization from third-party payers.</p>
<sec id="section17-1474515112459989">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This test–retest study had several limitations. The short period (mean of 3.1 days) between test and retest administrations may be considered a limitation or a strength. By definition, PS may change from day to day, raising questions about the appropriateness of assessing test–retest reliability. However, the MAPMISS PS section asks about women’s experience of various symptoms over the preceding 3 months. Except in the case of women whose symptoms emerge for the first time or significantly change during the few days between test and retest, a woman’s 3-month experience would be expected to be much the same over 3–5 days (i.e. to be temporally stable), making test–retest analysis appropriate. A short interval between test and retest increases the risk of recall bias. However, while conducting the retest 2–3 weeks after the baseline assessment would minimize this likelihood, it would also increase the likelihood of actual changes in symptom status. Recall bias is a concern, but less so with symptom reports than with reports of attitudes or conditions that are either clearly desirable or undesirable. When examining the pros and cons of longer and shorter test–retest intervals, the advantages of a shorter interval were felt to outweigh their disadvantages. Additionally, it is possible that women without CHD may perceive greater variability in symptoms over time than women who will eventually be diagnosed with CHD but a short interval lessens the likelihood of this occurring.</p>
<p>This report addresses a critical psychometric characteristic of the MAPMISS: test–retest reliability. Strong test–retest reliability, reflecting the instrument’s precision, is an essential prerequisite to utility. However, the ultimate utility of the MAPMISS will depend not only on its reliability but on its validity, in this case, on the extent to which it accurately predicts the development of CHD events. The parent study addresses 2-year predictive validity; upon its completion, predictive validity findings will be disseminated to supplement current findings.</p>
<p>Despite the study’s limitations, the findings make an important contribution to an understanding of the psychometric properties of the MAPMISS PS scores and thus to the instrument’s overall utility. The data on test–retest reliability in black women are especially important because black women have higher mortality rates from CHD than both white women and men.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1474515112459989">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>The current study indicates that the MAPMISS has solid test–retest reliability for black women as well as white women. Findings suggest that the MAPMISS will prove useful in assessing women’s PS. Additional studies will be needed to address the psychometric properties of the acute section of the MAPMISS and to establish the predictive validity of the MAPMISS PS score. Identifying those women that are at high risk for developing CHD in order to provide timely treatment and thus improve healthcare outcomes for women is essential worldwide.</p>
