<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the last decade, gender mainstreaming assumed a prominent place among international organizations and government initiatives as a central policy strategy to promote the broad goals of gender equity. Although the definitions vary, gender mainstreaming includes a focus on gender equity evident not only in project outcomes, but also through all the phases and aspects of an initiative and the organizations carrying it out, as further discussed later. Its endorsement in the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020872811418994">Rai, 2003</xref>: 2) popularized a series of administrative measures supporting feminist practices and women’s empowerment. The strategy became the major tool to make gender issues visible, address inequities and eliminate bias. Social workers and others committed to an agenda of social justice, equity and empowerment of groups traditionally marginalized embraced this strategy since gender, despite its various manifestations, continues to be a contemporary site of power relations.</p>
<p>Excited by the promises and possibilities of gender mainstreaming but challenged by its implementation, social workers, community organizers and international practitioners have been documenting and discussing the conditions and circumstances that shape its various practices and outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020872811418994">Woodward (2008)</xref> proposed that discussion of this strategy for change is urgent, since its principles, proposals and tools are expanding to other equality areas. Mainstreaming, in various formats, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020872811418994">Squires (2005)</xref> argues, has become one of the central tools for achieving equality (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872811418994">Hankivsky, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020872811418994">Woodward, 2008</xref>) and the debate seems to focus on moving beyond the institutionalized vision of gender mainstreaming to address the critiques currently articulated, and build on the possibilities of change it may offer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020872811418994">Moser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872811418994">Perrons, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020872811418994">Ravindran and Kelkar-Khamhete, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In the spirit of contributing to the debate on the use of mainstreaming as a tool for change, we discuss in this article the use of this tool in an international project aiming to enhance processes of participation in Brazil. The project <italic>Building Capacity in Food Security in Brazil</italic> (BCFSB) was funded by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) between 2004 and 2010 and involved partnerships between the Centre for Studies in Food Security, Ryerson University, Canada, and several Brazilian actors: faculty members, staff and research assistants at the Reference Centre for Food and Nutrition Security (Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro, the Fluminense Federal University and the Brazilian Institute of Social and Economic Analyses); the State University of Ceará; the State University of Bahia; and the Educational Foundation of the Jequitinhonha Valley; as well as non-governmental organization (NGO) personnel in Vida Brasil (Fortaleza) in the Support Services for Rural Popular Organizations (Juazeiro) and in the Fenix Institute (Araçuaí). This international cooperation project operated at the level of developing the interest and capacity of local groups to participate in the food security initiatives already put in place by the Brazilian government. Food Security, a concept that broadened the understanding of hunger internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872811418994">Campbell, 1991</xref>), has been enshrined in the National Law on Food and Nutrition Security, passed by the Brazilian congress in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811418994">Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO], 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020872811418994">Santos, 2000</xref>). Article 3 defines food and nutrition security as consisting:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>… in realizing the right of all to regular and permanent access to food in sufficient quantity and quality, without compromising access to other essential needs, on the basis of food habits which promote health and respect cultural diversity, and which are environmentally, culturally, economically, and socially sustainable. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872811418994">Brazil, 2005a</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From its inception, the project was attentive to gender inequities in issues of food security and in particular in the emerging food security decision-making mechanisms in Brazil. Food, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872811418994">Allen and Sachs (2007)</xref> propose, has a strong connection with women, who form a large proportion of agricultural workers and the mainstay of domestic food work. In the day-to-day activities of many cultures, a large number of women are responsible for planting and harvesting gardens; procuring, preparing and serving meals for the family; and disposing of the residues and waste (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872811418994">De Vault, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020872811418994">Phillips, 2009</xref>). In addition, women constitute the majority of the professionals working with food security: nutritionists, social workers and community workers. Women, due to the gender division of labour, are also particularly involved in the cultural aspects of transferring food habits to different generations in the family or to outsiders. Despite these close associations, women may be particularly vulnerable in terms of food security and nutrition, as expressed in the prevalence of poverty among families headed by women, the financial and occupational restrictions women typically experience in the labour market and, as well, their lack of power in public and other decision-making systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872811418994">Engle, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872811418994">FAO, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020872811418994">Van Esterik, 1999</xref>). Food security is consequently gendered and, arguably, can only be achieved if gender is taken into consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872811418994">Avakian and Harber, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>While the project worked with groups involved in the transformation of food relations in Brazil, this article is focused on the discussion of the potential for a gender mainstreaming strategy to support this transformation. First, we summarize the debates around gender mainstreaming, its definitions, critiques and promises. Following this, we describe the project and its gender mainstreaming strategy. We then use reports of the project local coordinators to examine the gender strategy implementation and to provide evidence of the mainstreaming outcomes. We conclude with a discussion of how we perceive the possibilities and challenges of gender mainstreaming as a strategy for change.</p>

<title>Gender mainstreaming: State of knowledge</title>
<p>Gender mainstreaming was conceptualized by feminist advocates and, reflecting the diversity among them, its definitions vary widely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020872811418994">Walby, 2005</xref>: 327). Core among them, however, is the understanding of gender as a socially constructed polarization between men and women that is reproduced through power relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872811418994">Council of Europe, 1998</xref>: 8). Pointing out the interconnection of gender and other structuring inequalities, such as race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, disabilities, faith and so forth, gender mainstreaming calls for a contextualized understanding of gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872811418994">Hankivsky, 2007</xref>). A second commonality among the definitions is an explicit commitment to change gender inequalities through making them visible and actively working towards their elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872811418994">Rees, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020872811418994">Shaw, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020872811418994">Squires, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As a mechanism for change it offers policy makers and practitioners a concrete way to link theoretical understandings of gender relations to action, and various tools and guidelines to help accomplish the gender equity aims which have been produced (among them see the websites of the United Nations Development Program [UNDP], the International Labour Organization [ILO], the CIDA, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency [SIDA] and Oxfam). This promising link pushed gender mainstreaming to the centre of policy discourses and development practices and institutionalized the strategies in international bodies, NGOs, universities and women’s offices of national governments.</p>
<p>Despite its widespread acceptance and the prolific production of practical guides and tools, only recently has attention focused on a systematic examination of the effects of gender mainstreaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872811418994">Benschop and Verloo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020872811418994">Woodward, 2008</xref>). Some critics have discussed challenges associated with implementation and organizational dynamics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020872811418994">Mukhopadhyay (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020872811418994">Stratigaki (2005)</xref>, for example, argued that by being reduced to a technical project specified in the tools and guidelines, mainstreaming was disconnected from the radical roots of the concept of gender (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872811418994">Hearn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020872811418994">Standing, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020872811418994">Woodford-Berger, 2004</xref>). A different stream of critiques focuses on the tensions of integrating gender mainstreaming in a traditionally gendered economy and polity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872811418994">Benschop and Verloo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872811418994">Perrons, 2005</xref>), resulting in a restricted vision of equity. A further group of critics proposes that gender mainstreaming has in its application transformed the feminist project by addressing women as one unified group of people with very little attention to, or even understanding of, intersectionalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872811418994">Cornwall et al., 2007</xref>). Among them, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872811418994">Hankivsky (2007)</xref> argues that only a mainstreaming of diversity can do justice to what the concept aims to encompass. Finally, an unwavering critique suggests that the emphasis on equity obscures the need to strive for broader structural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020872811418994">Rees, 1998</xref>). In other words, gender equity is only one aspect of the broader social changes that are required and should not consume all resources and energies of an initiative.</p>
<p>These are substantial quarrels which, no doubt, question the strategy. There is, however, a widespread reluctance to abandon gender mainstreaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020872811418994">Walby, 2005</xref>). Its promise to bridge the theoretical analysis of gender inequality with the practice of transformation is enticing. As discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020872811418994">Woodward (2008</xref>: 289), among the reasons for its broad acceptance is the importance of gender mainstreaming as a policy strategy for social change. Acknowledging the challenges, she praises its innovative and transformative possibilities and underlines the need for some action rather than remaining at the immobilizing critique stage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872811418994">Kirton and Greene (2004)</xref> suggest a strategic focus on the short-term goal of equity while simultaneously pursuing equality and transformation as long-term goals. This, they suggest, would avoid settling for an equality of low standards and pursuing a long-term agenda with transformative potential. The importance of opening possibilities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872811418994">Benschop and Verloo (2006</xref>: 22) propose, involves a rather incongruous process of finding ‘a way to deal with existing gender bias in order to change the gendered systems, structures and cultures’.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020872811418994">Walby (2005)</xref> suggests that the continued relevance of gender mainstream hinges on clear understandings of the complexities and diversity of gender interests and the processes of power that sustain them. To constantly advance transformative objectives, she calls for the inclusion among gender mainstreaming strategies of processes that can strategically challenge power structures as manifested locally. Among these processes, gender budgeting, monitoring of gender efforts, inclusive democracy and active participation tools have challenged established policy paradigms and their outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020872811418994">Squires, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020872811418994">Verloo, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>The project context and methodological considerations</title>
<p>With over 40 million people affected by food and nutrition insecurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872811418994">Instituto de Pesquisa Economica e Aplicada [IPEA], 2007</xref>), Brazil introduced in 2003 the Hunger Zero federal program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872811418994">Brazil, 2003</xref>), which considerably reduced poverty and malnutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872811418994">FAO, 2006</xref>). Central to its innovations were various channels for public participation that contributed to the emergence of important advocacy networks and decision-making councils for food security at the municipal, state and federal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872811418994">Burlandy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872811418994">Burlandy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020872811418994">Rocha, 2009</xref>). In response to local demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020872811418994">Rocha, 2004</xref>), the BCFSB project focused on developing local skills and proficiency to join these participatory mechanisms, and to develop capacity at the local level to implement activities and programs geared to increased food security (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ryerson.ca/fsbra/">http://www.ryerson.ca/fsbra/</ext-link>). Three Brazilian cities of different sizes were selected as strategic nodes in the <italic>Semiarid</italic>, a dry land characterized by droughts and occasional rain showers covering an area of approximately 900,000 square kilometers. Its large population of 36 million people is predominantly poor, with particularly acute food insecurity issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872811418994">Brazil, 2005b</xref>). Araçuaí, in the state of Minas Gerais, with a population of 38,000 people, is a small town that is the centre for a rural economy characterized by subsistence farms in the Jequitinhonha valley. Juazeiro (population 400,000), a medium-size city, is the centre of an emerging agro-industrial complex in the São Francisco Valley, state of Bahia, developed through irrigation projects. This region’s economy is also characterized by a large number of small, family farms. Finally, Fortaleza is the capital city in the state of Ceará. With a population 3.7 million people, it has a diverse yet polarized economy and is the magnet of regional rural migrants that settle in the poverty-stricken shanty towns surrounding the capital. These cities were chosen because their <italic>Semiarid</italic> location makes them a priority for development intervention in Brazil: despite pockets of prosperity, the area as a whole continues to show the highest levels of poverty and food insecurity in Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872811418994">Brazil, 2005b</xref>). In addition, they brought to the project distinct socio-economic situations, different levels of professional resources and diverse food security focuses and programs.</p>
<p>A gender mainstreaming strategy was firmly supported and encouraged by the funding source. The CIDA, as well as other Canadian federal government departments and agencies, has pursued an agenda of gender mainstreaming in its internal organization and activities, as well as in the projects it funds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020872811418994">Ranking and Wilcox, 2004</xref>). This institutional commitment to gender equity and the importance of gender for the realization of food security helped to give the strategy a prominent position in the project and facilitated its implementation.</p>
<p>BCFSB was administered by Ryerson University, where it was subject to the standard Canadian ethics procedures. The two authors were its director and its gender overseer. As designers of the mainstreaming strategy, we feel particularly committed to a discussion of its potential. During the project implementation, our discussions brought to fore various debates around implementation issues, and at the same time, called attention to the limitations of a strictly pragmatic approach. The analyses presented here use two sets of project documents. Firstly, we draw on documents we wrote pertaining to the design of the strategy and the discussions with the project team. These documents describe each component of the strategy and the practices put in place to address the critiques of gender mainstreaming. The second set of documents is the written reports submitted by the local gender coordinators at the end of the project. Their reports were part of their employment duties and they were asked to comment on and provide evidence of changes in gender and food security issues in their locality. The gender coordinators also reported on issues of relevance to their activities, including the challenges and successes of various practices utilized to implement the gender strategy, and concrete effects of the strategy on access to nutritious, sustainable and equitable food for participants and organizations with which the project came into contact. Our analysis, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872811418994">Mason’s (2001)</xref>, grouped common themes for these two sets of documents, and commented on them in light of the literature on gender mainstreaming.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0020872811418994">
<title>Gender mainstream strategy: Design and implementation</title>
<p>The project’s gender strategy unfolded from six central components. First, it established a firm commitment to <italic>capture the complexity and diversity embedded in the concept of gender</italic>. This commitment speaks to the critiques about disregarding the differences encompassed by the word ‘women’. To ensure that complexity and intersectionality were captured and grounded in local realities, BCFSB partners and participants sustained systematic discussions about specific manifestations of the gender relations and women’s role in food security in each locality. These initial discussions called attention to the differences between rural and urban locations, the lack of available data to document perceived differences, the hierarchy of women’s occupations and local manifestations of power relations. For example, in Araçuaí, an area marked by the out-migration of able men at working age, more women report a higher level of education than the local average, hold more stable employment than men and occupy positions of respect. Often the teachers at primary school, nurses at the health unit and employees at the municipal office are women. Most of the men who do not migrate are hard to employ in the weak regional economy. In addition to a focus on locality, complexity was also incorporated through the diversity among participants, specifically documenting racialized groups’ food security issues. Project documents, training sessions of local community agents, implementation and accountability tools incorporated both the locality of the manifestations of gender relations and the intersectionality of age, race, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender and poverty. For example, in Araçuaí, indigenous groups were the focus of specially designed participatory activities and projects, and in Fortaleza programs focused on dwellers of shanty towns.</p>
<p>A second component of the gender strategy made <italic>gender relations visible and central</italic> in every aspect of the project. Here we made gender a priority by allocating resources and time to its manifestations in food security. Inclusive language was consistently observed in written and oral communications and discussions, and training and education of partners focused on several aspects of gender roles. In addition, equitable participation in project activities (courses, workshops and so forth) was steadily observed and documented, aiming at numerical equity between self-identified men and women and striving for a diversity of identities. This preoccupation, while technical and administrative, attempted to make visible the assumed gender biases embedded in social relations.</p>
<p>The third component focused on ingraining democratizing processes, establishing a <italic>decentralized and integrated structure</italic> that adopted participatory and inclusive practices. Approaching gender relations as inserted in local contexts, the project did not centrally design gender activities. Instead, each location had a local gender coordinator who received special training on gender issues and feminist methods and processes. They designed activities locally, making gender a priority and visible in the issues relevant to each city. Team meetings ran on a consensual decision-making model. Local gender coordinators met as a group periodically with the project gender coordinator, to discuss local issues, assess tools, document gender outcomes and exchange knowledge and information about their activities and team processes of participation. These created an atmosphere of cooperation, while developing and supporting the network capacity and confidence of local gender coordinators to encourage and support inclusive and equitable activities.</p>
<p>A fourth component called for <italic>making strategic use of gender issues and encouraging action</italic>. This involved using all opportunities to discuss gender issues in their diversity, developing public educational activities, supporting gender sensitive leadership at different levels and developing networks with other organizations with similar gender interests. The concentration on concrete issues of gender in the strategy ensured a consistent focus on the possibility of action for food security. This strategic use of gender required consistent data collection and documentation of activities in order to develop arguments and enhance the capacity to act.</p>
<p>The fifth component referred to the <italic>project’s networking and partnership development</italic>. It encouraged an approach of inclusion and relied on discussion and sharing among similar organizations and initiatives. Aware of issues of power in participatory community meetings, many facilitation techniques were proposed and shared by the local teams. Organization capacity building was developed through rotating annual meetings among the project locations where directions, concerns, setbacks, accomplishments and possibilities were discussed. The meetings also included a comprehensive study of the food security initiatives of each area and articulation with various organizations. Networking, exchanges and consultations among the different groups occurred for each activity and event of the project.</p>
<p>Finally, the sixth component directed <italic>the focus of the gender mainstreaming strategy to equity</italic>. As the critiques above propose, this focus can restrict the aims of the strategy to gender parity under circumstances of widespread poverty. However, equity in the project invited a focus on women’s poverty and autonomy. This conscious option was also expressed in the challenge gender equity posed to household and food preparation labour, as well as public participation in the project locations. Our intent was to ingrain the strategy completely in the project’s aims of food security, which would expand the restricted focus on equity to one of transformation of local systems of production, distribution and access to adequate nutritious and quality food.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0020872811418994">
<title>Change in the reports of local gender coordinators</title>
<p>Directly associated with the gender strategy, the training of community agents and project participants generated knowledge and interest in further understanding issues about gender and food security. The project was successful in linking gender and food security beyond a simple abstract statement, documenting and developing action around various concrete aspects of this conjunction in the <italic>Semiarid</italic>. For example, in Juazeiro women employed in food preparation in the schools have only one meal a day, taken at night after they finish their domestic duties. What is particularly ironic in their situation is that they spend the day working with food: early in the morning they prepare food for the family’s daily consumption, then, without eating, they leave for work, and late afternoon they come home to work on production of food in the family garden. In Araçuaí, water was a defining factor around food security, not only because its unavailability made food production impossible in the small plots, but also because procuring water took a lot of women’s time and energy. In Fortaleza, most of the poor families are led by women and their dependence on the government conditional income support program, <italic>Bolsa Familia (Family Grant)</italic>, shapes issues of food security for these families. The dynamics of food security and gender in each area were documented and generated knowledge and concrete project actions. The clear effects of gender and the domestic division of labour were centrally incorporated in the training and activities and the developed awareness of many women who participated in the project, as well as several professional and administrative personnel and authorities, became particularly relevant. It gave them vocabulary and language to articulate claims and develop solidarity through common struggles around food, and encouraged common activities and networks. The focus on food, women and equity encouraged discussion, alliances and articulation of demands and claims.</p>
<p>The practices utilized in the implementation of the gender strategy generated mixed results. Local gender coordinators commented on various aspects and mechanisms, which helped to position gender at the centre of the activities. Among them the understanding of gender issues as integrated in every component and a responsibility of the whole team helped to ingrain democratizing practices. The local gender coordinator in Fortaleza, for example, argues that her participation in all meetings and activities, sharing information and proposing gender actions, was essential for the visibility of gender in the project activities. In the three cities, the local team received training on gender, food security and issues of inclusion to ensure that a gender approach was integrated in every project activity. Particularly important was the use of examples incorporating day-to-day activities of people intertwined with statistics and analysis to provide examples of gender inequity in food and food systems and to provoke a discussion about the possible actions for change. In Juazeiro, public events, radio interviews, workshops and campaigns had gender focuses. A local gender coordinator explained how, at the lunch break of the workshops, both men and women were required to do the washing up and cleaning of the room. Many men had never washed dishes in their lives and the facilitators used this to introduce a discussion around division of domestic work in the home. Another coordinator commented on how the attention to detail, brought on by inclusive language or having women in roles usually undertaken by men, can destabilize sexism.</p>
<p>It is important to notice, however, that while dissemination of information and awareness is important and necessary, a substantial move into action and change requires continued activities and concerted efforts. While the project aimed at sustainability through education and training, continued effects rely on the commitment of organizations and individuals. The gender coordinators, in addition, pointed out the many social barriers to advancing a gender agenda and how this work involves a difficult negotiation with powerful institutions and traditions. For example, in Juazeiro, many men do not want the women participating in public activities, assuming themselves the roles of speakers for the family. In Fortaleza, activities with women are directly associated with demands for better work conditions and quickly opposed by local employers. These examples refer to the difficulties of integrating gender mainstreaming in a gendered economy and society mentioned in the literature. Difficulties that minimize the results, wear out those at the forefront of the activities and call into question the fragility of an agenda for change that depends on the insertion of gender issues into the mainstream.</p>
<p>To offset these effects, a project team presence was important in offering support and encouragement, and celebrating small victories. A team that understands the difficulties of the work helps to maintain the momentum, learns with the challenges and prevents burn-out. In the project, this protective environment was stronger in some cities than others, illustrating the challenges faced by mainstreaming. For example, in Araçuaí, changes in the elected representatives at the municipal level undermined project activities in the last year and wore out the local team’s energy, while in Fortaleza the project activities were supported and encouraged by municipal leaders offering the opportunity for expanded activities.</p>
<p>There is evidence that the implementation of a gender strategy helped transform food and nutrition structures in the project localities. The focus on equity associated with the long-term goals of food security managed to support, in aspects of the project, the emergence of collective structures and organizations with potential to challenge established interests. For example, in Juazeiro, the priority to empower women to initiate community development activities found an echo in the work of other organizations and the project resources and activities generated some transformations. Women who worked in the seed-processing cooperative provoked organizational change when they managed to establish new membership rules: it was assigned to the person who does the work (mostly women) rather than to the household (often represented by men). In doing so, the women opened the possibility of gaining further control over work conditions and the product of their labour, rather than allowing their husbands, fathers or sons to make the decisions. Also in Juazeiro, women took control of the fish-processing plant cooperative, which had been subsumed under the direction of the fishermen’s association. These examples point out that the possibility of occupying spaces with transformative ideas and actions is real, but it requires networking among several agencies and resources to allow for the intensive work of empowerment.</p>
<p>Many other effects of the project remained focused on parity with men in the domestic sphere and in the reduced job market. These, despite the limitations, bring with them a hope of broader social changes. Here we can cite, firstly, the number of women who received gender and food security training and who assumed positions of decision making in municipal departments and organizations; and, secondly, the participants who, after attending project courses and workshops became a voice in the growing councils for food security at the state and municipal levels. The project public workshops in each location involved community members, administrators and politicians discussing gender and food security and proposing demonstration projects to model processes of change. The unhurried pace of the activities allowed for the incorporation and negotiation of participants’ pressures and demands, demonstrating the inclusiveness of methods keeping the goals alive.</p>
<p>Other effects of the project influenced some of the gender imbalances of society by, as an example in Fortaleza illustrates, providing marginalized migrant single mothers with training as food and nutrition peer educators, helping to integrate them into part-time stable employment and encouraging further education. In Araçuaí, the local team used food security as a focus for articulating gender demands and developing coalitions with the educational system. These activities further developed and ingrained gender issues, occupying mainstream spaces, disseminating ideas and making connections. Empowering women using individual coaching, rotating responsibilities, giving attention to the location and time of meetings and implementing food projects with a gender approach, in addition to improving access to basic services and resources, generated individual changes and opened possibilities for collective changes.</p>
<p>Despite the uneven and complex effects of the strategy’s many accomplishments and shortcomings, it has contributed to focusing demands and has advanced several aspects of the food security struggles in the project locations. It also introduced and demonstrated the operation of participatory and inclusive practices, and carried out widespread education and training around issues of gender and food security in the three locations. However, the interacting conditions and contexts make gender mainstreaming only one of the components of the changes that occurred. Networking with similar-minded organizations, finding support among local authorities and developing team-supporting strategies are some of the important aspects that helped to produce positive effects.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Possibilities and challenges of gender mainstreaming</title>
<p>We conclude with cautious support for gender mainstreaming as a strategy that may be used to advance the gender agenda. In BCFSB, discussions regarding gender differences, power relations as they affect food security were definitely put on the agenda of the participant organizations and their partners. In some locations these discussions integrated public spaces and came to affect broader governance structures of participation and organization functioning. Important for progressive social work, the project introduced and demonstrated the workability of participatory processes and the importance of team and network building through workshops, courses and training seminars. Significantly, it contributed to greater equality in many individuals’ lives.</p>
<p>Following the well-articulated critiques of gender mainstreaming discussed above, we continue to ask whether it can actually advance a gender agenda that does not assume equality under conditions of disadvantage for both men and women. Distinctions between long- and short-term agendas suggest that equal treatment measures can be followed by transformative policies addressing organizational structures, and challenging their cultures and norms. While possible actions today may be limited to what can be described as a short-term agenda, the strategy’s language, theoretical foundations and aims point and push towards social transformations, continued work and restlessness with the current accomplishments, while recognizing that gains have been made.</p>
<p>The project encountered particularly favorable conditions, since the funders, project coordinators and participants were committed to gender issues and assigned priority to gender mainstreaming. In that sense, different partners’ approaches and organizational obligations were not in conflict with the strategy, and did not impose compromises that affected the project outcomes. Personal and organizational commitment allowed for more nuanced training, integration of participation and inclusion skills and everyday local practices informing the educational components. While using inclusive language and enforcing equitable participation reflect technical aspects of the strategy, these called attention to issues and the need for change, which must be followed by proposals and actions. These practices can motivate, engage and, perhaps, lead to action depending on other circumstances, commitments and supports.</p>
