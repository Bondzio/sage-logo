<abstract>
<p>This article examines social work with separated young asylum seekers following armed conflict, and focuses on ethical issues arising from contradictions between core social work values and immigration control. It considers problems facing these young people and policy responses internationally, in Europe and the UK. The tension between child welfare and immigration control permeates these responses, with the latter usually trumping the former. Age assessment is a particularly contentious issue involving UK social workers. Drawing on findings from a study of age assessment practice, the study concludes with the centrality of maintaining social work values and links with wider campaigning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article examines social work with young people in the aftermath of forced migration following armed conflict, and focuses on specific ethical issues that affect social work when it becomes enmeshed in the tensions between core social work values and immigration control. The article firstly reviews the broader situation of young people, who are separated from their families and carers, when they arrive in a country of asylum. It describes key problems they face and the policy context affecting them internationally, in Europe and in the UK. A major determinant of their treatment is the central tension between child welfare and immigration control.</p>
<p>The article then focuses in more detail on specific manifestations of this tension in the UK. This includes the broader treatment of all asylum seekers, as the backcloth to the consideration of social work with unaccompanied young people, and in particular the question of age assessment – which determines whether they are treated as adults, with all that entails in terms of lack of support, or as children – theoretically entitled to the same care as citizen children. The article presents the findings from a small qualitative study of how social workers manage these tensions, and the part played by social work values in this process. It concludes with some broader reflections on two divergent but interconnected levels: the role of social work values in managing tensions in individual practice with asylum seekers; and broader political campaigns backed by international human rights instruments to prevent human rights abuse in Western asylum systems.</p>
<p>This article recognizes that the term ‘asylum seeker’ is constructed within a political discourse that is primarily designed to put boundaries around people’s status and rights, and to limit access to the provisions of the UN Convention on the Status of Refugees. However, this article specifically focuses on those who have not yet been granted refugee status, and this limits the ability to move outside this dominant discourse while retaining clarity of meaning.</p>

<title>Separated asylum seeker young people internationally</title>
<p>Separated children and young people who seek refuge in Western countries, most of whom are fleeing conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020872812447638">Sutton and Smith, 2005</xref>), face a range of practical, emotional, legal and social issues, including the trauma and loss that may be associated with their departure from their homeland and family, trafficking or exploitation at any stage of their journey, lack of knowledge and fear concerning the country they are entering, cultural and language barriers, and the uncertainty and pitfalls of the legal system for claiming asylum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020872812447638">Hek, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020872812447638">Legget, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020872812447638">Nandy, 2005</xref>). The European Social Network (ESN), that brings together social services directors across Europe, has affirmed that separated children ‘must receive the same standards of care and protection offered to all children’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812447638">ESN, 2005</xref>: 5). Their additional particular needs should also be met, including protection from return to life- threatening situations; protection from harm and abuse within the country of asylum; their needs for nurture, safety and support, for preventive and remedial health care, for education and play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812447638">ESN, 2005</xref>). The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) should underpin policy and practice.</p>
<p>There has been international legal recognition of the specific needs and vulnerability of separated child refugees since the early 20th century, for example the 1924 Declaration of the Rights of the Child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812447638">Bhabha and Crock, 2007</xref>). However, this legal recognition has not guaranteed the protection of their rights: the situation they encounter in countries where they seek asylum embodies fundamental tensions between immigration policy and child welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872812447638">Aspinall and Walters, 2010</xref>). While there is good practice, children’s rights throughout Western countries of asylum can also be undermined by reception arrangements and asylum processes that are not child-oriented, deficiencies in the availability and provision of services, and liability to detention and to removal.</p>
<p>This is not the place for detailed examination of different national policies and practices, so brief illustrations of international trends are offered, prior to discussion of the European and UK contexts. A review of law, policy and practice related to separated children in Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872812447638">Crock, 2008</xref>) concluded that insufficient attention had been given within the immigration system to children’s vulnerability, experiences and needs; data collection relating to children was inadequate; the minister for immigration was ‘in a position of impossible conflict of interest because immigration control dominates over child protection issues at every point’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872812447638">Crock, 2008</xref>: 12); and the detention of children caused immediate and lasting damage. Detention of children and its impact was the subject of a national inquiry by the then Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020872812447638">HREOC, 2004</xref>), while a social work-led inquiry looked more broadly at the human rights abuses of immigration detention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872812447638">Briskman et al., 2008</xref>). Detention continues to be a key part of the asylum system in Australia, as in other Western countries.</p>
<p>A parallel review of refugee protection for separated children in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872812447638">Bhabha and Schmidt, 2006</xref>) also found a lack of adequate protection and of appropriate responses to children, the unacceptability of detention, and data collection failures. In comparison with juvenile justice, ‘U.S. immigration law does not consider the best interests of the child in decision making’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872812447638">Bhabha and Schmidt, 2006</xref>: 34). Despite differences, there were strong broad similarities between the US and Australia. The situation in the UK, considered later, was reviewed in a third investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872812447638">Bhabha and Finch, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, a comparative review of the US, Australia and the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812447638">Bhabha and Crock, 2007</xref>) criticized failures to collect data on separated children, deficient procedures for identifying such children, the lack of a guardian and of quality legal support in processing claims, failures in meeting their social needs, and the generalized hostility towards asylum seekers that is reflected in a ‘culture of disbelief’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020872812447638">Jubani, 2011</xref>) amongst immigration officials. Other issues included being denied access to the country’s territory in the US and Australia through the use of offshore processing centres, and the absence of child-oriented practices and information within most asylum procedures. Age assessment or determination was a problematic issue in all three countries because of unreliable procedures, because disbelief about age compounds credibility issues, and because the status of child or adult can be crucial for the treatment received. The greater the difference between adult and child treatment, as in the UK, the greater is the contention surrounding age determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812447638">Bhabha and Crock, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Separated asylum seeker young people in Europe</title>
<p>These problems in the treatment of separated child asylum seekers are also reflected throughout Europe. European policy concerning immigration and asylum, involving both refugee protection and immigration control measures, has undergone a process of increasing harmonization, through a number of stages. The 1985 Schengen Agreement first provided for free movement within the borders of five countries. In 1992 immigration and asylum became part of mainstream EU policy in the Maastricht Treaty under the Justice and Home Affairs pillar. These areas were moved into the Community Pillar under Title IV of the 1999 Amsterdam Treaty, which also incorporated and extended the reach of the Schengen Agreement. The subsequent 1999 Tampere summit set a five-year agenda which produced four major directives, followed by a further five-year agenda in the 2004 Hague programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872812447638">Geddes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020872812447638">Sutton and Smith, 2005</xref>). The current Stockholm programme of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) restates the EU’s commitment to refugee protection and human rights, and affirms that the rights of the child concern all EU policies and ‘must be systematically and strategically taken into account with a view to ensuring an integrated approach’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872812447638">European Council, 2010</xref>: 10).</p>
<p>These stated commitments have been an integral part of the various stages in the creation of the CEAS. However, the development trajectory of the CEAS and its implementation demonstrate that immigration control has been the main policy driver, under governments of different persuasions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872812447638">Schuster (2000)</xref> concluded that there had been little liberalization of policy under more centre- left governments in the late 1990s; that across Europe it was becoming increasingly difficult for people seeking asylum to reach EU territory; and that their treatment within EU states widely involved segregation from mainstream housing and welfare provision, and sub-standard and undignified provision. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020872812447638">Morris (2005)</xref> expressed concern that the harmonization process was undermining the principles of the Refugee Convention, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872812447638">Crawley (2005</xref>: 15) concluded that ‘public disquiet and . . . hostility have been allowed . . . to drive the direction of European policy making’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020872812447638">Pirjola (2009)</xref> examined the fundamental contradictions within the Common European Asylum System between abstract human rights commitments and the unspecified notion of refugee protection in the 1951 Convention, and their implementation by national governments with particular interests related to controlling the inflow of asylum seekers to their territory. He concluded that the power of states versus the powerlessness of those seeking asylum means that the CEAS is a ‘hypocrisy . . . that promotes particular and instrumental aims under the camouflage of universal human rights commitments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020872812447638">Pirjola, 2009</xref>: 366).</p>
<p>Within European asylum policy, as internationally, the experience of children’s services has been that the situations and needs of children are generally neglected or treated as an addition, with little in the way of child- friendly procedures or recognition of child specific forms of persecution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872812447638">ESN, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020872812447638">Sutton and Smith, 2005</xref>). The specific impact of asylum policy harmonization on separated children in Europe was analysed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872812447638">Enenajor (2007)</xref>. While echoing the neglect of children’s needs within asylum processes, and the importance of recognizing their vulnerability due to pre-arrival experiences, she analysed the intersection of vulnerability with European asylum policy. Punitive and deterrent measures, and the climate of suspicion and hostility towards all asylum seekers including children, mean that asylum policy is itself a potent source of additional vulnerability operating within the country where refuge is sought.</p>

<title>Separated asylum seeker young people in the UK</title>
<p>The UK reflects these broader policy trends. Although Britain never signed up to Schengen, and opted out of Title IV of the 1997 Amsterdam Treaty on free movement, migration and asylum, it retained the right to opt into any of the European provisions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872812447638">Geddes (2005)</xref> demonstrated that Britain has tended to opt in to coercive measures that restrict migrants’ access to the EU, and to opt out of protective measures, for example on family reunion. Increasingly restrictive and deterrent policy has developed in the UK, involving both internal and external controls. Since 1993, asylum seekers have been progressively excluded from mainstream benefits and services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872812447638">Cemlyn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872812447638">Griffiths et al., 2005</xref>), allocated to a segregated system that controls all aspects of their lives: no choice accommodation, forced moves disrupting support networks, minimal subsistence and prohibition on working (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872812447638">Fell and Hayes, 2007</xref>). It leaves many adults whose asylum claims are unsuccessful both homeless and destitute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020872812447638">Refugee Council, 2004</xref>). Even families with unsuccessful claims can have all support withdrawn, with the threat of children being removed by social workers. Where asylum seekers do approach social services, social workers find themselves part of a system that may perpetuate destitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872812447638">Cemlyn, 2008</xref>) or may require them to reinforce immigration control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020872812447638">Humphries, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Unaccompanied asylum seeking young people are the exception to this pattern, as they are included within the UK’s child welfare legislation, and are theoretically entitled to the same services as citizen children who cannot live with their families. However, the fundamental tension between child welfare and control of asylum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020872812447638">Giner, 2006</xref>) is equally pervasive in the UK, affecting young people and those who work with them. Previous research identified that unaccompanied young people need to manage their stories in a hostile asylum system and that silence may be a way of coping with post-conflict trauma and loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872812447638">Kohli, 2006a</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872812447638">Chase (2010)</xref> concluded that selective disclosure of their stories was also a way of retaining some agency within a system of hostile surveillance.</p>
<p>Social workers manage such tensions by responding in different ways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020872812447638">Kohli (2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020872812447638">2007b)</xref> described three overlapping practice domains: ‘humanitarians’, offering practical day-to-day assistance and ensuring networks of support; more therapeutic ‘witnesses’, providing space to listen to young people’s painful emerging stories; or ‘confederates’ or protective allies in line with the UNCRC, reaching out to young people who have to ‘reclaim and reinvent their lives in deeply uncertain circumstances’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020872812447638">Kohli, 2007a</xref>: 190), acknowledging the political context of asylum seeking, and drawing a clear boundary between themselves and immigration authorities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0020872812447638">
<title>Age assessment</title>
<p>The UK provision for separated young people is more favourable in law than some other European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872812447638">Bhabha and Finch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872812447638">Enenajor, 2007</xref>), although there are deficiencies in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020872812447638">Wade et al., 2005</xref>).This means that age assessment, determining whether a young person is treated as a child or an adult, potentially subject to dispersal, detention or destitution, takes on more crucial significance. It has become pivotal in the overall experience and treatment of many separated young asylum seekers who have found themselves increasingly suspected of being ‘adults posing as children’, a category constructed in response to rising numbers of unaccompanied children and the rigid division of support provision since the 1990s. Those whose age is disputed by immigration officials are not given the benefit of the doubt, and generalized suspicion of minors means they lose credibility in relation to their asylum claim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020872812447638">Giner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020872812447638">Kvittingen, 2010</xref>). Only a minority of young people achieve recognition as refugees in the UK, compared with adults or with young people in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872812447638">Bhabha and Crock, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Age assessment is extremely contentious with a high degree of error. There used to be reliance on medical evidence, but paediatricians have concluded that determining chronological age through bone density x-rays, especially for older teenagers, is ‘virtually impossible . . . [and] should not be attempted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020872812447638">Levenson and Sharma, 1999</xref>: 13), though dental analysis and paediatric reports are still offered as supplementary evidence, alongside Merton age assessments (discussed below). Significant variations exist in the experiences and development of children from distinct cultural and ethnic contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872812447638">Crawley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020872812447638">Watters, 2008</xref>); age is not universally registered, documented, celebrated or even necessarily known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872812447638">Dorling, 2009</xref>); and young people coming from countries of war and conflict may challenge Western conceptions of childhood as ‘dependent’ and ‘powerless’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020872812447638">Legget, 2008</xref>). They may instead be seen as ‘manipulative imposters’ or ‘people out of place’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872812447638">Bhabha, 2001</xref>: 294).</p>
<p>The validity of a more holistic social work age assessment has been evaluated through successive judicial reviews. The ‘Merton’ judgment gave legal backing to the guidelines of two London boroughs concerning a holistic approach to age assessment to include interaction, social history, family circumstances, education, self-care and health, as well as physical appearance and behaviour, although it also reinforced a focus on credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872812447638">Crawley, 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, such assessments are affected by culturally based preconceptions about age-related behaviour, subjective judgement, management pressures to reduce costs associated with care of those assessed as under 18, and political and cultural constructions of asylum seekers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020872812447638">Kvittingen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Social workers are required to complete this assessment task whilst under pressure from competing childcare and immigration legislation and its implications: its ideologies, assumptions and implicit values. Conflicting associations arise with the competing identities ascribed to young people that arrive in the UK seeking asylum of ‘child’ and ‘asylum seeker’; the former is associated with welfare needs, protection and socially constructed attributes of vulnerability, passivity and lack of agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020872812447638">Giner, 2006</xref>), while the latter is a legally constructed term imbued with sanctions, control and lack of status. Previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872812447638">Crawley, 2007</xref>) found variability of approach, with pockets of holistic, open-minded, culturally aware practice, but poor quality age assessments overall, reflecting socially constructed understandings and the culture of disbelief that pervades the asylum system.</p>
<p>Through conducting age assessments, social workers are effectively gate keepers to the possibilities or curtailment of their own supportive, therapeutic or advocacy role. The different approaches outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020872812447638">Kohli (2007a)</xref> only come into play once a child is decided to be a child. Moreover, developments since ‘Merton’ have given primary authority to social work age assessments. They function not only to determine service provision, but are used for immigration age disputes, and age assessment information has to be shared with the Home Office. A social work task has become embedded in immigration control.</p>
<p>A situation therefore prevails in which the practice of individual social workers, who are caught between regulatory and financial pressures and their loyalty to professional values, is at the fulcrum of influence in terms of the experience of young separated asylum seekers. The Social Care Institute for Excellence guide to social care with refugees and asylum seekers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020872812447638">SCIE, 2010</xref>: 6) affirms that ‘adopting a rights-based approach to social care is the best way of ensuring that the principles of equality and respect . . . are met’. This is in line with international and national codes of social work ethics that ‘principles of human rights and social justice are fundamental to social work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020872812447638">IFSW, 2007</xref>). The wider policy and legal context, as we have just seen, creates conditions in which even the most positive rights based practice can be undermined. The cultural context also affects individual social work practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020872812447638">Masocha and Simpson (2011)</xref> argue that political and media constructions of asylum seekers in negative and ‘xenoracist’ terms, and the culture of disbelief, affect social workers’ own understanding and practice, without a critical awareness of the political context of asylum. Therefore, this is arguably an area where social workers can take more control by remaining true to social work values and challenging their own assumptions and attitudes, with professional supervisory support.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0020872812447638">
<title>Study findings</title>
<p>This is exemplified in a small qualitative study that was undertaken by one of the authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020872812447638">Nye, 2010</xref>). It sought to explore the views and experiences of social workers conducting age assessments. The social workers interviewed were not new to the task of age assessment, but recognized the challenge of establishing the objective fact of age from an imprecise science. Through the experiences of the sample of social workers, the study illustrates significant contrasts in approaches to age assessment of young people seeking refuge in the UK from violent conflict.</p>
<p>One approach viewed this task as a procedure separate to the role of social work: the ‘bureaucratic approach’. This disconnection of age assessment from social work practice and value commitments has significant subsidiary effects. The approach was critically reflected upon by its adherents as creating an attitude of disbelief in their practice, in which inconsistencies were re-visited and stories challenged. Budget pressures and anecdotal evidence of adults claiming to be children for the benefits this status afforded were considered to exacerbate this culture of disbelief. Communication with the Home Office appeared to place further pressure on social workers to make speedy decisions and contributed to the immigration narrative of adults abusing the system.</p>
<p>The importance of managing the stories of unaccompanied young people coping with trauma and loss in a safe space is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020872812447638">Kohli, 2006b</xref>). The Merton assessment criteria cover many profoundly sensitive issues for these young people, including family composition, cultural context and social history. In creating an initial environment of disbelief and interrogation as a gateway to care and protection there is a risk of destroying a potentially safe space for unaccompanied young people to process the changes occurring in their lives. Additionally, a lack of clarity in the social work role in this approach was leading to young people having difficulty in distinguishing between social workers and immigration officials, reflective of wider trends in social work with asylum seekers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020872812447638">Humphries, 2004</xref>). Young people were also reported frequently to disappear prior to the completion of age assessments approached in this manner. The impact of the ‘bureaucratic approach’ upon young people caused ethical dilemmas and value conflicts for practitioners. Adherents of this approach reflected that the task had a disabling effect upon their practice and values, holding practitioners back from advocating for young people until an age had been determined. Distinctions were made regarding the type of social worker they had been prior to conducting this task, and the social worker they felt this task had made them become; in this role practitioners following the bureaucratic approach expressed loss of professional identity along with the values the social work profession champions.</p>
<p>The distinct ‘child-centred approach’ incorporates the assessment within established childcare values and protective duties of social work. This approach advocates for an extended child-centred process utilizing child- friendly tools in which the issue of age is incorporated into a wider needs assessment. Human rights were also viewed as indicative to this approach, in which the young person whose age is disputed should be treated with dignity and respect, irrespective of the age that is eventually determined. The child-centred approach also recognizes that in Western society <italic>need</italic> is often dictated by <italic>age</italic>, but in disputed cases where our a priori understanding of age is eluded, <italic>need</italic> must take priority. Young people are placed in care and education to meet their perceived needs and the age that they claim to be. If during the extended age and needs assessment the care that has been put in place is not deemed to be appropriate, it may later be adjusted in consultation with the young person and with consideration of their best interests. Through giving young people the benefit of the doubt in relation to this inexact assessment process, a safe space is created and arguably more accurate results are eventually gained, while safeguarding children’s rights.</p>
<p>The Merton guidelines aim to be ‘holistic’ to ensure that appearance is not the only factor taken into account when assessing age. However, given the difficulty of the task and its inherently political nature, the Merton guidelines alone cannot guarantee that practitioners will be able to resolve this conflicting role. Through the contrasting experiences of practitioners, the study developed the following recommendations to improve practice and ensure clarity of purpose for social workers asked to perform this task.</p>
<p>The task of age assessment is often a new concept for social workers as no pre- or post-qualification training is uniformly received. To ensure that social workers feel empowered to conduct an age assessment, training should be given not only on how to conduct age assessments, but also on the difficulties of the task and framing age assessment within the wider asylum system.</p>
<p>The benefit of the doubt should be given throughout the assessment process. Treating an age-disputed young person as an adult until proven otherwise during a traumatic time of transition puts the wellbeing of that young person at risk. In contrast, treating an adult as a child does not have negative implications for their welfare. As a social worker the potential harm to a child mistakenly placed in a hostile adult asylum system should be of far more concern than immigration or budget pressures. Throughout the process young people should be engaged with in a child-centred way. Information deemed relevant to meeting the care needs of the young person should be gained sensitively and over time, taking into account the views of care and educational professionals who regularly interact with the young person. If made compulsory throughout the UK, these measures could ensure more consistent and fair assessments and allow practitioners to manage this complex position within the protective and therapeutic functions of social work.</p>

<title>Conclusion: The political context of individual practice and the centrality of values</title>
<p>Age assessment can be seen as paradigmatic for the tensions facing social work with asylum seekers between a focus on the rights of service users and the demands of conformity to the restrictions of immigration law. It is an area in which broader political and moral issues crystallize at the level of individual practice, thus effectively privatizing the management of the powerful tensions within the treatment of asylum-seeking children. The study outlined in this article has demonstrated that the values of individual social workers can shape crucial areas of practice. These values are endorsed by the structures of the profession, at the international level in the statement of principles of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020872812447638">IFSW (2007)</xref>. The current British regulatory code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872812447638">General Social Care Council, 2011</xref>) is somewhat more circumscribed in referring to ‘service users’ rather than ‘people’. As we have seen, whether asylum seekers in general, and children in particular, are defined as ‘service users’ is at the core of key political dilemmas in social work with asylum seekers.</p>
<p>These tensions have to be handled by individual social workers, but they also properly belong in a wider political sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872812447638">Cemlyn, 2008</xref>), drawing on human rights instruments combined with political mobilization. Consortia of children’s organizations have campaigned with refugee groups about separated children’s rights. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020872812447638">Giner (2007)</xref> has demonstrated how a wide range of international and local actors have mobilized to defend the rights of asylum-seeking families, often with children as key agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872812447638">Cemlyn and Briskman, 2003</xref>). International human rights law and activism among women’s and refugee groups have enhanced campaigns for the rights of women asylum seekers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872812447638">Freedman, 2010</xref>). In the current period of retrenchment, social work in Britain is refinding its radical voice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020872812447638">Social Work Action Network [SWAN], 2011</xref>) to link with campaigns against cuts in services and the undermining of service users’ rights. It is essential that broader movements of social workers play an equally active part in the wider political struggles to protect asylum seekers, alongside the confident maintenance of core humanitarian values in their practice.</p>
