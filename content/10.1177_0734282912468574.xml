<title>Brief Introduction</title>
<p>The purpose of this book is to equip professionals with the knowledge and research-based practices necessary to effectively conduct authentic assessment in early childhood and to link the results to intervention. This volume is intended for a broad audience of practitioners, including psychologists, educators, and other professionals, who provide services to young children and their families. Essentially, the book is a handbook of best practices and assessment methodology aimed toward obtaining accurate measurements of ability among children in the early childhood age span. Going a step further than most assessment books, this valuable resource provides practical information describing how assessment results can be used to guide the planning of programs of early intervention for individual children.</p>
<p>The authors identified several main goals for writing this book. The primary goal was to promote advancement toward the use of authentic assessment as a means of improving the quality and accuracy of measurements obtained when evaluating young children. The authors viewed this goal as vital to avoid misrepresentation of children’s skills and abilities. Another goal identified by the authors was to make readers aware of effective methods of linking authentic assessment to intervention as a method of improving service delivery in early childhood programs. The authors sought to accomplish this goal by equipping professionals with research-based information about authentic assessment and the effective use of this methodology. Equally important, the authors provide professionals with reviews of validated assessment tools commonly used in early childhood. These reviews present a scientific evaluation of each instrument and report the authenticity of measurements yielded by the tools.</p>

<title>Content and Structure</title>
<p>To meet their stated goals, the authors structured the book into two major sections that present relevant information, arguments, and research substantiation for the stance taken by the book. The first section of the book defines authentic assessment and provides the research base for using authentic assessment to guide early intervention. The second section examines existing assessment measures and provides evaluative data regarding the authenticity of each measure. The first book section begins with chapter 1 presenting the authors’ argument for promoting change in accepted assessment methodology in early childhood. It is in this chapter that the main thesis of the book is presented. The authors argue that change is necessary in the methodology used to measure the development, learning, and skills of young children. They point to long-standing dissatisfaction among parents and professionals who believe conventionally accepted methods of testing fail to capture and accurately represent the full range of skills and abilities young children might possess. Criticism of conventional testing has been focused on several aspects of test administration as well as the instrumentation used. Regarding the administration of traditional tests, critics have noted that testing protocols are often contrived and place children in unnatural situations where their performance of tasks is generally outside of natural contexts. Critics argue that expecting young children to sit still and listen to test administrators’ instructions is unrealistic, especially when children have disabilities or potential lags in development. Moreover, the traditional instruments generally fail to offer accommodations when test items are administered to children with disabilities. Conventional tests are meant to be administered in tightly controlled situations intended to give each subject a similar set of circumstances during administration. However, for young children, especially those with disabilities, these controlled situations may, in fact, place limitations on their ability to perform tasks and demonstrate their areas of competence.</p>
<p>Another criticism is that validation processes of conventional standardized tests rarely involve children with disabilities. Many traditional instruments eliminate children with disabilities from the sample and usually fail to offer norms for children with various types of disabilities. Furthermore, the authors discuss the issues related to cultural and linguistic diversity of young children and how such diversity may not be adequately taken into consideration by standardized protocols of conventional tests. Consequently, the book presents a strong argument for moving away from traditional methods of measuring intelligence and ability in favor of authentic methods of assessment. When early intervention is the goal rather than research, the authors strongly favor assessment that is more likely to reveal the areas of strength and information that will be useful in designing intervention. It is argued that authentic assessment has the potential to provide a more accurate view of young children and their areas of competence. The authors contend that traditional methods of assessment lack accuracy for children in the early childhood age range and in using conventional testing methods, one risks misrepresentation of children’s skills and abilities. The result of such misrepresentation, the authors warn, may be limitations to civil rights of children, specifically, to their rights to a public education with their peers. The authors also caution that inaccurate assessment can result in barriers to children’s opportunities for optimal development and may limit their opportunities to achieve academic success.</p>
<p>After thoroughly describing the limitations of conventional testing in chapter 1, the authors define authentic assessment in chapter 2 and present the characteristics of authentic assessment that make it a more appropriate alternative to traditional standardized testing methods for use in early childhood. Three features of authentic assessment are of particular interest to professionals seeking accurate information about the skills and abilities of young children. First, authentic assessment uses observation rather than artificial testing to obtain data about children’s performance. Second, the situation for obtaining information about children is natural using usual contexts rather than a contrived set of circumstances. Third, the information obtained through authentic assessments is collected by caregivers, such as teachers and parents, who are familiar so children are comfortable and more likely to exhibit usual behaviors. It is believed that when data about a young child are collected in typical contexts by familiar persons, a broader range of information might be available to inform intervention.</p>
<p>In chapter 3 the authors discuss the standards that have been agreed on by professional organizations in the fields of early childhood, such as the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), that have defined developmentally appropriate practices for professionals and programs serving young children. Typical test administration protocols run counter to the practices described in these standards. The authors also discuss the position statements issued by various organizations and agencies that address recommendations for assessment, curriculum, and programming. Highly credible organizations, including the Division for Early Childhood of the Council for Exceptional Children, National Association of Early Childhood Specialists in State Departments of Education, and NAEYC, have issued position statements articulating their stance on assessment and programs in early childhood. These organizations have issued these recommendations to provide guidance to practitioners toward better assurances of positive outcomes for all children, including those with disabilities.</p>
<p>Application of authentic assessment in early childhood is the subject of chapter 4 in which the best uses for authentic data are outlined. This chapter suggests ways these data can be used in screening of children and establishing their eligibility for special services. Through text and tabular information, specific applications are summarized throughout the chapter. Ways to use authentic assessment to plan individualized programs of intervention and monitoring the performance of children within those programs are offered in the chapter. The evaluation of program outcomes using authentic data is also addressed. The chapter ends with a discussion of accountability as a controversial issue in assessment and suggestions to guide use of authentic data for accountability purposes. This book section ends with chapter 5, which offers an exciting look at forecasts for promising new practices and methodology on the horizon. The authors describe new formats aimed at increasing the effectiveness of assessment and efficiency of linking assessments to intervention in the future. Computer-assisted databases may offer more portable alternatives to paper and pencil assessments. Media offers opportunities to collect audio and video recordings of children’s behavior and interactions, which can prove useful in team planning for intervention. The development of functional classification systems can help professionals consider a wider range of factors including health, personal, environmental, and activity variables in the planning of individual interventions. Use of performance probes are being researched for application in Response to Intervention models. Another exciting approach is the application of epidemiological measures that use data on populations of children to help communities plan better support for children with special needs and their families.</p>
<p>The second section of the book provides an evaluation of assessment measures commonly used in early childhood. This section begins with a description of the LINK Social Validity Study in which web-based surveys were conducted to examine the authenticity of selected assessment measures. The development and validation processes for the survey are described. A system of icons was adapted from the Consumer Reports rating scale for use by consumers of assessment tools in the field of early childhood. A national panel of assessment experts in early childhood intervention served as reviewers to guide and evaluate the development of the survey. Test users were recruited to complete the survey through postings on listservs of national professional organizations. Test users included personnel serving on early intervention teams, such as therapists, teachers, and administrators. Data from over a thousand test users were compiled and used to prepare the analyses presented in this section of the book. Summaries of the test user survey data for 87 assessment measures were presented in two different ways. First, tables were used to compile consumer ratings across the 87 measures. Second, an “At-a-Glance” section was prepared for each assessment measure. Concise summaries of relevant features and the survey ratings for individual assessment measures were provided. This information becomes a handy and practical guide for professionals to use when deciding which tools match their assessment purposes.</p>

<title>Critique</title>
<p>This well-written book constitutes a practical resource for professionals to use in their decision-making processes relevant to assessment and intervention in early childhood. The quality of this book is outstanding, and it will be a valuable reference for early childhood intervention team personnel. The stated goals described in the preface of the book were met. The authors succeeded in providing a strong, well-substantiated argument in favor of moving from traditional testing toward authentic assessment approaches in early childhood. The authors made an excellent case for using authentic assessment as an effective tool in the evaluation process. The book provides solid guidance on how to apply the results of authentic assessment to achieve effective intervention. A clear strength of the book is the wealth of information provided in a concise format about each of the 87 assessment tools reviewed and available for use by early childhood intervention professionals. The streamlined format of the “At-a-Glance” section will be helpful to busy professionals who will appreciate the efficiency of the rating icons and brief textual information provided. For these reasons, this book makes a valuable contribution to all professionals involved in the assessment and the planning of interventions for young children. Furthermore, this book would be valuable as a required reading in the preparation program of all professionals who will be involved in the assessment of young children. For example, students preparing to be school psychologists will benefit from a clearer understanding of factors that might affect the accurate assessment of young children and how to select assessment measures that are developmentally appropriate for the early childhood age range. Therapists and teachers will benefit from knowledge about how to use authentic assessment to inform their early intervention efforts and how to best monitor children’s progress. The information in this book will help all professionals engaged in psychoeducational assessment to make better judgments about children’s competencies and practical recommendations about intervention strategies.</p>
