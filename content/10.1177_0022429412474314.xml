<abstract>
<p>In this descriptive study, we examined self-reported concerns of 159 music student teachers pre– and post–student teaching, over a period of 5 years. Resulting comments (<italic>N</italic> = 867) were analyzed on the basis of (a) stages of teacher concern (focus on self, subject matter [music and teaching], and students) modeled after Fuller and Bown and (b) emerging categories of concern compared with those identified by Madsen and Kaiser. Stages of concern were reliably identifiable across all comments. Teachers, as predicted, began student teaching with more self (56%) and fewer student (4%) comments. Post–student teaching comments resulted in fewer self (33%) and more student (20%) mentions. Categorization of concerns indicated that pre– and post–student teachers shared some concerns (applying knowledge, discipline, confidence) but showed marked differences in other areas (cut out for teaching, information about students, administrative duties). Pre–student teaching categories were similar to those reported by Madsen and Kaiser a decade earlier; post–student teaching comments differed.</p>

<p>Student teaching is a time-honored teacher preparation experience that prospective teachers often believe to be the most valuable part of teacher preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022429412474314">Brand, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022429412474314">Conway, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022429412474314">2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022429412474314">Kelly (2010)</xref>, viewing student teaching from the educator preparation point of view, noted, “Perhaps the ultimate goal of any music teacher education program is the transformation of preservice students into successful educators” (p. 21). The purpose of this study was to examine the specifics of that transformation as it is presumed to occur between the first and last days of the student teaching experience.</p>
<sec id="section1-0022429412474314">
<title>Stages of Concern</title>
<p>In an influential chapter titled “Becoming a Teacher,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022429412474314">Fuller and Bown (1975)</xref> postulated that inexperienced educators move progressively through three stages: focus on self (survival and self-adequacy), focus on task (subject matter and teaching), and finally, focus on students or educator impact on students. In this essay reviewing research on effective teaching, the authors described stages of development leading to effective teachers, asking, “How can concerns about survival be resolved and concerns about pupils be encouraged?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022429412474314">Fuller &amp; Bown, 1975</xref>, p. 40). Implied is a progression through a hierarchical sequence that should be fostered. The influence of this model is “perhaps the most classic of stage theories in that it was meant to be relatively invariant, sequential and hierarchical” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022429412474314">Richardson &amp; Placier, 2001</xref>, p. 910). See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022429412474314">P. Conway and Clark (2003)</xref> for a cogent account of the development of Fuller and Bown’s stages of concern. These seminal ideas have been examined widely by the general education community (a single Google Scholar search for “Fuller &amp; Bown” yielded over 2,000 citations) but are not without critics. Among those, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022429412474314">P. Conway and Clark (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022429412474314">Watzke (2007)</xref> noted that the widely adopted concerns-based approach is limited, emphasizing teacher initial fears (concerns) but ignoring teacher aspirations.</p>
<p>The reminder of this review of literature is limited to research using the concerns-based stages of teacher development as a basis for examination of music teacher preparation. Data on the three postulated stages have been gathered from preservice music teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022429412474314">Berg &amp; Miksza, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429412474314">Killian &amp; Dye, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022429412474314">Paul et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022429412474314">Teachout &amp; McCoy, 2010</xref>) and from high school students serving as teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022429412474314">Miksza &amp; Austin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022429412474314">Austin &amp; Miksza, 2012</xref>). Those who have examined what has become known as the “Fuller stages” reference various names for that developmental process, including teacher socialization, learner-centered learning and teaching, social role development, and social intelligence, among others. The fact that the Society for Music Teacher Education sponsors an ASPA (Areas for Strategic Planning and Action) for Music Teacher Socialization (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://smte.us/aspa/">http://smte.us/aspa/</ext-link>) speaks to the importance of and interest in this line of inquiry.</p>
<p>Music teacher concerns have been examined in at least two disparate ways: (a) Teachers stated their concerns in free-response written or interview format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022429412474314">Berg &amp; Miksza, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022429412474314">Conway, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022429412474314">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022429412474314">Powell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022429412474314">Miksza &amp; Austin, 2010</xref>), or (2) teachers rated the importance of prepared statements regarding teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022429412474314">Austin &amp; Miksza, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022429412474314">Campbell &amp; Thompson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022429412474314">Teachout &amp; McKoy, 2010</xref>). Each would appear potentially to yield differing results. We describe two studies here to exemplify the potential differences.</p>
<p>Using a prepared list of statements, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022429412474314">Campbell and Thompson (2007)</xref> surveyed music students (freshman to seniors) from 16 universities. Students rated the importance of 45 Likert-type questions from the Teacher Concerns Checklist of Fuller Stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022429412474314">Borich, 2000</xref>). Results indicated that all music education majors, regardless of year in school, believed student-based phrases to be of most importance, followed by self-oriented phrases and then task- or subject-oriented phrases.</p>
<p>Using free-response interviews, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022429412474314">Miksza and Austin (2010)</xref> studied 11 high school students who had repeated teaching experiences across 12 weeks. Data consisting of 1,000 coded interview statements revealed that the respondents, as predicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022429412474314">Fuller and Bown (1975)</xref>, moved from focus on self to focus on instructional tasks.</p>
<p>Other music researchers have not mentioned concerns-based stages specifically but have referenced the developmental nature of teacher preparation by exploring preservice teachers’ focus on self as opposed to their students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022429412474314">Henninger &amp; Scott, 2010</xref>) or development during peer- and field-teaching experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022429412474314">Powell, 2011</xref>). Others have observed in-service teacher behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022429412474314">Duke, 1994</xref>) or combined personality surveys with observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022429412474314">Juchniewicz, 2010</xref>). Thus, there appears to be widespread and ongoing recognition of the importance of examining the development of student teachers using a variety of dependent measures across all areas of music education.</p>
<p>Although music researchers have begun to explore the development of concerns-based stages among both preservice and in-service teachers, apparently there is a dearth of studies examining to what extent music student teachers develop through observable stages during and as a result of student teaching.</p>
<sec id="section2-0022429412474314">
<title>Assessment of Teacher Concerns</title>
<p>Of interest to those who structure student teaching experiences are the concerns of the student teachers themselves as they prepare for this culminating precertification activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022429412474314">Madsen and Kaiser (1999b)</xref> asked music student teachers to assess their concerns just prior to student teaching, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022429412474314">Kelly (2000)</xref> asked undergraduates to list their current concerns both about student teaching and about their envisioned first teaching position. In procedures particularly related to the current study in both topic and methodology, music students were asked to list their fears and concerns immediately prior to their student teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022429412474314">Madsen &amp; Kaiser, 1999b</xref>), in the last year of their undergraduate course work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022429412474314">Kelly, 2000</xref>), or in the year prior to their music therapy internship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429412474314">Madsen &amp; Kaiser, 1999a</xref>). Analysis of the resulting concerns revealed most frequent mentions of discipline, not being cut out for teaching, inability to apply knowledge, and concerns about interactions with supervising teachers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022429412474314">Kelly’s (2000)</xref> study of 62 pre-interns revealed similar results, with the addition of frequent concerns about nonteaching duties. Each of these studies gathered data by simply asking the respondents to list their perceived concerns, allowing analysis of students’ own words in self-report formats that subsequently were coded into emerging categories.</p>
<p>In one of few studies examining change among music student teachers from the start to the finish of student teaching, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022429412474314">Brand (1982)</xref> surveyed students’ pre–student teaching management beliefs and skills with their post–student teaching beliefs and skills. Results indicated that during an 8-week student teaching experience, little change in that measure occurred. Students’ beliefs and skills remained stable and did not appear to be modified either by their own experiences or by the beliefs and skills of their cooperating teachers.</p>
<p>Given the lack of comparison between student teacher concerns and perceptions just prior to and immediately following student teaching, we designed this study to examine student teachers’ concerns and perceptions at the start and the finish of their student teaching experience (pre– to post–student teaching). Given the two types of designs revealed in the literature review, we elected a free-response design rather than a rating survey. We speculated that asking student teachers to rate the importance of a prepared list of statements might result in responses reflecting what they perceived they should answer. A free-response prompt might elicit individual thoughts beyond those on a written survey or different from what we expected to learn.</p>
<p>We explored the following research questions: (1) Would there be reliably identifiable Fuller stages among the written concerns? (2) If so, were there differences between pre–student teaching concerns and post–student teaching concerns relative to the Fuller stages? (3) How would emerging categories of concern compare with categories identified in earlier research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429412474314">Madsen &amp; Kaiser, 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022429412474314">1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022429412474314">Kelly 2000</xref>)? (4) Would there be a difference between either quantity or quality of emerging categorical comments before and after student teaching?</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants in this study included students (<italic>N</italic> = 173) who had completed their student teaching at a large southwestern university in the nine semesters from fall 2006 through fall 2010. These included nearly equal numbers of males (<italic>n</italic> = 83) and females (<italic>n</italic> = 90). Each student had completed the requisite music and academic music teacher preparation course work, finished all field observation experiences, engaged in peer teaching episodes, and participated in pre–student teaching practicum teaching in the public schools as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429412474314">Killian and Dye (2009a)</xref>. Thus, all students were fully eligible to student teach and qualified to sit for the state all-level music certification exams. They earn a “comprehensive certification” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022429412474314">Robinson, 2010</xref>), a single certification in music for early childhood through 12th grade, including all music subdisciplines (band, orchestra, choir, general). Approximately 60% of student teachers taught in band settings (<italic>n</italic> = 103), while the remainder taught in choir (<italic>n</italic> = 29), orchestra (<italic>n</italic> = 27), or elementary (<italic>n</italic> = 14). All student teachers participated in a single 14-week semester of full-time student teaching. Most (90%) elected intensive single-area placements (band, choir, orchestra, general music); the remainder chose a dual placement (7 weeks elementary, 7 weeks secondary). Size of the student teaching cadres ranged from 6 to 33, with a mean of 19 student teachers per semester.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022429412474314">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>During part of their daylong pre–student teaching meeting, each group of student teachers was instructed to “list questions or concerns that you have prior to student teaching” and then anonymously submit the comment forms with other required paperwork by the end of the day. Fourteen weeks later, the student teachers returned for their all-day post–student teaching meeting and were instructed to “consider how far you’ve come: As a teacher or as a person, what do you know now that you didn’t know at the beginning of your student teaching?” Again, they submitted this form anonymously with other required paperwork by the end of the day. Note that stages of concern were not mentioned, nor were students reminded that student teaching might cause them to focus more on the student than on themselves. Their responses were completely unguided except for the original prompts specified earlier, and instructions were identical across the nine semesters examined in this study.</p>
<p>We purposefully made responses anonymous in an effort to elicit candid comments. Anonymity meant we could not match pre– and post–student teachers, nor could we track which students submitted this particular part of their paperwork package. More than 46% (80 out of 173) voluntarily signed both the pre– and post–student teaching comment sheets; however, we had no way to match the remainder pre– to post–student teaching comments, so we did not attempt to compare individual pre- and posttest responses in this study. We ultimately compiled complete records for 159 pre–student teaching participants out of a possible 173 (92%) and 143 post–student teaching forms (83%). The inadvertent loss of spring 2008 post–student teaching comments explains the difference between pre- and posttest numbers.</p>
<p>Subsequently we entered each comment into a database. Because some students listed comments and some wrote paragraphs, we considered the sentence or phrase as the primary unit of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022429412474314">Miksza &amp; Austin, 2010</xref>) and listed each sentence or phrase separately. Resulting data (<italic>N</italic> = 867 individual comments) included pre–student teaching (159 participants made 495 comments, mean = 3.11 responses per student) and post–student teaching comments (143 participants made 372 comments, mean = 2.60 responses per student). All comments were compiled by student name where possible or labeled <italic>anonymous</italic>. Thus, even when we could not identify an individual student, we knew how many comments each individual made. Numbers of comments per participant ranged from 1 to 9 with an overall mean of 2.87.</p>
<sec id="section6-0022429412474314">
<title>Stages of concern</title>
<p>Our investigation focused partially on the question of the extent to which these comments indicated evidence of the postulated Fuller stages of concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022429412474314">Fuller &amp; Bown, 1975</xref>). The Fuller stages were defined as concern with self, subject matter (what Campbell &amp;Thompson, 2007, called “task concerns”), and student learning or teacher impact on learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022429412474314">Fuller (1969)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022429412474314">Fuller and Bown (1975)</xref> interpreted movement from self to subject to student concerns as an indication of positive developmental growth in the life of a teacher; we made that same assumption. When we initially examined student teacher responses, we found subject matter references to include comments both about music and about teaching itself. Given the early evidence that responses in the music classroom sometimes differ from those in the general classroom (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022429412474314">Killian, 1990</xref>), we speculated that it might be informative to separate the two components of subject matter concern. Thus, we divided Fuller and Bown’s original category <italic>subject matter</italic> into <italic>music</italic> (comments about the teaching of music, including clarinet fingerings, crescendo, tone quality, etc.) and <italic>general teaching</italic> (comments about classroom management, attentiveness, planning, etc.). The resulting categories were then coded numerically as 1 (self), 2 (music), 3 (teaching), and 4 (students).</p>
<p>A graduate student entered all data, and the three researchers (with 13 to 40 years of teaching experience) independently labeled each written comment with a category number 1 through 4, based on the extended Fuller stages of concern. Student names had been removed to allow coders to focus on the comments rather than on known characteristics of the students who wrote them, since all three researchers had served as instructors for these student teachers. Reliability between each pair of judges, using the formula agreements divided by agreements plus disagreements, averaged .90 (ranging from .88 to .94). Reliability among the three judges was computed further using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance for both the pre–student teaching comments, <italic>H</italic>(2, 12) = 0.03, <italic>p</italic> = .99, and post–student teaching comments, <italic>H</italic>(2, 12) = 0.04, <italic>p</italic> = .98. We deemed these results to be reliable and subsequently combined the three judges’ coding to create a single code for each comment. Examination of the frequency of each code based on student self-reported comments allowed us to explore the extent to which our students exhibited the stages of concern at two points in time, the beginning and the end of their student teaching.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022429412474314">
<title>Emerging categories</title>
<p>All comments were examined for emerging categories using established procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022429412474314">Adler &amp; Adler, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022429412474314">Creswell, 2007</xref>). We initially used the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429412474314">Madsen and Kaiser (1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022429412474314">1999b</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022429412474314">Kelly (2000)</xref> lists of pre-internship fears but modified some and abandoned others when they did not appear in quantity among our participants’ comments. After independent examination of categories, disagreements among the three researchers were discussed collectively until a consensus was reached. Using the same procedures, we then reexamined individual entries in each of the categories and collapsed them as appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022429412474314">Creswell, 2007</xref>). Ultimately, we agreed on 25 categories.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>This study was designed to examine pre– and post–student teaching comments and concerns in two separate ways: first relative to stages of concern and then on the basis of emerging categories derived from the self-reported comments.</p>
<sec id="section9-0022429412474314">
<title>Evidence of Fuller Stages</title>
<p>Each of 867 comments was coded independently by the three researchers using the extended Fuller stages of concern (1 = self, 2 = music, 3 = teaching, 4 = student). Because reliability analyses indicated no significant differences among the judges’ coding, all subsequent examination was based on the combined judges’ codes for each comment. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022429412474314">Table 1</xref> presents both frequency of each stage and the percentage of occurrences to allow for differences in completed self-report prompts between pre– and post–student teaching responses.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022429412474314">Table 3</xref> allows examination of sample responses within the categories that appeared among more than 5% of the pre– or post–student teaching comments. Examination of individual responses to the most frequently mentioned categories (defined as more than 5% of the comments) revealed categories that appeared to be important to both pre– and post–student teachers. Applying knowledge was the most frequently mentioned category by both groups (26% pre– and 32% post–student teachers). Discipline was of frequent concern (ranking second for pre– and third for post–student teachers). However, further examination revealed that 47 of 57 (82%) of pre–student teachers’ comments about discipline were negative (concerns with “keeping the students’ attention during class” or “controlling undisciplined kids”). Contrastingly, the majority of post–student teaching comments (23 out of 35, or 66%) were positive (“I know how to control a class full of kiddos” or “I feel capable of controlling a class”). Discipline comments that could not be coded as negative or positive (“classroom management,” discipline issues”) were listed as neutral. Although we found the distinction between positive and negative comments to be informative, it should be noted that the pre–student teaching prompt (“What are your concerns prior to student teaching”) by its wording may have elicited more negative responses than the post–student teaching prompt (“What do you know now that you didn’t know at the beginning of your student teaching?”).</p>

<p>Confidence is a third category that appeared in more than 5% of both pre– and post–student teaching comments. Again, the positive-negative factor was contrasting with 24 of 27 (89%) of pre–student teaching comments being negative (“insecure in my ability to conduct” or “anxiety about being in front of a large crowd”). In contrast, 26 of 30 (90%) of post–student teaching comments regarding confidence were positive (“I’ve become more confident in motivating students” or “I’m capable of more than I initially thought”).</p>
<p>Other categories that appeared in more than 5% of the comments included topics evidently specific only to pre–student teaching concerns. Comments related to cooperating teacher relationships (“Will I get along with my cooperating teacher?”) were of concern to 8% of the pre–student teachers as compared with only 2% of post–student teachers. Teacher and professional role concerns (“friend to teacher change as I go from being a student to a teacher” or “How to act around students?”) were mentioned by 6% of pre–student teachers but fewer than 1% of post–student teachers. General procedures were of concern to 5% of pre–student teachers (“How much teaching will I be doing?” or “Will my background check be done in time?”) but were of absolutely no concern (0%) to post–student teachers.</p>
<p>Likewise, post–student teachers had concerns that were seldom mentioned by pre–student teachers. Many (16%) made comments placed in the <italic>cut out for teaching</italic> category while only one comment on that topic was made among pre–student teachers. Notably, that single pre–student teaching comment tended toward the negative (“Do I really want to spend the rest of my life in a classroom?”), while 95% of post–student teaching comments regarding being cut out for teaching were positive (“Students are capable of anything and I am here to give them tools to do that”). Post–student teachers also mentioned the category of administrative duties frequently (7%), while pre–student teachers seldom did (2%). Post–student teachers mentioned information about students 8% of the time (“I am more understanding with children because I know how they think and work”), while pre–student teachers made only one comment on that topic. Finally, post–student teachers made comments (7%) about their growth as a teacher (“I now understand the meaning of patience!” or “My creative side has come to light”), while only a single pre–student teacher mentioned that category (concerned with “not being able to learn as much as I can”).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section12-0022429412474314">
<title>Stages of Concern</title>
<p>We initially asked whether the Fuller stages of concern could be identified reliably from student teachers’ self-reported concerns and whether predictable changes in those stages could be observed from pre– to post–student teaching written comments. Results confirmed that the Fuller stages of concern could be reliably identified within the 867 pre– and post–student teaching comments gathered from 159 student teachers. Comparison of the Fuller stages (focus on self, subject matter [divided between music and teaching], and students) revealed, as predicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022429412474314">Fuller and Bown (1975)</xref>, that student teachers initially were involved most with self (55%), then were involved with music and teaching, and only slightly were focused on students (4%). After completing student teaching, the teachers were involved with self to a lesser degree (33%) and much more focused on students (20%). Findings concurred with the results of earlier research involving preservice music teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022429412474314">Berg &amp; Miksza, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429412474314">Killian &amp; Dye, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429412474314">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022429412474314">Teachout &amp; McCoy, 2010</xref>) and high school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022429412474314">Miksza &amp; Austin, 2010</xref>). We concluded that our data supported the postulated movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022429412474314">Fuller &amp; Bown, 1975</xref>) from student focus first on self, then subject matter, and finally impact on students. Note, however, that although during student teaching, our students decreased focus on self (from 55% to 33% of the comments) and increased comments about students (4% to 20%), overall, they remained more focused on self than on students.</p>
<p>Our decision to divide subject matter concerns into music and teaching revealed that music concerns remained relatively constant pre– to post–student teaching (21% to 20%), but comments about teaching increased (20% to 27%). Thus, we concluded that dividing subject matter into music and teaching was not a particularly informative procedure. Overall, pre–student teaching students were most concerned with self (56%), then subject matter (41%), with concern about students a distant third (4%). Post–student teaching, comments included more subject matter (47%), a notable decrease in mentions of self (33%), and a distinct increase in mentions of students (20%).</p>
<p>Our study demonstrates that using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022429412474314">Fuller and Bown (1975)</xref> stages is a viable and perhaps insightful way to analyze young educator growth in music settings. Further research using these stages as dependent measures would appear to be fruitful. Further research is needed to explore the ideal relationship between self, subject, and student focus. Do the individuals who move sooner into the student focus stage become more effective teachers sooner? Do effective in-service teachers differ in some observable ways from their less effective peers on the self–subject–student progression? How long does it take a teacher to achieve this effectiveness? Most related research has involved preservice teachers, and that important research certainly should continue. However, examination of the extent to which practicing teachers in the field move through these stages might prove to be a valuable area of research.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that movement through the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022429412474314">Fuller and Bown (1975)</xref> stages is not a linear event; students do not necessarily progress steadily through each stage (i.e., once they show a focus on students, they no longer focus on self). Instead they may exist in all three stages simultaneously with emphases changing with circumstances. Fuller and Bown conceived their stages as hierarchical. Others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022429412474314">P. Conway &amp; Clark, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022429412474314">Watzke, 2007</xref>) have questioned the hierarchical nature of concerns-based stages, noting that focus on concerns has the potential to “dissipate into an excessive focus on resolving teacher candidates’ immediate and urgent survival concerns” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022429412474314">P. Conway &amp; Clark, 2003</xref>, p. 467), and recommend an increased focus on both concerns and aspirations (what a teacher wants or plans to do in a given situation). Qualitative research examining individual student movement within the stages of concern (whether defined as concerns and/or aspirations) might result in valuable insights for researchers and for the young music teachers themselves.</p>
<p>Our students were asked to self-report perceived concerns on the basis of, presumably, their current thoughts about student teaching or their recent post–student teaching memories. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022429412474314">Campbell and Thompson (2007)</xref> approached the Fuller stages differently, using a prepared list of teaching statements, and elicited different results. They found that unlike previous research and unlike our current findings, their participants indicated the most concerns about students. Note that authors of other studies in this line of research asked students to respond to either video of themselves teaching or their memories of what had just happened in the classroom. Thus they were not considering how they <italic>might</italic> respond; they were considering how they <italic>did</italic> respond. That difference, as pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022429412474314">Berg and Miksza (2010)</xref>, might explain the differences in results. One might speculate that Campbell and Thompson’s students may have responded the way they “were supposed to” or “how they thought they might.” If so, the Campbell and Thompson test might be particularly useful as a diagnostic test of whether teaching is an appropriate career choice. Additional studies comparing the same teachers on free-response prompts with their ratings of prepared teaching statements would appear to be a useful future step.</p>
<p>The question remains as to whether prospective teachers can be (or should be) taught earlier to become less self-oriented and more student oriented as part of their socialization into teaching. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022429412474314">Miksza and Austin (2010)</xref> observed high school students move through the predicted stages of concern during structured teaching opportunities, so age is apparently not the issue. Actually teaching students, rather than agreeing or disagreeing with hypothetical statements, may be a deciding factor. We instituted a learner-centered, need-to-know, hands-on program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429412474314">Killian &amp; Dye, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022429412474314">Raiber, Teachout, Killian, Dye, Vandehey, 2009</xref>) with our undergraduates in the early part of the nine semesters that encompassed this study. We had hoped to examine possible earlier growth through Fuller stages by comparing the pre–student teaching concerns of students before and after the inauguration of our curricular changes. For example, students early in the years under consideration had fewer peer teaching experiences than those in later years. We speculated that students fully immersed in a student-centered curriculum with significant peer teaching experiences as opposed to traditional lecture components might move from self-focus to student focus more quickly and in greater numbers. We did not find this to be the case, perhaps because individual concerns appeared to be extremely idiosyncratic. In addition, the varying numbers of student teachers per semester (6 to 33) yielded such different frequencies of data per category that reliable comparisons among semesters was not possible. Thus, we reported only composite descriptive data rather than semester-by-semester data in the present study.</p>

<sec id="section13-0022429412474314">
<title>Emerging Categories</title>
<p>The categories that emerged from the 867 comments demonstrated some distinct differences between student teachers before and after student teaching and perhaps allow important insights into the internal lives of student teachers. Most frequent pre–student teaching concerns included applying knowledge and techniques, discipline, cooperating teacher relationships, teacher and professional role, confidence (89% indicated a distinct lack of confidence), and procedures.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022429412474314">Madsen and Kaiser (1999b)</xref> examined comments from student teachers just prior to student teaching; thus the results, more than a decade apart, might be comparable. All of the most frequently mentioned concerns for our current study appeared among the most frequent comments in the Madsen and Kaiser study with one exception. The earlier study indicated that the second most frequent comment involved failure or not being cut out for teaching (10% of outstanding teachers and 21% of good teachers). Among our pre–student teaching students, only a single student mentioned concerns with not being cut out for teaching. This result may be a difference in the student population from a decade ago, or it may be the result of the intensive peer and practicum teaching sessions our students experienced, since our previous research indicated that this curriculum led to increased personal confidence among our teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429412474314">Killian &amp; Dye, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429412474314">2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022429412474314">Kelly’s (2000)</xref> results, our pre–student teachers were less frequently concerned with nonteaching duties, although 7% of our post–student teachers mentioned administrative duties. In additional comparisons to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022429412474314">Madsen and Kaiser (1999b)</xref>, our pre–student teachers displayed a few more concerns about time (4% worried about enough podium time and getting to work on time), other (4% had individual problems involving money, car troubles, family missing them), jobs (3%), balance between personal life and teaching (2%), respect (2%), health (1%), and appearance (1%). Thus, in aggregate, these types of personal concerns involved 17% of our total responses, indicating perhaps a greater focus on personal issues. By way of contrast, these types of concerns were categorized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022429412474314">Madsen and Kaiser (1999b)</xref> as “miscellaneous” and composed only 1% of outstanding-teacher and 4% of good-teacher concerns. This single area of difference might be worth further exploration as a possible generational difference with the decade-long gap between studies.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the post–student teaching concerns were different in both content and quantity from pre–student teaching concerns. Most frequently mentioned concerns from those who had completed their student teaching included applying knowledge and techniques (32%), being cut out for teaching (95% positive comments), discipline, confidence (87% positive), information about students, administrative duties, growth as a teacher, and advice to new student teachers. Apparently, post–student teachers had solved their initial concerns about relationships with their cooperating teachers, their teacher and professional roles, procedures, failure, jobs, balancing personal and professional life, communicating, and their professional appearance. The list of issues of less concern after student teaching perhaps allows insight into the importance of the student teaching semester, how much learning occurs during this time, and how potentially stressful the unknowns of student teaching might be to those about to enter what is for most the final semester prior to beginning their careers as certified music educators.</p>
<p>Conclusions for this study were based on a fairly large sample (ultimately 159 student teachers made 867 comments), but all participants were from a single music education program, and all were asked to self-report on the basis of two single snapshots in time. All students experienced the same program, and all were fully certified to teach on the basis of their progress through that program. However, no effort was made to control for differences in personal teaching effectiveness, conversation during the meetings in which data were gathered, comments from respected peers, diversity and quality of student teaching placements, helpfulness of cooperating teachers, and other unforeseen differences. It also should be noted that as is true of all free-response measures, responses might have been affected by unknown external factors, such as memory, current focus of thought, trivial or important concerns, or other unknown factors. Notice that the semantic difference between pre– and post–student teaching prompts also may have influenced results. The first prompt asked for concerns or questions; the second instead surveyed gained knowledge. In addition, the fact that we separated each sentence or phrase into individual entries may have allowed students who answered in more detail to have more influence. Thus, generalizations should be drawn with care.</p>
<p>A further challenge in synthesizing the results of teacher development studies involves the frequent use of a wide variety of categories. Seldom does a study use the same categories, with some notable exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022429412474314">Kelly, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022429412474314">Madsen &amp; Kaiser, 1999b</xref>). Even authors of carefully designed studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022429412474314">Austin &amp; Miksza, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022429412474314">Berg &amp; Miksza, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022429412474314">Henninger &amp; Scott, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022429412474314">Miksza &amp; Austin, 2010</xref>) either define categories differently or, as was the case in our study, find that responses represent differing categories. Eventually it might be useful to researchers and to those involved with music teacher preparation to agree on a list of categories of interest for further research and further curricular development.</p>
<p>Future research should include study of longitudinal development during student teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022429412474314">Berg &amp; Miksza, 2010</xref>) rather than only before and after, as well analysis of development of music educators currently teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022429412474314">Duke, 1994</xref>). There are 80 students for whom we can identify pre– and post–student teaching responses, the majority of whom, at least according to our records, are now employed as music educators. Future study thus might include asking these individuals to react to their student teaching concerns and comments from their new perspective as practicing music educators, allowing us to examine individual development rather than aggregate data as was done with this study.</p>
<p>The vital question of how best to transform good students into effective music educators remains, and determining how best to develop research that explores this question in a careful, structured, data-based manner becomes even more important. This type of research truly matters to our profession as we thoughtfully prepare the next generation of music educators. Comments from student teachers exemplify the remarkable growth gained during the single semester of student teaching: “I am now a teacher, an inspirer, a planner for my specific students.” Another simply summarized: “I love teaching.”</p>
