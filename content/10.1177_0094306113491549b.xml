<p>Many scholars ponder the persistent gap in occupational attainment along racial lines, even among those black and white adults who have attended college. Much of the economic gains made by white workers is attributed to the fields where they secure employment, mostly in the private sector, while many educated black women and men continue to be found in education, social work, and welfare: service work that is either non-profit or state supported, or they are in race specific divisions of the corporate world. They are also engaged in entrepreneurial pursuits that translate into small offices or practices in law, medicine, dentistry, architecture, and funeral parlors. We see the legacy of centuries of injustice. In <italic>Opting Out: Losing the Potential of America’s Young Black Elite</italic>, Maya Beasley raises questions as to why these patterns persist, when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 quickly approaches its 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary.</p>
<p>To examine orientations towards careers, Beasley interviewed 60 college juniors, men and women, 30 black and 30 white, attending either the University of California, Berkeley or Stanford during the 2002–2003 academic year to examine the role of race. Given the prestige of both institutions, Beasley expected that students would graduate with the highest of aspirations, but she found that the majority of the black students planned to follow established patterns, while only a minority considered occupations where African Americans are not well represented, like consulting, computer programming, and banking. In contrast, white students’ occupational goals do not appear to be limited in such ways. Beasley would like to see more minority students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, where their numbers would be appreciated and it might decrease the racial earnings deficit.</p>
<p>Beasley presents the history of segregation, both on the macro level in terms of denial of access to education and limited occupational mobility, and the micro level as black middle-class parents faced racism in their own lives, often in the form of blocked mobility. These parents actively communicate to their children the indignities of restrictions, thus influencing the next generation to shun work where they anticipate significant racism. In terms of her theoretical grounding, Beasley introduces many threads, but misses the opportunity to really explore her data. There is a long list of “factors” but they are not integrated, making it hard to frame the issue for readers. She recognizes failures of many intervention programs, such as Affirmative Action, which produces pessimism within the black community as they face the new racism. She comments that there is no clear mobilization around the new racism because there is “no consensus within the black community of how to prioritize and organize against the complex obstacles facing African Americans” (p. 35).</p>
<p>Given the complexity of the transition from education to employment, Beasley does fault young African Americans who are attending elite institutions but not “stepping up to the plate” to do their part in the larger scheme of diversifying occupations—and perhaps in the process, raising the aggregate level of earnings. There are ways that universities fail, in programming but also in encouraging self-segregation. Students’ comments reveal that their images of work are from family and friends, with very limited work experiences, which means that those in the middle class, particularly white students, have more cultural and social capital that translates into futures that they can better see and perhaps actually achieve. Their comments are important in recognizing how removed this generation is from work. In her introduction, Beasley suggests that she is looking at black students from more middle-class backgrounds. However, there are many black scholarship students in her sample who lack material and cognitive support from their families. Thus the sample is more complex than initially promised and does introduce new variables, because the white and black students are really not matched in terms of social class and the wealth gap is significant.</p>
<p>To understand black youth’s views on work, Beasley gives attention to the racial composition of their social networks in college, linking occupation aspiration with either segregated or integrated social groups. Beasley cites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113491549">Tatum’s (1997)</xref> work, but does not incorporate Tatum’s research on how minority and majority students pass through different stages of racial identity in college. The students’ own comments might be readily identified as at either the immersion or internalization stage. Her analysis could attend more to the complexity of this stage in life for young people, especially coming of age in elite institutions, where comments from the white students indicate that only a few are cognizant of their own racial privileges. Beasley discusses stereotype threat as an intervening factor in how black students avoid the “hard stuff.” This concept, generally used to refer to specific events, like tests or performances, could be more integrated with security with one’s racial identity, which could act as a buffer for students facing a stereotype threat. Greater attention to work on racial identity would enhance this research as well as put the experiences of college juniors in a different perspective, as their thinking about careers is not mature—nor can we assume that voiced intentions have anything to do with occupational outcomes.</p>
<p>Beasley’s chapter on the role of the university focused mostly on the racial composition of support networks and linking “segregated” networks with hyper-attention to race and career choices that subsequently follow. There is little coverage of the academic component of the university. However, in the conclusion she does fault the universities for a lack of STEM programming. In terms of career paths, I find that students gravitate toward majors and disciplines where they feel welcomed. Faculty play a huge role here, not just in social interactions with students in their offices, but the shaping of how to teach subject matter, including the structuring of assignments that can encourage students to work together, as in problem-based learning activities. In her push for black students to enter new fields, many of which are STEM-related, Beasley gives little attention to either students’ own talents or how STEM courses might be taught. She does present many threads for investigations, but fails to really integrate them theoretically. However, her book is useful for others because she highlights racism in many forms and the role it plays in young people’s thinking about careers. In considering the career choices of any group, scholars can think seriously about what work means for individuals—including the core values involved in pursuing paid employment that addresses racial injustice. We can be more nuanced in our attention to how work is not just about diversifying occupations and earnings, but addressing a core sense of self for individuals.</p>
