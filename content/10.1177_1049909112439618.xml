<abstract>
<p>Palliative care is somewhat of a new field in medicine. A field which requires within it an intricate understanding of disease and its prognostic indicators. A field which considers the patient as a whole with the goal of patient-directed care. And a field which necessitates as much medicine as it does art. However, Palliative Care is often consulted by intensivists and primary teams during the last moments of life. And although we can be helpful during this time, we can be of more assistance when incorporated earlier by providing not only end-of-life care, but enhanced pain and symptomatic management, elucidating goals of care, as well as affording patients and their families with emotional, spiritual, and psychosocial support. Our expertise can be useful in all patients, not just the dying.</p>

<p>In palliative medicine, rarely are we surprised or caught off guard. Chronic diseases have their diagnoses, diagnoses have their prognoses, and prognoses have their concomitant signs and symptoms. Although we may not be able to foretell with exact conviction the time or duration of a disease, we can distinguish with fair certainty the course of decline and the symptoms which will lead us on the path of deterioration. Rarely are we shocked with the eventual outcome. However, it has become the standard in many hospitals (this author’s included) to consult palliative care only when the light at the end of the tunnel has dimmed for the physician and perhaps become more visible to the patient.</p>
<p>Since the dawn of palliative medicine, the overwhelming notion has been to consult the service at the last moments of life; when all hope has failed and all medications rendered useless. More often than not, the requesting team does not seek our advice on how to alleviate pain and suffering, but how to relay to the patient and/or the family the grim news and to convince them to let hope go.</p>
<p>Recently, I have come to wonder whether palliative care is actually called in order to alleviate the pain and suffering of the primary team; to help the physicians cope with the fact that their patient will die and provide them with yet another modality of patient care so as to remedy their feelings of helplessness. Or, are we merely to be the bearers of bad news to help deliver information that no one else wants to?</p>
<p>Yet are physicians to blame? We have spent years being indoctrinated on how to treat diseases and prolong life. Thousands of sleepless hours learning and practicing the science of medicine. We have become genetically engineered to withstand pain, agony, and even death in order to extend the mere potential for life. Darwin must certainly be proud.</p>
<p>During the course of my fellowship at the University of Texas, I have seen hundreds of patients and countless families. Yet for the most part, my role has been limited to tending and caring for them toward the end of their lives—when all hope has disintegrated and all other options exhausted. My task is to deliver bad news and remain in the room until all questions are answered and a decision is made to forego further aggressive care.</p>
<p>But this should not be the case. Palliative medicine is more than just a last-minute consult to make amends. We are not the opposition. We are not the antiphysician. Nor are we the latter between the time-old struggle of good versus evil, hope versus despair, or life versus death. We are all on the same side.</p>
<p>Moreover, a fundamental understanding of what palliative care can provide is vital in order to afford patients not only with self-empowered options but also with long-term management of their chronic illnesses—regardless of their course of treatment.</p>
<p>Perhaps this notion can best be made clear by looking at 2 actual cases. Both of these patients were consulted by the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) during their last hours of life. Both had vastly different admission diagnoses, yet their outcomes were identical. Upon reading the 2 scenarios, ask yourself whether palliative care could have done more than just deliver the bad news and attain the do not resuscitate orders.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049909112439618">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>A 76-year-old man with a past medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome with evolvement to full chronic myelogenous leukemia not responsive to chemotherapy and progressive neuromuscular disease for more than 4 years, who is dependant in all activities of daily living (ADLs), presented to the emergency department (ED) and was transferred to the MICU for chronic hypercapnic/hypoxic respiratory failure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1049909112439618">
<title>Case 2</title>
<p>A 56-year-old man, with a past medical history of depression and bipolar disorder, presented to the ED with right-hand cellulitis after getting into an argument and punching a tree with his bare fist.</p>
<p>Case 1 is clearly that of an individual with chronic and deteriorating health. This is a textbook example where palliative care can be of limitless assistance if utilized early: in establishing goals of care, helping with symptomatic management such as physical pain control, shortness of breath, air hunger, and providing emotional, spiritual, and psychosocial support throughout the patient’s entire battle with his or her disease. Thereby, granting a patient-first approach to care.</p>
<p>Case 2 is a bit more complicated and one where we may not automatically come to think of palliative care—especially if we only assimilate palliative care with end-of-life care. This too is a perfect scenario where palliative care can provide endless support in all avenues of care when consulted early. Let us consider the story a bit further. Our patient was initially admitted from the ED to the general medical wards for management of his cellulitis. Within 24 to 36 hours, his cellulitis had progressed to necrotizing fasciitis requiring amputation of his entire right arm. Thereafter, septic shock developed requiring intubation, mechanical ventilation, and subsequent admission to the MICU. Within 24 hours of intubation, the patient had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with 100% oxygen demand and a progressively worsening prognosis. Aggressive management was continued throughout the entire process with pressor support and broad-spectrum antibiotics, yet he continued to deteriorate and eventually became unresponsive to stimuli. The decision was made with the family for terminal extubation and only then was palliative care consulted.</p>
<p>One can certainly not be expected to predict this patient’s severe and aggressive course of disease right from admission. But once things became a bit more complicated, palliative care should have been involved. We could have assisted with elucidating goals of care, providing symptomatic management, including enhanced pain control, and providing the patient and his family (he had young children) with emotional, spiritual, and psychosocial support—irrespective of the decision to pursue aggressive management and fight for a full recovery.</p>
<p>In the end, this patient died because we were unsuccessful in treating his disease, yet we also failed to treat him as a person. We failed to see him as a father and a husband. We saw him only as necrotizing fasciitis with ventilator-dependent ARDS, thereby aggressively managed his disease and not his person.</p>
<p>Palliative care is somewhat of a new field in medicine. A field which requires within it an intricate understanding of disease and its prognostic indicators. A field which considers the patient as a whole with the goal of patient-directed care. And a field which necessitates as much medicine as it does art. Our expertise can be useful in all patients—the likely as well as the unlikely.</p>
