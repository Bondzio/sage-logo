Participants included 978 mothers of preschool-age children who were interviewed about their home environment and screened for maternal depression. <italic>Results</italic>. Whereas only 5.7% scored at high depressive levels on the screen, another 21.3% scored at low depressive levels. Logistic regression analyses controlling for demographics revealed that children were significantly more likely to experience home safety risks in 6 of 7 areas when mothers reported either low or high levels of depressive symptoms. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. Results suggest that children whose mothers experience even low-level depressive symptoms are at increased risk for safety problems in the home environment, pointing to the need for screening and interventions to reduce the risk of injury.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Maternal depression is considered a worldwide public health problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812473776">1</xref></sup> An estimated 1 in 10 US children experience maternal depression each year,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812473776">2</xref></sup> with higher rates among low-income populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812473776">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812473776">4</xref></sup> Maternal depression is a significant risk factor for poor child outcomes across a range of domains,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812473776">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812473776"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812473776"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812473776"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812473776">9</xref></sup> in part because of the negative impact of depression on maternal sensitivity, responsiveness, and other aspects of parenting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812473776">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812473776"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812473776">12</xref></sup> Recent studies indicate that depressed mothers are less likely to institute basic safety and preventive care practices such as using electrical outlet covers, car safety seats, smoke alarms, or the back-to-sleep position,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812473776">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812473776">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812473776">14</xref></sup> though the research is not entirely consistent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812473776">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Studies of the impact of maternal depression on the safety and preventive care practices of mothers have grouped mothers with and without clinically elevated depressive symptoms based on their depression screening results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812473776">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812473776">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812473776">14</xref></sup> However, we are not aware of studies that have examined the impact of subthreshold depressive symptoms on parenting safety practices. At what point do maternal depressive symptoms exert a negative impact on the capacity for parenting? Must depressive symptoms rise above the threshold needed for diagnostic purposes or a cutpoint on a screener that suggests risk for clinical depression? Specifically, the purpose of our study was to identify differences in child safety practices among low-income mothers with no depressive symptoms, low-level depressive symptoms, and high-level depressive symptoms, as measured by a brief screening instrument, the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812473776">16</xref></sup> Our study advances our understanding of depression by examining levels of symptoms and by addressing a wider array of safety issues than in previous studies, including risks related to child supervision and violence exposure. The study is strengthened by the assessment protocol: we gathered data in home visits where safety issues could be readily identified or confirmed rather than through telephone interviews, as in past research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0009922812473776" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Data collection occurred during home visits to mothers whose children were enrolled in Head Start programs in a Southern state. Head Start is a federally funded, 2-generational program serving low-income (100% of poverty or below) families and children aged 3 to 5 in preschool settings. Head Start agencies are mandated to reduce the impact of risks to healthy child development through the use of educational services, supportive interventions, and referrals to community services. To this end, Head Start performance standards require home visits during the school year, during which staff identify family goals related to the welfare of the child and family.</p>
<sec id="section3-0009922812473776">
<title>Instrument: The Family Map</title>
<p>The primary data collection tool was The Family Map, a semistructured interview developed to assess key aspects of the family and home environment associated with well-being in children aged 3 to 5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812473776">17</xref></sup> The Family Map systematically identifies areas of concern and strength so providers can design interventions to reduce risk conditions or enhance conditions associated with healthy development. The measure was designed for compatibility with Head Start home visits, but it is also appropriate for use with any family that has children aged 3 to 5.</p>
<p>The Family Map is organized into modules that target components of family life that research indicates are critical for child well-being, such as Home and Car Safety or Surveillance and Personal Safety. Each module assesses multiple aspects of risk associated with basic child safety (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812473776">Table 1</xref>). Risk areas are usually assessed with 3 or fewer items. They have good reliability and are usually based on well-known instruments. Each item or scale representing a possible risk area is coded (<italic>risk</italic> = 1, <italic>no risk</italic> = 0). Information about validity, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency support the Family Map.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812473776">17</xref></sup></p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The Family Map was implemented in a Southern state, in 20 Head Start centers (53 classrooms) located in a metropolitan area and in 6 centers (17 classrooms) serving families living in a micropolitan area (population &lt; 50 000). A teacher conducted a Family Map interview with a child’s primary caregiver, usually the mother, during a home visit 2 months after the child began attending Head Start. The Family Map developers trained teachers to conduct interviews through video examples and discussions of each item emphasizing nonjudgmental interview techniques, the impact of the home and parenting environment on children, and how to use the identified risks to suggest family goals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0009922812473776">
<title>Analysis Plan</title>
<p>Analyses using SPSS compared mothers with no depressive symptoms, those with low-level depressive symptoms (a score of 1 or 2 on the PHQ-2), and those with high-level depressive symptoms (a score of 3 or more on the PHQ-2) to identify differences in child safety risks. Specifically, in the first set of analyses, we used χ<sup>2</sup> tests to investigate the degree to which maternal depressive symptoms are associated with an increased likelihood of risk for the child at the bivariate level. To control for family demographics, in the second set of analyses, we used a series of logistic regression models to investigate the differences in risk for children of mothers with no symptoms compared with mothers with low or high symptoms. Control variables included maternal race/ethnicity, employment status, number of children in the home, level of maternal education, the presence of another adult in the home, and child gender.</p>

For simplicity of language, we will refer to these mothers as having <italic>high</italic> symptoms. Another 198 mothers (21.3% of the sample) had scores of 1 or 2, and we will refer to these mothers as having <italic>low</italic> symptoms. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812473776">Table 2</xref> includes the depression screening items and the percentage of caregivers that endorsed each response option.</p>

<title>Comparison of Child Safety Risk Exposure for Maternal Depression Groups (No Symptom, Low Symptom, and High Symptom)</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812473776">Figure 1</xref> shows the result of the first set of analyses and indicates that children whose mothers had low or high symptoms of depression were more likely to experience risks than children whose mothers had no symptoms of depression. In these bivariate analyses, there were significant group differences in 6 of 7 specific risk areas, and children whose mothers showed low or high symptoms of depression were more at risk than when the mother had no symptoms. For example, 36.8% of children whose mothers had no symptoms of depression had access to poisons in the home, compared with 50.3% with low-symptom mothers and 60.4% with high-symptom mothers: χ<sup>2</sup> = (2, 924) = 20.12; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001. The only area where there was not a significant difference was in percentage of children at risk because of fire safety issues: χ<sup>2</sup> = (2, n = 907) = 1.64; <italic>P</italic> = .44.</p>

<p>Next, we used a series of logistic regression models to investigate differences in risk for children of mothers with no, low, or high symptoms of depression while controlling for family demographics. The resulting odds ratios (ORs) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812473776">Table 1</xref> show significantly increased risk in 6 of the 7 risk areas associated with both low and high levels of maternal depression. When mothers had low-level symptoms of depression, children were generally at a little less than twice the risk for problems in the risk areas related to home and car safety (vehicle safety, secondhand smoke, etc) compared with children of no-symptom mothers. Furthermore, they were at more than twice the risk for problems related to violence exposure (OR = 2.53; confidence interval [CI] = [1.57, 4.09]; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). When mothers had high symptoms of depression, children were generally 2.5 to 3 times more likely to have safety risks compared with children of mothers with no symptoms. The difference between the groups was most striking for access to dangerous objects in the home: OR = 3.64; CI = [1.90, 6.94]; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In our study, few mothers (5.7%) screened positive for depression based on the traditional cutpoint on the PHQ-2 when administered in a home visit with their children’s preschool teachers. However, another 21.3% of mothers reported symptoms of depression that fell below the cut. Combining the 2 groups, these rates are comparable with other studies of this population, such as the Head Start FACES study, which found depression rates of 25%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812473776">3</xref></sup> This is also consistent with results reported by Olson and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812473776">19</xref></sup> from screening implemented at pediatric well-child visits, in which 6% of mothers scored at risk for major depression, and 17% had 1 symptom. It is possible that the interview format resulted in fewer positive screens because prior studies have shown that the written format produces more positive screening results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812473776">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Consistent with past studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812473776">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812473776">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812473776">14</xref></sup> we found that mothers’ depressive symptoms negatively affected their use of basic safety practices with their preschool-age children, such as using car seats and keeping poisons and dangerous objects out of reach. Based on anecdotal evidence from the data collection staff, we feel that collecting these data in the context of a home visit increased the validity of our findings because mothers were able to examine safety issues in the home with the data collector when they were unsure of the answer. (For example, some mothers asked the child if they were able to reach a dangerous object such as a knife and were surprised to find it within the child’s reach.) Extending prior studies, we also found that mothers with depressive symptoms were less likely to consistently monitor their children at all times, by leaving them in the bathtub unattended or by being outside while the child was inside or the reverse. Furthermore, children whose mothers had depressive symptoms were more likely to be exposed to violence, drug use, or sexual activities compared with mothers with no symptoms.</p>
<p>A key finding of our study is that the risk for children was increased even when the mother reported low-level depressive symptoms (below the recommended cutpoint on the PHQ-2). This suggests that while the cutpoint of 3 may provide the ideal balance of sensitivity and specificity in identifying major depression, the presence of any symptoms may be a concern from a parenting perspective. This is consistent with past research, which suggests that subthreshold depression, when defined as below the diagnostic threshold for a depressive disorder, can be associated with substantial impairment in work and life functioning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922812473776">21</xref></sup> The relationship between depressive symptoms and child risk may be linear in nature, with increases in depressive symptoms associated with similar increases in problems with monitoring and safety.</p>
<p>We should note that more than half of our sample is African American, and all were residing in a Southern state. We cannot say whether the relationships that we found between depressive symptoms and child safety would generalize to families of all cultures, and future studies should address this issue with a range of cultures.</p>
<p>Health supervision guidelines for anticipatory guidance and preventive care now include more behavioral and emotional topics to be addressed with families during well-child care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812473776">22</xref></sup> and pediatricians have an important role to play in identifying depressed mothers and their children and facilitating treatment. However, there are still psychosocial, emotional, and behavioral needs that go undiagnosed and/or untreated among young patients and their families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922812473776">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922812473776">24</xref></sup> Given the limited time available during a health supervision visit, it is understandable that whereas more than half of pediatricians surveyed agree that it is their responsibility to recognize maternal depression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922812473776">25</xref></sup> many do not screen for it regularly or consistently. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating a maternal depression screening into well-child care visits and visits with mothers of young children. Whereas a great deal of focus has been given to postpartum screening, our results are consistent with past research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812473776">13</xref></sup> in suggesting that screening should continue during the early childhood period. Several valid screening options exist, including the 2-item brief screening option,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812473776">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922812473776">26</xref></sup> which may be useful to physicians with time constraints. Olson and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812473776">19</xref></sup> have demonstrated the feasibility of implementing the brief screening option during well-child care visits in pediatric clinics.</p>
<p>Screening may be especially critical for low-income women, given their increased risk for depression and the overwhelming evidence that poverty is associated with less optimal child outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922812473776">27</xref></sup> The National Center for Children in Poverty recommends that communities address maternal depression as a barrier to healthy development and school readiness with specific strategies, one of which is brief screening and follow-up of pregnant women and parents of infants and young children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922812473776">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many physicians may feel ill prepared by their training to diagnose and treat psychosocial problems, including maternal depression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922812473776">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922812473776">29</xref></sup> but there is evidence that mothers are open to screening for their health issues, including depression and receiving referrals if needed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922812473776">30</xref></sup> Olson and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812473776">19</xref></sup> reported that 20.6% of mothers with subthreshold symptoms and 47.2% of mothers with high-level symptoms reported thinking that they might be depressed and were willing to take action. Their results also supported the feasibility of pediatricians taking actions to support the family, including discussing the impact on the child and referring the mother for treatment if needed.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that even low-level depressive symptoms in mothers are associated with safety risks for children. Screening and interventions are needed to prevent unintentional child injury and ensure the safety of children affected by maternal depression. Future studies should examine this issue from a longitudinal perspective to help us more fully understand the long-term impact on the child.</p>
