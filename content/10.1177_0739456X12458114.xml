<p>With interest in sustainability and sustainable development growing worldwide, related scholarship in architectural, engineering, and planning fields is finding a growing audience, especially in interdisciplinary contexts. Responding to this growing interest, the Wessex Institute of Technology offers a collection of seventy short papers written by international authors and selected from several of the institution’s many conferences. While the book does not specify which meetings contributed to the collection, the papers may have originated from the April 2010 Eco-Architecture and The Sustainable City conferences held in A Coruña, Spain; the May 2010 Urban Transport conference held in Cyprus; the July 2010 Sustainable Tourism conference held in New Forest, United Kingdom; and the July 2010 Waste Management conference held in Tallinn, Estonia. The collection is grouped into five sections reflecting each of these conference titles. For ease of discussion, this reviewer has grouped each section’s papers by topic area.</p>
<p>The first and largest section contains twenty-three papers exploring the sustainable city in various international settings. Three papers explore sustainable buildings, including a proposal to improve architectural design by including material and life cycle assessments, an engineering experiment investigating a solar-powered desert home in Egypt, and a combined water treatment system pilot test in the United Kingdom. Three additional papers explore transportation topics, including reviews of pedestrian behavior in Portugal, the European Union’s sustainable mobility plans, especially in Portugal, Spain, and France, and the French high speed rail and regional service system. A third group of papers explores sustainability from a social or historical perspective. Such topics include the impact of political factors on sustainability in seventy-eight Spanish cities, the relationship between refugee actions and refugee camp conditions in Nigeria, public–private partnership practices internationally, noise pollution and public participation in Hungary, the historical role of urban public spaces in four cities (Venice, Italy; Venice Canals, California; Savannah, Georgia; and Folegandros, Greece), and the value of two historic sites in Turkey.</p>
<p>The largest and final group of papers in the sustainable city section explores sustainable development in a broader context. Two papers propose new indices, one measuring urban center vitality in South Africa, the other improving urban–rural categorization in Spain. Other papers support university-led urban gentrification in Miami, Florida; review the BREEAM Community program’s prospects in the Spanish context; and discuss temporary land use as a community transformation approach in the United States. Several additional papers focus on development in Asia, including a case study of urban development outside Bangkok, an engineering review of water resources in Taiwan, a neural network modeling method for projecting housing needs in Malaysia, and a review of tourism infrastructure in three Asian cities: Phnom Penh, Cambodia; Bangkok, Thailand; and Georgetown, Malaysia.</p>
<p>The second and smallest section in the collection contains five papers related to eco-architecture. Two of these papers describe green building retrofit projects in Louisiana and in France while a third describes an eco-housing community design based on local Chinese culture. This section also includes a description of architectural design software under development in Brazil and an exploratory study of traditional Portuguese construction methods.</p>
<p>The third section offers twelve articles exploring waste management–related topics internationally. Unlike most of the collection, this section includes a large number of experimental studies. Wastewater studies account for two papers, one exploring the impact of bacterial additives on septic system performance in Egypt and the other testing alternative solid content measurement techniques in Spain. This section also contains three recycling studies, one testing the effectiveness of agricultural residues as sheep feed in Saudi Arabia, one reclaiming heavy metals from batteries through electrodeposition in Portugal, and one testing enzyme-based x-ray film recycling and silver recovery in India. Two additional experimental studies test sustainable fuel innovations, including the use of vegetable oil to capture and utilize fine coal particles in China and the liquefaction of several Chinese and Japanese wood wastes. In addition to experimental studies, the waste management section contains qualitative reviews. For example, papers in this section include case study reviews of Pakistani and South African solid waste management systems and a review of Malaysian English-language press coverage of waste control and management issues. Other papers include a review of anaerobic digestion of municipal solid waste throughout Europe and a proposal to improve recycling through materials flow and life-cycle assessments.</p>
<p>Section four provides thirteen papers discussing urban transport topics internationally. More than half of the papers included in this section discuss models, methods, and other tools to improve transportation and transportation planning. These papers discuss the following methodological topics: using probabilistic modeling to incorporate urban and human dimensions into transportation planning in Spain; developing a multimodal tool for urban transport development and modeling in Belgium; using fuzzy logic and geographic information systems to select a bus terminal site in Iran; prioritizing road projects using a linear additive model in Saudi Arabia; modeling pricing policy impacts in multimodal transport systems in Italy; modeling Italian road accidents and safety with logistic regression; determining system requirements and evaluating risk through a systematic framework in France; and optimizing traffic signals in Japan using genetic algorithms. Additional papers included in this section explore transportation topics, including a study of traffic from the local government perspective in Portugal, the application of various network theories to Bucharest’s underground transport network, a discussion of new metro–car transitions based on a Paris case, a review of Greek measures to improve road tunnels and safety, and a study of emissions on either side of the automobile restriction ring in Athens.</p>
<p>The fifth and final section explores sustainable tourism through seventeen papers using predominantly qualitative methodologies. Three papers focus on the hospitality industry, identifying factors influencing green hotel construction in Germany, assessing environmental innovation in the Polish hospitality sector, and presenting a technical case study of retrofit options for a tourist lodge in India. An additional eight papers explore sustainable tourism policies and social phenomena. For example, one study reviews sustainable tourism development in Europe while a second studies the impact of tourism on communities in Botswana. Others include a discussion of rural development and governance in Colombia, a focus group study of short-break holiday travel in Australia, and a case study of bicycling in a Mexican city. Several papers focus on the United Kingdom, including a case study of local access forums and stakeholder participation best practices; an exploration of networking, rural tourism, and entrepreneurship; and a study of resistance to food tourism. This section also includes six papers detailing plans and opportunities for sustainable tourism development in Slovenia, Mexico, Nigeria, and Iran.</p>
<p>When taken as a whole, the collection provides a broad sampling of the many varied architectural, engineering, and planning activities that might be considered relevant to sustainability and sustainable development. However, the collection lacks cohesion and editorial clarity. The generic one-page preface provides very little context and the collection lacks introduction or conclusion sections, section summaries, or explanations of the papers’ origins and organization. The preface mentions the importance of interdisciplinary solutions and collaboration, but if intended to highlight interdisciplinary and collaborative research, the collection falls short. While the collection contains a grouping of papers from many disciplines, these papers generally do not describe interdisciplinary or collaborative work and/or work opportunities. The preface also refers to scientists and engineers, but the collection is most likely aimed at practitioners in architectural, engineering, and planning fields.</p>
<p>As a result, the reader struggles to make sense of a collection that does not possess a consistent theme or definition for “sustainability.” Likely derived from several unrelated conferences, the collection contains a very broad range of topics, many of which are only tangentially relevant to the title. Readers looking for a collection of sustainability-related papers may be disappointed. Adding to the confusion, very poor internal organization makes it difficult for readers to locate material of interest. The collection contains a table of contents and is indexed by author, but does not include an index by topic or keyword.</p>
<p>While readers are unlikely to consume the collection in its entirety, they may be interested in individual sections. Nearly all the authors are affiliated with academic institutions, but the collection is more appropriate for practitioners and readers of the technical press. The large and highly eclectic sustainable city section offers a variety of insights for policymakers and practitioners in the urban planning field. The green design and retrofit case studies found in the small eco-architecture section demonstrate several new design ideas for practitioners in the architecture and building rehabilitation fields. The waste management section’s technical experiments and policy reviews would be of most interest to engineers and policy makers, respectively, though academics may also benefit. The urban transport section highlights some new and innovative technical methods and tools along with work on policy-related topics. This section would be of interest to both academics and practitioners in transportation fields. The final eco-tourism section provides knowledge concerning the growth, nature, needs, and opportunities of the eco-tourism sector, mostly for the benefit of related policy makers and practitioners.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this book’s wide topic range and lack of cohesion limits its value as a collection. Sustainable development remains an important research topic, and while the collection’s individual sections provide some insights, academics and practitioners would be better served by more focused literature that highlights high-quality, interdisciplinary work.</p>
