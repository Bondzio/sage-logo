<p>This delightful and well-presented book from Four Courts Press has been produced under the direction of members of ENID (the European Network on the Instruments of Devotion) and had its origins in a five-day workshop held at St Patrick’s College, Thurles, in 2008. ENID is an international network of interdisciplinary researchers interested in the instrumentality of Christian piety and devotional practices from the <italic>devotion moderna</italic> of the 14th century to the reforms of the Second Vatican Council. Scholars come from the areas of theology, musicology, art history, literature, and history and from across Europe. While academic fashions come and mostly go, this study is yet another demonstration if one was still needed of the importance of studying the materiality of religious belief, of carefully attending to the objects used by believers in the practice of their faith. It is precisely this issue of practice that is attended to so well in this present set of essays. Sheridan Gilley in his chapter notes that, ‘One last consideration is that belief needs practice to become ingrained. But what sort of practice? The Mass is primarily an action, not a form of words, with holy silences punctuated by bells. It seems to me a rather Protestant notion that one can only understand a thing by following a text’ (p. 46).</p>
<p>The theme of the book is clearly outlined by the editors in their introduction to the collection of papers: ‘This volume takes as its theme the devotional cultures of European Christianity, from the dawn of the French Revolution to that later revolution which was the Second Vatican Council’ (p. 1). The idea and the timeframe (alerted from the outbreak of the First World War to the 1960s) are borrowed of course from the work of Eric Hobsbawm on the ‘long 19th century.’ The Introduction is succinctly written but is also an excellent theoretical framework for the rest of the book. Both in Roman Catholicism and the Protestant Churches of Northern Europe the devotional world forged at the end of the 18th century persisted or even flourished until the 1960s. The events of the French Revolution are in a sense the roots of the Catholic revival in the 19th century as they spurred lay Catholics into forming and practising a new kind of ritual activity based in the home and led by them in the absence of the clergy. It is also in this period, the editors note, that the status of the papacy was enhanced rather than weakened, contributing to a growing wave of Ultramontanism. It is the paradox of the 19th century that on the one hand religion seems to be in decline with the advancing march of secular thought and practice bolstered by an increasing scepticism and scientific advance; on the other hand, it is the century of papal infallibility in Roman Catholicism and an increasing number of reported Marian apparitions. Rational thought with its critical biblical and historical scholarship sits uneasy with a religious anti-intellectualism. Yet it is this mutual interaction that still requires study and research. In their introductory essay, the editors firmly knock on the head any idea that devotional cultures are top-down inventions, or ‘part of some ultramontane “master plan”, surely misjudges the dynamism within popular piety, which is more than capable of accepting or rejecting devotional innovation on their own merits or usefulness’ (p. 2).</p>
<p>The book is divided into three parts: Part one is entitled Devotional Geographies and is made up of five essays which describe religious and spiritual renewal in various parts of Europe from Norway to Italy; Part two is devoted to Devotions and the Arts and studies of devotional culture in the arts, aspects of sacred music, iconography, and architecture are explored here; Part three is focussed on Devotional Instruments, treating hymnody and religious emblems as ways into considering how religious persons and groups define themselves against an ‘Other.’ From Roman Catholics and Protestants in English hymnody to the use of the Sacred Heart in the Spanish Civil War, this part concludes with a study of religious emblems and cultural identity in Northern Ireland. Extensive use is made of musical examples and photographs, presented in both black and white and colour. Obviously in a book of essays like this, some of the studies are highly specialized and indeed localized; hence the first essay by Arne Bugge Amusden treats the Norwegian pietistic movement and its leader Hans Nielsen Hauge (1771–1824). In Part two of the book one also finds highly specialized studies of Byzantine iconography by Georgios Kordis and medieval revivalism in architecture by Henrik von Achen, while Franz Liszt’s treatment of the Via Crucis is carefully studied by Peter De Mey and David J. Burns.</p>
<p>Sheridan Gilley’s chapter in Part one is rather provocatively entitled ‘Devotions and the Old Rite.’ Starting with the assertion that the vast majority of Roman Catholics in the British Isles in the modern period have been of Irish birth or descent, he explores recent historical research on the Roman Catholic Church in 19th-century Ireland. He begins with the 1972 iconic article of Emmet Larkin which postulated a devotional revolution in post-Famine Irish Catholicism spearheaded by Cardinal Paul Cullen. Using the research of David Miller, Larkin also noted how the norms of religious practices changed after the Famine in terms of Mass attendance and a shift from the home to the church. Gilley notes the importance of the article and how more recent studies have nuanced Larkin’s work, seeing the genesis of the so-called ‘devotional revolution’ much earlier and in the promotion of confraternities and sodalities by Archbishop Troy. Of perhaps even greater note is Gilley’s insistence that the primacy of English devotional literature in this ‘revolution’ leads as much to a process of Anglicization as that of Romanization. Gilley argues for the agency of ordinary laymen and women in this devotional world and cautions against seeing it as a purely or even exclusively as a clerical top-down imposition. Gilley rightly calls for the kind of research pioneered by Eamon Duffy on the late medieval devotional world to be applied to this material. As a liturgist I hesitate to quibble with such a masterly study but Gilley’s assertion that ‘Modern liturgists are accustomed to despise a great deal of this, but in fact this devotional world answers to the modern criteria of accessibility and comprehensibility’ (p. 39), is hard to fathom and would need greater explanation and documentation. The interaction of liturgical celebrations and devotional practices is complex and has changed with a liturgical celebration now ordinarily in the vernacular and calling for active participation from those present. Many of the later chapters build on the work of Gilley or demonstrate his fundamentally correct insights.</p>
<p>If further evidence was required about the vibrancy of devotional cultures, this book produces it in a lavish fashion. The interaction of authority and popular piety, political viewpoints and religious affiliations, and the opposition and yet essential link between the material and the spiritual are all treated and explored by the chapters. The issue of the feminization of religion and increasing Marian devotion and the canonization of female saints are also studied in this fine collection which opens doors to a neglected world and suggests many fruitful areas to be explored in the future.</p>
