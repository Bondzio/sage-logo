<p>Daniel Hucker’s monograph is a valuable addition to current literature. Meticulously researched, this work does far more than survey public opinion. Hucker focuses on how perceptions of public opinion shaped decision-makers’ actions and influenced the policy-making process. As a result, this work gives a valuable insight into the illusive ‘unspoken assumptions’ which shaped foreign policy.</p>
<p>Hucker’s analysis emphasizes a differentiation between reactive and residual public opinion. ‘Residual’ representations of opinion were governed by long-term assumptions and memories, particularly a deep-seated ‘war anxiety’. ‘Reactive’ representations were more current, dictated by immediate reactions to events in 1938–39. In the prelude to Munich, ‘war anxiety’ was the dominant public mood. Residual representations of public opinion were crucial in the decision to appease Germany at Munich. However, initial manifestations of relief were soon superseded, and on both sides of the Channel there was a feeling that this should not happen again. Daladier was more in tune with this mood than Chamberlain and supported a firmer policy. Chamberlain, in contrast, was convinced by the apparently euphoric public reaction to Munich that appeasement was popular and would continue to be so, although even at this stage the Foreign Office was beginning to recognize that public opinion was shifting.</p>
<p>Throughout 1939, Hucker shows a gradual decline in the significance of residual representations informing policy, and their replacement with reactive representations. The Prague coup in the spring marked, not a turning point, but a crucial moment when reactive representations superseded residual ones. Daladier’s response was swiftly to condemn Germany’s actions. He told the French Chamber, ‘As regards foreign policy there is nothing more than to prepare for war’ (134). Daladier’s response not only reflected French public opinion, but also helped strengthen his own domestic position by uniting a previously fractured population. Chamberlain’s response, in contrast, was decidedly lacklustre. He continued to favour appeasement, telling Parliament, ‘Do not let us … be deflected from our cause’ (132). The majority of the British press criticized Chamberlain’s stance, and by the end of March the British government could no longer ignore this. Foreign policy hardened: Poland was guaranteed and conscription introduced. Interestingly, however, once the shock of the Prague coup had dissipated, residual ‘war anxiety’ resurfaced (190). Whilst a minority view, revived residual fears found a voice in articles such as ‘Mourir pour Dantzig’ (<italic>L’Oeuvre</italic>, 4 May 1939) and editorials in the <italic>Times</italic> in early May. Such commentary caused consternation in the Foreign Office, where Harvey and Vansittart feared that Downing Street was manipulating the press to engineer a return to appeasement (162).</p>
<p>A similar complexity in public perceptions muddied the Triple Alliance negotiations. Hucker examines the relationship between residual anti-Bolshevism and immediate desires for an alliance with the USSR to prevent German expansionism. He shows how ‘paradoxically although public opposition to a Soviet alliance was more vocal in France, it was the British who were the most reluctant to vigorously pursue a pact with Moscow’ (193–4). Once more, Hucker criticizes Chamberlain. Growing press support and pressure for a Soviet pact was unable to alter his ‘deep-rooted and institutionalized anti-communism’ (206). Chamberlain was reluctant to respond to the evolution of press opinion, surrounding himself with likeminded people and convincing himself that anti-Bolshevism was widespread within the British political elite. Negotiations with the Soviets stalled over the summer months. When the Nazi–Soviet pact was concluded, the reaction was shock on both sides of the Channel. British and French public opinion was now united. Although isolated figures remained influenced by residual perceptions of public opinion, by September 1939 opinion in both France and Britain recognized that there could no longer be peace with honour. The majority of policy-makers also recognized this.</p>
<p>Hucker’s interpretation of key personalities is of interest throughout. Daladier was more in tune with the development of his country’s public opinion and quicker to stiffen French policy. At times he was skilful in using his foreign policy position to decrease the attractiveness of the extremes in French politics and encourage domestic cohesion. Daladier also used his understanding of British public opinion effectively in his foreign policy towards Britain. For example, in the spring of 1939, Daladier pushed Chamberlain on the issue of conscription as his sources showed that British public opinion was hardening on this question. In contrast, Hucker consistently criticizes Chamberlain for being out of step with the development of British opinion, for example relying excessively on correspondence with his sisters for information.</p>
<p>This book has an excellent bibliography and is rich in archival sources, both British and French. It is well written with strong, fluent analysis throughout. Hucker’s evidence sheds light on foreign policy, particularly the Anglo-French relationship, and, crucially, on the policy-making process. Hucker’s conclusions do not, perhaps, change the traditional view of key politicians isolated and swept along by the tide of events. However, his work reveals the links between the unspoken assumptions shaping foreign policy and the diplomatic process itself. Hucker is thus able to illuminate the organic, multi-faceted nature of foreign policy and policy-making in the crucial months prior to the outbreak of World War II.</p>
