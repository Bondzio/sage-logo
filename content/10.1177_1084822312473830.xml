<p>This article explores the relationship between early childhood moral development and moral dilemmas as it relates to employee training and continuing education in health care organizations. Additionally, this article seeks to explore three intentional strategies (<italic>narratives, bibliotherapy, and the analytical process for problem solving</italic>) to train employees who are faced with moral dilemmas in the health care workplace. How does one arrive at a decision that is “right” and “not wrong”? This article also discusses the importance of moral reasoning within the context of health care organizations.</p>

<p>We used to experience morality as imperatives. The consequences of not doing the right thing were not only social, but deeply emotional and psychological. We couldn’t bear to live with ourselves. Now we experience morality more as a choice that we can always change as circumstances call for it. We tend to personalize our ideals. And what you end up with is a nation of ethical free agents. We’ve moved from a culture of character to a culture of personality. The etymology of the word character is that it’s deeply etched, not changeable in all assorts of circumstances. We don’t want to think of ourselves as transgressive or bad, but we tend to personalize our understanding of the good</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>—said James Davison Hunter, a professor of religion, culture, and social theory at the University of Virginia.</p>
<p>Health care organizations seek to create a seamless garment called a compliance culture. This garment is a contextual framework to guide employees in understanding that every decision they make is cloaked in a fiduciary responsibility of doing what is “right” without regard to having someone looking over their left shoulder on a daily basis. The weave of this garment is created by establishing a set of fundamental core values that health care organizations deem as nonnegotiable. These nonnegotiables are characteristics that have been a built-in part of our personality that starts in early childhood. It is in early childhood that our fundamental and developmental processes between what is right and wrong are established/magnified in later adult life.</p>
<p>Henry Ford reportedly once complained that all he wanted from a worker was a pair of hands but that he had to deal with the whole person instead. Every day each one of us brings a whole self to work, regardless of whether we have a chance to express and actualize ourselves in our jobs.</p>
<p>As much as we might like to believe that we can adapt our personality or our style as needed in a work environment, we are likely to have many of the same strengths and weaknesses in the health care workplace that we have outside of it. Whether we suffer at home or at work from a lack of assertiveness or from too much confidence, whether we are accommodating peacemakers or contentious resisters, or whether we are supportive and empathic or businesslike and formal, who we are in our personal lives is inextricably linked to who we are in the workplace. And who we are in our personal lives and in our professional lives is always a function, at least in part, of our early life experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1084822312473830">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Early childhood research points to the influence of early experiences on later development. This influence could account for negative individual behavior in the context of ethical decision making and therefore reflects on the individual differences that employees bring to the health care workplace, including cognition of what is right and wrong as it relates to fraud, waste, and abuse. Early experiences influence emotionally or affectively charged experiences with other employees or management personnel. These experiences induce and organize the patterns of structural growth that result in the expanding functional capacities of a developing individual.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084822312473830">2</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section1-1084822312473830">
<title>What is Morality?</title>
<p>Morality can be viewed as the “system of rules that regulate the social interactions and social relationships of individuals within societies and is based on concepts of welfare (harm), trust, justice (comparative treatment and distribution) and rights.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084822312473830">3</xref></sup> This is how humans determine their actions based on their cognitive abilities to interpret a social situation.</p>
<p>The study of morality and moral development has always been tied to children’s conceptual development because morality involves reasoning of various kinds. Morality entails understanding behavioral standards, for example, and their applications to personal behavior. Morality involves generalizing content-specific sanctions and rewards into broader rules of conduct. Morality requires understanding others’ needs, desires, and interests and relating them to one’s own. It also requires anticipating the responses of others to one’s actions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1084822312473830">4</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section2-1084822312473830">
<title>Early Theoretical Frameworks</title>
<p>To understand how early experiences influence health care organizational compliance, we must begin with where it all started—early childhood development as it relates to moral development. The author has chosen Piaget and Kohlberg to provide the conceptual framework for this discussion.</p>
<sec id="section3-1084822312473830">
<title>Piaget</title>
<p>The main thrust of Piaget’s theory is that there are discreet stages of mental development, each of which is characterized by a different form of reasoning. Piaget was not primarily concerned with establishing normative data for children; rather, most of his studies revealed as emerging cognitive complexity determined by the child’s own biological growth. He distinguished four stages of intellectual development: sensory motor, preoperational, concrete operations, and formal operations.</p>
<p>Piaget’s (1932/1965)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822312473830">5</xref></sup> description of sociomoral development was expressed as movement from anomy (nonregulation by others or the self) to heteronomy (regulation by others) to autonomy (self-regulation). He described two types of morality corresponding to two types of adult–child relationships, one that he believed to promote children’s development in all domains and one that he believed to retard development.</p>
<p>The first type of morality is a morality of obedience. Piaget called this “heteronomous” morality, reflecting roots meaning “regulation by others.” Therefore, the individual who is heteronomously moral follows moral rules given by others out of obedience to an authority who has coercive power. Heteronomous morality means that the individual does not regulate his or her behavior by means of personal convictions. Rather, his or her activity is regulated by impulse or unthinking obedience.</p>
<p>The second type of morality is autonomous, reflecting roots meaning self-regulation. The individual who is autonomously moral follows moral rules that are self-constructed and self-regulating principles. These rules have a feeling of personal necessity for the individual. The individual who is autonomously moral follows internal convictions about the necessity of respect for persons in relationships with others. On a practical level, employees without belief that rises from personal conviction will not likely follow moral rules that are ready-made by employers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084822312473830">5</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1084822312473830">
<title>Kohlberg</title>
<p>Kohlberg contended that different people make different decisions when confronted with similar ethical situations because they are at different stages of what he termed cognitive moral development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1084822312473830">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Kohlberg’s model of moral development has three stages. In the <italic>preconventional level</italic>, an employee would be acting out of fear of punishment. In agencies and organizational settings, employees act ethically only out of fear that they will be caught and punished. The ramification of this stage of moral development is that if there is no realistic fear of being caught, unethical behavior might become common. The employee who is functioning on this level does not understand why his or her behavior is moral or immoral, because morality is not really part of his or her vocabulary. The uncomfortable emotions that are triggered by offending one’s own moral code are simply not available, having yet to be integrated into one’s personality. Behavior that is tolerated becomes more common unless a cost is imposed on it and, at this stage, the personal cost paid is only weighed against the benefit gained.</p>
<p>Kohlberg’s second stage of moral development is the <italic>conventional level.</italic> Employees at this level conform their behavior to the expectations of the groups to which they belong. If the group deems the action to be ethical then the employee will follow the group without an independent evaluation of the situation. Some current examples are the Wall Street investment companies, Stanley Morgan, Anderson, and Goldman Sachs, and other corporate environments where certain behaviors were acceptable and followed because they were part of the organizational and compliance culture.</p>
<p>Kohlberg’s third stage of moral development is the <italic>postconventional level.</italic> At this level, an employee understands the reasoning behind a particular moral principle. There is a voluntary acceptance of the principles; moral principles become intrinsic to the individual. At this level, an employee would make independent judgments of particular ethical dilemmas. Health care agency decisions would not necessarily be followed simply out of a sense of loyalty or group expectations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084822312473830">7</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section5-1084822312473830">
<title>Other Considerations</title>
<p>There are two other considerations or philosophical constructs the writer would like for you to consider within the context of this discussion, namely, <italic>utilitarianism</italic> and <italic>deontology</italic>. Utilitarianism is the belief that “an action is morally right when that action produces more total utility for the group as a consequence than any other alternative does.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084822312473830">8</xref></sup> The goal of utilitarianism is often stated as the greatest good for the greatest number.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1084822312473830">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Deontology focuses purely on the intrinsic rightness of an action, without regard for its consequences. Deontologists believe in the absolute necessity of duty, irrespective of the rewards or punishments that may follow. Along these lines, Immanuel Kant insisted that two concepts are necessary for consistent behavior, namely, human reasoning and goodwill. He defined goodwill as the will that obeys the universal law. Kant’s Categorical Imperative requires people to always act in such a way that they can, at the same time, wish that everyone would act in that way. Deontologists view that moral actions are always rational actions, so the primary value of these imperatives is to provide a way to reason with the question of, “What is right?” In practice, this can be achieved by applying the maxim: “If everyone did this, would it be okay?” Deontology is not unlike virtue ethics, in the sense that as a moral theory its goal is for everyone to act virtuously at all times. The question that arises is whether it supports the minimum conditions for mortality, in particular responsibility, concern for others, consistency, universality, and reason.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the importance that history has placed on utilitarianism and deontology in the past, the author contends that moral ethical decision making is not primarily about judging conduct after the event, but instead believes that moral and ethical decision making is, more appropriately, about the little voice inside everyone, calling them to reason and premeditated accountability for their actions.</p>

<title>Definitions/Characteristics of Moral Dilemmas</title>
<p>Moral dilemmas can be defined as situations where there is a moral requirement for an agent (employee) to adopt each of two alternatives, and the agent (employee) cannot adopt both, but neither moral requirement is overridden in a morally relevant way. Such situations vary from trivial to tragic, but what makes them all dilemmatic is that each alternative violates a moral requirement that is not overridden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084822312473830">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Blackburn defines moral dilemmas as “situations in which each possible course of action breaches some otherwise binding moral principle.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1084822312473830">11</xref></sup> Blackburn stated that a moral dilemma is a choice between two wrongs and in the face of such a choice, two attitudes are possible. One can become fatalistic about dilemmas and regard them as essentially “no-win” situations in which whatever one does will be wrong, which it inevitably will. He also suggested that one can view dilemmas as more of a challenge, and try to determine the lesser of two evils in any given situation.</p>
<p>A moral dilemma may also be understood as the process of moral judgment on appropriateness or inappropriateness of some action, activity, or decision of an institution and/or individual, with appreciation of basic moral standards and information about the fact concerning the actions, which are the subject of discussion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1084822312473830">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Dilemmas Examined</title>
<sec id="section8-1084822312473830">
<title>Situation No. 1</title>
<p>Piaget’s theory of moral understanding was formulated using similar research methods to his “Cognitive Development Theory”: he used open-ended clinical interviews to question 5- to 13-year-old Swiss children on the rules of marbles and posed moral dilemmas so that he could examine their moral reasoning. Here is an example of two of Piaget’s dilemmas:
<disp-quote>
<p>A little boy called John was in his room. He was called and went into the dining room. Behind the door there was a chair and on the chair there was a tray with fifteen cups on it. John couldn’t have known that the chair was behind the door, and as he entered the dining room, the door knocked against the tray and the tray fell on the floor breaking all of the cups.</p>
<p>One day, a little boy called Henry tried to get jam out of a cupboard when his mother was out. He climbed onto chair and stretched out his arm. The jam was too high up, and he couldn’t reach it. But while he was trying to get it, he knocked over a cup. The cup fell down and broke.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Piaget asked the children who was naughtier and should be punished. Piaget found that even though 5- to 10-year-old children were able to distinguish between deliberate and unintentional acts, they still tended to base their judgments on the outcome of the act: the more severe the outcome, the naughtier the act. This is called “Heteronomous Morality.” Older children were able to make judgments based on the person’s motive: Henry was doing something he shouldn’t have been doing, so he is naughtier. This is called “Autonomous Morality.”</p>
<p>Piaget did not see moral development as consisting of separate stages, as in his cognitive development theory; instead he sees development as progressing through two broad phases that overlap—so sometimes a child’s moral reasoning will be in the heteronomous phase and at other times it will be autonomous.</p>
<p>Piaget’s situational dilemma raises concerns within the organizational context on how and what we do to train employees to recognize and distinguish between what is a deliberate act and what is an unintentional act.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1084822312473830">13</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section9-1084822312473830">
<title>Situation No. 2: “The Heinz Dilemma”—Kohlberg’s Theory</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In Europe, a woman was near death from a special kind of cancer. There was one drug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered. The drug was expensive to make, but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to make. He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug.</p>
<p>The sick woman’s husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get together about $1,000 which was half of what it cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said: “No, I discovered the drug and I’m going to make money from it.” So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man’s store to steal the drug-for his wife. Should the husband have done that?<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1084822312473830">14</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Kohlberg based his theory on research and interviews with groups of young children. The above moral dilemma was presented to the groups of children and they were later interviewed to determine the reasoning behind their judgments. The responses were then classified into various stages of reasoning in his theory of moral development.</p>
<sec id="section10-1084822312473830">
<title>Level 1—Preconventional morality</title>
<list id="list1-1084822312473830" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Stage 1—Obedience and Punishment—the earliest stage of moral development is especially common in young children, but adults are also capable of expressing this type of reasoning. At this stage, health care employees see rules as fixed and absolute. Obeying the organizational rules is important because it is a means to avoid punishment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Stage 2—Individualism and Exchange—at this stage of moral development, children account for individual points of view and judge actions based on how they serve individual needs. In the Heinz dilemma, children argued that the best course of action was the choice that best-served Heinz’s needs. The question that it raises is whether reciprocity is possible in health care organizations?</p></list-item>

<sec id="section11-1084822312473830">
<title>Level 2—Conventional morality</title>
<list id="list2-1084822312473830" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Stage 3—Interpersonal Relationships—often referred to as the “good boy-bad girl” orientation, this stage of moral development is focused on living up to social expectations and roles. There is an emphasis on conformity, being “nice,” and consideration of how choices influence relationships. As health care employees advance up the seniority ladder to higher level positions, they play the good ole boy or good ole girl game.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Stage 4—Maintaining Social Order—at this stage of moral development, health care employees begin to consider society as a whole when making judgments. The focus is on maintaining law and order by following the rules, doing one’s duty, and respecting authority. The challenge arises when employees are faced with a moral dilemma that opposes the law and order stance of their superiors within the health care organization where they are employed. Is the law and order stance always the “right” thing to do, especially when the moral dilemma may involve the moral issue of justice?</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1084822312473830">
<title>Level 3—Postconventional morality</title>
<list id="list3-1084822312473830" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Stage 5—Social Contract and Individual Rights—at this stage, employees begin to account for the differing values, opinions, and beliefs of other people. Rules of law are important for maintaining society, but members of the society should agree on these standards.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Stage 6—Universal Principles—Kohlberg’s final level of moral reasoning is based on universal principles of justice, even if they conflict with laws and rules.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Kohlberg was not interested so much in the answer to the question of whether Heinz was right or wrong, but in the reasoning that participant’s based their decisions.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1084822312473830">
<title>Situation No. 3—The Aide Borrows Money From His or Her Patient</title>
<p>In this situation a home health care aide who has cared for her patient for the past 10 years asks her to borrow some money.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Jane, a home health care aide, asks her patient Helen to loan her $5,000 to stop a foreclosure on her home. The patient felt obligated to loan the aide Jane the money because losing one’s home is one of the most devastating things that can happen to a person who has worked their entire life, and then end up homeless. Another reason why the patient felt obligated to her aide was because Jane had cared for her the past 10 years and she had grown attached to her as a kind of a “daughter” that she never had.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On its face, this dilemma appears to be like a double-edged sword. Either way you decide there will be consequences for both parties. As a result of the economic crisis in this country, we all feel remorse for those who have had to go through the experience of losing their “kingdom.” On the other hand, there is an organizational code of ethics that prohibits employees from accepting money from their patients. This principle is universal and when an employee crosses the line, they have broken the fiduciary trust that must exist in a provider–patient relationship. How would you as a supervisor solve this dilemma?</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1084822312473830">
<title>Organizational Recommendations</title>
<p>The development of the moral element of leadership in health care organizations is often ignored in the training and education of upper and middle management, practitioners, and clinical persons. The leap between compliance and moral understanding is never made by some individuals. For reasons of attitude or intellect, some are incapable of reflection on the purpose of rules, standards, and beliefs. Others simply reject the concepts underlying organizational rules and standards. The most important transitory step that organizations can do is to coach employees of how to make the step from compliance to moral understanding.</p>
<p>Moral understanding implies that health care organizations and their employees make numerous and complex value judgments about the foundational principles that underlie established rules and standards. These judgments precede ethical decisions, which in turn precede ethical conduct, which itself precedes ethical leadership.</p>
<p>Moral understanding must be embedded in the performance reviews of each employee to ensure that there is cohesion and clarity at all levels of management. The greatest challenge to upper management is clarifying their expectations to their subordinates. The second challenge is to ensure that those expectations are in constant agreement with the mission and overall organizational principles. Health care organizations must have an unending quest in their training and continuing education updates to establish coherent ways in which understanding—on the part of upper management and his or her subordinates can be achieved.</p>
<p>This understanding is revisited and refreshed and through this process matures into a thorough and more complete understanding of the intentional use of narratives and stories that are focused on identifying moral dilemmas. Narratives and the use of stories are how we transmit our truth, our insight, and our commitment to employees. The more we dig into the nature of organizational moral dilemmas, the more we are able to recognize the hidden facets of the problems that we are faced with and how employees can become more compliant. Narratives and stories are informal and emotional. The right narrative or story stated over and over to reveal its complexity will help to develop a new set of lenses for employees to continually diagnose the level of moral dilemma that has surfaced within the organization. The technique used by early childhood teachers that begins with, <italic>let me tell you a story</italic>, becomes a staple of the mentoring process relative to moral dilemmas for employee coaching. We coach employees over and over again to respond by making the right types of decisions by emphasizing that people make mistakes and that they are not always right or always wrong. It is about using real dilemmas and concrete situations to discuss moral issues.</p>
<p>The second recommendation would be to use the well-established practice of <italic>bibliotherapy—</italic>where carefully chosen literature is used to help employees solve problems. This process of interactive discussion can provide an effective strategy in helping employees reconstruct their views on morality. Children’s literature often serves as an excellent stimulus for such a discussion. Rather than just reading a book from cover to cover with employees, trainers should help employees uncover the meaning and personal implications of the story through thoughtful discussion. Such discussion should be based on the understanding that books can’t give employees morality but that they can serve as the stimuli for meaningful social interactions with their coworkers. Trainers should be reminded that morality arises out of social interactions and social relationships.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1084822312473830">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1084822312473830">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The final recommendation is to teach health care employees how to use the analytical process to solve moral problems. In his book <italic>Alpha and Omega: Ethics at the Frontiers of Life and Death</italic> Ernle W. D. Young<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1084822312473830">17</xref></sup> describes an approach that can be used in the context of health care organizations. This approach if used in a meaningful context can help health care employees to deal with potential moral dilemmas. When dealing with a moral problem, it is helpful to have a systematic strategy to apply as a template to ensure that all relevant and critical information has been ascertained from all the individuals involved to the potential conflict. The essence of Young’s strategy is as follows:</p>
<list id="list4-1084822312473830" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Step 1. <italic>Define the problem</italic> so the dilemma is clearly understood by all parties. This is done by determining whether a problem or conflict is on one hand a matter of poor communication, that is, failure to appreciate cultural or religious differences, or represents a genuine difference in values and principles, which means looking more closely at examining the issues involved. Some dilemmas or conflicts are readily addressed simply by clarifying the nature of the disagreement.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Step 2. <italic>Collect as much information</italic> about the potential dilemma as possible from the very start. The information is still fresh in the minds of the informants and therefore much more reliable. At this collection step, employees must be able to understand personal, religious, economic, and cultural beliefs, which are key components of the context framing the dilemma or conflict.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Step 3. <italic>Identify the important values and principles</italic> for you and the other employees who are involved. Values are grounded in beliefs, which may be held consciously or unconsciously and are sometimes highly charged with emotion. An example, a belief in God may predispose one to value human life as the most important value. Though sometimes difficult to articulate and not necessarily derived from a reasoning process, beliefs have a legitimate place in making a decision.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Step 4. <italic>Reflect on personal motives and intentions</italic> in light of different courses of action and consequences to self, others, and society. Motive can be distinguished from intention in that motive can be thought of as the “why,” and intention the “what.” What outcome is wanted and why is this desirable? Both of these questions apply to the individual’s character.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Step 5. <italic>Prioritize</italic> conflicting values and make an ethical and responsible decision. Consider that deciding to NOT make a decision represents one form of choice that has real consequences. Finally, <italic>keep the process simple!</italic></p></list-item>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The process of resolving moral dilemmas doesn’t take place in a vacuum. Health care employees must understand the context in which the dilemma occurred. Early childhood experiences play a significant role in the determination of how moral dilemmas are decided and resolved; because, typically moral standards are first learned as a child from family, friends, and various societal influences such as church, schools, and other community associations. Later, as we mature, our experience, learning, and intellectual development will lead us to think about, evaluate, and revise our moral standards according to whether we judge them to be “moral” or “Immoral,” “ethical” or “unethical.” You may discard some standards that you decide are unreasonable and may adopt new standards because you come to believe they are more reasonable than the ones you previously accepted. Through this maturing process, health care employees develop standards that are more rational and so more suited for dealing with the moral issues of adult life.</p>
