<abstract>
<p>The malignant glioma is the most common primary human brain tumor, and its migration and invasiveness away from the primary tumor mass are considered a leading cause of tumor recurrence and treatment failure. Recently, gene expression profiling revealed that the transmembrane glycoprotein CD99 is more highly expressed in malignant glioma than in normal brain. Although its function is not completely understood, CD99 is implicated in cell adhesion and migration in a variety of different cell types. <italic>CD99</italic> has wild-type and splice variant isoforms. Previous studies have shown that wild-type <italic>CD99</italic> may be an oncosuppressor in some tumors, distinct from the role of the splice variant isoform. In this study, our data reveal that only wild-type <italic>CD99</italic> is expressed in human glioma cells and tissues. Using a tissue microarray, we validated that gliomas demonstrate higher expression of CD99 compared with nonneoplastic brain. To assess the role of CD99 in glioma migration and invasion, we inhibited CD99 expression by siRNA and demonstrated decreased glioma migration and invasion. In contrast, when CD99 was overexpressed in glioma cells, we observed enhancement of cell migration and invasiveness. An orthotopic brain tumor model demonstrates that CD99 overexpression significantly increases invasiveness and decreases survival rate. Interestingly, Rac activity was decreased and Rho activity was increased in CD99 overexpressing glioma cells, and the proportion of amoeboid cells to mesenchymal cells was significantly increased. Taken together, our findings suggest that CD99 may play an important role in the migration and invasion of human gliomas independent of Akt, ERK, or JNK signaling pathways. Moreover, CD99 might be involved in amoeboid-mesenchymal transition in glioma migration. CD99 may be an important future target to inhibit migration and invasion, especially in CD99-expressing gliomas.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1947601912473603">1</xref></sup> and are among the most aggressive malignant tumors in part because of their propensity to disseminate diffusely throughout the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1947601912473603">2</xref></sup> Therefore, to improve our ability to treat patients with malignant gliomas, we must increase our understanding of the migratory and invasive properties of these tumors.</p>
<p>To migrate, glioma cells must acquire a special asymmetric, and polarized phenotype. This enables them to transform intracellular forces into net cell body translocation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1947601912473603">3</xref></sup> Typically, a migrating glioma cell remodels its cytoskeleton and forms protrusions and focal adhesions at the leading edge of the migratory front. This generates contractile forces and traction, allowing the cell body to move forward. Recent studies have demonstrated that individual cells of certain cancers, such as melanoma, have 2 different interchangeable modes of movement: a mesenchymal mode driven by Rac GTPase activation and an amoeboid mode driven by Rho GTPase activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1947601912473603">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1947601912473603"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1947601912473603">6</xref></sup> Therefore, the ability of tumor cells to switch between different modes of migration might limit the effectiveness of single therapeutic agents targeting migration and invasion of cancer cells.</p>
<p>Invasion is a complex cellular phenomenon that involves cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, enzymatic degradation of the ECM, and cell migration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1947601912473603">7</xref></sup> Cell movement involves the coordination of multiple signaling pathways that regulate cell-substratum adhesion and actin cytoskeletal dynamics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1947601912473603">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, numerous potential targets for migration and invasion in gliomas have been reported. Recently, through a gene-expression array study for possible immunotherapeutic targets of gliomas, 31 novel potential membranous proteins were revealed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1947601912473603">9</xref></sup> One of these was CD99, whose expression was 4.8-fold higher than in normal brain. In addition, CD99 expression level directly correlated with advancing grade of glial tumors.</p>
<p>CD99, a cell surface glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 32 kDa, was originally described as a human thymus leukemia antigen,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1947601912473603">10</xref></sup> a Ewing sarcoma-specific membrane marker molecule,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1947601912473603">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1947601912473603">12</xref></sup> and an adhesion molecule involved in spontaneous rosette formation of T cells with erythrocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1947601912473603">13</xref></sup> CD99 is distributed on many cell types, with particularly strong expression on human cortical thymocytes, Ewing sarcoma, ependymoma, and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1947601912473603">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1947601912473603">14</xref></sup> Although the functional role of CD99 is not fully understood, in normal cells CD99 has been associated with cell adhesion, migration, apoptosis, differentiation, activation, and proliferation of lymphocytes and extravasation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1947601912473603">15</xref></sup> In pathological conditions, the role of CD99 has not been completely elucidated. Expression of CD99 resulted in the induction of cell-cell adhesion and apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1947601912473603">16</xref></sup> and the inhibition of anchorage-independent growth, anoikis resistance, migration, and metastasis in Ewing sarcoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1947601912473603">17</xref></sup> Similar results were also reported in osteosarcoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1947601912473603">18</xref></sup> Contrary to this, others have reported that high expression of CD99 contributed to the malignant properties of sarcomas by promoting growth and migration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1947601912473603">19</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>CD99</italic> encodes 2 distinct proteins by alternative splicing of the <italic>CD99</italic> gene transcript.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1947601912473603">20</xref></sup> Compared with the wild-type full-length form (CD99wt), the minor splicing variant (CD99sh) of molecular weight 28 kDa has a shortened intracytoplasmic fragment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1947601912473603">15</xref></sup> Several papers suggest that the CD99sh favors oncogenesis, including anchorage-independent growth, anoikis resistance, migration, and invasion, whereas the CD99wt inhibits these phenomena in a few sarcomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1947601912473603">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1947601912473603">17</xref></sup> To the best of our knowledge, there are no published reports showing the expression and functional significance of CD99 in human gliomas. Accordingly, in the present study, we have examined the role played by CD99 in human glioma cells.</p>

<title>CD99 expression in glioma cell lines and glioblastoma tissue samples</title>
<p>Western blot was performed on the different glioma cell lines, including U343, U251, U118, U87, SNB19, and T98, as well as on normal human astrocytes (NHAs). T98, SNB19, and U343 glioma cell lines expressed CD99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947601912473603">Fig. 1A</xref>), whereas NHAs, U251, U118 and U87 did not. From these results, we selected U87 for CD99 overexpression experiments because it expressed almost no CD99; we selected T98 and SNB19 glioma cells for gene silencing because these 2 cell lines demonstrated high levels of CD99 expression. Five of 6 glioblastoma tissue samples showed high expression of CD99, whereas all 5 nonneoplastic brain specimens did not express this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947601912473603">Fig. 1B</xref>). To determine whether either of CD99 isoforms was expressed, we used 12% SDS-PAGE as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1947601912473603">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1947601912473603">17</xref></sup>; however, only CD99wt was expressed in the cell lines and tissues.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we examined the biological role of CD99 in human malignant gliomas. We show that CD99 overexpression was associated with morphological alterations of glioma cells, increased motility and invasion, and increased adhesiveness. In addition, Rac activity was decreased, and Rho activity increased following CD99 overexpression, suggesting a potential mechanism by which CD99 influences the actin cytoskeleton. Elimination of CD99 expression by siRNA led to the opposite effects predominantly.</p>
<p>The role of CD99 in many tumors is still controversial. High CD99 expression has been shown in Ewing sarcoma, acute lymphoblastic lymphoma, synovial sarcoma, mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1947601912473603">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1947601912473603">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1947601912473603">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1947601912473603"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1947601912473603"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1947601912473603">24</xref></sup> A significant relationship between CD99-positive cells and the occurrence of local invasion and/or distant metastasis has been found in gastrointestinal and pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1947601912473603">25</xref></sup> However, low expression of CD99 has also been associated with the development of pancreatic and gastric cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1947601912473603">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1947601912473603">27</xref></sup> A recent report also showed that down-regulation of CD99 is associated with the metastatic phenotype of osteosarcoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1947601912473603">18</xref></sup> Meanwhile, in breast invasive carcinomas, no significant association was found between CD99 immunoreactivity and the metastatic stages of the tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1947601912473603">28</xref></sup> This discrepancy may be due not only to the difference in cancer types but also to the difference in the relative expression levels of the 2 CD99 isoforms.</p>
<p>Differential expression of alternative splice variants has been known to occur on both physiological and pathological bases. CD99 isoforms have been found to be differentially expressed in various human tumor cell lines and normal tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1947601912473603">15</xref></sup> The general concept is that both isoforms exhibit different functions in malignancy. CD99sh was originally reported as an inhibitor for homotypic cell adhesion of lymphocytes, whereas CD99wt acted as an inducer for cell adhesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1947601912473603">20</xref></sup> Previous studies have suggested that CD99wt is a potent oncosuppressor in osteosarcoma, because CD99-forced expression reduced resistance to anoikis and inhibited growth in soft agar as well as migration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1947601912473603">18</xref></sup> In contrast, our studies showed that CD99wt-overexpressing glioma cells have similar ability of survival and progression compared with nonexpressing glioma cells. Furthermore, our <italic>in vivo</italic> data revealed that mice harboring xenografts overexpressing CD99 had a decreased survival rate and higher invasive profiles than did controls.</p>
<p>In tumors expressing CD99sh or CD99wt, it has been shown that CD99 signaling cascades include the JunD-FosB complex, which enhances the transcription of AP-1-responsive genes, such as MMP-9 and cell motility-stimulating genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1947601912473603">15</xref></sup> Moreover, it was also reported that CD99 expression results in positive cross-talk between the epidermal growth factor receptor and Akt pathways, causing increased expression of JunD and FosB along with increased AP-1 activity. Interestingly, our data demonstrated that Akt, ERK, and JNK were not activated in CD99 overexpressing human glioma cells, perhaps because only CD99wt was expressed, and not CD99sh. In efforts to understand more completely what signaling pathways may be operational in CD99 overexpressing glioma cells, we performed mass spectrometry to identify cytoplasmic interacting peptides, and we found some putative interactions worthy of further investigation, such as capain-1. MMP-9 was increased, however, in keeping with previous studies showing its activation following CD99 up-regulation (data not shown).</p>
<p>Recently, 2 different migratory modes have been reported in certain types of cancer cells such as melanoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1947601912473603">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1947601912473603">6</xref></sup> One is mesenchymal migration, which is characterized by an elongated morphology that requires extracellular proteolysis localized at cellular protrusions and is driven by activation of Rac. The other is amoeboid migration, which is characterized by round cells with no obvious polarity that is independent of proteases and is driven by activation of Rho.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1947601912473603">29</xref></sup> These 2 migratory modes are interconvertible, depending on environmental conditions. In our study, Rac activity was decreased and Rho activity was increased in stably CD99-transfected glioma cells, which enhanced migration and invasiveness of human malignant glioma cells. Moreover, the ratio of amoeboid cells to mesenchymal cells was much higher in CD99 overexpressing glioma cells compared with control cells, further confirming a Rho-activated cell migratory phenotype and suggesting a potential mechanism by which CD99 may be associated with increased cellular migration. From our mass spectrometry analysis, potential CD99 interactors Capain1 and the 14-3-3 chaperone proteins may represent a potential mechanism as to how CD99 regulates Rac and Rho activation, as these proteins have been previously shown to influence Rac and Rho activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1947601912473603">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1947601912473603">31</xref></sup> Although the majority of the literature indicates that CDC42 and Rac are critical regulators of filipodia formation, there is evidence to suggest alternative mechanisms of filopodia activation through RhoA regulation, as demonstrated in this study and previous groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1947601912473603">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1947601912473603">33</xref></sup> Although beyond the scope of this study, genome-wide profiling of CD99 positive versus negative cells would be of interest to interrogate further mechanisms by which CD99 promotes these invasive phenotypes in glioblastoma.</p>
<p>In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time expression and activation of CD99wt enhance the migration and invasive ability of human glioma cells. CD99 may play a role in in amoeboid-mesenchymal transition in glioma migration. Our findings suggest that CD99 could be an important target for tumor migration and invasion in those gliomas, which express CD99 and show enhanced invasiveness.</p>

<title>Anoikis (detachment-induced apoptosis in poly-2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate) assay</title>
<p>Cells undergoing death by anoikis were identified and quantified using the CytoSelect anoikis assay kit according to the manufacturerâs instructions (Cell Biolab, San Diego, California). Briefly, cells to be assayed for anoikis were collected, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in culture medium. Cells (400,000) in suspension were added to an anchorage-resistant poly-Hema-coated well. After 24-hour, 48-hour, and 72-hour incubation times at 37Â°C, 50 ÂµL of MTT reagent in the kit was added into each well to detect living cells. Absorbance at 570 nm was measured 2 hours after the addition of MTT reagent.</p>

<title>Cell attachment assay</title>
<p>The cell attachment assay was performed as described previously (Elbashir, 2001 #46; Sriramarao, 1993 #47) with some modifications. Briefly, 96-well plates were incubated at 4Â°C overnight with an ECM protein, laminin (at 10 Âµg/mL). The unbound sites were blocked with 0.1% BSA in PBS for 1 hour at 37Â°C. Control dishes were prepared by blocking with BSA alone. Glioma cells were detached, resuspended in serum-free medium, and then plated at 5 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well on laminin- or BSA-coated plates. The cells were allowed to adhere for 3 hours at 37Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified chamber. Unattached cells were removed by washing with PBS 3 times, and the remaining cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. Excess stain was washed away with water, and then the plates air-dried overnight. The crystal violet bound to the attached cells was solubilized with 1% SDS, and a microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California) measured the absorbance of each well at 595 nm. All experiments were repeated 3 times using replicates of 5.</p>

<title>Radial cell migration assay</title>
<p>Cell migration assays were performed using the microliter-scale radial monolayer assay as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1947601912473603">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1947601912473603">35</xref></sup> Briefly, 10-well Teflon-coated slides (CSM Inc., Phoenix, Arizona) were coated with different ECM proteins and 0.1% BSA as described above. To establish a circular confluent monolayer 1 mm in diameter at the center of the substrate-coated well, transfected cells were collected 24 hours after transfection and seeded through a cell sedimentation manifold (CSM Inc.) at 2,000 cells per well. Photographs were taken 22 hours after plating, and a circle of best-fit circumscribing the cells was drawn. The cells were allowed to migrate for 24 hours, and then another circle circumscribing the newly migrated cells was made. The average migration rate was calculated as the change in the diameter of the circle circumscribing the cell population over a 24-hour period (micrometers per 24 hours). Photomicrographs were taken with an inverted microscope (Leica DM IRE2; Leica Microsystems, Inc., Bannockburn, Illinois) and studied using image-analysis software (Scion Image, Frederick, Maryland). All experiments were repeated 3 times using 3 replicates each.</p>

<title>Transwell cell invasion assay</title>
<p>A cell invasion assay was carried out using modified Boyden chambers that consisted of Transwell-coated Matrigel membrane filter inserts with 8 Âµm pores in 24-well tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences, Bedford, Massachusetts) as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1947601912473603">36</xref></sup> Two days after transfection, 4 Ã 10<sup>4</sup> cells were plated onto the top of the chamber in DMEM with 5% FBS. The bottom chamber was filled with DMEM containing 20% FBS as a chemoattractant. Plates were incubated for 24 hours in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified chamber at 37Â°C. Noninvading cells were wiped off the upper surface of the membrane with a cotton swab, and the filter membrane was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. The degree of invasion was determined by counting the number of cells that had migrated through the membrane in at least 6 random fields (total magnification, 200Ã) per filter. Experiments were repeated 3 times in triplicate.</p>

<title>Orthotopic intracranial xenograft</title>
<p>U87 cells stably transfected with EGFP-pcDNA3.1- and CD99wt-pcDNA3.1- expression constructs were used for xenograft experiments. Cells were released from the culture plates using Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri), washed twice in 1 Ã PBS, resuspended in a small volume of serum-free EMEM at a final concentration of 100,000 cells/ÂµL, and kept on ice until the time of injection. Male Nu/Foxn1/Nu mice (ages 5-6 weeks; Charles River, Senneville, Quebec) were anesthetized using i.p. ketamine/xylazine. Intracranial injection of 200,000 cells (2 ÂµL) was performed in the right forebrain at the following coordinates: 2.0 mm lateral and 1 mm anterior to bregma at a 2.0 mm depth from the skull surface, using a murine stereotactic head frame and Hamilton syringe. Six mice were injected with U87 cells stably transfected with EGFP-pcDNA3.1-, and 7 mice were injected with U87-CD99-pcDNA3.1- stable cell line. Mice were observed for evidence of a symptomatic intracranial mass such as incoordination, lethargy, or weight loss &gt;20% of maximal body weight. Whole brain specimens were fixed in 10% formalin for 72 hours followed by 70% ethanol until all samples were obtained for further processing. Samples were paraffin embedded; sections were cut, mounted onto slides, and stained for H&amp;E, human CD99, the same as in the tissue microarray.</p>
