<abstract>
<p>Ken Stone conducted the first study of WalMart stores’ economic impact in Iowa in 1988. Since then, research on WalMart’s impacts has exploded. Recent studies employ sophisticated statistical techniques to more accurately measure the size and direction of effects. Many reach conclusions similar to Stone’s original work. This article updates the original Stone study with additional years of data. It draws on recent methodological advances to help account for the effects of WalMart’s strategic location decisions on estimated retail sales in Iowa. As is consistent with previous studies, we find that WalMart’s entry into smaller trade centers in Iowa had a big initial impact on host-town retail sales, with some categories experiencing significant increases while others saw declines in sales per capita. WalMart’s presence helped stabilize or even expand the local retail sector of most rural Iowa host communities. To conclude, we discuss policy implications for local economic development officials.</p>

<p>Dramatic changes in retail market structure have occurred in the United States over the past few decades. Retail trade has become much more concentrated in cities and regional trade centers, and retail sales in nonmetropolitan areas of the United States have declined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891242412461828">Gale, 1996</xref>). This shift is the result of a number of factors: improved transportation infrastructure that facilitates long-distance shopping trips; the rise of shopping malls and increasing retail concentration in urban areas, which offer consumers one-stop shopping, greater variety, and improved convenience; and declining customer bases in many rural areas because of out-migration and increased commuting by rural residents. More recently, a rapid expansion of discount stores such as Target and WalMart, along with their sector-specific counterparts such as Home Depot, Staples, and Best Buy, has further altered the structure of retail markets, redistributing retail trade not only geographically but also among types of retail outlets.</p>
<p>Declining rural retail sales are a growing concern to local policymakers for several reasons. The ability of a community’s retail sector to retain local customers (and to attract customers from other communities) is an important indicator of that community’s economic health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891242412461828">Deller, McConnon, Holden, &amp; Stone, 1991</xref>). When declining sales lead to local business closures, the buying behavior of local consumers may change. Consider the loss of a grocery store. If residents are forced to shop outside the community for necessities such as food, they will likely begin to “outshop” for other goods as well. As a result of reduced local spending, the sales of the remaining local businesses will suffer, spurring further decline.</p>
<p>Retail business owners are not the only ones affected by declining retail sales. The retail sector employs more people in nonmetropolitan areas than any other sector except the government, accounting for 11.2% of nonmetropolitan employment in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891242412461828">U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011</xref>). If declining retail sales threaten the survival of local retailers, a significant source of jobs is jeopardized as well. The loss of local businesses can erode a small community’s tax base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891242412461828">Leistritz, Ayres, &amp; Stone, 1992</xref>). The deterioration of a community’s downtown business district is likely to have a psychological impact on local citizens as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891242412461828">Ozment and Martin (1990)</xref> describe such loss as “a visual and symbolic decline of the entire town.” Lastly, over the past 20 years, revenues from local-option sales taxes have become more important in local budgets. In some cases, a local sales tax is allowed if part or all of the revenues are used to offset property taxes, further increasing the dependence of local governments on sales tax revenues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891242412461828">Krmenec, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Given this backdrop, many communities view retail as an important part of their economic development efforts. But unless population or incomes are growing substantially (generally not the case in rural areas), there is a relatively fixed amount of money to be spent in the retail sector. A new, large store will capture considerable trade from other merchants in the trade area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891242412461828">Blair &amp; Kumar, 1997</xref>). Even in large metropolitan areas, new retail development comes at least partially at the expense of existing merchants. In a study of the Dallas retail market, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891242412461828">Ingraham, Singer, and Thibodeau (2005)</xref> estimated that for every new dollar of retail sales within a 15-mile radius of the Dallas center, 34 cents is cannibalized from existing retailers. Furthermore, the authors suggest that the primary source of the incremental 66 cents is not population and income growth but more likely existing retail sales from nearby cities outside the 15-mile radius, resulting in little contribution to overall economic growth. This suggests that, at least when it comes to retail, what is one community’s gain is another community’s loss.</p>
<p>Hence, we see the reasons for the controversy generated over the rapid expansion of the discount mass merchandiser WalMart in relatively small, nonmetropolitan retail markets during the last few decades. On the one hand, WalMart had the potential to shore up or increase the retail trade activity of the rural trade centers in which it located, but at some cost to competing retailers in nearby communities. On the other hand, because of the wide variety of goods sold by this mass merchandiser, WalMart’s entry induced some redistribution of retail sales among store types and posed a real threat to a number of existing retailers in the host town who sold products similar to those offered by WalMart.</p>
<p>Ken Stone conducted the first study of the economic impacts of WalMart stores in Iowa in 1988, using a small sample of Iowa towns in which WalMart stores had only a few years of operating experience. WalMart was still in its early expansion years, and very little was known about the impacts of its stores on existing stores in the local area. Consequently, the Stone study received widespread attention and was cited by many media outlets across the United States.</p>
<p>The 1988 WalMart study concluded that local area businesses that sold things different from WalMart tended to enjoy increases in sales, primarily benefiting from the increased traffic that WalMart brought into the area. Conversely, businesses that sold the same merchandise as WalMart usually lost sales because of their inability to compete with such a dominant business. Later studies in Maine by Artz and additional studies by Stone and Artz in Iowa and Mississippi reached similar conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891242412461828">Artz &amp; Stone, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891242412461828">Stone, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891242412461828">1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891242412461828">1995a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891242412461828">1995b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891242412461828">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891242412461828">Stone &amp; Artz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891242412461828">Stone, Artz, &amp; Myles, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The academic research evaluating impacts of the growth of WalMart stores at both the local and the national levels is now extensive and continues to grow. Early studies like Stone’s were faulted for failing to account for the strategic nature of WalMart’s location decisions in their before-and-after-type study designs. If WalMart systematically chose to locate in high-growth areas, a before-and-after-type analysis would overestimate any positive impacts and underestimate more negative effects. Conversely, if the mass merchandiser’s strategy was to locate in slower-growth areas, WalMart’s negative affects might be overstated.</p>
<p>Recent studies have employed a variety of methods to address the problem of nonrandom selection in econometric models of WalMart’s impacts on existing local retailers. In general, these more recent studies examining the effects of WalMart entry confirm the general pattern, if not the magnitude, of many of Stone’s original findings in Iowa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891242412461828">Basker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891242412461828">Irwin &amp; Clark, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891242412461828">Renkow, 2005</xref>): Retailers who compete most directly with WalMart are negatively affected by the mass merchandiser’s entry, whereas others can benefit. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891242412461828">Jia (2008)</xref> estimates that WalMart’s expansion accounts for half or more of small discount retail closures between 1988 and 1997. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891242412461828">Basker (2005)</xref> finds that on average four small competitors close within 5 years of WalMart’s entry into a community. There is evidence that although WalMart’s entry may not lead existing firms to close, many experience significant declines in revenue. Additionally, the number of retailers may not change much, but the composition of businesses may (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891242412461828">Basker, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>This article updates Stone’s early work on the “WalMart Effect” on sales of retail businesses in Iowa host towns. A new addition to this study is a comparison of the retail sales performance of host towns for 15 years before the opening of a WalMart store relative to the performance of these same towns for 15 years after the WalMart opening. The earlier Stone studies compared the sales performance after the opening of a WalMart store to the “base year,” the year before the WalMart store opened, but did not consider the longer-term trends in retail sales that existed prior to WalMart entry. In addition, we include comparisons to a group of control towns—similar-sized Iowa towns without a WalMart store. Although Stone’s 10-year study (1997) did include a control group for comparison, for this study we use a matching strategy to select a set of comparison towns as a way to try to account for the strategic nature of WalMart’s location decisions on the empirical results.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>Retail sales data were obtained from the <italic>Iowa Retail Sales and Use Tax Reports</italic>, published annually by the Iowa Department of Revenue and Finance. The department has published total retail sales data for virtually every town and city in the state since the early 1970s. Sales of all taxable goods and services are also reported by two-digit North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Codes for communities with more than 2,500 in population, if the community has five or more businesses within the category. The two-digit classification is a broad description of merchandise categories such as food, general merchandise, building materials, and apparel. (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0891242412461828">Table 1</xref> for descriptions of these categories.) Retail sales data by merchandise category was reported for 122 Iowa towns and cities between 1976 and 2008. Statewide sales are also published at more detailed three-digit NAICS levels. For example, in the building materials category, statewide sales would be reported for hardware stores, lumberyards, paint and glass stores, and so on.</p>

<p>In Iowa, the food bought in stores is not taxable (sales tax). However, approximately 25% of the sales in grocery stores are nonfood items and are therefore taxable. Although total food sales are not known with certainty, the nontaxable sales serve as a good proxy for the total sales.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>An advantage of using data on sales rather than business counts is that sales figures are precise and a proxy measure of employment. Conversely, business counts do not discriminate between large and small businesses. In smaller towns and rural areas, many businesses are very small and sometimes one-person operations. Many small businesses are also seasonal or part-time. Therefore, we believe that sales tax data are a superior measure of retail vitality.</p>
<p>Population figures and income data were obtained from U.S. Census reports. Geographic distances of WalMart host towns to the nearest city with a population of 50,000 or greater were calculated using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Mapquest.com">Mapquest.com</ext-link>. Opening dates for WalMart stores were obtained from a combination of information posted on the retailer’s website<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0891242412461828">1</xref></sup> and from the authors’ personal records of store openings compiled from media accounts.</p>
<sec id="section2-0891242412461828">
<title>Study Sample</title>
<p>The set of Iowa WalMart host towns included in the analysis met two criteria. First, WalMart had to have opened in the town no later than 1994; this ensured we had 15 years of data after entry. This cutoff also corresponds with the end of the first wave of WalMart entry in Iowa, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0891242412461828">Figure 1</xref>. WalMart opened 45 stores in Iowa between 1983 and 1994. No stores opened in the state over the next 5 years. Then, beginning in 1999, the retailer began a second wave of store openings and conversions of discount stores to supercenters. Iowa now hosts 59 WalMart stores in 55 different towns and cities. The second criterion for inclusion in the analysis was that the host town’s 1980 population had to have been 20,000 or less. We chose to focus on these smaller towns for three main reasons: first, WalMart’s early strategy focused on locating in smaller towns and cities (29 of the “first wave” stores were located in towns with fewer than 20,000 residents in 1980); second, it is more difficult to isolate the effects of WalMart in larger cities because the sales volume of a single WalMart store is overwhelmed by the overall sales of the city and is barely detectable; and, third, we have several control towns for this population range but no possible controls for the larger Iowa cities, which all have one or more WalMart stores.</p>

<sec id="section3-0891242412461828">
<title>Selection of the Control Group</title>
<p>For the subset of Iowa towns with a population between 3,000 and 20,000 in 1980, we compared changes in retail sales before and after WalMart’s entry into host communities with a control group of similar, nonhost towns. The set of possible control towns includes towns with a population of less than 20,000 in 1980 that did not have a WalMart store by 2008. That is, we exclude towns that become WalMart host towns after 1994 as possible controls. Of the 122 towns with reported retail sales data by merchandise category, 103 had populations of less than 20,000 in 1980. Of these 103 towns, 29 hosted a WalMart store by 1994 and an additional six towns had a WalMart store by 2008, leaving a total of 68 possible control towns.</p>
<p>A key to this type of analysis is finding a good counterfactual for comparison. That is, for each host town, we need to find a nonhost match that represents what would have happened in the host town had WalMart not located there. The concern is that WalMart strategically chooses the best locations for its stores, so that there is something fundamentally different about the towns it locates in compared with those it does not. If so, nonhost towns will not provide a good counterfactual. A common method for addressing this problem is called propensity score matching. Propensity score matching provides a systematic way to select control group matches that most closely resemble the host towns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891242412461828">Angrist &amp; Krueger, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891242412461828">Smith &amp; Todd, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>We first generate a propensity score for each town using probit analysis. The dependent variable in this first step is a binary indicator variable measuring whether WalMart is present in the community during any year in our sample. The independent variables are a vector of preperiod observable attributes of the town believed to affect the probability of getting a WalMart store: 1980 population, 1980 median household income, retail sales growth between 1980 and 1985, and distance to the nearest city with a population of 50,000 or greater. The estimated probabilities, or propensity scores, are then used to match each host town to a nonhost control town. The results from this probit estimation are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0891242412461828">Table 2</xref>. Since there were relatively few nonhost towns in the population range by 2008, we used matching with replacement; that is, some nonhost control towns are matched with more than one host community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0891242412461828">2</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0891242412461828">Figure 2</xref> shows the locations of the host and control towns included in the study; both are relatively evenly dispersed across the state. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0891242412461828">Table 3</xref> compares the mean values of variables used to derive the propensity scores for the host towns, for the selected control towns, and for the whole set of possible control towns. The mean values for the selected controls are very similar to those for the host towns, suggesting that the control group provides a reasonable counterfactual.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0891242412461828">Figure 3</xref> includes trends for total retail sales and general merchandise sales, the category in which WalMart is classified. In both cases, the charts show a sizable increase in average per capita sales in the host towns following WalMart’s entry, relative to the pre-entry trend in the host towns and relative to the overall trend for control towns. This marked change suggests a large, positive impact on retail sales in the host towns. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0891242412461828">Figure 4</xref> shows trends for food stores and apparel stores. In both cases, the host-town trend in average per capita sales apparently falls postentry. In the food store category, the trend for control towns is increasing in the postentry time period. This suggests that WalMart had a negative effect on per capita food store sales in host towns. In contrast, the postentry trend in control towns for apparel stores is similar to that of host towns. In this case, it is unclear whether the downward trend in per capita apparel sales might be attributed to WalMart entry or instead might be part of a larger decline in this merchandise category among towns of this size.</p>
<p>It is important to note that these figures do not fully account for other factors that may be affecting retail sales trends. The following econometric analysis attempts both to quantify the divergence in per capita retail sales that appear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0891242412461828">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0891242412461828">4</xref> and to determine whether it is statistically significant after controlling for other town characteristics and for the likelihood that WalMart locates its stores in a nonrandom fashion.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The estimates in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0891242412461828">Table 4</xref> provide evidence that the impact of WalMart’s entry on host town retail sales varies across merchandise category. Not surprisingly, the biggest impact is seen in the general merchandise category, where WalMart is classified, followed by eating and drinking and by total retail sales. Smaller, positive impacts occur in the apparel, specialty, and services categories. Per capita retail sales of building materials, the category that includes home-improvement and hardware stores, saw an immediate and sizable decline in the average host town, postentry. The coefficients for home-furnishing and food stores are also negative, although smaller in magnitude.</p>
<p>In all but three merchandise categories—apparel, home furnishings, and specialty—WalMart’s impact endures for 15 years after entry, although the magnitude of the effect tends to diminish over time. In several cases, while the immediate impact is positive, the postentry trend is negative, although generally quite small in magnitude. This is the case for total retail sales, eating and drinking, and specialty stores. Such a trend is consistent with anecdotal evidence that, especially during the earlier years of WalMart openings in Iowa, WalMart attracted a large number of consumers from nearby towns. This increased customer traffic benefited retailers, such as restaurants and certain specialty stores, whose goods and services complemented WalMart’s offerings. Over time, however, as the novelty effect wore off, and as more and more WalMart stores opened in nearby towns, a portion of this increased customer traffic subsided.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0891242412461828">Figure 5</xref> shows the estimated percentage change in per capita retail sales for host towns on entry and 15 years postentry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0891242412461828">5</xref></sup> WalMart host towns’ total per capita retail sales rose on average roughly 11% on entry and remained positive over time, although by Year 15 the effect had diminished to roughly 5%. The estimated percentage change in per capita sales on WalMart’s entry in general merchandise was 84%, which had tapered off only 3 more percent—to roughly 81%—15 years later.</p>

</fig>
<p>Interestingly, these estimates confirm the apparent negative effect of WalMart entry observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0891242412461828">Figure 4</xref> for the food store category, but for apparel stores they indicate that WalMart’s presence boosted sales, if only temporarily, relative to what occurred in the control towns. This result highlights the importance of establishing a frame of reference in analyzing before-and-after impacts of economic changes. Suppose only the postentry pattern of per capita apparel sales was considered. It would be easy to conclude that WalMart’s entry caused, or at least significantly contributed to, the steep decline in apparel sales. Even comparing before-and-after trends in the affected communities can result in misleading interpretations of the data, if postentry patterns are part of larger trends affecting similar communities without WalMart stores.</p>
<sec id="section6-0891242412461828">
<title>Change in Sales (Dollars) for Host-Town Merchandise Categories</title>
<p>Using the estimates from the regression analysis we can compute the change in sales by merchandise category for the average host town in our data set. These estimates are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0891242412461828">Table 5</xref>. On entry of WalMart, general merchandise sales rose roughly $9.5 million. The magnitude of the increased sales in the host towns suggests that the new WalMart captured a significant portion of its sales from existing general merchandise retailers in the host towns. An average WalMart discount store opening in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Iowa contained about 90,000 square feet. A conservative estimate of the sales generated by a new WalMart store would be $250 per square foot at that time,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0891242412461828">6</xref></sup> or $22.5 million—well above the $9.5 million increase in general merchandise sales implied by our estimates. Furthermore, the average increase in total sales was somewhat less—on average $7.8 million. This implies that the net effect of the new WalMart also included some capture of retail sales from existing host town retailers outside of the general merchandise category, especially categories like food and building materials, where retail sales fell following WalMart’s entry.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, total retail sales do increase significantly in the average host town, prompting the question, where do these sales come from? In a state like Iowa, where population and income are stable or even declining, retail trade approximates a zero-sum game, where new entrants capture trade from other businesses rather than expanding the size of the market. Although some trade was apparently redistributed between the various types of retail stores, anecdotal evidence indicates that redistribution also occurred geographically, as WalMart captured some trade from smaller, neighboring communities. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0891242412461828">Figure 6</xref> provides a cursory look at this geographic shift, plotting the average retail sales per capita (in inflation-adjusted dollars) over the study period for the two groups of towns included in this analysis (study host towns and study control towns) as well as the remainder of Iowa communities divided between WalMart host cities (larger than 20,000 population) and all other Iowa towns without a WalMart store. Real per capita sales in WalMart towns remained steady or increased slightly over the time period, while falling in the average non–WalMart towns. For the study control towns, the average decline was roughly 25%; the decrease in all other non–WalMart towns (95% of which have populations less than 2,500) was substantially larger, on the order of 33%. WalMart’s entry into the state is only one factor in the shift of retail sales from smaller towns to larger regional trade centers over time. Future research could investigate the magnitude of WalMart’s impact on this larger trend.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Consistent with previous studies, this analysis shows that WalMart’s entry into smaller trade centers in Iowa had a big initial impact on host-town retail sales, with some categories experiencing large significant increases while others saw declines in retail sales. Over time, the impact declined, but in general towns hosting a WalMart store appeared to have fared better, in terms of total retail sales, than similar towns in which WalMart did not locate. This analysis supports the idea that WalMart’s presence helped stabilize or even expand the local retail sector of most rural host communities.</p>
<p>It is important to note that these findings are derived from a relatively small sample, Iowa towns with less than 20,000 population in which WalMart opened prior to 1994. Therefore, these results reflect the impacts of discount stores, which represent a smaller-format store without the full line of grocery items found in the more recent Supercenter format. WalMart’s impact may vary by location and across time. Furthermore, the merchandise-category groupings allowed by the Iowa sales tax data are still relatively aggregated, especially for categories with a wide variety of store types such as specialty. As a result, we can only estimate net changes; these data might yet mask significant changes that have occurred at the firm level. Some firms may close while others open, resulting in small, or no, net impacts. Finally, this study is focused quite narrowly on one measure of WalMart’s impact: retail sales in the communities in which it locates. But clearly the debate surrounding WalMart’s impacts (both positive and negative) extends far beyond the impacts on other local retailers.</p>
<sec id="section8-0891242412461828">
<title>Policy Implications</title>
<p>When WalMart opened its first stores in Iowa in the mid-1980s, it generated considerable concern among business people and chambers of commerce across the state. Part of the controversy may have been fear of the unknown; people simply did not know what to expect, or how to adjust, to such a significant change in the local retail market. Twenty-five years later, there is much less controversy when WalMart does establish a new store. Although some retail businesses did lose trade, and some did ultimately go out of business, many others adopted new strategies to compete effectively with WalMart. As demonstrated in this analysis, having a WalMart store stabilized the retail sector of smaller trade centers, helping curtail the out-migration of shoppers to the larger cities. A robust local retail district provides residents with more convenient shopping options, and the higher level of competition introduced by a store like WalMart forces other local businesses to improve efficiency, whereby they can offer lower prices or else compete on quality and service. As a result, consumers benefit.</p>
<p>So what should a local economic developer do with this information? Does it make sense to recruit large retailers, potentially offering financial incentives, or is it better to discourage such competition? Unfortunately, it is not an easy question. In previous years, potential host-town economic development officials fell into three camps: (a) most local governments simply welcomed the introduction of a WalMart store; (b) some were adamantly against it; and (c) a minority of local officials wanted a WalMart store so badly that they offered the company financial incentives to come to their towns. Generally, economists agree that incentives should only be used when they do not compromise the competitive position of other local firms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891242412461828">Stallmann and Ball (2002)</xref> state,
<disp-quote>
<p>To maintain competitive conditions, the public sector should avoid actions that directly favor one firm over another, often referred to as maintaining a level playing field. When the public sector takes actions that relax the rules or lower the costs of doing business specifically to benefit one firm, but not for all, it is adding a noncompetitive element to the business climate.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The empirical results from this analysis suggest that the practice of offering financial incentives to a company like WalMart fails this level-playing-field test because it captures a substantial amount of sales from existing local merchants. Some would further caution against the use of economic development incentives when one local economy benefits at others’ expense, contributing little to overall economic growth, and leading to greater economic disparity among communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891242412461828">Artz &amp; Stallmann, 2006</xref>). As noted above, in the case of retail, incentives may merely move sales from one community to another.</p>
<p>From the community’s point of view, however, offering incentives to retailers may make sense. One major factor in the decision to offer incentives is the fact that communities are increasingly dependent on revenues from sales taxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891242412461828">Krmenec, 1991</xref>). Thus, more retail means greater tax revenues. And, most local officials do not consider the effects on neighboring towns in their decision-making process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891242412461828">Ingraham et al. (2005)</xref> argue that as long as the incremental tax revenue from a proposed project exceeds the cost of subsidizing a retail development, it is in a city’s best interest to offer incentives.</p>
<p>Perhaps a more regional approach to retail development in rural areas could alleviate some of these concerns. Encouraging retail development can benefit rural consumers by offering greater convenience and variety and lower prices. Offsetting negative impacts within the region might be identified and, where appropriate, addressed. For example, WalMart could be encouraged to extend the geographic distribution of its local donations to smaller surrounding towns whose residents are likely to shop in the host communities, or host town officials might find ways to share the increased tax revenue generated by higher retail sales in the host community across affected communities.</p>
