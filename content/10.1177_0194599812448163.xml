<p>At no point in our commentary do we refute the projected physician shortage, nor do we question the possibility that otolaryngologist shortages are likely to occur. As we stated, “It is clear that with an aging population, expansion of coverage by health care reform, and an ever-increasing menu of services that allow us to live longer and healthier lives, the United States will need more physicians in general and more otolaryngologists in particular over the next decades.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812448163">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our concerns with the analysis by Kim, Cooper, and Kennedy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812448163">2</xref></sup> center first upon the assumption, built into the analysis, that an increasing proportion of female otolaryngologists will exacerbate the impending shortage. There are no current statistically valid data regarding the productivity of American female otolaryngologists referenced in the analysis that might support this assumption.</p>
<p>As cited in our commentary, there are sufficient data to conclude that the recent trend among physicians toward working fewer hours is more generational than gender based, and as acknowledged by Kim et al, if this trend continues, the difference in hours worked between male and female physicians will disappear in a few years. We continue to question the definition of “work output” and productivity strictly in terms of hours worked. Physician burnout results in decreased productivity as most would measure it. We contend that both physician well-being and patient satisfaction are, in fact, appropriate goals to pursue when planning for the future of medical care in the United States. Kim et al’s analysis, while centering on gender differences, failed to address physician workforce diversity, clinical practice redesign associated with the implementation of a patient-centered medical home, and geographic maldistribution, all of which are significant factors in patient access to care that must be addressed if we are to rise to the challenge of providing quality care to our entire population in the face of an anticipated physician shortage.</p>
<p>Younger physicians, both men and women, are making choices that recognize better work–life integration. In making this balance more difficult to achieve by laying blame on physician gender, nontraditional career paths, and schedules, we may exacerbate the shortage ourselves by discouraging potential physicians from entering medicine and potential otolaryngologists from entering our specialty.</p>
