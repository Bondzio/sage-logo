<abstract>
<p>Depressive symptoms are negatively associated with relationship satisfaction. The degree to which depression is associated longitudinally with relationship quality as assessed by both partners, versus with the depressed person’s unique view of the relationship, may have implications for interventions. Longitudinal associations between depressive symptoms and relationship satisfaction were examined among 260 couples. Individual measures of relationship satisfaction were decomposed into dyadic relationship quality and each partner’s additional unique view of the relationship. Depressive symptoms and dyadic relationship quality predicted changes in each other, which suggested that the longitudinal associations between depressive symptoms and relationship quality are not due to reporter biases or confounded by other individual factors, but rather that relationship quality and depressive symptoms affect each other over time.</p>

<body>
<p>A major issue in the relationship literature is how depressive symptoms can lead to dissatisfaction with the romantic relationship and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407512448264">Davila, Bradbury, Cohan, &amp; Tochluk, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0265407512448264">Whisman, 2001</xref>). There is substantial evidence showing that vicious cycles can arise where relationship dissatisfaction and depressive symptoms exacerbate each other over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407512448264">Davila, Karney, Hall, &amp; Bradbury, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407512448264">Kouros, Papp, &amp; Cummings, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265407512448264">Whisman &amp; Uebelacker, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265407512448264">Beach, Sandeen, and O'Leary (1990</xref>) argue that relationship dissatisfaction can lead to increased depressive symptoms by reduced support and increased levels of conflict. Depressive symptoms can again reduce relationship satisfaction. According to Hammen’s (1991) stress generation theory, depressed persons generate interpersonal stress by their symptoms and behavior. Depressive symptoms have indeed been found to be associated with social skills problems, increased criticism of the partner, reduced ability to resolve conflicts, excessive reassurance seeking, and other behaviors that can deteriorate the quality of intimate relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407512448264">Davila et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407512448264">Eberhart &amp; Hammen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407512448264">Hammen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265407512448264">Joiner &amp; Timmons, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265407512448264">Segrin, 2001</xref>). The aim of the current study was to increase our knowledge about the processes linking depressive symptoms and relationship satisfaction longitudinally. </p>
<sec id="section1-0265407512448264">
<title>Measuring relationship quality</title>
<p>Research on the associations between relationship satisfaction and depressive symptoms is heavily based on self-reports, which may be influenced by depressed mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265407512448264">Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407512448264">Hammen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0265407512448264">Whisman, Uebelacker, &amp; Weinstock, 2004</xref>). Correlations between individual measures of relationship satisfaction and depression thus raise theoretical questions regarding whether qualities of the relationships lead to depression, or whether the correlations are due to reporter biases or other individual characteristics. Measures of one partner’s relationship satisfaction confound qualities of individuals and qualities of the relationship. Information from both partners should therefore be used when studying relationship quality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0265407512448264">
<title>Dyadic relationship quality</title>
<p>Two partners’ evaluations of relationship satisfaction typically correlate between .40 and .80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265407512448264">Watson, Hubbard, &amp; Wiese, 2000</xref>). This suggests that partners are synchronized in their perceptions of their relationship – when one person holds a relatively positive view, the other is also likely to adopt a positive view. Information from both partners makes it possible to capture this synchronized view in a latent factor. This factor will be referred to as dyadic relationship quality in this paper. This factor reflects the degree to which two partners covary in their satisfaction with the relationship, regardless of the sources of their satisfaction/dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>The more synchronized couples are in their degree of satisfaction with the relationship, the more of the variance in the individual relationship satisfaction measures will be explained by this dyadic factor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0265407512448264">
<title>Unique relationship satisfaction</title>
<p>The dyadic relationship factor only captures the two partners’ synchronized view of the relationship. Their views of the relationship are far from perfectly correlated, indicating that each partner in addition has his or her own unique perspective of the relationship. These unique perspectives can be modeled as two uncorrelated latent factors, which will be referred to as unique relationship satisfaction in this paper. These unique relationship satisfaction factors capture the residual variance in the individual measures after the dyadic relationship quality factor is adjusted for. By using first-order latent factors of individual relationship satisfaction to construct second-order latent factors of unique relationship satisfaction and dyadic relationship quality, random errors of measurement will not be included in any of the second-order latent factors.</p>
<p>The unique relationship satisfaction factors will reflect everything that contributes to reduced correlation between the partners’ individual measures of relationship satisfaction. Unique relationship satisfaction may arise because the two partners react differently to quarrels or other experiences in the relationship. One partner may think they spend too little time together while the other partner does not see it that way. Unique relationship satisfaction can arise because the partners have different expectations of the relationship or because of mood biases due to depression, for example. Unique relationship satisfaction can also arise because the two partners treat each other differently.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0265407512448264">
<title>Associations between depressive symptoms and dyadic relationship quality</title>
<p>A longitudinal association between dyadic relationship quality and later depressive symptoms would indicate that both partners identify poor relationship quality that increases depressive symptoms in both or one of the partners. Such a finding would strongly suggest that relationship quality really affects depressive symptoms and would also suggest that both partners’ view of the relationship will be important for intervention strategies.</p>
<p>One partner’s depressive symptoms can again reduce dyadic relationship quality, as depression is associated with social skills problems and negative behavior towards others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407512448264">Davila et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407512448264">Hammen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512448264">Herr, Hammen, &amp; Brennan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265407512448264">Segrin, 2001</xref>). If depressive symptoms predict reduced dyadic relationship quality over time, interventions should focus on how depression can lead to relationship problems and help couples improve relationship quality rather than only focusing on changing the depressed person’s cognitions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0265407512448264">
<title>Associations between depressive symptoms and unique relationship satisfaction</title>
<p>Low levels of unique relationship satisfaction can increase depressive symptoms if, for example, only one partner feels that he or she gets too little support in the relationship and this feeling of lack of support leads to depression. Negative unique perceptions of the relationship can be due to unrealistic expectations or to reactions to actual negative behavior from the other partner. An association between low unique relationship satisfaction and increased depressive symptoms should thus not automatically be interpreted to mean that the dissatisfied person has an unrealistically negative view of the relationship. Rather, interventions need to help him or her explore why the negative evaluation of the relationship increases depression.</p>
<p>Depression can again reduce unique relationship satisfaction, because depressed mood or depressed thinking may lead the person to view the relationship in a negative way. Further, unique relationship satisfaction can be reduced due to unrealistic needs for insurance associated with depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0265407512448264">Davila, Stroud, &amp; Starr, 2009</xref>). If depressive symptoms predict reduced unique relationship satisfaction over time, intervention strategies should target the depressed person’s symptoms to prevent reduced relationship satisfaction over time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0265407512448264">
<title>Bidirectional effects</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that regarding within-partner effects, relationship satisfaction tends to predict changes in depressive symptoms equally well as depressive symptoms predict changes in relationship satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407512448264">Davila et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265407512448264">Dehle &amp; Weiss, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265407512448264">Karney, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407512448264">Kouros et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265407512448264">Whisman &amp; Uebelacker, 2009</xref>). Regarding cross-partner effects, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265407512448264">Whisman and Uebelacker (2009</xref>) reported that one partner’s depression predicted changes in the other partner’s relationship satisfaction, while one partner’s relationship satisfaction did not predict changes in the other partner’s depression. However, others have reported that one partner’s relationship satisfaction predicted changes in the other partner’s depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265407512448264">Beach, Katz, Kim, &amp; Brody, 2003</xref>). Together, previous findings indicate that paths in both directions are involved in cross-partner processes. However, there have been no tests of differences across direction in models including dyadic relationship quality.</p>
<p>Dyadic relationship quality is not affected by transient fluctuations in one of the partners, but reflects relationship qualities that both partners evaluate in similar ways. It can thus be hypothesized that the paths from dyadic relationship quality to each partner’s later depressive symptoms will be stronger than the paths from each partner’s depressive symptoms to later dyadic relationship quality. A stronger path from dyadic relationship quality to later depressive symptoms than from depressive symptoms to later dyadic relationship quality would indicate that interventions should focus especially on relationship quality. A stronger path from depressive symptoms to later dyadic relationship quality than from dyadic relationship quality to depressive symptoms would suggest that interventions should focus especially on an individual’s depressive symptoms. Equally strong paths in both directions would indicate that both depressive symptoms and relationship quality should be addressed.</p>

<sec id="section7-0265407512448264">
<title>Gender differences</title>
<p>Correlations between relationship satisfaction and concurrent depressive symptoms tend to be stronger among women than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0265407512448264">Whisman, 2001</xref>), even though most studies have failed to find gender differences in the longitudinal associations between one partner’s relationship satisfaction and his or her depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265407512448264">Beach et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407512448264">Kouros et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265407512448264">Whisman &amp; Uebelacker, 2009</xref>). Stress generation in romantic relationships has been found to be stronger among women than among men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407512448264">Davila et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512448264">Herr et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, it is often assumed that men are less affected than women by the quality of romantic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407512448264">Levenson, Carstensen, &amp; Gottman, 1993</xref>). It is therefore important to examine whether dyadic relationship quality is more strongly linked to women’s than to men’s depressive symptoms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0265407512448264">
<title>Personality as a confounder</title>
<p>Depression-prone persons have been found to generate interpersonal stress even when they are not currently depressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265407512448264">Hammen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512448264">Herr et al., 2007</xref>). This indicates that stress generation could be more heavily associated with personality than with depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265407512448264">Hammen, 2005</xref>). The personality trait neuroticism/negative emotionality is indeed found to be associated with poor relationship quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407512448264">Malouff, Thorsteinsson, Schutte, Bhullar, &amp; Rooke, 2010</xref>), as well as with increased risk for depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0265407512448264">Klein, Durbin, &amp; Shankman, 2009</xref>). The association between depressive symptoms and reduced relationship quality may thus be partly or fully confounded by neuroticism. Further studies are therefore needed to examine the longitudinal association between depressive symptoms and relationship quality when controlling for the effects of neuroticism in order to be able to identify the specific effects of depressive symptoms on relationship quality.</p>

<title>Aim of the current study</title>
<p>The current study was guided by the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0265407512448264">Figure 1</xref>. This model was developed to formally test the degree to which depressive symptoms are related to dyadic relationship quality versus to unique relationship satisfaction over time. The model was also developed to formally test possible differences in the magnitude of the effect of depression on later relationship satisfaction versus the effect of dyadic relationship satisfaction on later depression. Possible gender differences were also tested.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section11-0265407512448264">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Data from the longitudinal TOPP study (Tracking Opportunities and Problems) were used. The study started in 1993 when mothers in Eastern Norway, attending 19 different community health care centers with their 18-month-old children, were asked to participate (t1). About 95% of all families with children in these areas attended the health care centers. Of the invited parents, 87% (<italic>n</italic> = 929) answered the questionnaires at t1: 913 were women and 16 were men. The mothers received further questionnaires by mail before attending the centers again for routine control when children were 2–3 years (t2) and 4 years (t3) old, and were asked to return them to staff when attending the centers. Questionnaires were later sent by mail to mothers when the children were aged 8 years (t4), 12–13 years (t5), 14–15 years (t6), and 16–17 years (t7). At t6 and t7, mothers were asked to forward separate questionnaires to the fathers, who were asked to complete and return them.</p>
<p>The current study used data from the fathers’ and mothers’ t6 and t7 questionnaires, in this study referred to as baseline and follow-up, respectively. This study only included information from couples that were still together at t7 and where at least one of the partners had answered at both baseline and at two-year follow-up. Responses from 260 couples were thus included in the analysis. This included responses from 259 women and 222 men at baseline and from 258 women and 215 men at follow-up. Attrition analysis was performed using logistic regression with 16 variables from the first wave of data collection in 1993 as predictors and the couples’ participation in the current study as outcome. Women’s temperamental emotionality and activity, their children’s temperament, women’s relationship to their partners and to family and friends, their symptoms of anxiety and depression, working status, and financial situation did not predict which couples participated in the current study. High educational level, high age, and low scores on temperamental sociability among the women predicted participation in the current study. High educational level remained a significant predictor of participation even after adjusting for multiple tests (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05/16), while high age and low temperamental sociability did not.</p>
<p>Missingness was handled by full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation, allowing use of all available data. Information from all 260 couples was thus used in the analyses even when only one of the partners had responded. T-tests showed that at baseline women with responding partners did not differ from women with non-responding partners regarding relationship satisfaction or depressive symptoms (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). At follow-up women with responding partners had higher levels of relationship satisfaction and lower levels of depressive symptoms compared to women with non-responding partners. The effect sizes were small to medium according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265407512448264">Cohen (1988</xref>). Men’s non-responses at follow-up were thus related to women’s observed variables, which is in accordance with the Missing At Random (MAR) assumption that allows missingness to be a function of observed outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265407512448264">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2010</xref>). Including responses from women with non-responding partners thus allowed analyses to account for the difference between women with and without responding partners.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0265407512448264">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>At baseline and follow-up both partners answered five questions from the Relationship Assessment Scale (RAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265407512448264">Hendrick, 1988</xref>) (e.g., “How well does your partner meet your needs?”, “To what extent has your relationship met your original expectations?”). The items were rated on a five-point scale. Mean scores of these five items were computed, ranging from 1 representing low relationship satisfaction to 5 indicating high satisfaction. Cronbach’s alpha was .84 at baseline and .87 at follow-up for men and .90 and .91, respectively, for women.</p>
<p>At both time points, both partners completed the depression sub-scale from the 25-item version of the Hopkins Symptom Check List (HSCL-25) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265407512448264">Hesbacher, Rickels, Morris, Newman, &amp; Rosenfeld, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0265407512448264">Winokur, Winokur, Rickels, &amp; Cox, 1984</xref>). This sub-scale consists of 15 questions, but one question (about sexual interest) was omitted because of negative reactions from participants in the pilot study. The response scale was from 1 = not distressed at all to 4 = very much distressed. The reliability and validity of the HSCL have been found to be sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0265407512448264">Deane, Leathem, &amp; Spicer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407512448264">Tambs &amp; Moum, 1993</xref>). Cronbach’s alpha for men was .84 at baseline and .88 at two-year follow-up, and .88 at both time points for women.</p>
<p>Neuroticism/negative emotionality was assessed with the Emotionality, Activity, and Sociability Temperament Questionnaire (EAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265407512448264">Buss &amp; Plomin, 1984</xref>). Temperamental negative emotionality is equivalent to the personality trait neuroticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265407512448264">Clark &amp; Watson, 2008</xref>) and reflects the tendency to experience the world as threatening or distressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265407512448264">Caspi, Roberts, &amp; Shiner, 2005</xref>). Men and women answered the eight questions in the fear and distress sub-scales of the EAS at baseline. All items were measured on a five-point scale ranging from ‘not typical’ to ‘very typical.’ An examination of the factor structure, reliability, and stability of the EAS with the TOPP data set has shown acceptable psychometric properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265407512448264">Naerde, Roysamb, &amp; Tambs, 2004</xref>). Cronbach’s alpha was .84 for women and .78 for men.</p>
<p>Sociodemographic variables included both partners’ age, years of education, employment status, and family income. Years of education was rated on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 representing nine years or less at school and 5 representing four or more years at university.

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Analyses were run in SPSS and in Mplus Version 6 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265407512448264">Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2010</xref>). Three outliers were excluded from the analyses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407512448264">Kenny, Kashy, and Cook (2006</xref>) have described use of structural equation modeling (SEM) as an appropriate approach for analysis of dyadic data.</p>
<p>The Robust Maximum Likelihood (MLR) estimator was used for analyses in Mplus. This estimator provides standard errors that are robust to non-normality in that data. χ<sup>2</sup>-values obtained from the MLR estimator cannot be used for Δχ<sup>2</sup>-testing of nested models, because the differences between them are not χ<sup>2</sup>-distributed. Adjusted Δχ<sup>2</sup>-values were thus used in difference testing of nested models, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265407512448264">Satorra and Bentler (2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Items were standardized and grouped into parcels in order to heighten the reliability of the indicators and to reduce the item/subject ratio, thereby increasing stability of solutions and reducing the risk of specifying sample-specific models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0265407512448264">Little, Cunningham, Shahar, &amp; Widaman, 2002</xref>). Items measuring relationship satisfaction were grouped into three parcels, two parcels consisting of two items and one parcel consisting of one item. Items measuring depressive symptoms were also grouped into three parcels, two parcels with five items and one consisting of four items. Scree plots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407512448264">Cattell, 1978</xref>) from exploratory factor analyses showed that both relationship satisfaction and depressive symptoms were best explained as unidimensional phenomena, and items were thus randomly assigned to parcels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0265407512448264">Little et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<p>For relationship satisfaction, a factor structure was then modeled with three second-order factors based on the first-order latent factors of individual relationship satisfaction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0265407512448264">Figure 2</xref>). The latent factors of individual relationship satisfaction were thereby decomposed into dyadic relationship quality and each partner’s additional unique relationship satisfaction. Random errors of measurement were removed already in the first-order latent factors of individual relationship satisfaction and were thus not included in any of the second-order latent factors. The three second-order factors were constrained to be uncorrelated, and together they captured all of the variance in the first-order latent factors of individual relationship satisfaction. Dyadic relationship quality and unique relationship satisfaction each explained about 50% of the variance in the individual relationship satisfaction factor at baseline. The partners thus had a substantial synchronized view of the relationship, as well as substantial unique views.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The longitudinal association between individual measures of relationship satisfaction and depressive symptoms was explained by the dyadic relationship quality factor, not the unique relationship satisfaction factors. The results thus highlight the usefulness of decomposing relationship satisfaction into its dyadic and unique parts to understand the longitudinal associations between relationship quality and depressive symptoms. The results also indicate that longitudinal associations between relationship satisfaction and depressive symptoms are unlikely to be due to reporter bias or otherwise confounded by qualities of the individuals, but rather that relationship quality and depressive symptoms actually affect each other over time. There were no gender differences and no differences in magnitude across direction in these bidirectional effects.</p>
<sec id="section18-0265407512448264">
<title>Relationship quality and depressive symptoms</title>
<p>We have extended previous knowledge on longitudinal associations between relationship satisfaction and depressive symptoms by using information from both partners to model a dyadic measure of relationship quality. The measure used in this research captured the correlation between the two partners’ individual relationship satisfaction measures and thus reflected the partners’ synchronized view of the relationship. Dyadic relationship quality and unique relationship satisfaction explained equally much of the variance in the individual relationship satisfaction measures. The current results are thus not due to lack of variance in the unique relationship satisfaction measures. Further, the unique relationship satisfaction factors did not consist of random errors of measurement, as they were based on first-order latent factors where random errors already were removed. The results were thus not due to lack of reliability of the unique relationship satisfaction factors.</p>
<p>Baseline depressive symptoms were associated with concurrent dyadic relationship quality, as well as with concurrent unique relationship satisfaction. The longitudinal results showed that despite the correlation between unique relationship satisfaction and concurrent depressive symptoms, unique relationship satisfaction did not predict changes in depressive symptoms over time. Only dyadic relationship quality predicted changes in depressive symptoms. Our findings therefore indicate that even though each partner indeed has his/her unique view of the relationship in addition to their synchronized view, private views of the relationship do not lead to increased depressive symptoms over time. This suggests that both partners identify poor relationship quality that is serious enough to increase depressive symptoms in one or both partners. The findings thus strongly suggest that relationship quality actually affects depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>The longitudinal results also showed that depressive symptoms predicted changes in the two partners’ synchronized view of the relationship over time, but not in each partner’s additional unique view of the relationship. Together, the cross-sectional and longitudinal results suggest that even though relatively private depressive processes, such as negative thinking and mood bias, may partly explain the cross-sectional association between depressive symptoms and relationship satisfaction, the longitudinal effects of depressive symptoms on relationship satisfaction seem to involve depressive processes that are identified as negative by both partners in a longer time frame. The current findings could be interpreted to mean that more private depressive symptoms over time develop into observable behaviors, such as criticism, withdrawal, or other behaviors, that make both partners evaluate relationship quality as deteriorated. Such behaviors are indeed found to be associated with depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407512448264">Davila et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407512448264">Eberhart &amp; Hammen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407512448264">Hammen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265407512448264">Joiner &amp; Timmons, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265407512448264">Segrin, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Another possible explanation for the effect from one person’s depression to dyadic relationship satisfaction is that one person’s depressive symptoms affect both partners’ relationship satisfaction, but through different processes. The depressed person’s relationship satisfaction can be negatively affected by intrapersonal processes, such as rumination, whereas the other partner’s relationship satisfaction may be affected equally much by negative behavior from the depressed person. Further studies are needed to examine different processes directly to learn more about this. However, regardless of the processes involved, the current results show that the partners’ synchronized view of the relationship is affected by one partner’s depressive symptoms. The findings therefore imply that interventions should help couples avoid relationship problems rather than only focusing on changing the depressed person’s cognitions.</p>
<p>SES, age, and neuroticism are possible confounders of the associations between relationship quality and depressive symptoms. However, the present findings cannot be attributed to the effect of SES, age, and neuroticism, which strengthens the notion that relationship quality and depressive symptoms do affect each other over time.</p>

<title>Magnitude of the bidirectional effects</title>
<p>The cross-lagged paths between each partner’s depressive symptoms and dyadic relationship quality were equally strong in both directions. This is in accordance with existing knowledge about within-partner and cross-partner effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265407512448264">Beach et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407512448264">Kouros et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265407512448264">Whisman &amp; Uebelacker, 2009</xref>) and suggests that interventions should address both depressive symptoms and relationship quality.</p>
<p>Earlier studies have not tested differences across direction in models including dyadic relationship quality. Dyadic relationship quality is not affected by short-term fluctuations in one partner and was thus hypothesized to predict changes in depressive symptoms more strongly than each partner’s depressive symptoms would predict changes in dyadic relationship quality. However, our findings showed that each partner’s depressive symptoms predicted changes in dyadic relationship quality equally well as dyadic relationship quality predicted changes in depressive symptoms. The unexpected finding of equality across direction in these cross-lagged paths suggests that the effect of depressive symptoms on relationship quality is of great importance. The very low value (.38) from the Δχ<sup>2</sup>-test indicates that lack of power due to a relatively small sample size was not the reason for non-significant difference across direction in these paths. Intervention strategies should thus be designed to address the effects of depressive symptoms on relationship quality. This could be done in couples’ therapy and/or in individual therapy that addresses how depression affects both partners in a relationship. Couples’ therapy has proven to be effective for both relationship quality and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265407512448264">Beach, Fincham, &amp; Katz, 1998</xref>) and might thus be especially beneficial.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0265407512448264">
<title>Gender differences</title>
<p>There were no gender differences in the longitudinal associations between relationship quality and depression. This is in accordance with earlier findings that one partner’s depressive symptoms and relationship satisfaction affect him or herself, as well as the other partner, regardless of gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265407512448264">Beach et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407512448264">Kouros et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265407512448264">Whisman &amp; Uebelacker, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have not tested gender differences in models containing dyadic relationship quality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407512448264">Herr and colleagues (2007</xref>) found that depression and poor marital functioning were more strongly associated for women than for men. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407512448264">Davila and colleagues (1997</xref>) found depressive symptoms to be associated with concurrent negative behavior towards spouse in women, but not in men, among newlywed couples. However, our results indicate that among established couples, relationship quality is affected equally much regardless of whether a man or a woman is depressed. Our findings further contradict previous assumptions that men are less affected than women by the quality of the romantic relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407512448264">Levenson et al., 1993</xref>), because changes in men and women’s depressive symptoms were equally well predicted by relationship quality. Intervention strategies for troubled couples should thus focus on reducing depressive symptoms in both men and women and focus on how relationship quality affects them both. Couples’ therapy focuses on both reducing depression and improving relationship quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265407512448264">Beach, 2001</xref>), and our findings indicate that such therapy can be relevant regardless of whether a man or a women seeks help for depression or relationship dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Depressive symptoms showed greater stability among men than among women. This is in accordance with findings from two previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265407512448264">Beach et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0265407512448264">Fincham, Beach, Harold, &amp; Osborne, 1997</xref>).</p>

<title>Limitations and future directions</title>
<p>This study has sought to advance existing understanding of the longitudinal association between relationship satisfaction and depressive symptoms by including information from both partners and using methods that allowed separating dyadic relationship quality and each partner’s additional unique relationship satisfaction. Further, we have used a population-based sample that represents the situation for most couples. Nevertheless, there are some factors that may limit representativeness of the findings.</p>
<p>Firstly, the relatively high attrition rates since the study started in 1993 may compromise the representativeness of the sample. However, attrition analyses showed that symptoms of depression and anxiety and evaluation of the relationship did not predict participation in this study. High educational level was the strongest predictor of participating in the study, and the model was adjusted for socioeconomic variables. Nevertheless, replication in a sample with better coverage of lower SES couples would be beneficial. More women than men responded, and it was shown that women with responding partners differed somewhat from women with non-responding partners. However, all available responses were included in the analyses, which thus were allowed to account for these differences. Secondly, only two waves of data were analyzed here because information from men was only available at the two last data collections. It would be valuable to explore whether the pattern we have found also applies over longer periods of time and in other age periods. Thirdly, if the effects of depressive symptoms on dyadic relationship quality and vice versa are manifested sooner than our two-year time span, these effects may be under-estimated in our model. However, the fact that bidirectional associations were found over the two-year period for both men and women indicates that such effects may be long lasting. On the other hand, the stability in both relationship satisfaction and depressive symptoms was relatively high, as expected within a two-year period, thus leaving little change to be explained. Further studies should therefore examine the associations between depressive symptoms and dyadic relationship quality within different time spans to increase knowledge on when the effect of one on the other manifests itself most strongly.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results indicate that reducing depressive symptoms can have positive effects on relationship quality and that helping couples improve relationship quality can have positive effects on depressive symptoms. Our findings indicate that even though partners do have different expectations and experiences in their relationship, both partners identify poor relationship quality that is related to depression over time. The findings thus strongly suggest that relationship quality and depressive symptoms affect each other over time.</p>
