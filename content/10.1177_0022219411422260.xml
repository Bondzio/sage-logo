<abstract>
<p>In this article the authors report a meta-analysis that examines the association between internalizing problems (anxiety and depressive symptoms) and learning disabilities (LD) in adults. Two hypotheses about the relationship between internalizing problems and LD in adults are posited and tested: the abeyance hypothesis (internalizing problems decline in adulthood) and the continuance hypothesis (internalizing problems continue in adulthood). From an initial pool of 171 relevant studies, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria, with eight published articles and seven dissertations yielding 48 effect sizes, <italic>N</italic><sub>Total</sub> = 16,239). The overall effect size was significant and of medium magnitude (<italic>d</italic> = 0.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Results from the study suggest support for the continuance hypothesis, with rates of adult internalizing problems similar to those found in studies of children and adolescents with LD. Moderating variables are explored, and implications for practice and research are offered.</p>

<p>The specific learning problems associated with learning disabilities (LD) often persist from childhood and adolescence into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022219411422260">Shaywitz, Morris, &amp; Shaywitz, 2008</xref>). Indeed, current definitions of LD state, “learning disabilities are lifelong” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022219411422260">Learning Disabilities Association of Canada [LDAC], n.d.</xref>), and recent longitudinal studies show, for example, that specific reading difficulties diagnosed at age 10 continue to be manifested at age 16 and age 23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219411422260">Undheim, 2009</xref>). Academic problems identified in children with LD may interfere with attainment levels in college and reduce vocational options in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219411422260">Gregg, 2007</xref>; although for a contrasting viewpoint, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022219411422260">Seo, Abbott, &amp; Hawkins, 2008</xref>). However, LDs affect more than academic outcomes: Evidence from recent studies shows that children and adolescents with LD show lower levels of emotional well-being and higher levels of internalizing problems (anxiety and depression; see <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022219411422260">Note 1</xref>) than children and adolescents without LD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411422260">Greenham, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022219411422260">Halonen, Aunola, Ahonen, &amp; Nurmi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411422260">Maag &amp; Reid, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411422260">Nelson &amp; Harwood, 2011</xref>). The social and psychological impacts associated with childhood LD may continue to play a role in later life, but the links between LD and anxiety and depression in adulthood are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022219411422260">Davis, Nida, Zlomke, &amp; Nebel-Schwalm, 2009</xref>). No systematic review has examined whether or not adults with LD exhibit higher levels of anxiety and depression than their non-LD (NLD) peers. Thus, the purpose of this article is to address this gap in research knowledge by reporting a meta-analysis that synthesizes research comparing the internalizing problems (anxiety and depression) of adults with and without LD.</p>

<title>Learning Difficulties and Internalizing Problems</title>
<p>Learning difficulties pose a risk factor for the mental health of children and adolescents (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411422260">Mugnaini, Lassi, La Malfa, &amp; Albertini, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219411422260">Patel, Flisher, Hetrick, &amp; McGorry, 2007</xref>) and, in particular, are associated with high levels of internalizing problems, such as anxiety and depression. The relationship between learning problems and internalizing problems in children and adolescents is not surprising given the primacy of school experiences in shaping the social, emotional, and mental health functioning of young people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022219411422260">Waters, Cross, &amp; Shaw, 2010</xref>). In the reciprocal development view of LD and psychosocial maladjustment, repeated academic failures by children with LD result in feelings of inferiority and helplessness, which in turn lead to further academic failures and a continuing cycle of psychosocial maladjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411422260">Greenham, 1999</xref>). According to developmental health theories, environmental factors such as academic stressors associated with schooling interact with biological predispositions to negative affectivity, resulting in anxiety and depression in children and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219411422260">Zahn-Waxler, Klimes-Dougan, &amp; Slattery, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Learning difficulties may not be the only factor contributing to the increased rates of internalizing problems in individuals with LD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411422260">Nelson and Harwood (2011)</xref> highlighted the relationship between cognitive processing and anxiety, with information processing, metacognition, and working memory influenced by high levels of anxiety. In the cognitive processing-anxiety model, high levels of anxiety lower capacity for the cognitive tasks required in reading and other academic domains, leading to negative educational outcomes and reduced employment opportunities (and consequent depression) in adulthood. Similarly, deficits in executive functioning have been implicated as a causal factor in LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219411422260">Alloway, 2009</xref>), in the overlap of LD and ADHD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022219411422260">Mayes &amp; Calhoun, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022219411422260">Tiffin-Richards, Hasselhorn, Woerner, Rothenberger, &amp; Banaschewski, 2008</xref>), and in the incidence and severity of anxiety and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219411422260">Castaneda, Tuulio-Henriksson, Marttunen, Suvisaari, &amp; Lönnqvist, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411422260">McDermott &amp; Ebmeier, 2009</xref>). However, the links between executive functioning and internalizing disorders in children with LD are unclear: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219411422260">Mattison and Mayes (in press)</xref> found children with LD to exhibit lower levels of executive functioning than children without LD, but no differences in levels of teacher- and parent-reported anxiety and depression. Deficits in executive functioning may present most obviously as learning problems in school settings in children and youth, but more strongly as internalizing problems in adulthood.</p>
<p>LDs are associated with low self-esteem (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022219411422260">Terras, Thompson, &amp; Minnis, 2009</xref>), and low self-esteem identified in childhood and adolescence prospectively predicts depression in later life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219411422260">Orth, Robins, &amp; Roberts, 2008</xref>). The negative emotions stemming from learning problems may be associated with early internalizing problems such as school-related anxiety, with the relationship between learning problems and psychological distress potentially continuing on or worsening in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022219411422260">Boetsch, Green, &amp; Pennington, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219411422260">Orth et al., 2008</xref>). Psychological problems in adulthood often evolve from subclinical problems in childhood and adolescence, with patterns of change dependent on a variety of internal and environmental factors influencing outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219411422260">Zahn-Waxler et al., 2000</xref>). However, the persistence of internalizing problems in adults with LD is underexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022219411422260">Davis et al., 2009</xref>), with the preponderance of research examining the relationship of LD and internalizing problems in childhood and adolescence.</p>
<p>The empirical relationship between LD and internalizing disorders such as anxiety and depression in childhood and adolescence are well established, with recent meta-analyses showing that school-aged children and adolescents with LD display higher levels of anxiety and depression than their NLD peers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411422260">Nelson and Harwood’s 2011</xref> study of anxiety in school-aged children and adolescents revealed significantly higher rates of anxiety in students with LD (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.61), although there was considerable heterogeneity among the studies. No significant moderation effects were found for participant gender or school level (elementary vs. middle or high school); however, significant moderation effects were found for informant type, with higher anxiety symptomatology found for teacher reports than for self-reports. In their comparison of scores on depression inventories for K–12 students with and without LD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411422260">Maag and Reid (2006)</xref> calculated an overall weighted mean effect size of 0.35 (higher depressive symptoms in students with LD) from the 14 studies in the meta-analysis, with a range of −0.17 to 0.90. The authors did not report testing of moderation effects but suggested provisional evidence for the moderating effects of gender, age, and setting.</p>

<title>Abeyance and Continuance Hypotheses</title>
<p>Two developmental hypotheses of the LD-internalizing problems relationship are suggested from the research literature. First, the <italic>abeyance hypothesis</italic> suggests that psychological problems associated with LD may decline in adulthood. Children and adolescents with LD may experience higher levels of anxiety and depression than their NLD peers while in school as a direct result of academic-related stressors, but the adverse effects of LD on internalizing disorders may lessen in adulthood with the advent of more freedom to choose pathways that do not expose academic weaknesses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022219411422260">Boetsch et al., 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411422260">Raskind, Goldberg, Higgins, and Herman (1999)</xref> followed cohorts of children and adolescents with LD over 20 years, with participants reporting that having an LD was the key stressor for their lives while in school, outweighing other social and environmental factors. Participants in the Raskind et al. study reported that life stress from LD was highest during school years because of not only academic challenges but also social pressures related to school changes, making friends, and difficulties with socializing. According to respondents, the overall impact of the LD lessened in adolescence and again in adulthood, perhaps resulting from increased control over decision making, along with increased opportunity to avoid or compensate for the specific literacy and numeracy skills associated with LD.</p>
<p>A second hypothesized trajectory—the <italic>continuance hypothesis</italic>—proposes that the incidence and impact of internalizing problems may continue after adolescence, and even worsen in adulthood (see <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022219411422260">Note 2</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411422260">Raskind et al.’s 1999</xref> study, although participants reported the academic impact of LD lessening in adulthood, they also reported a high incidence of emotional and psychological problems (including depression, anxiety, social phobias, and obsessive-compulsive disorders), even though none of the participants had initial diagnoses of emotional disturbance in childhood. The authors noted that the direct effects of a specific LD on psychological functioning might decline in adulthood (i.e., anxiety relating to school functioning should lessen on leaving school) but that the indirect effects of the disability might increase (e.g., depressive symptoms may increase because of reduced vocational opportunities). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411422260">Wilson, Armstrong, Furrie, and Walcot (2009)</xref> examined rates of psychological and social problems in a large representative sample of Canadians with and without LD and found significantly lower household income, social support, and emotional support in individuals with LD, in addition to higher levels of emotional distress, depression, and anxiety than in individuals without LD. Moreover, the rate of mental health problems, already higher in adolescents with LD than in adolescents without LD, increased across age groups, with older respondents with LD reporting poorer mental health outcomes than younger participants with LD.</p>
<p>The continuance hypothesis includes the possibility of not only a continuation of childhood internalizing problems into adulthood but also an <italic>increase</italic> in the severity of these problems. In addition to facing the everyday challenges posed by adult life, adults with LD in the general population face the loss of the support system offered in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411422260">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>), fewer coping and stress-reduction strategies than adults without LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022219411422260">Hoy et al., 1997</xref>), continuing or escalating difficulties with literacy tasks required in day-to-day living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022219411422260">Shaywitz et al., 2008</xref>), and vocational restrictions stemming from poor academic record and restricted participation in postsecondary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219411422260">Gregg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411422260">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>). Together, this cluster of challenges associated with continuing learning difficulties faced in adulthood could feasibly result in increased incidence of internalizing problems in adults with LD.</p>
<p>Increasing evidence suggests that the internalizing problems associated with LD not only may be the result of a history of academic difficulties but also may stem from underlying deficits in cognitive and executive functioning shown to be associated with academic functioning <italic>and</italic> with mental health (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411422260">McDermott &amp; Ebmeier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022219411422260">Tiffin-Richards et al., 2008</xref>). If so, the absence of formal schooling and consequent reduction in school-related stress in adulthood may not result in a reduction of internalizing problems in individuals with LD but a continuation or worsening of these problems. Executive dysfunction is associated with academic difficulties and internalizing problems in childhood and adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219411422260">Mattison &amp; Mayes, in press</xref>), but the association with internalizing problems continues into adulthood (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219411422260">Castaneda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411422260">McDermott &amp; Ebmeier, 2009</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411422260">Raskind et al. (1999)</xref> reported that academic skills was not the most critical factor associated with broadly defined life success for adults with a history of LD; rather, personality and affective variables, such as reactivity and emotional stability, were most closely associated with success in adulthood. A continuation or increase of internalizing problems in adults with LD may be associated with factors beyond academic difficulties.</p>

<sec id="section4-0022219411422260">
<title>Internalizing Problems in Postsecondary Students With LD</title>
<p>For postsecondary students, the internalizing problems associated with LD may decline because of the increased freedom to choose classes and areas of study that match academic strengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411422260">Goldberg, Higgins, Raskind, &amp; Herman, 2003</xref>), the continuing availability of academic support for many postsecondary students with LD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219411422260">Rath &amp; Royer, 2002</xref>), and the self-selection of students who display higher levels of the success attributes (e.g., self-advocacy) necessary to function successfully in college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411422260">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>). However, a convincing body of research points out that postsecondary students with LD may experience continuing academic stress in college because of relatively lower implementation of learning strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411422260">Kirby, Silvestri, Allingham, Parrila, &amp; La Fave, 2008</xref>), low levels of academic motivation and metacognitive self-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219411422260">Klassen, Krawchuk, Lynch, &amp; Rajani, 2008</xref>), and low metacognitive awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219411422260">Butler, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411422260">Wilson et al.’s (2009)</xref> study of mental health of Canadians with LD revealed an ambiguous relationship between postsecondary schooling and mental health, and overall little is known about whether the internalizing problems of postsecondary students with LD differ from the general adult population with LD.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section5-0022219411422260">
<title>Purpose of Study</title>
<p>A review of the relevant research supports the relationship between LD and internalizing problems in children and adolescents, but no synthesis of the results of studies examining the relationship for adults with and without LD has been conducted. The first purpose of this study was to examine support for two hypotheses—abeyance and continuance—explaining the relationship between adult LD and internalizing problems. The second purpose was to explore the empirical literature on internalizing problems—anxiety and depression—of adults with and without LD to establish the magnitude of difference, if any, between the two groups. We chose to direct our search at both anxiety and depression in adults with LD for three reasons: (a) anxiety and depression show high (often more than 90%) comorbidity in childhood and adulthood, with shared elements of general emotional distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411422260">van Lang, Ferdinand, Ormel, &amp; Verhulst, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219411422260">Zahn-Waxler et al., 2000</xref>); (b) internalizing disorders (anxiety and depression) of individuals with LD have previously been studied in tandem (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022219411422260">Hoy et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219411422260">Miller, Hynd, &amp; Miller, 2005</xref>); and (c) there is a relatively small pool of anxiety and depression research available on adults with LD. The third purpose of the study was to examine potential moderating effects on the internalizing problems of adults with LD.</p>

<sec id="section7-0022219411422260">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data collection was conducted in fall 2010 and spring 2011. Four inclusion criteria were used to select the studies. First, we decided to search for articles published in peer-reviewed journals as well as in (unpublished) dissertations to maximize the sample of data-based articles and to reduce publication bias. Second, the study included adults with LD defined as aged 18 or older. We included adults attending postsecondary institutions and adults from the general population. Third, studies had to include groups of participants with LD and a control group without LD. Fourth, studies had to include a measure for LD and NLD groups of an internalizing problem such as <italic>anxiety</italic> or <italic>depressive symptoms</italic>.</p>
<p>Our search terms were <italic>anxiety, depression, depressive symptoms</italic>, and <italic>internalizing disorders</italic>, along with the linking terms of <italic>learning disability, learning disabled</italic>, and <italic>dyslexia/dyslexic</italic>. We searched the online databases PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Educational Resources Information Center, Google Scholar, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses to locate pertinent literature. To increase the number of studies, we searched these databases with no date restrictions. Next, we reviewed the reference lists of the retrieved articles to identify additional studies after the database search. Our search procedures resulted in 171 relevant studies: 137 journal articles and 34 dissertations.</p>
<p>The following exclusion criteria were applied to refine the samples of studies located. First, all case studies and qualitative studies were excluded. Second, studies without control groups or with insufficient quantitative information to calculate effect sizes were excluded. Finally, studies had to be written in English. Eventually, 15 studies with 48 effect sizes met these criteria and were included in this study, eight published articles and seven dissertations, representing 1,379 adults with LD. Although this relatively small sample size reflects the lack of research attention given to adult LD, other meta-analyses of LD populations have been conducted with similar sample sizes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411422260">Maag &amp; Reid, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022219411422260">Ochoa &amp; Olivarez, 1995</xref>), and fail-safe statistics can be calculated to mitigate the modest sample of articles and to ensure the robustness of findings.</p>
<p>Based on our review of the literature, we coded the resulting studies for four moderator variables: gender (rates of internalizing disorders may be higher in females with LD; Hoy et al., 1999), status (postsecondary student or general adult population), age (based on findings of increasing internalizing problems from young adulthood to older adulthood; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411422260">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>), and type of internalizing problem (anxiety or depression). After reviewing the articles, we added two additional moderating variable: anxiety type (trait anxiety and state anxiety) and depression type (screening or clinical diagnosis). Two independent raters separately coded a random sample of 20 of the 171 studies (12%) for the moderator variables, with interrater agreement of 100%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022219411422260">
<title>Calculating Effect Sizes</title>
<p>We used the MIX 2.0 computer program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022219411422260">Bax, 2010</xref>) to conduct the analyses. Effect sizes (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>) were calculated using means and standard deviations of the groups, when available. In the absence of means and standard deviations, we used other data (e.g., conversions from <italic>F</italic> test statistics) to estimate the effect sizes. Effect sizes were weighted based on the standard errors. Given that LD diagnostic criteria (e.g., self-report vs. assessed by research team), identification procedures, and definition of internalizing problems varied across studies, a more conservative random effects model was deemed more appropriate than the fixed effects model. Consequently, we used a random effects statistical model that assumes that the effect sizes in the data are heterogeneous (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022219411422260">Cooper, Hedges, &amp; Valentine, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>To not violate the assumption of independence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411422260">Lipsey &amp; Wilson, 2001</xref>), we calculated one effect size per study when calculating the overall effect size. When data were reported for separate groups (e.g., gender or age), we computed the mean of the effect sizes of the study and included the averaged effect size in the overall analysis. In the case that studies reported multiple results for an internalizing problem measure, we calculated a mean effect size for each measurement outcome and then averaged them to obtain the study’s effect size.</p>
<p>The overall effect size was disaggregated to examine potential moderator effects. For example, for moderator analyses on status of participants, we calculated separate effect sizes for postsecondary students and general adult participants if the studies reported separate data for each category. It is not surprising that the number of studies with data available to test potential moderators varied, given that not all studies reported data separately for the moderator variables.</p>

<title>Analysis of Effect Sizes</title>
<p>The 15 retrieved studies were published between 1989 and 2009 and included a total of 16,239 participants (LD: <italic>n</italic> = 1,379; NLD: <italic>n</italic> = 14,860). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022219411422260">Table 1</xref> includes the range of effect sizes (–0.08 to 1.71) and the 95% confidence intervals. Positive effect sizes represent higher level of internalizing problems in LD groups than in NLD groups. Of the 15 included studies, 13 were in the expected direction, and the results from the 2 studies with unexpected valence were not significant. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411422260">Cohen’s (1988)</xref> descriptors, 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 represent small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively. The overall effect size in our study was significant (<italic>z</italic> = 4.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and was medium in magnitude (<italic>d</italic> = 0.51). An effect size of this magnitude can be interpreted as meaning that about 69% of adults without LD would be below the 50th percentile in a comparison group of LD peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022219411422260">Coe, 2002</xref>).</p>

<p>To examine publication bias, Rosenthal’s fail-safe sample size was calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022219411422260">Mostert, 2001</xref>). The fail-safe<italic>N</italic> estimates the number of nonsignificant studies needed to make the results of the meta-analysis invalid. An additional 606 unpublished studies with mean zero effect would be needed to reduce the significant <italic>p</italic> value to nonsignificance, which is unlikely to be the case. A more conservative Orwin’s fail-safe <italic>N</italic> analysis was also conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022219411422260">Long, 2001</xref>). Using this metric, an additional 61 missing studies with mean zero effect size would be required to reduce the medium effect size, <italic>d</italic> = 0.51, to trivial to small magnitude, <italic>d</italic> = 0.10. As another test of publication bias, we compared results from published studies and dissertations. A nonsignificant difference was found between peer-reviewed studies and dissertations, <italic>Q</italic><sub>b</sub>(1) = 0.20, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. Both peer-reviewed studies (<italic>d</italic> = 0.67, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and dissertations (<italic>d</italic> = 0.32, <italic>p</italic> = .02) revealed a significant difference in the experience of internalizing problems between adults with and without LD.</p>
<p>Two heterogeneity statistics (i.e., <italic>Q</italic> and <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> statistics) were calculated. Cochran’s <italic>Q</italic> is conventionally used as a test that examines the null hypothesis that all of the studies in the analysis are measuring the same effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022219411422260">Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, &amp; Altman, 2003</xref>). Results from the <italic>Q</italic> test were significant, <italic>Q</italic>(14) = 366.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, rejecting the hypothesis of a common effect size across studies. Because the <italic>Q</italic> test is known to be poor at detecting true heterogeneity under certain conditions, we followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022219411422260">Higgins et al.’s (2003)</xref> advice and calculated the <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> statistic, an alternative measure that is not influenced by the number of studies included in a meta-analysis. Our results revealed an <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> of 96.18%, indicating a large proportion of true variance across studies. Results from the two heterogeneity statistics indicate that it is justifiable to explore potential moderator effects contributing to the heterogeneity of results.</p>

<title>Analyses of Moderator Variables</title>
<p>We tested for six moderating variables—gender, status (postsecondary student vs. general population), age group, nature of internalizing problem, anxiety type, and depression type—but there was no significant moderating effect for gender. However, inferring equal effect sizes according to gender from our results is tenuous because there were very few studies that presented results according to gender. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022219411422260">Table 2</xref> presents data on the number of effect sizes per moderator (<italic>k</italic>), the effect size (<italic>d</italic>), and the upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals.

<title>Participant status</title>
<p>We computed 17 effect sizes for participant status from studies including postsecondary students and adults from the general population.

<p>Based on age categories from previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411422260">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>), we disaggregated and regrouped data into early adulthood (&lt;30 years, <italic>k</italic> = 14) and middle adulthood categories (30+ years, <italic>k</italic> = 3). Significantly higher levels of internalizing symptoms were reported in early adulthood than in middle adulthood, <italic>Q</italic><sub>b</sub>(1) = 11.74, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Consistent with the overall direction of the analysis, individuals with LD reported significantly more internalizing problems than NLD peers in early adulthood (<italic>d</italic> = 0.53,<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). By contrast, no significant difference was found on the report of internalizing problems between LD and NLD individuals in middle adulthood (<italic>d</italic> = 0.45, <italic>p</italic> = .18). Although the magnitude of the effect size points to a positive finding, the nonsignificance of the result is likely related to the small number of studies included in the analysis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of our study was to provide a systematic review of research that investigates the internalizing problems of adults with LD. Although meta-analyses have been conducted on the association of LD with internalizing disorders in childhood and adolescence, no such compilation and analysis of research exists for adult populations. The novel contribution of our study is that it provides the first attempt to collect, analyze, and integrate findings from published and unpublished primary data that provide comparisons of internalizing problems of adults with and without LD. The findings from our meta-analysis point to higher levels of internalizing disorders in adults with LD compared to their NLD peers, with an overall significant and medium effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 0.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). However, the results from the study must be interpreted cautiously because of a relatively small sample of studies that met our search criteria and the presence of moderating variables that influence the results from the synthesis.</p>
<sec id="section17-0022219411422260">
<title>Trajectory of Internalizing Problems in Individuals With LD</title>
<p>We proposed two hypotheses for the developmental trajectory of internalizing problems associated with LD. The abeyance hypothesis proposes that the internalizing disorders associated with child and adolescent LD decline in adulthood, in part because of the reduction of academic-related stressors that are most salient in school environments, and in part because of the increased freedom to choose the best-fitting academic and life pathways. The continuance hypothesis proposes that the lifelong nature of LD may continue to influence psychological functioning into adulthood because of the continuing importance of academic skills in adulthood, the persistence of emotional health problems initiated in childhood and adolescence, and the putative influence of executive dysfunction on learning and internalizing problems. Included under the continuance hypothesis is the possibility that internalizing problems do not just continue but increase in adulthood because of the combined effects of the increased stressors of adult life, the loss of support systems available in schools, and a continuation of the cognitive and executive functioning problems associated with LD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411422260">McDermott &amp; Ebmeier, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The results from our meta-analysis provide support for the continuance hypothesis, with little change in the magnitude of internalizing problems of adults with LD in comparison to syntheses examining the same problems in children and adolescents with LD. Our overall effect size (<italic>d</italic> = 0.51) is similar in direction and magnitude to the effect sizes reported in meta-analyses for depression scores (<italic>d</italic> = 0.35; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411422260">Maag &amp; Reid, 2006</xref>) and anxiety scores (<italic>d</italic> = 0.61; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411422260">Nelson &amp; Harwood, 2011</xref>) in K–12 populations. Furthermore, the overlap of the 95% confidence intervals surrounding our effect size and the effect size from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411422260">Maag and Reid (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411422260">Nelson and Harwood (2011)</xref> suggests little change in the magnitude of internalizing problems after formal K–12 schooling ends.</p>
<p>Additional questions about the abeyance and continuance hypotheses might be proposed: Are the internalizing problems associated with adult LD associated primarily with individuals enrolled in postsecondary education because of the continuing demands on the academic areas associated with their LD? Do internalizing problems abate for adults not in postsecondary settings? We addressed this question with the test of the moderating variable of participant status. The results from the test of moderation provide further support for the continuance hypothesis: There was no significant difference in effect size for postsecondary students (<italic>d</italic> = 0.54) or adults in the general population (<italic>d</italic> = 0.46) based on the ANOVA of the <italic>Q</italic> statistic, suggesting that internalizing problems for adults with LD continue on a similar trajectory regardless of postsecondary student status.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that LD has a continuing impact on a wide range of family and social relationships, employment, and community involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411422260">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>); the results from our study point to the continuing influence of LD on the psychological and emotional lives of adults with LD, regardless of postsecondary student status. In spite of the academic support provided to many postsecondary students with LD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219411422260">Rath &amp; Royer, 2002</xref>) and the self-selection of students into postsecondary settings, it appears that internalizing problems are present in adult students in rates similar to those for adults in the general population. The combination of lower levels of academic skills, deficits in executive functioning, and lower implementation of key learning strategies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411422260">Kirby et al., 2008</xref>) may influence both the learning and the emotions of college students with LD. However, an alternative interpretation of the finding of similar effect sizes according to postsecondary status should be raised. Our study does not address the education level of the general adult population included in our analyses (and indeed, these data are not readily available). Adults with LD who have successfully completed postsecondary schooling may display lower levels of internalizing problems after completing their education, consistent with the development of the success attributes needed to navigate postsecondary schooling and the challenges of adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411422260">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>). The possession of the attributes that distinguish successful adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411422260">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>)—high levels of self-awareness, perseverance, and emotional stability, along with effective social support systems—may contribute to an abeyance of internalizing problems for adults with LD who successfully complete postsecondary schooling. Future studies investigating internalizing problems of adults with LD who have successfully completed postsecondary education would be informative.</p>
<p>We addressed alternative variations on the theme of the abeyance and continuance hypotheses by testing the moderating effect of age groups. Here, however, our results must be tempered by the limited number of studies included in the test of moderation. Although the effect sizes for the comparison between LD and NLD groups showed little variation for participants in early adulthood (&lt;30 years; <italic>d</italic> = 0.53) and middle adulthood (30+ years, <italic>d</italic> = 0.45), the effect size for the latter group was not significant, likely because of the small sample size (only three studies reported statistics for participants in middle adulthood). We interpret the finding to suggest a trend to continuing problems in internalizing problems in middle adulthood—a trend also supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411422260">Wilson et al.’s (2009)</xref> analysis of Canada-wide mental health survey data, where adult LD samples older than 30 years reported greater mental health problems than their same-aged NLD peers. However, it is possible that anxiety and depressive symptoms do, in fact, decline with age, and the trajectory is masked by the lack of data on the topic. A clear need for further research is indicated by the paucity of studies examining how the internalizing problems of middle-aged and older individuals with LD continue or reduce with time.</p>

<title>Nature of Internalizing Problems</title>
<p>Clinical levels of anxiety and depression in adulthood are typically diagnosed discretely based on classification systems such as the fourth edition of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022219411422260">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>); however, rates of comorbidity are high to very high (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411422260">van Lang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022219411422260">Zahn-Waxler et al., 2000</xref>). Although the central purpose of our study was to examine rates of general internalizing problems in adults, we disaggregated data to examine anxiety and depressive symptoms individually. For both classes of problems, adults with LD displayed higher scores than NLD adults; however, for the LD samples, the effect sizes for anxiety (<italic>d</italic> = 0.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) were significantly higher (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) than those for depressive symptoms (<italic>d</italic> = 0.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The disaggregated effect sizes were comparable to those found in previous meta-analyses involving children and adolescents, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022219411422260">Nelson and Harwood (2011)</xref> finding an overall effect size of <italic>d</italic> = 0.61 for anxiety and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411422260">Maag and Reid (2006)</xref> finding an overall effect size of <italic>d</italic> = 0.35. Our results provide support for the continuance hypothesis with regard to discrete categories of anxiety and depressive symptomatologies in a diverse range of studies. We did not find that the class of anxiety (state vs. trait) was a significant moderator variable, but effect sizes were significantly higher for screening measures of depression than for clinical diagnoses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0022219411422260">
<title>Limitations of the Study</title>
<p>Our study is limited by the relatively small sample size, resulting in low power to detect statistically significant moderating variables. Clearly the limitation of a small sample size of studies examining the internalizing problems of adults with LD is a clarion call for further research in the area. In spite of the modest sample size, the patterns of findings toward higher internalizing problems in adults with LD were consistent across studies, and tests of the robustness of our findings (e.g., fail-safe <italic>N</italic>) provide support for the validity of our findings. The implicit message from the restricted attention paid to adults with LD is that problems associated with the disability end with the cessation of formal schooling; however, our results belie that message. Another restriction associated with meta-analytic findings of LD populations is that the definition of LD relies on the decision making of the researchers conducting the primary research, and the date range of the included studies in our analysis (i.e., 1989–2009) likely means variation in inclusion criteria for LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411422260">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, the definition of <italic>internalizing problems</italic> was broad and included a range of clinical and subclinical anxiety- and depression-related problems. We focused on broad internalizing problems rather than specific clinical disorders based on past research practices, high comorbidity of the two classes of problems, and a lack of research targeting the individual disorders in adults with LD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0022219411422260">
<title>Implications for Practice and Research</title>
<p>The finding of support for the continuance hypothesis for the association of internalizing problems and adult LD leads to important implications for mental health practitioners, educators, researchers, and, not least, adults with LD. An accumulation of research shows that learning difficulties in childhood affect well-being across the life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411422260">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411422260">Raskind et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411422260">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>). The findings from our meta-analysis point to the general finding that the internalizing problems associated with childhood LD continue into adulthood. Furthermore, the internalizing problems of adults appear to be similar for adult students in postsecondary settings and for adults in the general population. Our findings provide support for the underlying role of executive processes in LD, and especially for the continuing impact of domain-general executive control processes related to the regulation of cognitive activity and emotional responses in adults with LD. Interventions focused on improving executive functioning in adults with LD may result in improved life skills and a subsequent reduction in internalizing problems. For example, therapists and counselors who help clients with LD to build a repertoire of organizational strategies to manage day-to-day demands may provide pathways for reducing levels of stress and anxiety associated with executive function weaknesses.</p>
<p>Although we do not want to overstate the negativity of our findings—the effect sizes are medium, and we focus on subclinical anxiety and depressive symptoms that are more prevalent in any population than clinical levels of anxiety and depression—the results suggest not only that “learning disabilities are lifelong” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022219411422260">LDAC, n.d</xref>.) but also that the <italic>psychological effects</italic> of LD are lifelong and persist beyond schooling and into adulthood. For psychologists and other therapists working with clients with LD, attention to childhood learning history, continuing problems with specific academic areas, and executive dysfunction may prove fruitful as a means of understanding and potentially remediating tendencies toward internalizing problems in adulthood. Educators working with adult students with LD may gain a deeper understanding of the emotional needs of their students if they understand the greater tendency to internalizing problems of their students than for adult students without LD. For individuals with LD, successful adult functioning depends on understanding the role that a history of LD might play in influencing their emotional lives.</p>
<p>A number of attributes are associated with successful functioning for adults with LD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411422260">Goldberg et al.’s (2003)</xref> longitudinal work highlights that adults with LD considered “successful” (defined using a multidimensional set of eight factors, including employment, education, social relationships, and psychological health) were able to compartmentalize their learning difficulties as one facet among a range of life factors and viewed their academic difficulties as only one facet of their adult functioning. Success attributes included high levels of self-awareness about strengths and weaknesses, a proactive approach to decision making, and development of effective ways of managing stress, frustration, and emotional problems. The results from our research point to the conclusion that many adults with LD have developed effective ways to manage the psychological challenges associated with LD and have learned coping strategies that allow for successful adult functioning. Although our results show a significant association between LD and internalizing problems in adulthood, the magnitude of the effect size suggests a considerable range of individual differences in the prevalence of internalizing problems in adults with LD and offers the hope that most people with LD successfully transition into functional adult lives.</p>
<p>Our restricted sample size points directly to the paucity of research investigating anxiety and depression in adults with LD. In particular, additional research is needed to identify the sources of stress associated with LD that continue to affect psychological functioning in adults in the general population. We found that very few studies investigated the functioning of middle-aged and older adults with LD, and further research is needed especially as the population of adults with LD is likely increasing. LD as a field of study emerged only in the past 50 years; the relative youthfulness of the field may explain why little research has investigated the lifelong impact of identification as LD. However, with continuing trends toward identifying children and adolescents with LD, the adult trajectory of the psychological correlates of LD is an area of research warranting concentrated study. For adults with LD, little support is available outside of college settings. An awareness of the increased likelihood of internalizing problems may increase proactivity in seeking help when internalizing symptoms such as anxiety- and depression-related problems emerge. A research focus on the development of interventions for the internalizing problems associated with adult LD would be of considerable value for researchers and especially for individuals with LD.</p>
