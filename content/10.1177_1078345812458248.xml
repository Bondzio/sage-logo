<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The public health model for correctional health care has evolved from a model of infectious disease control to a model of comprehensive medical, dental, and mental health services, which additionally recognizes the importance of providing continuity of care as inmates transition into free-living communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078345812458248">Ashe &amp; Conklin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345812458248">Conklin, Lincoln, &amp; Flanigan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078345812458248">Freudenberg, Daniels, Crum, Perkins, &amp; Richie, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078345812458248">Johnston, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078345812458248">Lincoln et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1078345812458248">Rich et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1078345812458248">Roberts, Kennedy, &amp; Hammett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1078345812458248">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Since the early 1990s, the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) has had standards in place requiring discharge planning for seriously ill inmates, and in 2000, New York State mandated comprehensive discharge planning for mentally ill ex-offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078345812458248">Mellow &amp; Greifinger, 2006</xref>). Despite growing recognition that correctional health <italic>is</italic> community health and despite the high-risk status of correctional populations for a large number of health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078345812458248">Hammett, Harmon, &amp; Rhodes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078345812458248">Hornung, Greifinger, &amp; Gadre, 2002</xref>), systematic public health approaches have not been widely adopted. With a small number of exceptions, few local health departments direct health services in correctional facilities. We propose the Ten Essential Public Health Services as a conceptual framework for a public health approach to correctional health care and illustrate it by application to the health care program for a large jail system in Jacksonville, FL.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1078345812458248">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Public health practitioners have good reason to be concerned about incarceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078345812458248">Freudenberg, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078345812458248">2002</xref>). In the United States, the incarceration rate increased from 139 per 100,000 in 1980 to 501 per 100,000 in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078345812458248">Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2009</xref>). More than 7.2 million people, or 1 in every 31 U.S. adults, were on probation, in jail or prison, or on parole at year-end 2006. Additionally, racial disparities in incarceration rates exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345812458248">Glaze &amp; Bonczar, 2007</xref>). Both Blacks and Hispanics are overrepresented in jails relative to population size (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2010). Disease, particularly infectious disease, mental illness, and substance abuse, are highly prevalent in correctional institutions (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078345812458248">CDC], 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078345812458248">Hammett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078345812458248">James &amp; Glaze, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078345812458248">McCampbell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1078345812458248">Rapposelli et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1078345812458248">Teplin, Abram, &amp; McClelland, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1078345812458248">Wilson, 2000</xref>). A 1997 National Institute of Justice and CDC survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078345812458248">Hammett, 1998</xref>) of correctional systems found a relatively high level of collaboration between corrections and public health agencies related to the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and tuberculosis (TB). This collaboration has been beneficial in reducing the incidence of communicable disease. However, the health needs of this population, and the demands on society as a whole resulting from those needs, creates an imperative for a broader, more comprehensive public health approach than infection control.</p>
<p>From October 2006 to September 2009, the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office (JSO), Department of Corrections (DOC) contracted with the Duval County (FL) Health Department (DCHD), Division of Institutional Medicine (IM) to provide health care services in the county’s jails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1078345812458248">Winterbauer &amp; Diduk, 2009</xref>). This contractual arrangement, which brought together two local government agencies to provide for the health of inmates, is relatively uncommon. The large majority of funding for correctional health services comes from state legislatures to state departments of corrections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078345812458248">Anno, 2004</xref>), which oversee the programs. Increasingly, though, health services are contracted out to for-profit agencies. For example, it was reported that approximately $3.0 billion of the nearly $7.5 billion budgeted for correctional health care is contracted to private correctional health care providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078345812458248">Mellow &amp; Greifinger, 2006</xref>). At the end of the 3-year contract, due to liability issues, the JSO/DOC–DCHD/IM relationship was terminated and IM became a division of JSO. DCHD continued to administer STD and HIV screening and work with IM to integrate some chronic disease prevention programs.</p>
<p>The JSO/DOC correctional facilities house more than 3,100 inmates and accommodate more than 50,000 admissions and releases yearly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078345812458248">JSO, 2006</xref>). Jails hold particular relevance for community health. In comparison with prisons, where offenders serve sentences of 1 year or longer, the public health opportunity in jails is great, because (a) many more individuals pass through jails relative to prisons; (b) jails are local institutions, which provide the opportunity to establish a continuum of care from jail to community (and vice versa); (c) the “revolving door” from jail to the community through which inmates frequently cycle heightens the potential impact of this population on community health and life; and (d) the jail population is composed of difficult-to-reach individuals, particularly minority adult males. Given the significant public health opportunity afforded by the JSO/DOC–DCHD/IM relationship, program administrators required a more fully elaborated public health model for correctional health care in order to capture the division’s vision and objectives.</p>
<p>Correctional health care is embedded within the larger public health system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078345812458248">Lincoln, Miles, &amp; Scheibel, 2007</xref>), which includes academia, community-based organizations, and health care delivery systems. In fulfilling the three core functions of public health—assessment of community health, comprehensive policy development, and assurance of necessary public health services—government public health agencies play a coordinating role (Institute of Medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078345812458248">IOM], 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078345812458248">Lincoln et al., 2007</xref>). The conceptual model for the provision of correctional health care adopted by the DCHD/IM is organized around the Ten Essential Public Health Services framework, which is also the framework for the National Public Health Performance Standards Program (NPHPSP) as well as the national <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078345812458248">Public Health Accreditation Board process (2012</xref>).</p>

<title>The Ten Essential Public Health Services</title>
<p>The Ten Essential Public Health Services construct as a defining framework for what public health does has its origins in the 1988 IOM report on the Future of Public Health (IOM, 2002). The context for the IOM report was a public health system in “disarray” with “extreme variety of available services and organizational arrangements” (2002, p. 4). The 2002 IOM committee adopted the 1988 definition of public health as “what we as a society do collectively to assure the conditions in which people can be healthy” (IOM, 2002, pp. 3, 20). The 1988 report also defined the core functions of public health as assessment, assurance, and policy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078345812458248">IOM, 1988</xref>) The core functions were quickly institutionalized with the inclusion of a core functions objective in the 2000 objectives that were released in 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1078345812458248">Public Health Service, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1078345812458248">Roper, Baker, Dyal, &amp; Nicola, 1992</xref>). Efforts to assess the performance of health departments related to the 2000 objective for core functions continued through the mid-1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078345812458248">Margolis, Parker, &amp; Eng, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1078345812458248">Turnock, Handler, &amp; Miller, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>While the 1988 IOM report continues to be the seminal foundation for defining public health, the core functions were further developed into the essential public health services to provide more detailed explanation of public health’s role in society. The Ten Essential Public Health Services construct was developed by the mid-1990s by the CDC and its partners to provide a greater delineation of the core functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345812458248">Harrell &amp; Baker, 1994</xref>). Other efforts to provide more detailed explanation of the core functions, such as the Essential Practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078345812458248">Miller, Moore, Richards, &amp; Monk, 1994</xref>), gave way very quickly to broad acceptance by major public health institutions of the Ten Essential Public Health Services construct. The construct has been translated into the National Public Health Performance Standards (NPHPS), which is an assessment process developed by the CDC and collaborating partner agencies for monitoring the performance of the public health system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078345812458248">CDC, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1078345812458248">Potter, Ley, Fertman, Eggleston, &amp; Duman, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>We defined the institutionalized community as unique and applied the Ten Essential Public Health Services framework, using the NPHPS Local Public Health Assessment Instrument, V2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078345812458248">CDC, 2009</xref>) to the health care program operated by the DCHD/IM. The essential public health services model was used to frame current IM activities, identify gaps in service, and structure future objectives to further integrate the essential public health services with correctional health care.</p>
<p>The Ten Essential Public Health Services framework is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078345812458248">Table 1</xref>. For each essential service, both IM activities and potential activities are described.</p>

<title>The Ten Essential Public Health Services as an Organizational Framework for a Public Health Model of Correctional Health Care</title>
<sec id="section5-1078345812458248">
<title>1 Monitor Health to Identify and Solve Community Health Problems</title>
<p>The IM, together with JSO, invested in an electronic medical record (EMR) system, which was implemented in October 2008. This system greatly increased the capacity of IM to conduct many of the essential services related to health monitoring. International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes allow comparisons with public, private, local, regional, and national data. Monitored conditions include STDs, HIV/AIDS, latent and active TB, hepatitis, hypertension, convulsions, substance abuse, mental health, dental, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Data on violence are collected by JSO and shared with IM. Additionally, IM has access to MPH- and PhD-level epidemiologists, statisticians, and other public health scientists through DCHD academic affiliations. Other services available through DCHD include GIS mapping and access to comparative data sets.</p>
<p>With the implementation of the EMR system, IM was well positioned to address many of the epidemiological functions contained within the essential services framework. At the local level, it is crucial to develop a community health profile, which would minimally include health and sociodemographic indicators. The development of baseline data allows for future comparisons with (offender and free-living) populations at various levels (e.g., local, national), as well as the identification of trends and disparities. That some of these data derive from clinical exam could make an invaluable contribution to the field of correctional health care and has important practice implications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1078345812458248">
<title>2 Diagnose and Investigate Health Problems and Hazards in the Community</title>
<p>The IM established an office of risk management, which was charged with the management of high-risk conditions, including wound care, chronic care, infectious diseases, and infection control. Additionally, the division had direct access to the state laboratory and access to MPH- and PhD-level health scientists through the DCHD.</p>
<p>Given the capacity provided by EMR, IM could take advantage of this system to perform surveillance for specific health threats, including those both endemic to the institutional setting and, in a sentinel role, those not. Separately, this essential service is concerned with emergency response. As essential personnel, IM staff members were exempt from serving in community shelters as part of the DCHD emergency response. However, an emergency response plan for the jail system that takes into consideration inmate-patient requirements, such as medications and medically necessary devices, had not been developed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1078345812458248">
<title>3 Inform, Educate, and Empower Individuals and Communities About Health Issues</title>
<p>IM routinely conducted a number of general health education programs, such as STD/HIV prevention and living with HIV. The division also implemented a curriculum for diabetic care. Finally, IM maintained 24/7 emergency contact information and collaborative relations with JSO for risk communication in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p>The division was well positioned to engage in evidence-based public health practice by expanding the planning, conduct, and evaluation of targeted health education programs. Additionally, providing the public, policy makers, stakeholders, and particularly local media with information on the health status and needs of the correctional population and the impact of this population on community health was a key informational role for IM.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1078345812458248">
<title>4 Mobilize Community Partnerships to Identify and Solve Health Problems</title>
<p>The division took a number of steps to interact with the community regarding critical public health issues. For example, IM collaborated with community partners to secure funding and refer incarcerated HIV+ clients to intensive substance abuse treatment upon release from jail. In another important collaboration, the division engaged in a community mental health, substance abuse, and corrections planning process to divert mentally ill and substance-dependent individuals from inappropriate placement in jail. These two public health issues are of significant concern to the affected individuals and agencies and the community at large. Additionally, IM cohosted a reentry summit with the Jacksonville Re-Entry Center that brought together more than 100 area providers of a variety of medical and social services to ex-offenders in an effort to improve health and social outcomes for ex-offenders, their families, and the community.</p>
<p>The division included the perspectives of incarcerated patients in program building and quality improvement processes by holding a monthly jail forum in which inmates gave feedback to the division director and a JSO captain. Finally, IM included volunteers in community health projects by using AmeriCorps volunteers and student interns for medical assistants, nurses, advanced registered nurse practitioners (ARNPs), and licensed mental health counselors (LMHCs), and psychiatric interns from various schools, colleges, and universities in Florida and other states.</p>
<p>While the IM has taken many steps to develop community relationships, the Essential Public Health Services framework guides local public health practitioners to act as central figures in mobilizing community partnerships. IM held a key position at the crossroads of a variety of health and social service providers and hard-to-reach vulnerable populations. The division was well situated to bring together these diverse providers in participatory, community-informed issue identification and priority-setting activities to improve inmate and ex-offender health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1078345812458248">
<title>5 Develop Policies and Plans That Support Individual and Community Health Efforts</title>
<p>IM involvement in policy development and planning has been fairly substantial, considering the short lifetime of the program. The division participated in a community strategic planning process for mental health and substance abuse diversion and in a Medicaid pilot project to provide coverage for severely and persistently mentally ill ex-offenders at the time of release (Medicaid coverage is suspended during incarceration). Although there is no legal precedent for compassionate release from jail for terminally ill inmates, IM worked with local judges on a case-by-case basis toward this end. Finally, that the jail is a smoke-free facility represents a unique opportunity to implement smoking cessation efforts during and after incarceration. In partnership with the chronic disease program in the health services division, a smoking cessation program was developed.</p>
<p>Following the guidelines for this essential service, an important future goal might have engaged constituents in identifying and analyzing public health issues relevant to the correctional setting and in developing a community health improvement plan. Beyond this, advocacy for inmates who bear a disproportionate risk for morbidity and mortality was a key objective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1078345812458248">
<title>6 Enforce Laws and Regulations That Protect Health and Ensure Safety</title>
<p>The primary responsibility associated with this service is assuring that inmates receive appropriate health care per standards, regulations, and court decisions. A goal for IM was the establishment of best practices regarding regulations governing the incarcerated population to ensure safety. This service might be expected to be the most relevant essential service due to the relationship of this program to law enforcement. However, the numerous other services associated with a public health approach to correctional health care are more relevant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1078345812458248">
<title>7 Link People to Needed Personal Health Services and Assure the Provision of Health Care When Otherwise Unavailable</title>
<p>The provision of direct medical care to individual patients has historically been the primary concern of health service activities in correctional institutions. Consequently, IM provided evidence-based services for nonemergency and emergency, medical, mental health, and dental services. To assure access to care, IM redesigned the sick-call system to make it more confidential and difficult for individual manipulation. As part of the assurance process, IM also closely monitored medical grievances. Additionally, a community transition team linked patients to health services at release. The team’s primary goals were coordination of care, particularly qualification for assistance and for individuals without insurance, who represent the majority of the population in the jail.</p>
<p>A well-appreciated advantage of IM was the opportunity for linkages with other divisions in the DCHD. Services provided by other DCHD divisions to jailed patients through IM included programs in the STD control division that assist with contact investigation and field treatment for partners of incarcerated patients and treatment for inmates who may be released prior to the return of lab results. The disease control division, AIDS program office also included training for HIV 500/501 for client-centered testing, community medical care for HIV patients, and TB follow-up and surveillance. An especially promising linkage was community case management for chronically ill, high-risk inmate-patients transitioning to the community. Concrete linkages with DCHD clinics for ex-offenders are crucial to take full advantage of the potential afforded by the DCHD/DIM relationship.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1078345812458248">
<title>8 Assure a Competent Public and Personal Health Care Workforce</title>
<p>Employment of competent personnel in corrections is difficult due to the nature of the correctional environment and misperceptions about health care in corrections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078345812458248">Kendig, 2004</xref>). Public health is also hampered by a lack of experience in providing correctional health care programs. Nonetheless, IM proactively addressed workforce development. Because all IM staff were DCHD employees, they received a 3-day orientation to public health and DCHD policies and procedures through the department. Beyond DCHD orientation, IM personnel were required to attend an additional 2 days of training at the jail. This training was tailored to the intricacies of working in the correctional setting and policies and procedures of IM, and included presentations by corrections staff on JSO policies and procedures.</p>
<p>The division created a series of trainings (informally called “DIM School”) to address health issues specific to the correctional setting. Trainings are on an ad hoc basis, and topics have included medical and nonmedical issues. For example, sessions included TB, HIV/AIDS, MRSA infection, and diabetes. Nonmedical topics have included patient care, including customer satisfaction in corrections, correctional versus noncorrectional models of care, and public health and corrections. Finally, the division engaged students in issues relevant to correctional health care by serving as a rotation site for community health nurses and providing internship experiences for masters of public health students.</p>
<p>IM also considered developing competencies and a jail-specific curriculum for DIM School for both employees and visiting students. The staff development coordinator worked with the State of Florida to offer continuing education credits through IM.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1078345812458248">
<title>9 Evaluate Effectiveness, Accessibility, and Quality of Personal and Population-Based Health Services</title>
<p>Evidence-based correctional health care practice is a key concern of the IM. The division sponsored a formative evaluation of program implementation through the Institute for Health, Policy, and Evaluation Research, a division of the DCHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1078345812458248">Winterbauer &amp; Diduk, 2009</xref>), and developed evaluation plans for specific programs. Key staff members were also engaged in quality improvement in conjunction with the DCHD office of quality improvement, which is overseen by the DCHD executive quality council. IM also engaged in quality assurance through certification and accreditation from three accrediting bodies (NCCHC, American Correctional Association, and the Florida Model Jail Standards). Accreditation was received from all three bodies within 2 years of implementation.</p>
<p>Evidence-based correctional health care practice was a key value of the division. Although standards exist for prisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1078345812458248">Stone, Kaiser, &amp; Mantese, 2006</xref>), a barrier to evaluating correctional health care services has been the absence of community-based jail standards. IM embarked on a process for establishing these standards.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1078345812458248">
<title>10 Research for New Insights and Innovative Solutions to Health Problems</title>
<p>IM recognized its unique potential to contribute to our understanding of the health and social issues faced by incarcerated populations. Urgency was given to research questions that are applied in nature and have the potential to improve the lives of incarcerated and ex-offender populations and their families and communities. Through the DCHD, the division has access to staff with academic affiliations in public health and medicine. Additionally, the division partnered with local universities and has disseminated results in public health and correctional health care venues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1078345812458248">Solano, Winterbauer, &amp; Diduk, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1078345812458248">Solano, Winterbauer, Diduk, &amp; Livingood, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1078345812458248">Winterbauer, Diduk, &amp; Solano, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1078345812458248">2008b</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This work reflects an early stage of innovation in practice, moving from concept or theory to implementation. Evaluation and diffusion of the essential public health services model will require more time, greater acceptance of a public health approach to correctional health care, and expansion of the model to other settings, followed by rigorous evaluation. An important first step in this approach was to define the institutionalized community as unique. Further defining the unique attributes of this community that affect individual and community health, including and beyond the immediate commonality of incarceration, will be an important next step in the evolution of the model. All of the essential public health standards could be applied to correctional populations and the correctional health care setting. Only Essential Service 6 (Enforce Laws and Regulations That Protect Health and Ensure Safety) had somewhat limited relevance.</p>
<p>The assessment instrument used in this review, the NPHPSP Local Public Health Assessment Instrument, V2.0 (CDC, 2009), describes the optimal level of performance for state and local public health systems (all organizations that contribute to public health in a given area) and governing bodies and is broad in scope and level of detail. Consequently, at times it seemed superfluous. On the other hand, its scope and detail were useful in thinking strategically about the health and health care of correctional populations and their relationship to the health of the larger community.</p>
<p>The highly vulnerable nature of correctional populations and the significant opportunities jails afford to improve individual and community health require fully elaborated health services models. Overall, the Ten Essential Public Health Services framework was useful, conceptually, to assess the current scope and future potential for IM activities.</p>
