<p>A time–frequency analysis-based signal processing study for detecting active corrosion in aluminum plate-like structure utilizing the broadband piezoelectric wafer active sensors is presented in this article. Tests were conducted on an aluminum plate with a network of sensors installed on one side of the plate for Lamb wave generation and reception. The corrosion was emulated as material loss of an area of 50 × 38 mm<sup>2</sup> on the opposite side of the plate. The corroded area resulted in a thickness loss on the plate and a change in wave propagation as well. The experimental data were first evaluated by a statistical damage index (DI) based on root mean square values and then the Cohen’s class motivated cross-time–frequency analysis. The cross-time–frequency analysis was found more reliable and precise for detecting the corrosion progression when compared to the DI method. Not only can the proposed metric correctly evaluate the phase difference of specific frequency and time, it also carries useful information of phase difference, which is strongly correlated to the physics of corrosion detection using Lamb waves. Novel aspects of this study include a sensing approach that can sense corrosion damage on both external and internal surfaces of a given structure, the employment of effective tuning in corrosion detection, and using cross-time–frequency analysis to quantitatively evaluate thickness loss. Though the corrosion studied herein is an idealized and simplified situation, the subject work on phase difference and cross-time–frequency analysis is useful first-step effort and opens a new way to perform Lamb wave-based corrosion detection. The results presented in this article combine easy-to-examine corrosion assumptions together with low-frequency antisymmetric Lamb wave analysis to provide a stepping stone for more complicated analysis needed for further real life corrosion assessment.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1475921711406580" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Corrosion is a serious problem in industrial applications of structural health monitoring such as pipeline and aircraft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475921711406580">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475921711406580">2</xref></sup> Dunn and Yacout<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475921711406580">3</xref></sup> used X-ray backscatter methods to perform a limited-scan backscatter technique for detecting hidden corrosion in aircraft. Uchanin and Tsirg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475921711406580">4</xref></sup> discussed the detection problem of corrosion damage in inspection of aviation structures in the literature and proposed eddy current method in order to detect surface and subsurface defects in structures. Kathirvel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1475921711406580">5</xref></sup> reported corrosion detection using eddy current arrays and ultrasonic phased array techniques for imaging and visualization of corrosion damage. Ultrasonic bulk waves have also been used in thickness detection by nature of point-by-point examination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475921711406580">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Guided waves have opened new opportunities for cost-effective detection of damage in structures because they are more global in nature and can provide more measurable features that are related to the interaction between the guided waves and defects, and hence, contain more information about the defects in the structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1475921711406580">6</xref></sup> Lamb waves are guided waves that travel in thin-wall structures and they can facilitate efficient detection over large areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475921711406580">7</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475921711406580">13</xref></sup> Of particular interest in this study is the use of Lamb waves to detect corrosion in metal structures. Alleyne and Cawley<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475921711406580">14</xref></sup> detected corrosion in pipes using the pulse-echo method further utilizing the mode conversion method. Chahbaz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475921711406580">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1475921711406580">16</xref></sup> demonstrated the ability of Lamb waves to detect corrosion through material loss using the pitch-catch method. Zhu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475921711406580">1</xref></sup> conducted experimental study on hidden corrosion detection using ultrasonic guided waves combined with boundary element method numerical simulation. Jenot et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1475921711406580">17</xref></sup> and Sicard et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1475921711406580">18</xref></sup> used wedge transducers to generate S0 Lamb waves which are sent along a copper plate to detect hidden corrosion in airframe structures. Imperial College NDT group started development of a guided wave technique for the screening of long lengths (&gt;10 m) of pipes for corrosion in 1997.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1475921711406580">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article, we propose the use of propagating Lamb waves to detect simulated corrosion (material removal) and tested this procedure in thin aluminum plates. We use piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) in a pitch-catch configuration to excite and receive Lamb waves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1475921711406580">20</xref></sup> Since corrosion damage will change the material thickness, the propagating properties of the Lamb wave are changed and these alterations of properties are indicated in the received signals. The changes of the received signals can be correlated to damage presence, growth, and/or extent. To quantify these changes, several signal analysis methods including (1) DI definition, (2) cross-power spectrum, and (3) cross-time–frequency analysis have been utilized to evaluate the corrosion damage in support of the proposed method. Novel aspects of this study include (1) a sensing approach that can sense corrosion damage on both external and internal surfaces of a given structure, (2) the employment of effective tuning in corrosion detection, (3) investigation of limitation of root mean square deviation DI, and (4) using cross-time–frequency analysis to correctly quantify thickness loss. The ultimate objective of the study is to develop a permanently installed <italic>in situ</italic> sensing system for the corrosion monitoring. Such a system could be used during the in-service operational period, recording and monitoring the changes of the structures over time, such as corrosion and wall thickness.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the corrosion studied herein remains an idealized situation focusing on a specific range of structural defects while in practice, the corrosion process is much more complicated and may affect the wave propagation differently. The subject study on cross-time–frequency analysis is a useful initial step and provides a new method to quantify Lamb wave-based corrosion detection. The focused corrosion analysis presented under simplifying assumptions together with a novel utilization of low-frequency antisymmetric Lamb waves provide stepping stone for versatile, complicated analysis needed for further real world corrosion assessment.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-1475921711406580"><title>Piezoelectric wafer transducers</title>
<p>PWAS functions as an active sensing device or network using piezoelectric principles and provides a tensorial relation between mechanical and electrical variables. They can be permanently attached to the structure to monitor condition at will and can operate in propagating wave mode or electromechanical impedance mode. For a piezoelectric wafer as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1475921711406580">Figure 1(a)</xref>, an electric field, <italic>E</italic><sub>3</sub>, is applied parallel to the spontaneous polarization, <italic>P</italic><sub>s</sub>. If polarization <italic>P</italic><sub>s</sub> is aligned with the <italic>x</italic><sub>3</sub> axis, then the application of field <italic>E</italic><sub>3</sub> is created by applying a voltage, <italic>V</italic>, between the bottom and top electrodes. The situation of <italic>E</italic><sub>3</sub>//<italic>P</italic><sub>s</sub> results in a vertical (thickness-wise) expansion <italic>ε</italic><sub>3</sub> = <italic>d</italic><sub>33</sub><italic>E</italic><sub>3</sub> and a lateral (in plane) contractions <italic>ε</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>d</italic><sub>31</sub><italic>E</italic><sub>3</sub>, and <italic>ε</italic><sub>2</sub> = <italic>d</italic><sub>32</sub><italic>E</italic><sub>3</sub> (<italic>d<sub>ij</sub></italic>: piezoelectric coupling coefficients). The strains experienced by PWAS are direct strains and such an arrangement can be used to produce thickness-wise and in-plane vibration of PWAS.
<fig id="fig1-1475921711406580" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>(a) Induced strain response of PWAS and (b) interaction between the PWAS and the structure.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1475921711406580-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The transmission of actuation and sensing between the PWAS and the host structure is achieved through the bonding adhesive layer. The adhesive layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1475921711406580">Figure 1(b)</xref>) acts as a shear layer, in which the mechanical effects are transmitted through shear effects. Using 1-D plane-strain analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1475921711406580">21</xref></sup> for static morphing and the quasi-static low-frequency vibrations, it has been found that the shear transfer process is concentrated toward the PWAS ends at large values of the shear-lag parameter. Shear-lag analysis indicates that at an infinitely large shear-lag parameter value, all the load transfer can be assumed to take place at the PWAS actuator ends. This leads to the concept of ideal bonding, also known as the pin-force model, in which all the load transfer takes place over an infinitesimal region at the PWAS ends, and the induced-strain action is assumed to consist of a pair of concentrated forces applied at the ends.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1475921711406580"><title>PWAS Lamb waves tuning</title>
<p>For embedded NDE applications, PWAS can be used as embedded ultrasonic transducers acting as either actuators to excite guided waves or as sensors to receive the structural response in the pitch-catch mode (as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1475921711406580">Figure 2</xref>). PWAS couple their in-plane motion with the particle motion of Lamb waves on the material surface while the in-plane motion is excited by the applied oscillatory voltage through the <italic>d</italic><sub>31</sub> coefficient.
<fig id="fig2-1475921711406580" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>PWAS embedded NDE in pitch-catch mode as actuator and sensor.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1475921711406580-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>For Lamb waves, there are at least two Lamb modes, A0 and S0, existing simultaneously, where the product of the wave frequency and structure thickness falls in the range of 0–1 MHz-mm. The process of Lamb wave tuning attempts to modify the excitation parameters in such a way as to excite a certain mode for detecting a specified type or instance of damage. With wedge-coupled conventional ultrasonic transducers, guided wave tuning is performed by varying the frequency and the wedge angle until a maximum response is recorded. The change in frequency modifies the wave speed of the dispersive guided wave, while the change of wedge angle modifies the wave conversion relationship in Snell’s law. Certain combinations of wedge-angles and excitation frequencies were able to generate increasing response in certain guided-wave modes. An important characteristic of PWAS, which distinguishes them from conventional ultrasonic transducers, is their capability of exciting multiple guided wave modes at a single frequency. A comprehensive study of these prediction formulae in comparison with experimental results has been given by Giurgiutiu.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475921711406580">22</xref></sup> By carefully selecting PWAS length at either an odd or even multiple of the half wavelength, a complex pattern of strain maxima and minima emerges. Since several Lamb modes, each with its own different wavelength, coexist at the same time, a selected Lamb mode can be tuned by choosing the appropriate frequency and PWAS dimensions.</p>
<p>An example of PWAS tuning is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1475921711406580">Figure 3</xref> for a 7-mm square PWAS installed on a 1-mm aluminum alloy 2024-T3 plate. The experimental amplitude plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1475921711406580">Figure 3(a)</xref> shows that for the plate being studied, a S0 tuning frequency around 200 kHz can be identified, where the amplitude of the A0 mode is minimized while that of the S0 mode is still strong. Therefore, by choosing the excitation frequency, a single mode can be obtained for damage detection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1475921711406580">23</xref></sup> Theoretical prediction given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1475921711406580">Figure 3(b)</xref> consistent with the experimental results.

<sec id="sec5-1475921711406580"><title>Corrosion damage detection</title>
<p>Metal structures exhibit a wide range of corrosion types including uniform, pitting, galvanic, crevice, concentration cell, and graphitic corrosion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1475921711406580">24</xref></sup> The material loss corrosion method which provides the focus of this article can occur where the surface is exposed to the corrosive environment or underneath the protective coating. When the guiding structure has changes due to corrosion in the geometry, material properties, supports, or attachments, the guided waves that propagate through will bemodified accordingly. Hence, loss of material due to corrosion presents geometrical changes which will cause the guided wave scattering and can be used for the inspection of corrosion.</p>
<p>In this study, we introduced uniform corrosion on an aluminum plate by machining away the material over a given ‘corrosion’ zone. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1475921711406580">Figure 4(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1475921711406580">Table 1</xref>, the machining depth was increased gradually in order to simulate corrosion progression. This thickness loss produced a change in the waveguide impedance and thus caused (1) scattering and reflection and (2) modification of the wave speed of the Lamb waves crossing the corrosion area. In practice, corrosion defects are geometrically complex and require multiple parameters to describe them and their scattering behaviors. We used simplified shapes for propagating Lamb wave paths to reduce the number of parameters in order to better understand the changes caused by material loss. In the experiment, simulated corrosion was made on a 3.229-mm thick 500 × 500 mm<sup>2</sup> rectangular aluminum plate; 7-mm round PWAS were used to construct the sensor network. The corrosion is located at the same position of PWAS #2 on the other side of the plate. A 5 × 3.8 cm<sup>2</sup> area is used to simulate the corrosion by machine cutting material from the plate. Our aim was to develop appropriate signal analysis approaches to link the changes in plate thickness to changes in the guided wave signals.

<sec id="sec6-1475921711406580"><title>PWAS Lamb wave corrosion detection</title>
<p>The presented PWAS multi-mode sensing system will take advantage of PWAS ability to serve as guided wave actuators and sensors simultaneously. A possible configuration of PWAS network is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1475921711406580">Figure 4(b)</xref> with simulated corrosion added underneath sensor #2. Such a simplified configuration includes two general cases, on-path and off-path damage. The on-path case has damage in line with the transmitter–receiver pair, which has a PWAS pairing of #0 and #4 (pair 0–4); while the off-path case has damage offside the transmitter–receiver pair, which has a PWAS pairing of #1 and #4 (pair 1–4). More general sensor network configurations can be obtained by modifying this simplified one. The detection of corrosion path will use propagating Lamb wave inspection in pitch-catch mode. The section between the on-path and off-path pairs which suffers larger change will be considered as having corrosion. Once the path is determined, other methods such as electro-mechanical impedance spectrum (EMIS) can be used to evaluate the local EMIS changes of each sensor on the path in order to locate the exact position of corrosion damage and PWAS as thickness gauge to directly quantify the thickness loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1475921711406580">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>We conducted pitch-catch experiments on the PWAS pairs 1–4 and 0–4. Experimental corrosion development is listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1475921711406580">Table 1</xref> with <italic>d</italic><sub>0</sub> as the original plate thickness and Δ<italic>d<sub>i</sub></italic> as the lost thickness. The pitch-catch tests send out a 3-count tone-burst signal from a HP 33120 A signal generator to one PWAS and the received signal at another PWAS was recorded by a TDS-210 digital oscilloscope.</p>
<p>In the experiments, we assume that the characteristics of the received Lamb waves will change if the structure between two sensors is modified, focusing solely on decreasing thickness. Also assumed is that the waves travel only in straight paths in the plate structures. Hence, the objective of our Lamb wave signal analysis is to extract damage-related characteristics from the measured sensor data. Cross-time–frequency analysis, as well as DI approach, have been investigated in our pitch-catch signal analysis. The corrosion is expected to be located on the path of pair 0–4.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1475921711406580"><title>Lamb wave mode selection</title>
<p>Changes caused by the damage between records were quantified with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) DI analysis first. RMSD DI is a scalar quantity that results from a statistical comparison between the signal in the present state and the signal in the reference state (baseline).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1475921711406580">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1475921711406580">27</xref></sup> Such a scalar reveals the difference between pristine data and measurement caused by the presence of damage and provides an overall change of the structure between sensors. This feature would be ideal for corrosion detection since it carries information of both the amplitude and the phase changes from the growth of the corrosion. The RMSD DI is defined as the relative ratio of the difference between each measurement and baseline signals as follows:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-1475921711406580"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1475921711406580-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>s<sub>i</sub></italic> is the <italic>i</italic>th measurement and <italic>s</italic><sub>0</sub> the baseline signal, and <italic>N</italic> the data length.</p>
<p>The first step in using Lamb waves to detect the corrosion damage is the selection of an appropriate Lamb wave mode which is sensitive to corrosion damage. The theoretical dispersion curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1475921711406580">Figure 5</xref> indicate that the velocity of the A0 Lamb wave mode varies rapidly with plate thickness due to its highly dispersive nature at low frequency-thickness product (<italic>fd</italic>). Hence, changes in the plate thickness between the transmitter and receiver will affect the propagating speed of A0 mode. However, the S0 mode is almost nondispersive in this <italic>fd</italic> range, and hence unlikely to be modified by thickness loss.
<fig id="fig5-1475921711406580" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Phase velocity for antisymmetric modes Lamb waves in an aluminum plate (<italic>c</italic><sub>S</sub> = shear wave speed, <italic>c</italic><sub>S</sub> = 3.129 mm/μs; <italic>d</italic> = half-thickness of the plate).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1475921711406580-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>To complete the mode selection process, a pitch-catch testing between PWAS #0 and #4 was conducted at 120 kHz excitation frequency where both S0 and A0 modes are excited, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1475921711406580">Figure 6(a)</xref> (from record 0 to record 5). RMSD DI defined in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1475921711406580">Equation (1)</xref> was then applied on each mode (windowed parts), respectively. The plotted curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1475921711406580">Figure 6(b)</xref> show clearly that the RMSD DI of A0 mode changes significantly with the thickness loss in the plate between PWAS #0 and #4, whereas that for S0 was almost unchanged.

<p>In order to excite an amplitude optimized A0 Lamb wave mode for analysis, frequency tuning was performed using methodology developed in our previous work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1475921711406580">22</xref></sup> We identified a ‘sweet spot’ for A0 Lamb wave mode tuning at 57 kHz at which it reaches a local maxima while S0 mode is much weaker, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1475921711406580">Figure 3(a)</xref>.

<p>The raw signals from PWAS pairs 0–4 and 1–4 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1475921711406580">Figure 7</xref> were processed with the RMSD DI algorithm of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1475921711406580">Equation (1)</xref>. The curves obtained from this RMSD DI analysis are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921711406580">Figure 8</xref>. For the pair 1–4, since the corrosion is away from the path, the arriving wave packet is not significantly affected by the growth of corrosion. The DI curve of pair 1–4 shows small changes consistent with the visual observations on raw signals from this pitch-catch pair. For pair 0–4, the DI curve changes from 0 to nearly 2.5, indicating significant corrosion development occurring along the wave propagation path. However, the change of DI with corrosion development is not monotonic. The DI curve increases first from record 1 to record 4 and then decreases. This trend is not consistent with our visual observation aforementioned from pair 0–4 raw signals. The reason for this phenomenon is that the DI shows the changes of both amplitude and phase while it is more sensitive to magnitude changes. In the next section, phase-related methods for condition monitoring will be explored and used for corrosion detection.

<p>The phase of a signal itself may be related with the delay of a signal; however, the phase becomes more meaningful by considering the relative phase difference between the signals to represent propagation of a signal.

<p>Time–frequency analysis provides an effective tool for nonstationary signal analysis by a time and frequency localized signal representation. Various methods have been applied to a variety of applications; and Cohen’s class generalizes various types of the time–frequency distributions in terms of a kernel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1475921711406580">30</xref></sup> The main objectives of the various types of time–frequency distributions are to obtain time–frequency localized energy distribution with high resolution and to overcome interference effects within the limits of the uncertainty principle.</p>
<p>The limitation of Cohen’s class in our application is that the traditional definition of the time–frequency distribution within Cohen’s class concerns a nonstationary signal and generation of the time-varying energy spectrum. Thus, another critical feature of the signal, the phase difference, is not available in the real-valued time–frequency distribution function. Phase is meaningful when considering the relative phase difference between the signals to represent propagation of a signal. In particular, phase difference spectrum can reveal the dispersion phenomena and direction of propagation in wave propagation analysis. The cross-power spectrum in frequency domain is usually used in the case of stationary signals. For nonstationary signals such as Lamb waves in the corrosion application, it is necessary to use time–frequency analysis in order to measure the relative phase difference in the time and frequency domains. In this research, we proposed the cross-time–frequency distribution function to preserve the phase difference aspects of two signals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1475921711406580">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1475921711406580">32</xref></sup></p></sec>

<p>In this article, we briefly introduced the principle of PWAS, its application for guided Lamb wave generation, and a frequency tuning mechanism to selectively excite a preferred Lamb wave mode in a specific structure. A pitch-catch Lamb wave interrogation method was then introduced and applied to an aluminum plate to detect simulated corrosion development. The advantage of the proposed technique has shown that corrosion damage can be detected by a network of sensors mounted on the reverse side of the plate where other methods focus on surface and subsurface detection. Two methods, statistical DI definition and cross-time–frequency analysis, were developed and employed to evaluate the development of corrosion damage. The statistical DI contains both amplitude and phase changes of the received waves resulting from material loss. Though it gave a clear indication of corrosion presence, it failed in showing the continuous growth of the simulated corrosion. It was found that the phase information actually changed more significantly and proved to be a better indicator of corrosion development. Two signal processing methods, the traditional cross-power spectrum and cross-time–frequency distribution were developed then to evaluate the phase change caused by the material loss. For nonstationary Lamb wave signals, we found that time–frequency analysis is able to preserve the relative phase difference in both time and frequency domain and more suitable for the Lamb wave corrosion detection application. A novel cross-time–frequency analysis for phase difference evaluation then was developed based on Cohen’s class and applied to the PWAS signals. The resultant spectra showed a clear evolution correlated to corrosion growth. A DI defined on this analysis shows a monotonic trend of corrosion evolution and closely matches the theoretical phase difference prediction.</p>
<p>The study presented in the manuscript is an academic exercise where the corrosion was clearly defined as material removal. In reality, the corrosion process is much more complicated and may involve corrosion byproduct which would affect the wave propagation differently. Though the configuration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1475921711406580">Figure 5(a)</xref> is well designed, it has included two general cases of both on-path (when damage is inline with the pitch-catch pair) and off-path (when damage is offline with the pitch-catch pair) damage conditions and many general configuration can be obtained by slightly modifying it. The analysis of wave propagation in the presence of spongy corrosion product is quite complicated and goes beyond the scope of this article. We intended to pursue this avenue in the future. Nonetheless, we believe that the results presented in this article provide easy to analyze corrosion assumptions valid for consideration in and understanding of real-world corrosion assessment.</p></sec>
