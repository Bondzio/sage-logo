<abstract>
<p>The literature on the effect of maltreatment has revealed several methodological problems of retrospective studies, such as the validity and stability of retrospective reports, which may be influenced by factors such as one’s mental health at the time of the report. This study aims to assess the temporal stability of self-reported adverse childhood experiences at three different time points, separated by 6 months each, and to analyze the relationship between general psychopathology and the number of reported experiences. Thirty obese participants responded to the Portuguese version of the Childhood History Questionnaire, a self-report measure that assesses adverse childhood experiences, and the Brief Symptom Inventory. The results suggest that adverse childhood experiences are common in these participants (time 1: <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0886260512471077">

The agreement levels, as measured by kappa values, were satisfactory for the dimensions of maltreatment focused on the individual, with kappas ranging between .34 and .44. Our participants did not exhibit psychopathology at any of the time points, and the psychopathological symptoms were not related to total adversity reported. The major contribution of this study is the comparison of self-reports at three time points, separated by significant time intervals, and the inclusion of 10 different dimensions of childhood adversity. The data show an adequate stability in the report of maltreatment toward the individual (abuse and physical neglect) and in specific aspects of adversity in the family.</p>

<body>
<p>Several studies assessing the prevalence of childhood maltreatment have suggested adversity as a predictor of psychopathology and health problems in adulthood (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512471077">Anda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512471077">Felitti et al., 1998</xref>). Despite these results, several methodological problems have been raised, primarily related to data collection in the cross-sectional and retrospective studies, which rely on adult participants’ self-reports. The main criticisms concern either the validity or the reliability of retrospective self-reports.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512471077">Hardt and Rutter (2004)</xref> conducted a literature review on the validity and reliability of self-reports of childhood maltreatment experiences. The authors concluded that self-reports obtained in adulthood involve a high rate of false negatives (ranging from .15% to .18%) and substantial erroneous measures. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512471077">Pinto and Maia (in press)</xref> found that a significant proportion of participants who were identified as victims of adverse experiences in childhood do not report a great amount of these experiences in early adulthood, namely, 48% did not report the physical abuse they suffered, 30% did not report emotional abuse, 11.5% did not report sexual abuse, and 59% did not report physical neglect.</p>
<p>With specific regard to studies examining the temporal stability of self-reports, the results have been mixed. At least one study found a fairly reasonable temporal stability in a variety of experiences in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512471077">Dube et al., 2001</xref>), whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512471077">Fergusson, Horwood, and Woodward (2000)</xref> found weak and unstable results for self-reports on experiences of sexual and physical abuse. To explain these results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512471077">Fergusson et al. (2000)</xref> argued that responses to questions about past experiences seem to be influenced by one’s memory, perception of the experience, and willingness to report or omit the traumatic childhood events. Among the factors that interfere with self-reports, Fergusson and colleagues focused on the length of time between the traumatic event and the moment of recall, suggesting that longer intervals increase the difficulty of information access and decrease the validity of the report. Other authors, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512471077">Elliott and Briere (1995)</xref>, identified various factors related to the context in which the abusive experience occurred, including the victim’s age, chronicity of abuse, relationship to the perpetrator, and the level of violence and threat. According to the authors, these elements may influence a person’s report or capacity of recalling the traumatic events.</p>
<p>A thorough discussion on self-reported experiences of abuse involves the role of forgetting and its meaning. Whereas some researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512471077">Fergusson et al., 2000</xref>) have claimed that forgetting and the mechanisms of memory repression are common among victims of abuse, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512471077">Loftus (2003)</xref> refuted this argument by pointing to laboratory studies that produced insufficient evidence of individuals’ ability to repress memories of adverse childhood experiences.</p>
<p>Authors including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512471077">Melchert and Parker (1997)</xref> have suggested reasons for not reporting adverse childhood experiences, including feelings of shame or embarrassment, the desire to protect the perpetrator, and the desire to forget or avoid these past experiences. From this account, people fail to report adverse experiences because they choose not to talk about them, not because they do not remember them.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512471077">Widom, Raphael, and DuMont (2004)</xref> also refer to the importance of mood, particularly depressed mood, at the time of recall. In a study comparing reports of childhood abuse by victims in their adulthood through retrospective and prospective methods, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512471077">White and Widom (2003)</xref> found that, compared with a control group, depressed individuals had more discrepancies in their reports of physical and sexual abuse. According to these authors, one’s physical and psychological states at the moment of recall influence their report of adverse experiences, with individuals in poorer health being more likely than healthy individuals to evoke negative experiences. Despite the suggested effect of recall bias (i.e., the influence of emotional, psychological, and physical states at the time of recall), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512471077">Brewin, Andrews, and Gotlib (1993)</xref> stated that there is no reliable evidence that participants’ mental and physical states interfere with their memories of adverse experiences.</p>
<p>In summary, the questionable validity and stability of self-reports of childhood adverse experiences make it difficult to understand the results of studies relating early experiences to later physical and psychological symptoms, which are often also measured with self-report instruments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512471077">Dube and colleagues (2001)</xref> pointed out that, to the extent that it is not possible to determine the temporal relationship between events and their consequences, retrospective studies do not allow one to evaluate the cause–effect relationship between adverse experiences and their consequences.</p>
<p>Specifically, with regard to the stability of self-reports, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512471077">Stanton, McClelland, Elwood, Ferry, and Silva (1996)</xref> suggested that reports should be collected at two or three time points spaced at large intervals to ensure that the reports are sufficiently independent from one another.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to clarify methodological issues concerning the stability of self-reports. Given that most studies assess only the dimensions of direct abuse against the individual (typically, physical and sexual abuse), excluding the dimensions related to dysfunctional family environment and neglect experiences, this study evaluated self-reports of a wider range of adverse childhood experiences. The stability or validity of self-reports has been assessed across a variety of adversity dimensions in only a small number of studies, specifically, several studies carried out by Felliti and his team (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512471077">Dube et al., 2001</xref>) with American participants, and studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512471077">Correia, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512471077">Pinto &amp; Maia, in press</xref>) with Portuguese participants. Among previous studies, the temporal stability of reports of maltreatment in childhood has been assessed at only two time points with a short time interval between them. Thus, this study, which is part of a larger study on the physical and psychological characteristics of morbid obese, evaluated the temporal stability of self-reports on childhood adverse experiences at three time points over a 1-year period. Previous research, based in self-report methods, has shown that morbid obese has high values of adversity experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512471077">Silva &amp; Maia, 2007</xref>) but did not test for the consistency of the report. To investigate the influence of psychopathology on self-reports, the correlation between the general psychopathology index and total adverse experiences reported was calculated at each time point and point-biserial correlations were run to test the relation between psychopathology and each adversity category. Considering the discrepancies in the literature, our hypotheses are largely exploratory.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p><italic>Childhood History Questionnaire</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512471077">Felitti et al., 1998</xref>). A Portuguese version of the questionnaire was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512471077">Silva &amp; Maia, 2008</xref>). The questionnaire included detailed information about 10 different types of adverse childhood experiences pertaining to the participants’ first 18 years of life, which were organized into two areas: experiences of the individual (abuse and neglect experienced by the individual child) and household dysfunction. There were five response categories: “never,” “once,” “sometimes,” “often,” or “very often.” The instrument defines the following types of child abuse: emotional abuse (three questions), physical abuse (three questions), sexual abuse (three questions), physical neglect (three questions), emotional neglect (three questions), battered mother (three questions), household substance abuse (two questions), parental separation or divorce (one question), incarcerated household member (one question), and mental illness in the household (two questions). A participant was defined as exposed to a category if he or she responded “yes” (considering that this experience occurs “often” or “very often”) to one or more of the questions in that category.</p>
<p>For each participant, the total number of adversity exposures was summed to create a new composite variable <italic>Total Adversity</italic>. This variable ranged from 0 (if a participant did not receive a positive score in any category) and 10 (if a participant received positive scores in all categories).</p>
<p>The reliability of this instrument was confirmed using a test–retest procedure with 644 participants, producing a kappa coefficient of .56 to .72 for the categories of physical abuse, emotional abuse, and battered mother and of .46 to .86 for the remaining categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512471077">Dube et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>As a reference, in a Portuguese study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512471077">Correia, 2010</xref>) with a sample of 79 young participants who had been flagged in childhood because of inadequate care and who had been evaluated across a 4-month interval, the following kappa coefficients for each category of adversity were obtained: emotional abuse .46 (95% CI, .24–.68), physical abuse .88 (95% CI, .77–.99), sexual abuse .71 (95% CI, .49–.93), battered mother .63 (95% CI, .45–.81), household substance abuse .55 (95% CI, .35–.75), mental illness in household .46 (95% CI, .25–.67), parental separation or divorce .63 (95% CI, .43–.83), incarcerated household member .63 (95% CI, .43–.83), emotional neglect .38 (95% CI, .18–.58), and physical neglect .46 (95% CI, .25–.67). These data suggest acceptable consistency for most of the adverse experiences, although the emotional neglect kappa was slightly under the recommended cutoff (.38).</p>
<p>The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) (Derogatis, 1982, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512471077">Canavarro, 1999</xref>) is a 53-item self-report measure that was designed to evaluate general psychiatric morbidity. Participants respond according to a 5-point Likert-type scale that ranges from 0 (<italic>never</italic>) to 4 (<italic>several times</italic>). The BSI evaluates nine symptomatic dimensions: depression, somatization, hostility, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, paranoid ideation, obsessive-compulsive, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism. In addition to these scores, the BSI provides three global distress indices: the general symptoms index, the total of positive symptoms, and the global symptoms index. The Portuguese adaptation showed good psychometric qualities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512471077">Canavarro, 1999</xref>). In this study, we used only the general symptoms index (alpha = .94).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The data were collected in a Multidisciplinary Treatment Center of Obesity in Northern Portugal. All patients who underwent bariatric surgery between June 2008 and June 2009 were assessed. All participants were evaluated before the surgery (time 1), at the 6-month follow-up (time 2), and at the 12-month follow-up (time 3). Prior to inclusion in the study, the participants signed an informed consent form, which was approved by the Ethics Committee of the hospital. There were no missing data.</p>
<sec id="section5-0886260512471077">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18.0 was used for data analysis. For descriptive analysis parameters, descriptive statistics, including standard measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode), dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation), and simple frequency information, were computed. Cohen’s kappa was calculated to examine the temporal stability of reports for all variables, considering the reported presence or absence of each experience, which allowed us to test the level of agreement observed between the two categories of variables. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512471077">Landis and Koch (1977)</xref>, kappa values greater than or equal to .75 indicate excellent agreement, values between .40 and .75 indicate satisfactory agreement between the variables, and values below .40 indicate that the correlation between two variables is weak. A kappa value of 1 indicates that maximum agreement is reached and that the information is entirely consistent. Nonparametric tests were used because our data did not fulfill normality demands. To test if our participants have high levels of psychopathology, we compared the level of psychopathological characteristics of our participants with those based on the reference community data (from the Portuguese adaptation), using one-sample <italic>t</italic> tests. Finally, Spearman correlations were calculated to analyze the relationship between general psychopathology and total adversity. Point-biserial correlations were performed to analyze the relationship between general psychopathology/depression and all adverse experiences variables. The significance level adopted was 5%.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512471077">Table 1</xref>, adverse childhood experiences were reported by many of our participants. At time 1 (pre-surgery), 20% (<italic>n</italic> = 6) of the participants reported experiences of emotional abuse, physical abuse, and emotional neglect. Sexual abuse was reported by 10% (<italic>n</italic> = 3) of the participants, and physical neglect was reported by 33% (<italic>n</italic> = 10) of the participants. With regard to adverse experiences within the family, 33% (<italic>n</italic> = 10) of the participants reported household substance abuse, but no participant reported exposure to a battered mother.

<p>The results show satisfactory agreement across the time points in the dimensions of physical and emotional abuse, physical neglect, and substance abuse in the family, with kappa values above .40.</p>
<p>With regard to exposure to a battered mother, we were able to calculate the kappa value only between the second and third times, because this experience was not reported at time 1. There was consistency between time 2 and time 3, but not between time 1 and the other two time points. A similar level of agreement was observed in other dimensions of adversity related to family environment, such as parental separation or divorce and incarcerated household member. The reports of these dimensions were inconsistent when comparing them across the time points, because three (10%) participants did not report experiences of parental separation or divorce at time 1 and one (3%) participant failed to report having an incarcerated household member at time 2 and time 3. The experience of mental illness was completely consistent across the first and third time points but was inconsistent between the first and second time points and between the second and third time points, because two (7%) participants failed to report experience of mental illness at the first and third time points.</p>
<p>Because some authors have suggested that the report of negative experiences may be influenced by participants’ health status, including negative mood, at the time of reporting, we evaluated the relationship between reports of adverse experiences and psychopathology.</p>
<p>One-sample <italic>t</italic> tests showed that there were no statistically significant differences in terms of general psychopathology or in any of the nine dimensions of psychopathology at all time points between our participants and the community sample. To specifically assess the relationship between the level of psychopathology and the total adversity reported at the different time points, we performed correlations between the two variables. In the same way, we conducted a Spearman correlation between depression and total adversity. This analysis showed that there were no relations between these dimensions in each time period (time 1: <italic>r</italic> = .278, <italic>p</italic> = .453; time 2: <italic>r</italic> = .297, <italic>p</italic> = .465; time 3: <italic>r</italic> = .312, <italic>p</italic> = .398). In the same way, we performed a Spearman correlation between psychopathology and total adversity, and the results showed no relation between these variables (time 1: <italic>r</italic> = .123, <italic>p</italic> = .675; time 2: <italic>r</italic> = .187, <italic>p</italic> = .688; time 3: <italic>r</italic> = .124, <italic>p</italic> = .678). To analyze the relation between psychopathology and each adversity dimension reported, we conducted point-biserial correlations for each time period. The results (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260512471077">Table 3</xref>) showed no significant relationship between psychopathology and any of the adversity experiences reported at any time point. Similarly, to understand whether there was any relationship between the subscale of depression and the adversity experiences, we conducted the same analysis. The results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0886260512471077">Table 3</xref>) demonstrated that there was no statistically significant correlation between the variables under consideration for any of the three time points.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of our study suggest that adverse childhood experiences were fairly prevalent in our participants, in terms of adverse experiences faced by the individual and in terms of experiences related to the family environment. One exception is exposure to a battered mother, which was not reported at the first time point and was rarely reported at the next time points. We also observed that physical neglect, emotional neglect, and household substance abuse were the most frequently reported adverse experiences at the three time points. These data are in opposition to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512471077">Barudy (1998)</xref>, who has suggested that in the presence of active maltreatment, situations of neglect tend to be undervalued and are therefore reported less frequently by participants.</p>
<p>Adverse experiences related to the family environment were reported less frequently than experiences toward the individual. Nevertheless, before surgery (time 1), three participants reported the existence of substance abuse in the family environment and mental illness in the household. However, exposure to a battered mother was rarely reported by our participants, with none reported at the first time point. Experiences of parental separation or divorce and incarcerated household member were reported less frequently by participants in our study.</p>
<p>We also found a high co-occurrence of different types of adversity, with 15% of participants reporting at least four adversity experiences at the third time point.</p>
<p>It is further noted that the reports of sexual abuse increased from the first to the second time point and from the second to the third time point. These results suggest that some of the participants reported this adverse experience only under some conditions. In other words, participants seem to report this experience when they are doing so in an environment of trust. We had repeated contact with our participants (the same researcher collected data across the three time points, and this study also involved an interview and qualitative analysis), which might have contributed to an increase in participants’ trust in the researcher, facilitating the report of this special kind of abuse. Thus, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512471077">Melchert and Parker (1997)</xref>, our results suggest that whether one discloses a childhood experience can be a personal decision. We would add that the context of report, including relation to researcher, may have some influence.</p>
<p>Studying the prevalence of maltreatment and the relationship between past adversity and health indicators has been a major challenge for researchers, because a number of methodological problems can jeopardize the validity and reliability of retrospective reports. In our study, with a small sample of morbid obese patients, we found temporal stability in participants’ report of emotional abuse, physical abuse, neglect, and substance abuse, with kappa values ranging from being quite satisfactory to a maximum level of agreement. However, and as suggested by Fergusson and colleagues (2000), we found large inconsistencies in the reporting of sexual abuse when comparing reports at the first and third time points. In the reporting of other adverse experiences, we found inconsistencies between some time points. Specifically, in some of the experiences (emotional neglect, battered mother, parental separation or divorce, and incarcerated household member), there was total agreement from the second to the third time point, but there was inconsistency when compared with reports at the first time point. In turn, in terms of mental illness in household, the reports were consistent between the first and third time points but were inconsistent with the second time point. In this sense, reports of adverse experience on various dimensions of adversity can be considered consistent or inconsistent, depending on the specific time points being compared. Moreover, we cannot overlook the fact that on each adversity dimension, our results were based on dichotomized values (one or zero) rather than the original values for every single item. This may mask some inconsistencies, once different items in each dimension can lead to the same result (e.g., to be considered physically abused).</p>
<p>Given that we found significant differences in the reports of different experiences across the three time points, it is important to understand their origins. According to some authors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512471077">Fergusson et al., 2000</xref>), the longer the time interval is between adverse experiences and the report, the lower the likelihood is for participants to report that experience. In our study, despite the relatively young age of participants (<inline-formula id="inline-formula8-0886260512471077">
<mml:math display="inline" id="math8-0886260512471077">
<mml:mover accent="true">
<mml:mi>X</mml:mi>
<mml:mo>¯</mml:mo>
</mml:mover>
</mml:math>
</inline-formula> = 39.17 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.81), an average of nearly 30 years had passed since the experiences occurred.</p>
<p>In terms of the time interval between reports, a length of 6 months was longer than the interval used in most studies on temporal stability, and thus, this longer interval may have contributed to a lower temporal consistency between reports, especially when considering the interval between the first and third assessments.</p>
<p>With regard to the possibility of recall bias, some authors have suggested that reports of adverse childhood experiences can be influenced by participants’ physical health (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512471077">White &amp; Widom, 2003</xref>) and mental states (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512471077">Widom et al., 2004</xref>). Specifically, individuals in more depressive mood and poorer health situations tend to evoke more negative experiences than healthy individuals. Contrary to this prediction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512471077">Monteiro and Maia (2010)</xref> conducted a study with depressed participants and found that, 1 year after the first evaluation, there was a significant decrease in depressed mood but sustained reporting of adverse childhood experiences. Monteiro and Maia’s study suggests that the report of adversity is independent of the mood. In our study, we found no changes in psychopathology over time and no significant correlation between total adversity and general psychopathology or depression subscale at any time point. In the same way, the results show that any specific type of adversity was correlated with general psychopathology or the depression subscale.</p>
<p>Given that our participants showed neither levels of clinical psychopathology nor differences from reference community values, the results with regard to reporting adverse childhood experiences could not be explained by negative mood or psychopathology levels. In terms of physical health problems, another study that we conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512471077">Silva &amp; Maia, 2012</xref>) demonstrates that although participants showed various problems and physical health complaints during the first evaluation, these problems and complaints decreased significantly over time (with fewer instances at the second and third time points). Therefore, we conclude that reports of adverse experiences were not affected by the level of psychopathology or physical health conditions, thus increasing the reliability of our results.</p>
<p>In this study, we considered three separate time points, which contributed to a more complex discussion of self-report stability. If we had only two points in time (e.g., time 1 and time 2, as was the case in other studies), the results would be quite different. Thus, we believe that it is critical to increase the number of time points to amplify the rigor of the longitudinal studies and to better understand the (in)consistency of self-report.</p>
<p>The main limitations of this study include the small number of participants and the fact that they have the special characteristic of being morbid obese candidates of bariatric surgery. Together, these two factors significantly compromise data generalization. Accordingly, there was low statistical power to observe results. A study with a larger sample and involving participants from the community will provide an opportunity to increase knowledge about the stability of self-report over time.</p>
<p>In this study, we evaluated the stability of self-reported adverse experiences through the Childhood History Questionnaire (Portuguese version; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512471077">Silva &amp; Maia, 2008</xref>) and concluded that the instrument has acceptable temporal stability for both the dimensions of individual abuse (with the exception of sexual abuse, which showed low consistency across the first and ensuing time points), neglect (physical and emotional), and some dimensions related to the family environment (including household substance abuse, parental separation or divorce, and incarcerated household member).</p>
<p>Given the differences across the three time points, it is of interest to understand why individuals choose to report, or not to report, adverse experiences, namely, sexual abuse. Qualitative studies may help us understand the contributing reasons. Thus, as future directions, we plan to conduct a qualitative study with these participants to better understand, through an interview, the processes underlying self-report and the factors that may contribute to the reporting or omission of adverse experiences. The study of self-report stability does not consider whether an instrument actually assesses the content that is proposed, but the validity of self-reports is another challenge in research.</p>
