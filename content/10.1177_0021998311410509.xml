<abstract>
<p>Most composite damage tolerance assessments are made on bare laminates where the impactor comes into direct contact with the outermost ply. However, structures such as those used on launch vehicles are often covered with a thermal protection system (TPS) during the majority of the life of the part. This TPS covering may change the impact characteristics of the laminate rendering damage tolerance testing on bare laminates irrelevant to the part. This study examines the composite interstage structure of the ARES I launch vehicle which is scheduled to be covered with a sprayable foam TPS after manufacture. Damage tolerance testing is performed on bare sandwich structure and sandwich structure covered with the TPS selected for use on the ARES I composite interstage. Instrumented impact, infrared thermography, visual, cross-sectional and compression after impact CAI data are compared. Results show that the TPS covering does change most of the impact characteristics of the sandwich structure. It was found that the TPS created a larger damage zone as detected by IRT, however the TPS covered specimens possessed a higher residual compression strength for a given impact energy and damage size. These results are attempted to be explained by the different damage morphology that occurs between the bare and TPS covered specimens.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311410509" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>As part of a risk reduction program for utilizing composite components on future manned launch vehicles, a satisfactory demonstration of damage tolerance is required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410509">1</xref></sup> The vast majority of past studies on the foreign object impact damage characteristics of composite laminates have been on bare components, where the impacting object came in direct contact with the outer ply of the laminate. However, many launch vehicle components are covered with a thermal protection system (TPS) for temperature requirements during flight. Since the TPS will be in place for the majority of the component's life, especially when it is most vulnerable to foreign object impacts (transportation and assembly), the effects of impact damage to the TPS-covered composite laminate are needed since the impact characteristics can change due to the presence of the TPS.</p>
<p>In a European study of the effects of a cork TPS for launch vehicle fairing applications, the damage morphology and resulting residual compression strength of composite laminates were heavily influenced by the presence of cork TPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410509">2</xref></sup> It was noted that the TPS acted as a very good visual indicator of an impact damage event and increased the impact energy at which damage formed in the composite laminate. At the higher spectrum of impact levels used, the TPS caused a larger damage zone as determined by ultrasonic C-scan compared to bare laminates due to the load-spreading effectof the cork; however, the compression after impact (CAI) strength was consistently higher for the TPS-covered laminates when based on either impact energy or damage size as detected by ultrasonic C-scan. Two findings of note in the cork-covered laminates were: (1) impact damage morphology is different with less matrix cracking and fewer, but longer, delaminations; (2) some impacted specimens had reduced compression strength even with no detectable damage from an ultrasonic C-scan.</p>
<p>Other studies have examined the impact damage characteristics of carbon/epoxy laminates covered with other materials, not for thermal requirements but to enhance the damage tolerance characteristics of the laminate. Laminas with fibers of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) with various matrix materials were placed on one or both outer surfaces of carbon/epoxy laminates to enhance damage tolerance characteristics in at least four studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410509">3</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311410509">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the study of Adams and Zimmerman,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410509">3</xref></sup> it was found that as the number of UHMWPE/Epoxy plies increased, so did the amount of impact energy absorbed by the specimen as measured by instrumented impact tests. Such data were used for carbon/epoxy laminates with the top one-fourth or two-fifth of the laminate made of laminas of UHMWPE/epoxy.</p>
<p>Busgen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311410509">4</xref></sup> examined the CAI strength of impact damaged 8-ply laminates that consisted of specimens with (1) all 8 plies having carbon fiber reinforcement, (2) 1 outer ply on each side having UHMWPE fiber replace the carbon fiber, and (3) the outer 2 plies on each side having UHMWPE fiber replace the carbon fiber for a total of three types of specimens. The damage area as measured by ultrasonic C-scan showed that at high impact energy (12 J), the specimen with 2plies of UHMWPE fiber on front and back had larger damage areas compared to the all carbon fiber and 1-ply UHMWPE fiber specimens. However, when tested for CAI strength, the specimens with the outer 2 plies having UHMWPE fiber had higher normalized CAI strengths despite the larger damage area. If the UHMWPE fiber was placed on only one side of the specimen, a greater CAI strength was seen when the UHMWPE fiber was on the back (non-impacted) side of the laminate. The same results were found in the study of Peijs et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311410509">5</xref></sup> for residual flexural strength although the damage area decreased with additional outer plies of UHMWPE fiber at all impact energy levels tested.</p>
<p>Nettles and Lance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311410509">6</xref></sup> tested both honeycomb sandwich panels and monolithic laminates made of carbon/epoxy with 1 ply of UHMWPE/thermoplastic on the surfaces. Instrumented impact data showed little difference in maximum load of impact except for the honeycomb samples, which had a higher maximum load of impact at the higher ranges of impact energies used where the specimens with the UHMWPE/thermoplastic ply could withstand higher loads due to the delay of carbon fiber breakage onset. For honeycomb specimens, cross-sectional examination of the impact damage zone showed that the specimens without alayer of UHMWPE/thermoplastic contained more through-thickness damage than specimens with a layer of UHMWPE/thermoplastic although ultrasonic C-scan images showed little difference in damage area. The CAI results showed no difference in specimens with and without a ply of UHMWPE/thermoplastic. It was noted that the most beneficial aspect of the UHMWPE/thermoplastic ply was that it acted as a good impact indicator as a distinct white spot was made on the UHMWPE/thermoplastic ply at the impact location.</p>
<p>The aforementioned studies demonstrate that covering a laminate with another layer of material (cork or plies of UHMWPE fiber/resin) generally causes larger damage areas as detected by non-destructive evaluation (NDE), but CAI strength is unaffected or improved due to the different damage morphologies within the impacted laminate.</p>
<p>In an effort to protect composite laminates from impact damage, a few studies examined using a structure bonded to a composite laminate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311410509">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311410509">8</xref></sup> In the study of Shuart et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311410509">7</xref></sup> core material (honeycomb or Rohacell foam) with an outer face sheet consisting of 3 plies of various fiber/resin systems was assessed for both damage protection and damage detection with favorable results. In the study of ‘t Hart and Ubels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311410509">8</xref></sup> a surface layer of low-density adhesive filled with glass microballoons covered with three layers of aluminum gauze was found to protect a composite laminate and act as an improved visual aid for impact damage.</p>
<p>The protection of both composite and metallic aircraft parts has not gone unnoted as there are at least two commercial products available to protect surfaces from impact. They consist of applying adhesive sheets with coatings of polyester/polyethylene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311410509">9</xref></sup> or polyurethane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410509">10</xref></sup> to surfaces that require impact protection.</p>
<p>Although these applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410509">3</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410509">10</xref></sup> were specifically designed to enhance damage tolerance characteristics, the results of these studies may be applicable to the damage tolerance characteristics of a laminated composite structure with a TPS coating. Since it has been reported that the amount and type of damage can be influenced by a surface coating/covering, the goal of this study is to evaluate the impact response of a carbon/epoxy sandwich structure covered with foam TPS, identical to what is planned to be used on the ARES I launch vehicle interstage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021998311410509" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title>
<p>The TPS utilized in this study is a sprayable polyurethane foam planned for use on the ARES I launch vehicle composite interstage. The foam has a nominal thickness of about 7.6 cm with a variation of ±1.3 mm. The areal density of the foam is 294 g/m<sup>2</sup>. A photograph of the surface of the foam is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410509">Figure 1</xref> and it illustrates the coarseness of the surface texture.
<fig id="fig1-0021998311410509" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Photograph of the coarse surface texture of TPS foam used in this study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410509-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The foam-covered composite consists of a sandwich structure planned for use on the ARES I launch vehicle composite interstage. This sandwich structure has 18-ply face sheets and an aluminum honeycomb core. An aluminum screen (to serve as a lightning strike protection) is applied to the outer surface of the sandwich structure with epoxy film adhesive before the TPS foam is applied. This screen is nominally 0.13 mm thick and has approximately five meshes per centimeter. The areal density of the aluminum screen is 78.2 g/m<sup>2</sup>. The core used is perforated 5052 aluminum honeycomb with 3.2 mm cell size, having a density of 50 kg/m<sup>3</sup> and thickness of 2.54 cm with an areal density of 1271 g/m<sup>2</sup>. The face sheets consist of IM7/8552 carbon/epoxy and the film adhesive used to bond the face sheet to the core is FM-300 k, having an areal density of 379 g/m<sup>2</sup>. The lay-up of the 18-ply face sheets is [+45,0, −45,0,90,0,0,90,0]<sub>S</sub>. Each carbon/epoxy face sheet has a thickness of 2.9 mm, an areal density of 4597 g/m<sup>2</sup> and was co-cured to the honeycomb core. The honeycomb sandwich panels were manufactured as 61 × 61 cm<sup>2</sup> sandwich plates from which, 10.2 × 15.2 cm<sup>2</sup> specimens were machined for impact and subsequent compression testing. This gave each specimen a structural load bearing (laminate) cross-sectional area of 5.94 cm<sup>2</sup> which is used to calculate the breaking stresses. Testing of the lightning strike layer showed compression strength of 142 ± 15 MPa and a compression modulus of 4.76 ± 0.51 GPa. The strength is 42% less than the lamina transverse compression strength of the material used for the laminate and the modulus is 53% lower than the modulus of a transverse ply. For an undamaged 18-ply laminate with 10 plies at 0°, the contribution to strength of the lightning strike layer should be negligible.</p>
<p>A photograph of a cross section of sandwich structure with TPS like that used in this study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311410509">Figure 2</xref>. The load in the impact tests was applied perpendicular to the foam layer, as shown by the arrow in the figure.
<fig id="fig2-0021998311410509" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Edgewise photograph of sandwich structure used in this study showing direction of impact loading.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410509-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In order to decouple the impact response of the lightning strike layer from the foam TPS, some specimens had the TPS removed before impact, and thus the sandwich specimen was covered only by the screen lightning strike layer.</p>
<p>In addition to the specimens with the screen-lightning strike layer and TPS on the outer surface of the sandwich structure, baseline specimens without screen-lightning strike layer or TPS were also tested in this study. This gave a total of three types of specimens used in this study: (1) <italic>bare</italic>: those without covering, (2) <italic>screen</italic>: those covered only with the lightning screen and film adhesive, and (3) <italic>foam</italic>: those with both the lightning screen/film adhesive and foam TPS covering the face sheet.</p>
<p>The areal density values of the bare, screen, and foam specimens are 11.25, 11.74, and 12.03 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, representing a mass increase of 4.3% for the screen specimens and 6.9% for the foam specimens over the bare specimens. Undamaged specimens tested in compression gave an average strength of 523 ± 17 MPa. The presence of the lightning strike mesh had no effect on the virgin compression strength.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0021998311410509"><title>Impact testing</title>
<p>An instrumented drop weight tower was used to impact the sandwich specimens with a range of impact energies from 1 to 37.5 J. The impact energy was varied by adjusting the height of the dropped mass. An instrumented impactor (tup) with a load capacity of 22.25 kN and diameter of 1.3 cm was used throughout this study. The dropped mass used was 1.2 kg. The velocity of the falling mass was measured just prior to impact to calculate an impact energy. This eliminates a potential source of error in the impact energy calculation due to friction losses between the falling mass and its guideposts. Load data during the impact event were recorded with Instron's Impulse® data acquisition system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0021998311410509"><title>NDE testing</title>
<p>The damage in the specimens was assessed with infrared thermography (IRT). IRT is a NDE technique that uses a sensitive infrared camera to monitor heat dissipation from a surface induced with a flash of heat from a quartz lamp. Areas of damage will dissipate heat at different rates than undamaged material and the results observed are termed ‘indications'. A typical indication for the type of specimen used in this study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311410509">Figure 3</xref>. This 2D indication assesses the planar area of damage within the specimen. In a previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311410509">11</xref></sup> it was shown that damage width (damage size perpendicular to the loading direction) to be the best indicator of residual compression strength; thus, damage width was the parameter used in this study.
<fig id="fig3-0021998311410509" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Typical IRT indication of impact damaged laminate showing damage width, the parameter used in this study to characterize CAI strength.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410509-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0021998311410509"><title>Cross-sectional microscopy</title>
<p>Honeycomb sandwich panels representing the three types of specimens – bare, screen, and foam – examined in this study were impacted over a range of 2.7–27.2 J and then cross-sectioned to ascertain the differences in through-thickness damage morphology. The specimens were sectioned in the 0° direction through the center of the impact zone and then polished with successively finer grit silicon carbide paper on a polishing wheel. Once polished, the cross sections were examined under an optical microscope at magnifications up to 50×.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0021998311410509"><title>Compression-after-impact testing</title>
<p>Specimens of the bare, screen, and foam configuration were tested for residual compression strength after impact. Once the specimens had been impacted, photographed, and the foam TPS removed (if initially present), they were prepared for compression testing. The ends of the specimen were potted into aluminum frames and then machined flat and parallel to within ±0.0003 mm tolerance. Details of the specimen and testing procedure can be found elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311410509">11</xref></sup> A photograph of the type of CAI specimens used in this study, along with a typical load–strain curve is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311410509">Figure 4</xref>.

<sec id="sec9-0021998311410509"><title>Instrumented impact data</title>
<p>Load–displacement plots for the three types of specimens examined in this study impacted at 25.2 J are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410509">Figure 5</xref>. Since the area under these curves represents energy, these plots can give a relative idea of the amount of energy absorbed due to the presence of the TPS.
<fig id="fig5-0021998311410509" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Instrumented impact data for the three types of specimens examined in this study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410509-fig5.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The screen and bare specimens have very similar signatures and the energy under these two curves is 25.0 J which indicates that almost all the impact energy went into the specimen. The total area under the foam load–displacement curve is 18.5 J of which approximately, 1.2 J is from the crushing of the outer layer of foam. This energy is represented by the shaded area in the load–displacement plot for the foam specimen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410509">Figure 5</xref>. The presence of the TPS contributes very little (∼6%) to the total energy absorbed during the impact event; however, the crushed foam apparently acts a load spreader and thus less energy is absorbed by the specimen (less damage) due to this effect. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311410509">Figure6</xref> shows a schematic of the load-spreading effect of the foam.
<fig id="fig6-0021998311410509" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Load-spreading effect of the outer layer of foam.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410509-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Since the maximum load of impact is approximately the same for all three types of specimens at a given impact energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410509">Figure 5</xref>), the contact stresses are smaller for the foam covered specimens due to the larger effective contact area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0021998311410509"><title>Damage width</title>
<p>Comparisons of IRT indications for the three types of specimens examined in this study are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311410509">Figure 7</xref>.
<fig id="fig7-0021998311410509" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Representative IRT results are shown for foam covered (left), screen (middle) and bare (right) specimens at low (&lt;8 J) and high (&gt;15 J) impact energies.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410509-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Differences in damage geometry were observed in the IRT results. At high (&gt;15 J) impact energies, the indications on the foam covered specimens were more elliptical compared to the more circular indications on the bare and screen specimens.</p>
<p>Results from the impact tests on bare, screen, and foam specimens are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311410509">Figure 8</xref> for damage width, as detected by NDE <italic>vs</italic>. impact energy.
<fig id="fig8-0021998311410509" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Plot of NDE width <italic>vs</italic>. impact energy.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410509-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>From the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311410509">Figure 8</xref>, it appears that the TPS has little effect on the damage width formed at mid-range impact energies (up to about 15 J in this case). However, at higher impact energies, the screen and foam specimens show a larger damage width for a given impact energy. The bare specimens exhibited surface fiber breakage at ∼18 J, indicating the start of complete puncture of the impacted face sheet. The screen specimens exhibited surface fiber breakage at ∼26 J. The foam specimens did not show the onset of puncture until about 35 J, which was the upper limit used in this study. Typically, when damage size is plotted as a function of impact energy, the size increases with increasing impact energy until the start of puncture at which energy and above, the size remains fairly constant as a hole is formed in the laminate by the impactor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311410509">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311410509">13</xref></sup> This effort found this constant size at penetration is 16% higher for the screen specimens than for the bare specimens, probably due to the extra layer acting as a load spreader, as previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410509">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311410509">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311410509">6</xref></sup> The foam layer required 58% greater impact energy to achieve puncture. Thus, the screen and foam specimens increased the impact energy at which fiber breakage in the outer plies occurred by 44% and 94%, respectively.</p>
<p>Examining the data at low (&lt;8 J) impact energies shows that the foam appears to delay the onset of detectable damage from IRT testing. The data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311410509">Figure 8</xref> are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311410509">Figure 9</xref> at low impact energies to illustrate this effect in a better manner.
<fig id="fig9-0021998311410509" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Plot of NDE width <italic>vs</italic>. impact energy at low (&lt;8 J) impact energies.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410509-fig9.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The bare specimens do not demonstrate damage as detected by NDE until about 2 J. Once detectable damage does appear, it has a minimum width of about 7.5 mm. The screen specimens differ little from the bare specimens. The foam specimens do not demonstrate detectable damage until about 6.8 J of impact energy. Once detectable damage does appear in the foam specimens, it has a minimum width of about 18 mm. Thus, the critical energy at which detectable impact damage forms is 79% greater for the foam specimens than the bare or screen specimens. The minimum detectable damage size that forms is 89% greater for the foam specimens than the bare or screen specimens. At the lower range of impact energies, the foam layer has a more pronounced effect on the sandwich specimens than the lightning strike layer. At the higher range of impact energies used in this study, both layers contribute to give a larger IRT damage size than the bare specimens.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0021998311410509"><title>Visual examination</title>
<p>Examples of the visual damage on foam, screen, and bare specimens are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311410509">Figure 10</xref> for impact energies of 3.3 J. The TPS acts as a good impact indicator, since the impact was clearly visible on the specimens covered with foam, whereas there was no visible damage on the screen or bare specimens. Barely visible impact damage (BVID) on the screen covered specimens was not evident until impact energy of 16.8 J was reached. For the bare specimens, BVID was evident at 11.5 J of impact energy. It should be noted that BVID requires a specific definition for any given structure and is dependent upon many variables including examiner, lighting, surface finish, proximity to impact site, etc. Photographs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311410509">Figure 11</xref> are included to define the type of damage considered BVID in this particular study.

<p>For the foam-covered specimens, the foam was removed from the impacted specimens to ascertain the extent of visual damage beneath the foam. Examples of the three specimen types examined in this study impacted at similar energy levels are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311410509">Figure 12</xref>.

</fig></p>
<p>Although the foam acts as a good impact indicator, once the foam is removed, the impact event is less visible on the laminates covered with foam than that on the screen or bare laminates. Thus, if there is some type of removable foam covering the laminate, care must be taken to examine the foam for impacts before removal since the foam tends to obscure the visual damage once removed.</p>

<sec id="sec12-0021998311410509"><title>Cross-sectional examination</title>
<p>Impacted specimens were cross-sectioned to assess the damage morphology. Typical results for an impact of 8.1 J are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311410509">Figure 13</xref>. In these images, only one-half of the total cross-sectional damage area is shown, since the damage severity is approximately symmetrical on either half of the impact location. The plies which contain delaminations and/or matrix cracking are not necessarily symmetric, but the general damage morphology is. The dimpling or waviness in the plies closest to the core is typical of co-cured sandwich structures with a honeycomb core.
<fig id="fig13-0021998311410509" position="float"><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><p>Photographs of typical cross sections through the impact zone of specimens impacted with 8.1 J of energy; one-half of the damage zone is shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410509-fig13.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>All specimens impacted at energies below about 15 J showed approximately the same level of delamination and matrix cracking. The foam did delay the onset of delamination, but once delamination formed, it differed little from the bare and screen specimens up to approximately 15 J of impact energy.</p>
<p>Typical results for an impact level of 15.6 J are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998311410509">Figure 14</xref>. The bare specimen shows fiber breakage in the 0° ply closest to the core. This ply is assumed to carry less load than the central and outer 0° plies due to its waviness from the co-cure process. Wavy 0° plies have been shown to reduce the compression strength of a laminate by the proportion of 0° wavy plies to 0° straight plies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311410509">14</xref></sup> Thus, the emphasis is on the straighter 0° plies away from the core which carry the majority of the compressive load. At impact energies greater than about 15 J, it was noted that the delaminations within the foam specimens tended to be longer than the delaminations on the bare and screen specimens which can be seen by the NDE data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311410509">Figure 7</xref> showing a more elliptical shape with the longer axis in the 0° direction. The bare specimens tended to exhibit more damage on the plies closest to the core and on the plies at the top of the laminate. The data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311410509">Figure 7</xref> indicate that the foam specimens should have less damage overall which apparently is the case, as indicated by cross-sectioning.

<p>From the CAI results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998311410509">Figure 15</xref>, it is apparent that the screen specimens had a higher CAI strength for a given impact energy than the bare specimens and the foam specimens had a higher CAI strength for a given impact energy than the screen specimens. However; the damage size for the screen and foam specimens was the same or larger than the bare specimens for a given impact energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311410509">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311410509">Figure 7</xref>, the lightning strike layer and/or the TPS foam do not ‘protect’ the specimen from forming damage following an impact event. Furthermore, the CAI strength is higher for the screen and foam specimens for a given damage size as detected by IRT. Thus, the higher CAI strengths of the screen and foam specimens are not caused by a reduction in damage size as detected by IRT and an alternate explanation of why the residual strength of the screen and foam specimens is higher is needed.</p>
<p>Damage tolerance has been explained by the damage morphology of the specimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410509">2</xref></sup> A closer examination of the cross sections in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311410509">Figures 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998311410509">14</xref> concentrating on the outer two 0° plies since the inner two are wavy and presumably carry much less load, give some possible explanations for the CAI results.</p>
<p>For specimens impacted at lower impact energies, it was noted that the angle of the matrix crack in the −45° ply below the outer most 0° ply differed between thethree types of specimens tested. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0021998311410509">Figure 17</xref> shows more detailed images of the cross sections shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311410509">Figure 13</xref>. In general, the bare specimens had larger crack angles when the angle is measured between the crack and the through-thickness direction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0021998311410509">Figure 17</xref> shows the approximate angle measurements for the specimens examined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311410509">Figure 13</xref>.

</fig></p>
<p>It is possible that as the specimen is loaded in compression, the crack has a ‘wedge-like’ effect and causes out of plane forces on the neighboring plies. This ‘wedge effect’ has been explained by Puck and Schurmann<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311410509">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311410509">16</xref></sup> and termed ‘Mode C Inter-Fiber Failure (IFF)’. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0021998311410509">Figure 18</xref> shows a 2D representation of this type of failure.
<fig id="fig18-0021998311410509" position="float"><label>Figure 18.</label><caption><p>Schematic of ‘wedge effect’ of angled matrix cracks in compression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410509-fig18.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>As the fracture angle <italic>θ</italic><sub>fp</sub> becomes larger, the in plane stress <italic>σ<sub>x</sub></italic> will cause the normal stress <italic>σ<sub>n</sub></italic> to become larger which in turn causes the through-thickness stress <italic>σ</italic><sub>3</sub> to become larger indicating more likelihood of IFF. The friction between the two inclined planes help to delay the onset of Mode C IFF, however, once <italic>σ<sub>x</sub></italic> becomes large enough to overcome this friction, the two halves slide up and over each other causing the neighboring plies to delaminate and become unstable, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0021998311410509">Figure 19</xref>.

</fig></p>
<p>It should be noted that Puck and Schurmann<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311410509">16</xref></sup> demonstrate that in-plane compressive loads typically would not give rise to this type of failure for carbon fiber laminates of the (0°/±45°/90°) family since the 0° ply failure strain is so much lower than the failure strain needed to cause the inclined matrix cracks needed for the Mode C IFF. However, in this study, the inclined matrix cracks are caused by an out of plane load (impact) and inclined matrix cracks occur due to this type of load as evidence by the cross-sectional photographs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311410509">Figures 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998311410509">14</xref>.</p>
<p>For specimens impacted at higher impact energies, a closer examination revealed that the plies sandwiching the outermost 0° ply were consistently more heavily damaged in the bare specimens. Overall, the screen specimens tended to have less damage and the foam specimens had practically no damage in these plies. Closer views from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998311410509">Figure 14</xref> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-0021998311410509">Figure 20</xref>.
<fig id="fig20-0021998311410509" position="float"><label>Figure 20.</label><caption><p>Detail of damage to the +45° and −45° plies sandwiching the outermost 0° ply at impact energy levels above 13.5 J.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410509-fig20.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Berbinau et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311410509">17</xref></sup> have shown that the stiffness of plies neighboring the main load carrying 0° plies can have an effect on the compression strength of the laminate and the strength can be reduced by about 20% for laminates composed of 50% 0° plies if an outer ply is a 0° ply. This is shown to be due to out-of-plane microbuckling since one side has no neighboring plies to support the outer 0° ply and force in-plane microbuckling which is a higher strain failure event.</p>
<p>Qualitatively, it can be seen that for the outermost 0°ply in the specimens tested at higher impact energies in this study, the bare specimens had the least support from the ±45° plies neighboring it. These specimens typically demonstrated complete delamination at both interfaces along with severe matrix cracking. The screen specimens typically had delamination between both interfaces, but matrix cracking in the ±45° plies was minimal. The foam specimens typically showed no delamination between the interfaces and little to no matrix cracking. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0021998311410509">Figure 16</xref> shows that for large damage sizes (in the 3.8 cm range), the foam specimens had 64% higher compression strength and the screen specimens had 39% higher compression strength than the bare specimens. Thus, when undamaged specimens are compression tested, the lightning strike layer adds negligible stability to the outermost 0° ply, but causes a higher CAI strength by preventing the two outer 45°plies from sustaining greater damage. For the foam specimens, the lightning strike layer plus the foam prevent the outer two 45° plies from delaminating from the 0° ply between them.</p>

<sec id="sec15-0021998311410509" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Although the foam and screen specimens had larger damage sizes for a given impact energy based on NDE indications, their residual compression strength was greater than the bare specimens. This is explained by the different damage morphology that forms.</p>
<p>A difference in damage size for a given impact energy was not evident until about 13.5 J, at which point the presence of the foam layer caused the largest damage, followed by the screen and then the bare composite surface. Thus, the damage resistance of the carbon/epoxy face sheets changes at the higher end of impact energies used in this study.</p>
<p>The findings in this study were similar to those found in the study of Petit et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410509">2</xref></sup> for high strength fiber, namely that TPS causes a different damage morphology which leads to the different CAI results. The CAI results are a measure of damage tolerance and from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0021998311410509">Figure 16</xref> it appears that the additive layers (screen and foam) enhance the damage tolerance of the carbon/epoxy face sheets. This information, along with the literature review presented in the introduction, suggests that this is usually the effect of additive layers on the outer surface of a laminate due to the load-spreading effect shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311410509">Figure 6</xref>.</p>
<p>No loss in compression strength was observed for panels that did not exhibit damage as detected by IRT NDE techniques. Thus, it was assumed that the IRT NDE technique detected all detrimental damage observed in this study.</p>
<p>The foam covered specimens require larger minimum impact energy to form damage, and once it forms, the smallest damage size is larger than the bare or screen specimens impacted at the same levels. The threshold of impact energy required to create damage detectable by IRT was increased by 79% for the foam coating.</p>
<p>At higher impact energies, the lightning strike layer protects the outermost ±45° plies. With less damage in the outermost ±45° plies, the outermost 0° ply is more stabilized than in the bare composites that exhibited greater damage in the ±45° plies.</p>
<p>At the lower end of impact energies examined in this study, the higher CAI strength for the foam covered specimens can be explained by Mode C IFF as outlined by Puck.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311410509">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311410509">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the higher end of impact energies examined in this study, the higher CAI strength for the foam and screen specimens can be explained by improved stability of the outer most 0° ply.</p>
<p>The most significant aspect of having TPS foam and a lightning strike layer is that these layers act as a good impact indicator as well as a protection. This comes at a cost of a 6.9% increase in mass (areal weight). Impacts in the foam coating were clearly visible at 3.0 J of impact energy while the screen specimens did not exhibit barely visible damage until 16.8 J and the bare specimens exhibited BVID at 11.5 J.</p>
