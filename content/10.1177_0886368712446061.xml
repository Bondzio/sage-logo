<abstract>
<p>The importance of pay to employees has been a controversial topic among compensation professionals for at least the past 40 years. It has received considerable attention from the best minds in academia and from respected HR consulting firms. In recent years, consultants’ survey research studies have contributed substantially to defining pay’s role in attracting, retaining and engaging certain employees. In some cases, their findings have contradicted the beliefs of scholars, which are rooted in the distant past. Further study is needed to establish the best method for learning how important pay is to employees and to determine the effect pay has on their motivation to work.</p>

<p>In 2002, the Society for Human Resource Management surveyed 959 human resource (HR) managers, directors and vice presidents to determine the extent to which their beliefs about employee behavior were consistent with research findings from the behavioral sciences. Generally, the comparison between the two by HR scholars found some large discrepancies, primarily in the area of employee selection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886368712446061">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some scholars have interpreted the survey results to mean that HR managers do not read research journals and apply the latest thinking from the behavioral sciences in their work. They are said to view journals as too technical, impractical and irrelevant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0886368712446061">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>An area in the survey of particular interest to compensation professionals was the responses to this true–false question: “Surveys that directly ask employees how important pay is to them are likely to overestimate pay’s true importance in actual decisions.” Thirty-five percent of the respondents believed the statement was false, which was the correct answer according to the scholars’ analysis of several research studies.</p>
<p>Scholars believe that employees are likely to <italic>underestimate</italic> pay’s importance when directly asked and that their true beliefs about pay’s importance are revealed only when they make decisions related to pay. They have hypothesized that people respond in this way because of a lack of self-insight and the social undesirability of stating that money is most important to them.</p>
<p>Using this survey as a springboard, this article discusses the importance pay has for attracting, motivating and retaining employees. It looks at past and recent contributions of academic scholars and HR consultants to describe what we know and do not know about the subject.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886368712446061">
<title>The Correct Answer</title>
<p>Based on an analysis of the key research study used by the scholars to support their “correct” answer, one could make a good case that the HR leaders’ responses were neither right nor wrong, as explained below.</p>
<p>In the key study,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0886368712446061">3</xref></sup> differences were found between the participants’ relative ranking of six important job characteristics, using the following procedures:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A rank order method</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A ranking based on the distribution of 100 points according to the most and least preferable characteristic</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A ranking based on the subjects’ indications of how willing they would be to accept a position, after reviewing a position description containing the characteristics. The importance of each characteristic was inferred by applying regression analysis to their evaluations of the positions. This method is said to capture an employee’s “policy” on such matters.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Pay ranked fourth in this first procedure (use of skills and abilities ranked first) and first in the other two (use of skills and abilities ranked second). HR scholars claim this result shows our tendency to underestimate pay’s true importance when directly asked.</p>
<p>The claim that policy capturing was the superior method went too far, based on the conclusions of the study authors. They were unsure of the best method and stated, “The self-report ranks differ from the rankings yielded by . . . other measures (in the order of the first four items). More research is needed with broader samples of tasks and subjects to resolve the issue.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0886368712446061">3</xref></sup> In 1983, several HR scholars reached a similar conclusion: “The relative superiority of . . . rating/ranking or policy-capturing procedures has not been definitely established . . .”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0886368712446061">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Based on this information, we do not know if employees have a tendency to underestimate or overestimate pay’s importance in direct rankings, as there is no proven method for accurately determining what their true beliefs are. Thus, there is no correct answer (true/false) to the question: “Surveys that directly ask employees how important pay is to them are likely to overestimate pay’s true importance in actual decisions.”</p>
<p>Other aspects of the study that would cause many HR leaders to dismiss its contribution toward clarifying pay’s importance to employees are as follows:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The subjects in the study did not rank pay alone but pay and benefits together. Employees can hold very different opinions about the importance of pay and benefits, which undermines any conclusions from the study concerning the importance of pay alone.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The 62 subjects in the study were students in graduate management programs, a rather select group to generalize from on the topic of people’s attitudes toward pay. It is likely that other groups of people would have different attitudes about pay. A meta-analytical study that summarized a large number of studies, involving a cross-section of people, would have provided more compelling evidence of a generalized tendency that merits the attention of HR leaders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0886368712446061">5</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>People’s attitudes about the importance of pay and willingness to admit that they work for money could have changed in the 24 years that transpired between the time the study was conducted in 1978 and the time the HR leaders were surveyed in 2002.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In summary, scholars did not have a solid basis for concluding that employees’ true beliefs about the importance of pay are revealed by policy capturing. Their case was also weak in suggesting that HR leaders were out of touch with employee attitudes and that they would have benefitted from reading research journals. Although it is probably true that many HR practitioners had not read or were aware of this research study, it appeared that academic researchers had not closely read it and related studies from academia as well.</p>
<p>The results of the study and its analysis, however, do raise several significant issues about the importance of pay to employees that HR scholars and consultants have tried to shed light on for many years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0886368712446061">
<title>Edward Lawler’s Research</title>
<p>The above instance was not the first time academic researchers dealt with the issue of the importance of pay. In 1971, Edward Lawler wrote about the subject extensively and insightfully in his book, <italic>Pay and Organizational Effectiveness: A Psychological View.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0886368712446061">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lawler analyzed the results of 49 studies that ranked the importance of pay and other job characteristics. He found that the mean and median rank for pay was about third. Twenty-nine percent of the studies found that pay ranked first and 83% in the top five. His interest in the matter stemmed in part from an earlier analysis of 16 studies by Frederick Herzberg that showed pay ranked six in importance, which supported Herzberg’s theory that pay was not an effective motivator of behavior.</p>
<p>Lawler stated that we should not place great faith in such studies because of the overlap in ranking factors, the wording of the survey (e.g., people rank <italic>high pay</italic> lower than <italic>fair pay</italic>) and the social desirability of saying pay is unimportant.</p>
<p>His other pertinent observations are as follows:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>It is impossible to say how much more pay is important in relation to other factors when people make decisions, for example, on choosing a job or in motivating their behavior.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The data in his study suggested, but were not conclusive, in showing that pay was more important in attracting than in motivating employees.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>As we move up the organization, pay becomes less important to employees. Skilled blue-collar employees place less importance on pay than do unskilled employees as do higher level managers when compared with lower level managers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>With respect to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, studies show that pay can satisfy autonomy and independence needs, but is not particularly effective for satisfying social and self-actualization needs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do not assume that pay is the most important factor to your subordinates. There is a general tendency for superiors to overestimate the importance their subordinates assign to pay, regardless of their level in the organization.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do not believe reports from social scientists that pay is about sixth in importance.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Based on his analysis of the literature on employee differences, he hypothesized this profile of an employee who, in the 1970s, was likely to value pay highly. He stated that
<disp-quote>
<p>The employee is a male, young (probably in his twenties); he has low self-assurance and high neuroticism; he comes from a small town or farm background; he belongs to few clubs and social groups; he owns his own home or aspires to own one and probably is a Republican and a Protestant.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A similar analysis for current times could not be found.</p>
<p>In 2000, Lawler revisited the subject of the importance of pay in his book, <italic>Rewarding Excellence</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0886368712446061">7</xref></sup> He repeated his warning about putting too much faith in survey reports on the importance of pay. He advised, without citing studies, that they are unreliable because people have trouble determining what is important to them and that it is socially undesirable for some people to say they work for money, which results in pay being undervalued in some surveys. His general advice is to recognize the wide variability in the needs of people when designing reward packages.</p>
<p>Little academic research has been done by psychologists in the past 30 years to inform our thinking about how important pay is to employees and the best method for measuring its importance. As discussed below, some compensation scholars have written about the effect financial incentives have on employee performance to bolster pay’s importance in the eyes of practitioners. In recent years, consultants have surveyed thousands of employees to determine how important pay is to the attraction, motivation and retention of employees. Their work, which is summarized below, provides the best current insights on the importance of pay.</p>

<title>Employee Attraction</title>
<p>From 2001 to 2010, Towers Watson has conducted five surveys biennially of between 5,000 and 40,000 U. S. employees to determine the important job characteristics for attracting, retaining and engaging employees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0886368712446061">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0886368712446061">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0886368712446061">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0886368712446061">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0886368712446061">12</xref></sup> The surveys have consistently found that a competitive base salary is the number one factor for attracting employees, except for 2003 when it was ranked second.

<p>This ranking is determined by respondents’ answers to a direct question about the top five reasons they would look for in a new job. This finding directly contradicts what the scholars claim is employees’ tendency to underestimate the importance of pay when directly asked. The exact opposite may be true—employees could be overestimating the importance of pay. We do not know for sure, because the best way to measure employee’s true beliefs about the importance of pay has not been established.</p>
<p>What we do know from these surveys is that large numbers of people have no trouble saying that pay is important to them, contrary to the idea that it is socially unacceptable to do so. These surveys arguably are better reflections of how employees rank pay than the studies from the 1970s that are cited by compensation scholars. Towers Watson surveys have been done 5 times over 10 recent years with virtually the same results. The survey samples are large, statistically valid and involve employees of many companies. The studies cited by some compensation scholars have used small numbers of graduate students (62)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0886368712446061">3</xref></sup> and job applicants from one company<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0886368712446061">13</xref></sup> to determine how employees value pay in the 1970s.</p>
<p>There are limitations to the Towers Watson surveys. The survey respondents are primarily employees of large and midsize U.S. corporations. The question asked of employees to determine the direct rankings is not published. They do not state how important a factor is when compared with other key job characteristics—slightly better, twice as important and so on. Rankings for employees at various levels and positions are not always published, so we cannot see, for example, if hourly workers value pay differently than professionals and managers. These observations are generally true for academic studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886368712446061">
<title>Employee Motivation</title>
<p>The results of the survey of HR leaders led some HR scholars to suspect that there is an inconsistency between what employees say is important about their jobs and what the research shows is important in motivating them. They also noted that HR and general management publications (e.g., <italic>HR Magazine</italic> and <italic>Harvard Business Review</italic>) had a tendency to publish articles that undervalue pay as a motivator, and they wanted to counter that bias.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0886368712446061">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2004, to make their case, they cited the results of several research studies that summarize individual studies demonstrating the effectiveness of financial incentives. One cited study was “The Relative Effectiveness of Four Methods of Motivating Employee Performance.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0886368712446061">15</xref></sup> It summarized 56 field studies that compared the effects of four methods for motivating employee performance, as follows:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Financial incentives—30% improvement (median)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Goal setting—16% improvement</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Job enrichment—8.75% to 17% improvement</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Participation in decision-making—0.5% improvement</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To analyze financial incentives, the researchers reviewed the results of 10 field and simulated field studies published between 1934 and 1978. A review of the research methods and subjects used in these studies reveals weaknesses and limitations that seriously detract from the summary study’s value as supporting evidence for the broad use of financial incentives and for the idea that pay is the best motivator.</p>
<p>First, the financial incentives study was not a meta-analytical study, where the effect of one variable on another is measured across all the studies, and the number of subjects in the samples is considered, to arrive at a form of weighted effect figure. Instead, what is reported is the median performance improvement for the 10 studies, which was 30%. The individual values fell in a range of from 3% to 49%. Meta-analytical studies usually offer the most compelling evidence because they provide researchers with a systematic method for quantitatively summarizing a large number of individual research studies on a particular concept.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0886368712446061">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Second, according to the researchers, none of the 10 incentive studies used the most advanced experimental design. Four were surveys, and five did not use a control or comparison group to make a strong case that the change in performance was because of the use of incentives and could not be attributed in part to other factors in the work setting.</p>
<p>Third, in 4 of the 10 studies, the number of subjects is small—12, 14, 15 and 20.</p>
<p>Fourth, all the studies were conducted about 33 to 78 years ago, which raises the question of how applicable the results are to the current workforce in terms of the jobs studied and the value people place on money.</p>
<p>Fifth, the studies examined piecework pay plans for hourly employees. We do not know whether the results would hold true for workers whose work is less amenable to piecework pay, such as professional and managerial employees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0886368712446061">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>These factors raise serious questions about the validity and relevance of the results of this research as it applies to the current workforce, according to several compensation scholars.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0886368712446061">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0886368712446061">18</xref></sup> Results from other summary research studies cited by scholars on the power of financial incentives follow the same general pattern. They are often dated, limited in scope to blue-collar workers, simple tasks and quantity of output.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0886368712446061">16</xref></sup> Some even show that nonfinancial incentives are as effective or are more effective than financial ones in certain circumstances.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0886368712446061">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, these studies do not provide clear and convincing evidence about how effective financial incentives are in motivating key behaviors for important groups in our present economy. They also do not answer the question of which motivators—intrinsic or extrinsic—are more powerful. Thus, they do not contribute much to resolve the question as to which job characteristics are most important in motivating employees.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0886368712446061">
<title>Extrinsic Rewards Bias</title>
<p>For many years, organizational psychologists have noted a tendency for managers to say that their subordinates are primarily motivated by money. Chip Heath, a professor of organizational behavior in the Stanford Graduate School of Business, has done several studies to show that people have a tendency to assume that others are driven more by extrinsic rewards, such as pay, than by intrinsic ones, such as doing challenging work. He refers to this tendency as an “extrinsic rewards bias.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0886368712446061">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2009, McKinsey &amp; Co. conducted research that shows that this tendency could be changing. It surveyed 1,047 executives, managers and employees from around the world to determine what motivates employees. More than a quarter of the respondents were corporate directors or CEOs or other C-level executives. It found that this group believed that three nonfinancial motivators are no less, or even more effective, than the three highest rated financial incentives. The nonfinancial motivators were praise from immediate supervisors, leadership attention and a chance to lead projects. Financial incentives included base-pay increases, cash bonuses and stock or stock options.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0886368712446061">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The reasons for the apparent change in thinking are unclear. It could reflect a temporary change brought on by the recession and cutbacks in financial incentives, or perhaps the respondents were being influenced by the results of employee engagement surveys, which were popular in the past decade and partially overlap the concept of motivation. These surveys typically showed intrinsic rewards and organizational factors to be more important than extrinsic rewards in engaging employees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0886368712446061">22</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886368712446061">
<title>Employee Retention and Engagement</title>
<sec id="section7-0886368712446061">
<title>Towers Watson</title>
<p>The Towers Watson biennial surveys have also shown that competitive base pay has been a top 10 factor for retaining employees in 2001 (rated third), 2003 (sixth) and 2005 (seventh), but not in 2007. Being paid fairly as compared with other employees in the firm was rated as fourth in 2005, the first year it was ranked, and sixth in 2007. Data for 2010 are unavailable. These rankings have been derived statistically through regression analysis of related survey items. One possible reason for the progressively lower rankings of competitive base pay is that the economy was in a recession in 2001, and it took several years for employees’ concerns about money to diminish.</p>
<p>Towers Watson surveys also show that pay items are not among the top 10 drivers of employee engagement. This is understandable since Towers Watson’s engagement survey, like some others, generally identifies organizational commitment and intrinsic motivation as drivers of engagement, not pay.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0886368712446061">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The popularity of the concept of engagement in the past decade may have lowered the importance of pay in the minds of some HR professionals and general managers, if they did not understand the difference between the concepts of employee engagement and motivation. Engagement deals only with intrinsic rewards and employees’ commitment to their company and job while motivation deals with both intrinsic and extrinsic rewards and the performance of specific tasks. The academic community has shown little interest in the concept of engagement as it applies to the business world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0886368712446061">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other consultants have done extensive studies of turnover and retention, as discussed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0886368712446061">
<title>Saratoga Institute</title>
<p>The Saratoga Institute’s confidential third-party surveys of 19,500 employees and former employees from 18 industries, conducted between 1996 and 2003, challenged the idea that most employees change jobs to get more money. Eighty-nine percent of managers believe that employees leave for more money, even though only 12% leave for that reason, according to the Saratoga study. Other top five reasons for leaving are limited career and promotional opportunities (16%), a lack of respect from or support by a supervisor (13%), job is boring/lacks challenge (11%) and supervisor lacks leadership skills (9%). Please see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886368712446061">Table 2</xref> for a list of the top 10 reasons employees give for leaving. Saratoga researchers believe that pay is often a smoke screen for employees’ real reason for changing jobs. It also states that one of the first laws for retaining employees is to pay at or above the market rate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0886368712446061">23</xref></sup></p>

<title>Korn/Ferry International and the Center for Effective Organizations</title>
<p>In the late 1990s, Korn/Ferry International, an executive recruiting firm, and the Center for Effective Organizations, a university-based research partner for organizations, conducted an extensive study and survey of more than 4,500 knowledge workers from 10 large technology corporations in a variety of industries and countries.</p>
<p>Using the results from a survey, focus groups, interviews and objective performance indicators, they analyzed the differences between what employees said is important and what really is important to gain their commitment and to retain them. What employees said is important was based on employees’ responses to direct questions and what is important for their retention was based on a regression analysis of their responses to related questions.</p>
<p>Eighty-six percent of employees said that work–life balance was very or extremely important, 74% said job security and 71% said financial rewards. Career- and job-related factors ranked considerably lower—47% to 57%. There were no major differences between what managers and nonmangers said was important to them.</p>
<p>The analysis of what actually drives commitment and retention showed that only a few factors have a similar impact for all groups, as shown below:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Work–life balance does not have a positive effect on retention for any group of employees, who were analyzed by age, gender, career stage, organizational level and nationality.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Employees identify more closely with a company if it has a viable and well-communicated strategy for success.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pay for <italic>individual</italic> performance does not affect the commitment of any employee group, except for men younger than 30 years.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Pay for <italic>organizational</italic> performance has a positive effect on commitment for all groups, except Europeans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0886368712446061">24</xref></sup></p></list-item></list>
<p>In summary, consultant surveys have generally shown that pay is an important, but not the leading, driver of employee retention and a nondriver of employee engagement.</p>

<title>Importance of Pay to Managers</title>
<p>In the 1970s, labor experts believed that U.S. workers were dissatisfied with their jobs, as many were said to have boring, repetitive and meaningless jobs that offered little challenge. Federal governmental agencies investigated the matter and a book was written on the subject.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0886368712446061">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lending support for this view was a nationwide survey of workers by the Survey Research Center of The University of Michigan. When workers were asked how important they regarded 25 aspects of work, they ranked interesting work first and good pay fourth. This result agreed with the thinking at the time that workers would be more satisfied with their jobs if their duties were enriched or expanded, and supervision was reduced.</p>
<p>Others looked at the survey results more closely and found that having interesting work was not nearly as important to blue-collar workers as it was to white-collar workers. Blue-collar workers ranked good pay as the most important factor and interesting work as fifth in importance. White-collar workers ranked interesting work as first in importance—having good pay did not make the list of the top five most desirable job attributes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0886368712446061">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0886368712446061">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Edward Lawler’s observations in 1971 seemed to agree with this finding, when he stated that as employees move up the organization, pay becomes less important. The results of the following survey by McKinsey &amp; Co. are also consistent with this theory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0886368712446061">
<title>McKinsey’s Research</title>
<p>In 2000, McKinsey surveyed 6,900 corporate officers, senior and mid-level managers, working for 54 large and mid-sized U.S.-based companies. The goal was to determine what managers look for when deciding which company to join and stay with. Using the survey responses, McKinsey identified 16 elements that have a strong casual relationship with job satisfaction for managers. In addition to compensation and wealth elements (e.g., high annual cash compensation and substantial wealth creation opportunity), which accounted for 25% of the total, managers were also very interested in the intangible elements of work.</p>
<p>The following is a list of elements that managers felt were instrumental to their job satisfaction:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Well-managed company—91%</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Company committed to me—86%</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Growth and advancement opportunities—84%</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Culture and values of openness, trust and performance orientation—83%</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Great leadership—81%</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Rewards and wealth—79%</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Exciting, challenging work—78%</p></list-item></list>
<p>The results indicate that a multifaceted reward package is necessary to satisfy managers. Intangible elements, such as working for a well-managed company and organizational culture, were considered by many managers as important, or more important, than compensation. This finding challenged the stereotype of managers as being driven primarily by pay and wealth accumulation and provided a rationale for using a total rewards approach to develop their reward package.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0886368712446061">28</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section12-0886368712446061">
<title>Contributions of Scholars</title>
<p>To support their assertions about employee compensation, HR scholars tend to rely on ambiguous, dated and limited research studies that are often of questionable relevance to technical, professional and managerial employees in the present workforce. The result is that their contributions can lack force with practitioners.</p>
<p>There is a good reason for this shortcoming. In the 1990s, compensation scholars observed that many organizational psychologists apparently had lost interest in the topic of employee compensation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0886368712446061">18</xref></sup> The lack of interest exists today. Only 24 of the more than 8,000 members in the Society for Industrial &amp; Organizational Psychology in 2011 have a primary interest in the field of pay and compensation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0886368712446061">29</xref></sup> A review of the association’s 2011 annual conference program found that only a handful of the more than 300 sessions dealt with pay or compensation. One compensation scholar ran a posting at the conference to form a community of interest on compensation.</p>
<p>Based on this lack of recent interest and scholars reliance on studies dated in the 1970s and before, it is safe to say that compensation practitioners have not missed much by not reading HR-related academic journals in the past 20 years.</p>
<p>A recent sign of interest in academia may bear fruit in the future. In 2010, Cornell University established the Institute for Compensation Studies, which is an interdisciplinary incubator and clearinghouse for new insights, research data and knowledge on compensation. It serves students, academics, business leaders, compensation practitioners and others. It takes advantage of the research and thinking of scholars from six disciplines, including HR, labor economics, labor relations and organizational behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0886368712446061">30</xref></sup> Recently, its director expressed an interest in assisting organizations in testing the effectiveness of reward practices through field studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0886368712446061">31</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0886368712446061">
<title>Contributions of Consultants</title>
<p>In recent years, the absence of academic research has been filled by research studies of HR consultants,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0886368712446061">32</xref></sup> which are based primarily on surveys of employees, HR practitioners and company leaders. Many compensation practitioners have stayed abreast of developments in their field by subscribing to consultant periodicals, practitioner journals and the publications of their professional associations, which sponsor and conduct research.</p>
<p>With respect to the importance of pay to employees, Towers Watson has provided solid evidence that employees of medium to large companies consistently state that base pay is their most important criterion for choosing a job. This is one indication that today people might not feel that it is socially undesirable to say that they work for money. Consultants and academic researchers have not found a proven way of determining what is most important to employees, so we cannot say that this is an accurate indication of their true feelings.</p>
<p>Consultants have also offered evidence that individual pay is not a crucial driver of employee retention for many employees, at least during nonrecessionary times, and of employee engagement. There is some evidence from Korn/Ferry and the Center for Effective Organizations that organizationally based pay programs improve retention rates. McKinsey has provided substantial evidence that pay may not be the most important factor for managers and executives when they decide where to work and stay.</p>
<p>Consultants and academics have not provided solid evidence of how important pay is as a motivator of performance for all types of employees in the current workforce. Little evidence has been presented to settle the controversy over which rewards—intrinsic or extrinsic—are more effective at motivating employees. McKinsey has provided some evidence that people believe that others are motivated more by intrinsic rewards than by extrinsic rewards, contrary to a long-held belief that we have an extrinsic rewards bias toward others’ reasons for working.</p>
<p>In sum, consultants have contributed substantially to practitioners’ understanding of what drives the key employment processes of attraction, retention, engagement and motivation. They also have provided valuable information to show that people’s attitudes about pay may be changing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0886368712446061">
<title>End Points</title>
<p>Nationwide surveys of employees give HR practitioners a general idea of the drivers of the key behaviors for the attraction, retention and engagement of employees. In many cases, they do not provide enough information, by industry and workforce segment, to substantially influence HR strategy and policies of a given company.</p>
<p>To understand how these processes work in their organization, HR practitioners would, for example, need to monitor HR metrics on key processes such as attraction and retention and conduct regular employee surveys and focus groups, as well as studies that measure employee behavior before and after a major HR change has been introduced. Microsoft and Google have used a sophisticated decision-based survey tool, conjoint analysis, in addition to qualitative surveys, to get a better fix on employees’ reward preferences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0886368712446061">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0886368712446061">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0886368712446061">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>The challenge is to determine pay’s importance in attracting, retaining and motivating employees in each segment of a firm’s workforce, in good times and bad, and to design and administer responsive reward programs that benefit the company and employees. The challenge cannot effectively be met, however, without the benefit of solid evidence from researchers and empirical data generated by advanced survey tools.</p>
<p>That is one reason why compensation practitioners should support Cornell’s Institute for Compensation Studies and participate in research studies and surveys. These efforts will help ensure that the science we need to do our jobs with greater confidence is available and reflects our interests and perspectives. Although we are slowly closing the gap between what we know about pay’s importance to employees and what we need to know, much work remains to be done before we can close the book on this intriguing topic.</p>
