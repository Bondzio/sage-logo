<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783ad"><title>Lotte Jensen, Joep Leerssen and Marita Mathijsen, eds, <italic>Free Access to the Past: Romanticism, Cultural Heritage and the Nation</italic>, Brill: Leiden, 2010; xxii + 346 pp., 13 illus.; 9789004180291, 99.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>The collection <italic>Free Access to the Past: Romanticism, Cultural Heritage and the Nation</italic> – the second volume in the National Cultivation of Culture series – investigates the relationship between a developing bourgeois public sphere, the rise of romanticism and changing conceptions about the past, the popularization of history, the broadening of audiences and the nationalization of society.</p>
<p>Joep Leerssen’s introductory essay outlines the central theme, namely the crucial shift around 1800 from private to public history. At the turn of the nineteenth century, history went beyond the realm of private associations and collections and fully entered the sphere of public museums, libraries, archives and university institutes. The past was disseminated by way of text editions, philological studies, historical novels, plays, operas, paintings, monuments and restorations. This shift was part of the modernization process. The secularization of monastic libraries throughout Europe opened up long-forgotten documents to public scrutiny and access. This rediscovery of history resulted in the spread of a romantic national historicism. A new conception of the past emerged: the past as different and unfamiliar, rather than a mere continuation of traditions into the present. Due to the concomitant rise of romanticism, the past was no longer solely evoked in ‘universally Western’ scenes from biblical or Greco-Roman times, but increasingly constructed according to <italic>topoi</italic> celebrating the medieval and tribal roots of the nation.</p>
<p>It is Leerssen’s explicit aim (and a central concern of his prolific work) to complement materialist narratives of socio-economic modernization – in explaining the rise of nationalism – with a sensitivity for the autonomy of culture. Leerssen contends that cultural developments are no mere reflection of a socio-economic base, but have a logic of their own which sometimes contradicts purely material evolutions. Leerssen argues that already around 1800, national historicism pervaded European societies, at least coterminous with the modernizing processes that are central to several theories of nationalism.</p>
<p>The 14 chapters included in the volume mainly focus on Western Europe (the exceptions being three chapters respectively on Hungary, the US, and West-Africa and Indonesia), and are divided into four main parts. In the first part, ‘The Appropiation of the Past’, Leerssen offers a case study of the intellectual milieu of the Grimms. Peter Fritzsche and Marita Mathijsen both survey changing views of the past due to the French Revolution. Anne-Marie Thiesse analyses the Gauls as a <italic>lieu de mémoire</italic>.</p>
<p>The three remaining parts contain detailed case studies of diverse subjects. Part two, ‘Monuments for the Past’, includes chapters on state funerals in London and Paris (Eveline Bouwers), editorial scholarship in Sweden (Paula Henrikson) and the rise of historical literary genres in the Netherlands (Lotte Jensen). Part three, ‘A Public for the Past’, contains articles on art reproductions in Europe (Robert Verhoogt), the national museum in the Netherlands (Ellinoor Bergvelt), an analysis of three operas in terms of European imperialism (Peter Rietbergen), national opera in Hungary (Krisztina Lajosi), and history education in revolutionary France (Matthias Meirlaen). The final part, ‘Past and Present’, focuses on the question of whether issues about public history and romanticism can be applied to the US (Sharon Ann Holt) or to twentieth-century postcolonial states (Susanne Legêne).</p>
<p>This division into four main parts is fairly loose; it is unclear why certain contributions feature in one part rather than in another and there is no clue as to the general structure of the volume. For instance, we only learn in passing that these are the proceedings of a conference (an oblique mention on p. 291), and a general conclusion is also lacking. This is unfortunate because a comprehensive conclusion bringing together the common threads of the contributions, and reaching back to Leerssen’s introduction, could have provided unity to the volume. As they stand now, the case studies are interesting as examples of the past becoming public, but few address the complex nexus of issues raised by Leerssen. Most contributions remain silent about the autonomy of the cultural sphere or the conjunction between socio-economic modernization and the rise of national historicism. Bergvelt is the only one who directly tackles these questions in her chapter on the Dutch national museum. She argues that in the first half of the nineteenth century, the national art museum did not focus on the masters of the Dutch Golden Age, or on romantic depictions of the nation’s past, because art historians were still influenced by neo-classical standards rather than romantic ones. The cultural preferences of Dutch art historians proved more important. This is clearly a case of the cultural realm trumping political and socio-economic constraints, as Joep Leerssen’s central thesis claims.</p>
<p>All in all, this is a volume with interesting case studies, but it could have been more coherent.</p>
