<abstract>
<p>While there are no set rules about breastfeeding positions, Australian lactation practice has traditionally recommended some established ones. One position that can provide an alternative is the “Koala Hold.” This hold mimics that of the koala such that the baby is straddled on the mother’s knee, skin to skin, in the upright position. This article describes the techniques of the Koala Hold and identifies the advantages and considerations for the use of this position.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The Koala Hold has been taught to midwifery students in rural Australia for some time,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334413478690">1</xref></sup> and its application can be useful for health professionals supporting families, particularly in the early days after birth. This is a time when mother fatigue, painful breastfeeding, and an unsettled baby can lead to early and unnecessary weaning. In the Koala Hold, the baby’s head is in the neutral midline position, thus it can be effective for babies who have head or neck discomfort, are fussing at the breast, or have a breast preference. The breastfeeding position can be used in the short term, in the long term, or in conjunction with other preferred positions for the term baby. The Koala Hold technique is noninvasive, requires no specialized equipment, and is simple to demonstrate to the mother, without the need for the health professional to touch the mother or baby.</p>

<title>The Koala Hold Technique</title>
<p>Position the mother so that she is sitting in an upright position, with her back and feet supported at a right angle to her hip. Her feet may need to be elevated and adjusted. Then, straddle the baby skin to skin across the mother’s knee, close to her hip, as this prevents the baby from dragging on the mother’s nipple. Simply align the baby’s mouth with the angle of the mother’s nipple. The mother then places one hand across baby’s shoulders at base of the neck, with the other hand placed well back under her breast to stabilize the nipple in the baby’s mouth. The mother can then bring the baby to the breast in the upright position. Once the baby has latched, has commenced sucking, and is swallowing well, the mother may recline a little to support baby’s head more effectively.</p>

<title>Advantages of the Upright Position</title>
<p>Research on the upright position for the infant has shown some advantages that may explain the success of this breastfeeding position. For example, the upright position can improve gastric emptying,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334413478690">2</xref></sup> which may be beneficial for reflux; it can also reduce pain in the infant,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334413478690">3</xref></sup> which may be useful following an invasive procedure such as a heel prick. Furthermore, it can have a positive impact on ventilation, leading to an increase in average tidal volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334413478690">4</xref></sup> This position may also be an advantage for the infant with nasal congestion.</p>
<p>The upright position can be modified to a reclined position and so may prove useful for a baby with cleft lip to enable adequate lip seal for effective breastfeeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334413478690">5</xref></sup> For bilateral cleft lip, a “face on” straddle position may be more effective than other breastfeeding positions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334413478690">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other research shows that a good relationship between the baby’s head and mouth and the mother’s breast helps prevent or reduce damaged nipples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334413478690">7</xref></sup> The baby may have a head position of comfort and, as a result, prefer one breast and fuss at the other. The Koala Hold allows the baby to independently extend its head back, to latch and delatch effectively from the mother’s breast, particularly as the baby’s tone increases with age. At the same time, the baby is able to delatch easily to burp wind or simply obtain a better attachment to the breast. As a result, air swallowing from tongue snapback may also be reduced in this position.</p>
<p>The Koala Hold enables good contact between the mother and baby, so this can be particularly useful for mothers with large breasts who have difficulty aligning the nipple to the baby’s mouth. Some mothers may find increased comfort by positioning the baby away from the suture line following a cesarean section. Changing the point of contact by the baby to the breast for latching may provide more comfort for the mother experiencing nipple vasospasm in other positions.</p>
<p>In the past, the human baby was considered to be a dorsal feeder, with pressure needed on the baby’s back.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334413478690">8</xref></sup> However, the newborn can self-attach in the abdominal position at birth, indicating that breastfeeding initiation may be innate for mother and baby, not learned. However, opposing views suggest that lack of neck and torso control prevents nutritive sucking in the vertical posture, due to the infant having a 1:5 head body ratio, as well as neural immaturity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334413478690">9</xref></sup> This may be avoided by modifying the mother to a reclined position, referred to as the “biological nurturing position.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334413478690">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A major role for our lactation practice is to support mothers and babies through the challenges that can accompany the early days of a newborn’s life. The Koala Hold is a simple and effective breastfeeding position that can improve the breastfeeding experience, particularly if other breastfeeding positions are unsuccessful or problematic for the mother. More research is required to provide evidence to support the advantages of this upright position for breastfeeding. Consideration for using the Koala Hold breastfeeding position could be recommended, as it can provide one alternative for mothers experiencing difficulty with conventional breastfeeding positions.</p>
