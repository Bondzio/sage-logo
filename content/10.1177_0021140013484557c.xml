<p>Most teachers of New Testament Greek will want their students to familiarize themselves with the invaluable lexical resource that is BDAG (Bauer, Danker, Arndt, and Gingrich, <italic>Greek–English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature</italic>, 3rd ed., University of Chicago, 2000) as soon as they are able to use it profitably. However, given the limited time constraints under which New Testament Greek is often taught these days, it can be difficult to equip our students with a sufficient breadth of morphological competence to successfully navigate a work such as BDAG. What, then, are we to recommend that such students do? It is here that analytic lexicons are most useful.</p>
<p>While a lexicon such as BDAG requires that a student be able to identify the underlying citation form of any of the words they meet in a New Testament text (and it is usually verbs that are the most challenging in this regard), students may look up any word they encounter in an analytical lexicon—in whatever form it may be—and find that form parsed and glossed. The present work features two types of entry: dictionary (the citation or lexical form) and analytical (the actually occurring forms). The dictionary forms—which also provide short definitions of the lemmata—are given in bold, while the analytical forms are given in regular type. The analytical entries consist of parsing information, reference to the book’s own grammatical tables, and the citation form of the word. Strong’s numbering is also given. In addition to the 44 pages of grammatical tables, the appendices also contain a useful and detailed 19-page glossary of grammatical terms.</p>
<p>The present work is undoubtedly an extremely helpful reference tool and would be a welcome addition to the library of any student of the Greek New Testament. However, it should not be seen as a replacement for more substantial lexical works, but rather as a pointer towards such works.</p>
