<sec id="section1-0363546513486771">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Few studies report long-term subjective or objective results for acute, isolated posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries in patients followed prospectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513486771">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>Subjective or objective results will not differ based on PCL laxity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513486771">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513486771">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Sixty-eight patients with an acute, isolated PCL injury were treated nonoperatively and followed prospectively with yearly subjective surveys and periodic objective evaluations. Physical examination included evaluation of range of motion, effusion, and quadriceps strength; radiographic grading of osteoarthritis; and measurements of joint space width. Subjective follow-up included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and modified Cincinnati Knee Rating System (CKRS) surveys.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513486771">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>A total of 44 patients were available for both objective and subjective evaluations at a mean of 14.3 years (range, 10-21 years) after injury. All 68 patients underwent subjective follow-up at a mean of 17.6 years after injury. The mean quadriceps muscle strength was 97% of the noninvolved leg; all patients maintained normal knee range of motion. The overall grade of radiographs was rated as normal in 26 patients (59%), nearly normal in 13 patients (30%), abnormal in 4 patients (9%), and severely abnormal in 1 patient (2%). The grade of osteoarthritis on radiographs was not different in any knee compartment based on PCL laxity grade. Five patients (11%) had medial joint space narrowing greater than 2 mm. Mean IKDC and modified CKRS subjective scores at a mean of 17 years after injury were 73.4 ± 21.7 and 81.3 ± 17.4, respectively; there was no difference in subjective scores between PCL laxity grades. There was no difference in subjective scores between patients who completed a minimum 10-year objective follow-up and patients who completed surveys only.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513486771">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Long-term results after an isolated PCL injury show that patients remain active, have good strength and full knee range of motion, and report good subjective scores. The prevalence of moderate to severe osteoarthritis was 11%. Results were not different based on PCL laxity grade. This natural history study of nonoperatively treated PCL injuries can serve as a baseline for comparison with patients treated with PCL reconstruction.</p>

<p>The appropriate treatment plan for isolated posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries remains a topic of debate among orthopaedic surgeons. Some studies have found that patients with isolated PCL injuries have acceptable subjective and functional results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513486771">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513486771">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513486771">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513486771">37</xref></sup> The PCL also has a natural healing ability, which has been shown by studies with magnetic resonance imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513486771">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513486771">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546513486771">40</xref></sup> In a study by Jacobi et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513486771">16</xref></sup> continuity of the PCL was found in 20 of 21 patients at 6 months after injury with use of a dynamic anterior drawer brace for 4 months. At a mean of 3.2 years after injury, Shelbourne et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513486771">33</xref></sup> found that 37 of 40 patients had continuity of the PCL, even when the PCL was torn in conjunction with other ligament injuries or knee dislocations.</p>
<p>Despite these results, however, PCL reconstruction is becoming a more common choice for treatment. Many different surgical techniques exist for PCL reconstruction; however, an effective method has not yet been determined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513486771">14</xref></sup> Posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is usually performed to reduce posterior laxity with the assumption that this will improve results, but restoring normal PCL stability has not been achieved reliably.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363546513486771">‡</xref></sup> Furthermore, it is still unknown whether reducing PCL laxity with PCL reconstruction will improve the subjective results or prevent osteoarthritis (OA) compared with nonoperative treatment of isolated PCL injuries.</p>
<p>Most studies of nonoperative treatment for PCL injuries have been retrospective and were of patients who sought treatment because of chronic PCL laxity and painful symptoms or include patients with multiple knee ligament injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513486771">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513486771">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513486771">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546513486771">41</xref></sup> These studies do not give a true picture of the natural history of isolated PCL injuries and may represent a worse outcome than what would be found from evaluating a population of patients prospectively after an acute, isolated PCL injury.</p>
<p>Only a few PCL studies report long-term subjective or objective results for acute, isolated PCL injuries in patients followed prospectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513486771">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513486771">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513486771">37</xref></sup> Patel et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513486771">28</xref></sup> conducted a retrospective study of 57 patients with isolated PCL injuries treated nonoperatively. No correlation was found between subjective scores and length of follow-up (mean, 6.9 years) or between subjective scores and grade of PCL laxity. In another subjective study, Shelbourne and Muthukaruppan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513486771">37</xref></sup> evaluated 215 patients subjectively at a mean of 7.8 years after an acute, isolated PCL injury. All patients were treated nonoperatively with a home rehabilitation program. There was no correlation between subjective scores and grade of laxity. The subjective results were lower than scores of patients who had no history of injury to the knee, but the scores did not decrease significantly with time. Shelbourne et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513486771">33</xref></sup> also reported objective results of 68 patients at a mean of 5.4 years after injury. No change in laxity was found from initial examination to final follow-up, and patients with greater laxity did not have worse subjective or objective scores. No correlation was found between radiographic joint space narrowing and grade of laxity.</p>
<p>This study is a continuation of a previously reported natural history study of acute, isolated, nonoperatively treated PCL injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513486771">33</xref></sup> The purpose of this study was to determine the minimum 10-year objective results of the 68 patients who were evaluated as part of the previous report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513486771">33</xref></sup> We specifically evaluated for increased evidence of OA on radiographs, leg strength, and current function as assessed with subjective surveys based on the grade of PCL laxity.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Between 1983 and 1993, patients seen within 1 month of an acute, isolated PCL injury were treated nonoperatively for their injuries and were enrolled into a prospective study to determine the natural history of their injury. The study was approved by an institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. An initial short-term follow-up report was published in 1999.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513486771">33</xref></sup> The same 68 patients (13 female, 55 male), who underwent objective and subjective follow-ups in a previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513486771">33</xref></sup> were contacted to return for objective and subjective evaluations at a minimum of 10 years after injury. The mean age at the time of injury was 26.2 years (range, 9.6-60.0 years).</p>
<p>Upon initial physical examination, a thorough knee examination was performed to evaluate for effusion, range of motion, ligamentous laxity, and meniscal tears. The posterior drawer examination was performed with the knee in 90° of flexion. The examiner placed his leg over the patient’s toes so that the patient could relax the leg and the foot would be stabilized on the examination table. The examiner placed both hands on the front of the tibia with the thumbs over the medial femoral condyles. Pressure was applied and directed posteriorly to evaluate posterior excursion. Posterior laxity was graded as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546513486771">Table 1</xref>, with grade 2 laxity indicating that the tibia was flush with the femoral condyles. The posterior drawer examination has been found to be 96% accurate, 90% sensitive, and 99% specific.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513486771">31</xref></sup></p>

<p>Follow-up evaluation included physical examination for range of motion of both knees, presence or absence of joint effusion, associated laxity of other knee ligaments, and results of the posterior drawer test. Palpable osteophytes and patellofemoral crepitus were graded as absent, mild, moderate, or severe.</p>
<p>Measurements for knee range of motion of both knees were taken using a goniometer as described by Norkin and White.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513486771">26</xref></sup> To measure hyperextension, the patient’s heel was elevated on a bolster so that the knee could go into hyperextension if it was present. Knee flexion was measured by having patients bend the knee to slide the heel as far as possible toward the buttocks. Range of motion was recorded as “a,” “b,” or “c,” with “a” being the degree of hyperextension, “b” being the degree short of 0° of extension, and “c” being the degree of flexion. Measurements were taken by the treating physical therapist.</p>
<p>The KT-1000 arthrometer (MEDmetric Inc, San Diego, California) examination was performed as described by Daniel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513486771">9</xref></sup> First, the quadriceps neutral angle was determined on the uninjured side. Then, using a posterior force of 89 N, we measured the posterior laxity from the resting position and the active anterior translation (with quadriceps muscle contraction) from the resting position. The results of both these measurements were added to obtain the instrumented posterior drawer laxity.</p>
<p>The functional evaluation included isokinetic strength testing with a Cybex II dynamometer (Lumex Inc, Ronkonkoma, New York) and a single-legged hop test. The raw torque and the torque measured as a percentage of that of the opposite, uninjured leg were recorded.</p>
<p>Digital radiographs were obtained by the same technician with the same radiographic equipment. Radiographic views obtained included 45° weightbearing posteroanterior,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513486771">30</xref></sup> lateral, and Merchant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513486771">25</xref></sup> views. The radiographs were graded for arthrosis in the medial, lateral, and patellofemoral compartments according to International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) criteria as follows: normal: no degenerative changes; nearly normal: minimal degenerative changes (small osteophytes, slight sclerosis, mild narrowing of the joint space that is just detectable); abnormal: moderate degenerative changes (joint space narrowing that is detectable up to 50% of the joint space, periarticular sclerosis); or severely abnormal: severe degenerative changes (severe narrowing &gt;50% of the joint space, extensive osteophytes). An overall radiographic grade was assigned to each patient as the worst grade in any of the 3 knee compartments.</p>
<p>Joint space width of the medial and lateral compartments was also measured to the nearest 0.1 mm in both knees in a blinded fashion. Measurements were taken from the midpoint of the femoral condyle to the center of the tibial plateau, as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513486771">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513486771">34</xref></sup> using software obtained with digital imaging equipment for both the medial and lateral compartments of both knees. A second measurement was taken at the perceived minimum joint space between the femoral condyle and tibial plateau of each compartment, as described by others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513486771">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513486771">5</xref></sup> Measurements were made twice at different settings on the same bilateral digital radiographs by 2 separate readers to test intraobserver and interobserver reliability. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability for measuring radiographs was at least <italic>r</italic> = 0.94 for all compartments. Using the guidelines of Rosenberg et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513486771">30</xref></sup> we defined major narrowing as ≥2 mm of joint space narrowing in the involved knee compared with the noninvolved knee.</p>
<p>The subjective assessment at long-term follow-up included 3 separate surveys. A modified Cincinnati Knee Rating System (CKRS) subjective questionnaire was mailed on a yearly basis beginning with the year of injury. Beginning in 2000, the IKDC knee survey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513486771">2</xref></sup> was also mailed on a yearly basis. An activity level survey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513486771">37</xref></sup> was mailed yearly beginning in 1998. Levels 8, 9, and 10 reflect participation in twisting, pivoting, and jumping sports at the recreational, school-age, and college/elite levels.</p>
<p>The CKRS and IKDC subjective total scores were analyzed by an initial grade of PCL laxity. Patients who returned ≥4 CKRS subjective surveys with at least 10 years’ follow-up were also rated on how their scores changed through time. The scores were evaluated based on guidelines in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513486771">Table 2</xref> to determine the trends in scores with time from injury. Analysis of activity level was based on the highest level achieved after injury and the most recent activity level.</p>

<p>A χ<sup>2</sup> test was conducted to determine whether there were statistically significant differences in CKRS subjective total scores, IKDC subjective total scores, joint space width, and quadriceps muscle strength based on the initial PCL laxity grade. Spearman rank correlation coefficient with an asymptotic standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis was used to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference in the distribution of radiographic grades based on PCL laxity. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine if a statistically significant correlation existed between the time of injury and the perceived minimum width or midpoint of the medial compartment of the involved knee and between the involved posterior excursion measured with a KT-1000 arthrometer and the CKRS stability score. A 2-tailed Student <italic>t</italic> test was used to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between the joint space width measurements for the involved and noninvolved legs and between subjective scores of the 44 patients with objective and subjective results and the 24 patients with only subjective results. Statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Forty-four patients (8 female, 36 male; 62%) were available for detailed subjective, objective, functional, and radiographic evaluations at a mean follow-up of 14.3 ± 4.6 years (range, 10.0-21.0 years) after injury and initial evaluation. The remaining 24 patients (38%) who participated in the 5-year objective follow-up were not available for physical examination but completed subjective surveys at a mean of 13.3 ± 4.1 years (range, 9.8-20.6 years) after injury.</p>
<sec id="section9-0363546513486771">
<title>Physical Examination Findings</title>
<p>Initial PCL laxity was grade 1 in 18 patients (41%), grade 1.5 in 6 patients (14%), and grade 2 in 20 patients (45%). Follow-up PCL laxity was grade 1 in 17 patients (39%), grade 1.5 in 12 patients (27%), and grade 2 in 15 patients (34%). Increased laxity from the initial examination to follow-up was found in 4 patients (9%), and decreased laxity was found in 7 patients (16%).</p>
<p>Eight patients (18%) had trace effusion in 1 or both knees, and 1 patient (2%) had mild effusion in both knees. The mean range of motion for the PCL-injured knee was from 4° of hyperextension to 138° of flexion. The mean range of motion for the noninvolved knee was from 4° of hyperextension to 137° of flexion.</p>
<p>One patient (2%) had palpable osteophytes on the medial side of the involved knee, 1 patient (2%) had osteophytes on the medial side of the noninvolved knee, and 1 patient (2%) had osteophytes present on the lateral and medial sides of the involved knee. Crepitus grade in the patellofemoral compartment was mild in 3 patients (7%) and moderate in 3 patients (7%) but otherwise normal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546513486771">
<title>KT-1000 Arthrometer Evaluation</title>
<p>The mean KT-1000 arthrometer difference between the involved knee and noninvolved knee was 3.1 mm ± 1.2 mm for patients with grade 1 laxity, 4.4 mm ± 0.90 mm for patients with grade 1.5 laxity, and 7.2 mm ± 2.3 mm for patients with grade 2 laxity. There was no correlation between the KT-1000 arthrometer value and the CKRS stability score (<italic>r</italic> = −0.04).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0363546513486771">
<title>Strength Testing</title>
<p>There was no significant difference between the different grades of PCL laxity for the percentage of strength compared with the opposite leg for quadriceps muscle strength testing with the Cybex dynamometer (<italic>P</italic> = .30), hamstring muscle strength testing (<italic>P</italic> = .12), or the single-legged hop test (<italic>P</italic> = .63). The mean quadriceps muscle strength for all PCL grades was 97.2% ± 11.0% of the opposite, noninvolved leg. The mean hamstring muscle strength was 93.2% ± 17.9% of the opposite leg. The single-legged hop test showed that the involved leg had a mean strength of 98.5% ± 9.5% of the opposite leg.</p>

<sec id="section12-0363546513486771">
<title>Radiographic Findings</title>
<p>Forty-four patients underwent radiographic evaluation. The overall IKDC grade of radiographs was rated as normal in 26 patients (59%), nearly normal in 13 patients (30%), abnormal in 4 patients (9%), and severely abnormal in 1 patient (2%). A comparison of radiographic ratings with the same patients from the earlier follow-up study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513486771">33</xref></sup> showed that 7 patients (16%) had increased wear in at least 1 compartment of the knee and that 5 of the 7 patients had grade 2 laxity. However, these same 5 patients also had increased wear in the noninvolved knee as well since the last follow-up examination. There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of radiograph grades between grades of PCL laxity in any knee compartment or for overall radiographic grade (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546513486771">Table 3</xref>). There was no difference between the involved and noninvolved knees for mean radiographic measurements of joint space width for any of the 4 compartments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546513486771">Table 4</xref>). Five patients (11.4%) had joint space narrowing greater than 2.0 mm in the medial compartment. No correlation was found between the time from injury and the perceived minimum joint space or the midpoint of the medial compartment of the involved knee (<italic>r</italic> = −0.02 and <italic>r</italic> = 0.12, respectively). No statistical difference was present between laxity grades for the difference in perceived minimum joint space between the involved and noninvolved medial compartments (<italic>P</italic> = .82).</p>

<p>Activity level was analyzed at the most recent survey using the activity level rating scale. The mean activity level for all patients was 6.9 ± 1.5 at a mean of 17.6 ± 4.0 years after injury. Twenty patients (45%) were still participating in jumping/pivoting sports (levels 8 and 9) at least at the recreational level at the time of follow-up. Seventeen patients had an activity level of 6 or 7, reporting involvement in recreational sports such as tennis and golf. Seven patients (16%) were at level ≤5, indicating that patients were limited to activities of daily living. The mean activity rating was 7.0 ± 1.1 for patients with grade 1 laxity, 6.6 ± 1.5 for patients with grade 1.5 laxity, and 6.9 ± 1.6 for patients with grade 2 laxity (<italic>P</italic> = .689).</p>
<p>The CKRS subjective total score and stability score were also evaluated at a mean of 13.3 ± 4.1 years (range, 9.8-20.6 years) after injury for the 24 patients from the original patient population who were unable to return for objective follow-up evaluation. The mean CKRS subjective total score was 86.6 ± 16.5. The mean stability score was 17.8 ± 2.0. There was no statistically significant difference between the CKRS subjective total score or stability score for the 44 patients who returned for objective follow-up and the 24 patients who only completed subjective questionnaires (<italic>P</italic> = .20 and <italic>P</italic> = .15, respectively).</p>
<p>The annual subjective survey contained a question that asked patients if they had undergone any further surgery to their PCL-injured knee. Since the previously published report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513486771">33</xref></sup> 1 patient who did not return for the 10-year follow-up evaluation had undergone a medial meniscal allograft surgery; his CKRS score was 71 points, and his IKDC survey score was 63 points at 13 years after the injury and before he underwent meniscal allograft surgery.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This rare natural history study evaluated the objective and subjective results of patients studied prospectively after acute, isolated PCL injuries treated nonoperatively. The results showed that, at a mean of 14 years after injury, patients had good subjective and objective outcomes that were not statistically significantly different between grades of PCL laxity. A high incidence of OA was not found in this study. Only 5 patients (11.4%) showed narrowing greater than 2.0 mm of the involved medial compartment compared with the opposite noninjured knee. Seven patients did have an increase in degenerative changes in their knees between the short-term and long-term follow-up evaluations, and 5 of them had grade 2 laxity. However, the pattern of increased joint wear was also present in the noninvolved knee of 5 of the 7 patients, which may indicate a natural propensity for degenerative joint wear in some patients. Overall, the prevalence of moderate OA was still very low at 11%.</p>
<p>Before considering whether PCL reconstruction can prevent joint degeneration in the long term, one must first consider whether PCL reconstruction for isolated PCL injuries is able to reliably restore normal PCL stability. In studies that reported both initial laxity and laxity after PCL reconstruction, the rate of achieving grade 0 or normal PCL stability ranged from 0% to 90%, with most reporting less than 50% success.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363546513486771">§</xref></sup> Several investigators concluded that PCL reconstruction can improve PCL stability but may not be able to normalize it.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513486771">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513486771">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513486771">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513486771">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546513486771">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most reports of PCL reconstruction for isolated injuries have short follow-up times of 2 to 7 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513486771">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513486771">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513486771">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546513486771">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546513486771">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0363546513486771">46</xref></sup> or do not report radiographic outcomes for OA.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0363546513486771">‖</xref></sup> There are few studies with a follow-up of ≥10 years after PCL reconstruction that include radiographic evaluation for OA. Hermans et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513486771">15</xref></sup> found medial joint line narrowing in 59% of their patients at a mean of 9.1 years after reconstructive surgery for an isolated PCL injury, and the IKDC ratings of radiographs showed that 9 of 22 patients (41%) were rated as normal, 10 were nearly normal (45%), and 3 (9%) were abnormal. Jackson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513486771">17</xref></sup> obtained radiographs for 22 of 26 patients at 10 years after PCL reconstruction and found evidence of OA in 8 patients (36%); 4 patients had osteophytes but normal joint space width, and 4 (18%) had moderate degenerative changes. Although PCL stability improved with surgery in these 2 long-term follow-up studies, normal PCL stability was seen in only 2 of 22 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513486771">15</xref></sup> (9%) and 8 of 22 patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513486771">17</xref></sup> (36%). Neither study reported whether OA on radiographs was related to PCL laxity.</p>
<p>The prevalence of tibiofemoral OA after PCL reconstruction appears to be similar or worse than reports of nonoperative treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513486771">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513486771">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513486771">28</xref></sup> Parolie and Bergfeld<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513486771">27</xref></sup> found arthritis in 36% of their patients at a mean of 8.4 years after PCL injury. Boynton and Tietjens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513486771">4</xref></sup> reported articular degeneration in the medial tibiofemoral compartment in 53% of their patients at a mean of 13.2 years after PCL injury. Patel et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513486771">28</xref></sup> found that 10 of 58 knees (17%) had evidence of OA at a mean of 6.9 years after injury. The radiographic results of this current study mimic those found in other studies of nonoperative treatment, with evidence of some OA in 41% of patients overall, but moderate to severe OA was found in only 11% of patients. If PCL reconstruction is being performed to prevent OA in the future, it appears that, thus far, this goal has not been met.</p>
<p>It is believed that patients with PCL laxity will suffer increased patellofemoral arthrosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513486771">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513486771">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546513486771">41</xref></sup> but it appears that this perception may be unsubstantiated by true natural history studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513486771">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513486771">33</xref></sup> Only 3 patients (7%) in this current study had an abnormal grade of patellofemoral arthrosis, which compares with findings in the study by Patel et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513486771">28</xref></sup> who also found a 7% incidence of mild patellofemoral OA. Parolie and Bergfeld,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513486771">27</xref></sup> who evaluated a mixed population of patients with acute and chronic PCL injuries, found mild patellofemoral OA in only 4 patients (16%) and no patients with moderate or severe OA at a mean of 6 years after injury. Boynton and Tietjens,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513486771">4</xref></sup> who retrospectively evaluated 38 patients at a mean of 13 years after injury, found that only 4 patients (11%) had increased patellofemoral OA compared with the normal knee. These studies show that the prevalence of patellofemoral OA with an isolated PCL injury is low.</p>
<p>It is probable that surgical intervention is being offered to patients when they continue to experience undesirable symptoms after a PCL injury. However, the results of the subjective scores that were obtained consistently through time after the injury reflect that about 23% of patients continue to improve subjectively and 30% have inconsistent scores, and there was no difference in this pattern based on PCL laxity. Shelbourne and Muthukaruppan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513486771">37</xref></sup> found a similar pattern for 146 patients followed prospectively, with at least 4 subjective surveys completed at least 1 year apart after an acute PCL injury. Therefore, we encourage surgeons to be cautious in immediately offering PCL reconstruction as a treatment option based on an acute flare-up of symptoms.</p>
<p>Patients in this current study had a mean CKRS total score of 81 points and a mean IKDC total score of 73 points at a mean of 17 years after injury. This IKDC score of 73 points compares with the means of 75 points<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513486771">15</xref></sup> and 87 points<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513486771">17</xref></sup> found by studies of operative treatment that had much less follow-up times of 9 to 10 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513486771">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513486771">17</xref></sup> Other studies with shorter follow-up times used the Lysholm knee survey, and it is difficult to make comparisons. Overall, these scores represent good function but also indicate that patients do experience some limitations in the long term.</p>
<p>As with any surgery, there is a possibility of complications with PCL reconstruction. In particular, knee stiffness, range of motion deficits, painful hardware, and infection are reported complications in some studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513486771">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513486771">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513486771">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513486771">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546513486771">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546513486771"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0363546513486771">46</xref></sup> Only a few studies have evaluated knee range of motion, and the rate for range of motion deficits after surgery was reported to be from 7% to 30%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513486771">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513486771">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513486771">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513486771">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546513486771">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546513486771"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0363546513486771">46</xref></sup> Loss of knee range of motion has been found to be related to the presence of OA after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513486771">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546513486771">38</xref></sup> and we would expect that range of motion deficits after PCL reconstruction would also be related to the development of OA after surgery.</p>
<p>Patients in this study achieved overall good results in that they maintained full knee range of motion and good quadriceps muscle strength, had a low prevalence of moderate OA, and were able to maintain an active lifestyle, even with some residual PCL laxity. Given these good results found in the long term after nonoperative treatment of isolated PCL injuries, any surgical treatment performed for isolated PCL laxity should be significantly better than the results found in this current study to justify the expense and potential morbidity that PCL reconstruction can cause.</p>
<p>A weakness of this study is that we had only 44 (63%) of the original population of 68 patients available for long-term examination. However, the mean CKRS subjective total score was 86 points for the 24 patients who did not return for evaluation at ≥10 years after injury; this score was 5 points higher than in the patients who were examined, and the difference was not statistically significantly different between groups. Therefore, this patient population of 44 can be seen as representative of the original population.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>At a mean of 14 years after isolated PCL injuries, patients remained active and report good subjective scores, and the prevalence of moderate to severe OA was 11%, which is comparable with what has been reported after PCL reconstruction. There were no statistically significant differences for any subjective or objective results between patients with different grades of PCL laxity. This natural history study of nonoperatively treated PCL injuries can serve as a baseline for comparison with patients treated with PCL reconstruction.</p>
