<title>Background:</title>
<p>In lateral meniscus allograft transplantation (MAT) using the keyhole method, precise trough drilling is critical for ensuring the graft is placed at the correct anatomic position to minimize the risk of extrusion. However, no study has focused on the effect of bony trough axial obliquity on graft extrusion. Our purpose was to investigate whether bony trough axial obliquity and bony trough position correlate with graft extrusion in lateral MAT using the keyhole method.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512447932">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>We hypothesized that drilling the tibial bony trough at a greater axial angle would increase the risk of graft extrusion.</p>

<sec id="section4-0363546512447932">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The study involved 49 patients who underwent lateral MAT between 2009 and 2010 following total or subtotal meniscectomy. The mean patient age at the time of surgery was 34 years (range, 19-52 years). Graft extrusion and bony trough parameters (absolute and relative distance at the anterior, center, and posterior cuttings of the bony trough, and axial trough angle [ATA]) were assessed using conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed on postoperative day 2. The correlation between graft extrusion and MRI trough parameters was analyzed, and multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of graft extrusion.</p>

<sec id="section5-0363546512447932">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Of the 7 MRI measurement parameters, the ATA (<italic>r</italic> = .355, <italic>P</italic> = .012), absolute anterior distance (<italic>r</italic> = .301, <italic>P</italic> = .031), and relative anterior distance (<italic>r</italic> = .307, <italic>P</italic> = .032) were found to positively correlate with absolute extrusion. The ATA (<italic>r</italic> = .296, <italic>P</italic> = .037) and relative anterior distance (<italic>r</italic> = .296, <italic>P</italic> = .039) were also found to correlate with relative extrusion. The ATA was found to be a predictor of absolute extrusion (β = .36, <italic>P</italic> = .012) and relative extrusion (β = .33, <italic>P</italic> = .019).</p>

<body>
<p>Total meniscectomy leads to unavoidable early osteoarthritis. Meniscus-preserving techniques such as repair or partial resection have become mainstream treatments for meniscus injury. However, some menisci still require total resection owing to extensive tear patterns or degenerative change in the meniscus resulting from delayed or neglected diagnosis.</p>
<p>Treatment of a symptomatic meniscectomized knee, especially in young and active patients, is a challenging problem for clinicians. Meniscus allograft transplantation (MAT) is often used in such cases as it has been shown to provide pain relief and functional improvement in short-,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512447932">17</xref></sup> medium-,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512447932">2</xref></sup> and long-term<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512447932">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512447932">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512447932">22</xref></sup> studies. However, postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown that graft extrusion can occur after MAT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512447932">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512447932">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512447932">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although meniscal extrusion is known to occur during arthritic knee degeneration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512447932">4</xref></sup> the nature of its occurrence after transplanted meniscus procedures remains to be established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512447932">11</xref></sup> Issues surround meniscal extrusion in terms of definitions of the amount of extrusion, the clinical meaning, and the cause. A recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512447932">12</xref></sup> using serial MRI found that the amount of graft extrusion appeared to remain constant after MAT, suggesting that the risk of extrusion can be mitigated intraoperatively if correct preoperative allograft sizing is undertaken. However, the precise reasons for extrusion after MAT remain unclear. An anatomically correct graft, especially in both horn areas, is crucial for restoring normal knee biomechanics and may be essential for long-term survival of a transplanted graft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512447932">21</xref></sup> However, it is not always possible to achieve correct graft positioning using current open or arthroscopic procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512447932">9</xref></sup> Bony trough or keyhole techniques are used in almost all lateral meniscus transplantations. When using those approaches, precise and reproducible tunnel drilling is critical for ensuring accurate placement of the graft.</p>
<p>It appears that only 2 studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512447932">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512447932">23</xref></sup> have sought to identify the causes of graft extrusion in lateral MAT. Those studies found that bony trough position affected the risk of extrusion. However, no study has examined whether bony trough axial obliquity affects the risk of graft extrusion in lateral MAT.</p>
<p>The present study examined graft extrusion in patients who underwent lateral MAT using the keyhole method. The study investigated correlations between extrusion and bony trough axial obliquity and bony trough position. It was hypothesized that drilling the tibial bony trough at a greater axial angle would result in an increased incidence of graft extrusion.</p>

<title>Study Design and Sample Size</title>
<p>The study was a prospective longitudinal trial designed to evaluate the correlation between bony trough obliquity or position and graft extrusion after lateral MAT. All patients who were candidates for lateral MAT at our institution between 2009 and 2010 were considered for study inclusion. All surgery was performed by a single senior arthroscopic surgeon (S.I.B.), who had more than 10 years of experience and had performed more than 100 MATs. The indication for meniscus transplantation included 1-compartment pain attributed to lack of a meniscus, articular chondral wear of Outerbridge grade III (focalized IV) or less confirmed by previous arthroscopic surgery, and normal mechanical alignment, which was assessed both clinically and using long-leg standing films. Contraindications were uncorrected axis deformity involving greater than 3° of deviation toward the involved compartment, generalized tricompartmental arthritis, or uncorrected joint instability caused by ligament structure deficiency. Of the 56 patients (56 knees) initially approached for the study, 53 patients agreed to take part. After eligibility assessments, 51 patients were enrolled. The final analysis involved data from 49 patients (2 patients were excluded because immediate postoperative MRI was not performed). The study was explained to each patient, and each patient provided written informed consent. The study protocol was approved by our Institutional Review Board.</p>

<title>Preoperative Sizing, Surgical Technique, Rehabilitation, and Clinical Assessment</title>
<p>Sizing radiographs were obtained and measured according to the method described by Pollard et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512447932">15</xref></sup> We made every effort to obtain true anteroposterior and lateral radiographs through use of a 100-mm radio-opaque rod placed under fluoroscopy to minimize magnification and the risk of inaccurate bony landmark measurements. The desired meniscus size was communicated to the tissue bank (Korea Bone Bank, Seoul, Korea), which then provided a fresh-frozen meniscus allograft that never exceeded a 10% mismatch in terms of width or length. Graft safety was confirmed via mandatory serological screening at the tissue bank.</p>
<p>All menisci were transplanted by a single senior surgeon using the modified keyhole technique described by Wilcox and Goble.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512447932">20</xref></sup> Attention must be paid to re-creation of the native meniscal anterior and posterior horn attachments using bone-to-bone healing. All knees were arthroscopically examined to determine the status of the meniscus, ligaments, and cartilage. The host menisci were resected arthroscopically, leaving a 1- to 2-mm peripheral rim to achieve punctate bleeding. A lateral parapatellar mini-arthrotomy was performed to trim the anterior meniscal rim and create a bone tunnel as well as for later allograft passage. Under C-arm fluoroscopy intensification, a guide wire was inserted in the anteroposterior direction just under the lateral tibial eminence. The inserted guide wire was positioned approximately 8 mm under the highest portion of the articular surface of the lateral tibial plateau. Extreme care was taken to retract the medial flap, and because the ideal entry point was partially covered by the patellar tendon, this tendon was retracted medially so as not to inadvertently choose too lateral an entry point. In addition, maintaining the knee in extension made it easier to retract the patellar tendon medially by loosening it, allowing a relatively central entry point for the guide wire. After the correct guide wire position was confirmed, a 10-mm-diameter core reamer was used to create a tibial slot without breaching the posterior cortex. The roof of the tibial slot was removed with a narrow rongeur, and a keyhole-shaped tunnel was created with a pituitary rongeur. After the tibial slot was prepared, a posterolateral incision was made, and the posterolateral joint capsule was exposed. A lateral meniscus allograft was introduced through an anterior mini-arthrotomy. Two 2-0 nonabsorbable leading sutures, which had been anchored at the most posterior portion of the allograft, were passed through the posterolateral incision by pulling the previously inserted passing wires. After optimal allograft positioning and seating in the joint were obtained, the 2 leading sutures were tied to each other just beneath the capsule. With use of traditional inside-out meniscal repair techniques, 10 to 12 vertical 2-0 nonabsorbable sutures were placed at the midportion and the posteromedial or posterolateral part of the meniscus allograft. The anterior part of the meniscus allograft was sutured to the anterior capsule under direct visualization.</p>
<p>To ensure that the allograft had been placed in the most stable position and to prevent its extrusion, bone block fixation was always used, and more than 3 inside-out sutures were placed in the inferior part of the meniscus. At 1 to 2 days after surgery, the Hemovac drain (Zimmer, Warsaw, Indiana) was removed, and continuous passive motion exercises were commenced during the first postoperative week. The goal for range of motion exercises was to achieve full extension equal to the contralateral side within a week, 90° of flexion within 4 weeks, and 120° of flexion at 6 to 8 weeks. Patients were allowed only toe-touch weightbearing during the first 2 weeks postoperatively, which was slowly increased to 50% of body weight at the fourth week and to full weightbearing at the sixth week. Rehabilitation continued for 3 months and focused on restoring full range of motion and quadriceps strength. At the last follow-up, 1 year after surgery, patients evaluated their knee function using the Lysholm knee score, where 95-100 points = excellent outcome, 84-94 points = good outcome, 65-83 points = fair outcome, and &lt;65 points = poor outcome (maximum score, 100 points).</p>

<title>MRI Evaluation for Extrusion and Trough Position</title>
<p>All patients underwent an MRI examination (Achieva 3 T, Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands) on the operated knee joint on postoperative day 2. This early time point was chosen to exclude the effects of any secondary changes in transplants caused by remodeling. For MRI, patients were placed in a supine position with a fully extended knee. Graft position was evaluated using sagittal and coronal proton density–weighted fast spin echo images. Sagittal images were acquired with a 1.5-mm slice thickness, and coronal images were acquired in 2.5-mm slice thicknesses. Maximum graft subluxation usually occurs at the midbody portion, and therefore, the position of the midbody was assessed in terms of lateral subluxation on 7 consecutive coronal images that covered the entire midbody region. The subluxation distance was defined as the distance between the outer edge of the articular cartilage of the tibial plateau and the meniscal outer edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512447932">Figure 1</xref>). Extrusion was defined as subluxation of greater than 3 mm. Meniscal extrusion data are presented both as absolute values and as a relative percentage of extrusion (RPE), which was defined as the percentage of the width of extruded menisci compared to the entire meniscal width. The RPE provided a standardized measure for knees of different sizes. After all axial view images that included the bony trough were reviewed, the axial cutting that best demarcated the rectangular shape of the bony trough was selected.</p>

<p>To measure the distance from the trough to the center of the tibial articular surface, we fixed on the interspinal groove between the medial and lateral tibial spines as the center of the tibial articular surface on the coronal plane, which corresponded to the trough center on the axial plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512447932">Figure 2</xref>, left panel). The anterior border, center, and posterior border of the bony trough on the axial plane were matched respectively to the coronal image to measure the distance from the center of the tibial articular surface (interspinal groove) to the center of the trough at each of 3 coronal cuttings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512447932">Figure 2</xref>, right panels). The 3 absolute distances (anterior, middle, and posterior distances) were divided by the entire tibial width on the coronal plane to standardize the measure for knees of different sizes, and those ratios are referred to as the relative anterior, middle, and posterior distances, respectively.</p>

</fig>
<p>The obliquity of the bony trough on the axial plane was measured by drawing a line along the center between the medial and lateral edges of the bony trough on the previously mentioned axial cutting. The posterior tibial condylar tangential line connects the medial and lateral posterior tibial condylar cortexes. The angle subtended by those 2 lines was termed the axial trough angle (ATA) and was measured using an angle measurement tool contained in the PACS software (PI View STAR, version 5025, Infinitt, Seoul, Korea).</p>
<p>Images were independently evaluated by 2 orthopaedic surgeons with significant knee MRI experience (D.H.L. and B.S.L.). For each patient, measurements were made using MRI taken at 2 days postoperatively and on images taken 2 weeks later. The measurement used for analysis was the average of the 2 measurements taken by the surgeons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0363546512447932">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The study primary end point was to show whether relative graft extrusion was associated with the ATA. In a pilot study of 15 lateral MATs involving the keyhole technique, the correlation coefficient between ATA and relative extrusion was found to be .393 on immediate postoperative MRI. A priori power analysis was then performed to show the statistical significance of this correlation coefficient (.393) between ATA and relative extrusion, with α being set at .05 and the power being set at .8. That analysis showed that 42 cases were required to show a statistically significant relationship between ATA and graft extrusion. The current study involved 49 patients, indicating adequate power (.831) for detecting a significant correlation between the 2 variables.</p>
<p>The reliability of measurements of extrusion and MRI measurements regarding trough position was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), which quantifies what proportion of the difference is caused by measurement variability. The ICC can assume any value from 0 to 1, where &gt;.75 represents good agreement and &lt;.40 represents poor agreement. In the present study, interobserver reliability ranged from .782 to .923, and intraobserver reliability ranged from .791 to .912, indicating good reliability for graft extrusion measurements and MRI trough parameter assessments. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 12.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) for Windows. Lysholm scores and MRI measurements in the 2 groups were compared using Student <italic>t</italic> tests. A <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered to indicate a significant difference. The correlations between the amount of extrusion and score and MRI trough measurements were assessed using Pearson correlation analysis. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify which of 7 MRI measurement parameters were predictive of absolute extrusion and RPE. The selection of candidate prediction variables for entry into the multiple linear regression model was made using a stepwise selection method, and the criterion for entering variables in the model was a significance level of <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine the ATA cutoff values in relation to absolute extrusion and RPE.</p>

<title>Clinical Outcomes and Measurement Parameters on MRI</title>
<p>The mean age of the 49 patients (34 male, 15 female) was 34 years (range, 19-52 years). The mean Lysholm score for all patients increased from 71.6 (range, 60-84) preoperatively to 90.4 (range, 78-100) 1 year after surgery (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). The final follow-up Lysholm knee scores indicated that 20 patients (41%) had excellent outcomes, 24 (49%) had good outcomes, and 5 (10%) had fair outcomes. The mean ATA was 7.76° ± 4.28°. The MRI performed 2 days after MAT showed that the mean graft absolute extrusion was 3.12 ± 1.17 mm and the mean RPE was 30.05% ± 11.87%. The distance between the interspinal groove and the trough was found to decrease from anterior to posterior in terms of absolute extrusion and relative extrusion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512447932">Table 1</xref>). A subluxation of &gt;3 mm was considered extrusion, and based on that criterion, we found that 26 knees (53%) had nonextruded grafts (mean extrusion, 2.17 ± 0.65 mm) and 23 (47%) knees had extruded grafts (mean extrusion, 4.11 ± 0.78 mm). The mean preoperative and postoperative Lysholm scores were 71.9 (range, 62-84) and 90.5 (range, 84-100), respectively, in the nonextruded group and 71.2 (range, 62-78) and 90.3 (range, 78-100), respectively, in the extruded group, indicating that both groups showed similar improvements in Lysholm scores (<italic>P</italic> = .812). Across all patients, there was no correlation between the amount of extrusion and Lysholm score at final follow-up (Pearson 2-sided test, <italic>r</italic> = –.135, <italic>P</italic> = .354). A similar lack of correlation was observed in the nonextruded (<italic>r</italic> = –.215, <italic>P</italic> = .292) and extruded (<italic>r</italic> = –.216, <italic>P</italic> = .323) groups. After 1 year, none of these patients had symptoms requiring a secondary operation. Of the 7 MRI measurement parameters, we found that the mean ATA and the absolute anterior distance were greater in the extruded compared with the nonextruded group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546512447932">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>ATA Cutoff Values for Extrusion</title>
<p>A ROC analysis was performed to determine threshold values for the ATA in terms of predicting absolute extrusion (&gt;3 mm) and RPE (&gt;30%).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study analyzed the effect of trough axial obliquity and trough location on graft extrusion after lateral meniscus transplantation using the keyhole method. The study found that ATA correlated with absolute extrusion and that ATA and the relative anterior distance both correlated with RPE.</p>
<p>In the current study, the mean absolute graft extrusion on immediate postoperative 3-T MRI was 3.12 ± 1.17 mm, and the mean RPE was 30.05% ± 11.87%. Other studies have also examined meniscal extrusion after MAT. Noyes et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512447932">14</xref></sup> analyzed 29 MATs using MRI with a 0.7-T magnet at a mean 35 months after implantation. They found that the mean meniscus allograft displacement was 2.2 ± 1.5 mm and that graft extrusion was relatively infrequent (17 [59%] cases had no displacement, 11 cases had only minor displacement, and 1 case could not be evaluated because of artifacts from other operative procedures). Gonzalez-Lucena et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512447932">6</xref></sup> also evaluated extrusion in a series of 33 MATs comprising 19 MATs for replacement of the lateral meniscus and 14 for replacement of the medial meniscus. That analysis involved a 1.9-T MRI at 5 years postoperatively. In contrast to the Noyes et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512447932">14</xref></sup> conclusion, they reported that meniscal extrusion was common, with some degree occurring in all grafts, and that the mean extrusion was 36.3% ± 13.7% of the total meniscal size. Therefore, it appears that different studies have drawn different conclusions. However, it is difficult to compare findings between studies because of differences regarding tissue allograft preservation methods (eg, cryopreserved, fresh-frozen, or viable), surgical techniques (with or without bone block), the time at which MRI was performed (ranging from immediate postoperatively to 10 years postoperatively), and the extrusion notational system (absolute or relative value).</p>
<p>There are a number of possible reasons for graft midbody extrusion after MAT. An oversized graft almost guarantees extrusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512447932">19</xref></sup> A recent meniscus-sizing study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512447932">24</xref></sup> investigated the sagittal length of 25 fresh lateral menisci with attached proximal tibia, which were obtained during total knee arthroplasty using a novel radiographic measurement method, and compared the accuracy of that method with the conventional radiographic measurement method of Pollard et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512447932">15</xref></sup> That study showed that using the Pollard et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512447932">15</xref></sup> method to measure lateral meniscus length resulted in only 40% accuracy, whereas a modified Pollard et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512447932">15</xref></sup> method introduced in that study was accurate in 98% of cases. These observations highlight that the current methods of radiographic meniscus allograft sizing are inaccurate because of radiographic errors in magnification, erroneous identification of bony landmarks, and difficulty in differentiating between the soft tissue–bone interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512447932">24</xref></sup> These inaccuracies have resulted in a tendency to use allografts that are too large, which has then resulted in graft extrusion.</p>
<p>Another cause of graft extrusion relates to the surgical technical problem of overtensioning the meniscal suture during surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512447932">12</xref></sup> However, of the surgical factors causing graft extrusion, restoration of the correct anatomic horn position after MAT is the most important to translate axial compression into circumferential pressure to prevent graft extrusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512447932">6</xref></sup> With regard to lateral MAT using the keyhole method, the horn position is determined by the trough position.</p>
<p>The current study found a correlation between absolute distance as well as relative anterior distance of the bony trough from the interspinal groove at the midcoronal level of the tibial articular surface in terms of absolute graft extrusion as well as relative graft extrusion. Additionally, we also found a correlation between ATA on the tibial plateau and both absolute and relative graft extrusion and also demonstrated that ATA was a predictor of absolute and relative extrusion.</p>
<p>To our best knowledge, only 2 other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512447932">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512447932">23</xref></sup> have focused on causes of lateral transplanted graft extrusion in terms of the trough position. Using MRI, Choi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512447932">1</xref></sup> postoperatively evaluated 33 consecutive keyhole lateral meniscal transplants at 6 months after surgery. They reported that the mean center of the bony trough of the meniscus allograft was positioned 42.3% from the outer edge of the lateral tibial plateau, the mean meniscus allograft extrusion was 3.2 ± 2.3 mm, and the extrusion amount correlated with the center and anterior portion of the bony trough of the graft. At first glance, the findings of Choi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512447932">1</xref></sup> appear to be consistent with the present findings in that bony trough position was found to affect the amount of graft extrusion (our study also found ATA influenced extrusion). However, the 2 studies differ greatly with regard to the direction or obliquity of the bony trough to the tibial posterior cortex. Choi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512447932">1</xref></sup> reported that the average anterior, center, and posterior portions of the bony trough of the meniscus allograft were positioned at 42.8% ± 4.9%, 42.3% ± 3.6%, and 41.8% ± 4.5%, respectively, from the outer edge of the lateral tibial plateau with respect to the entire plateau. It appears that the bony trough was directed more laterally from anterior to posterior on the axial plane of the proximal tibia. In contrast, the results of the present study showed that the relative anterior, middle, and posterior distances from the interspinal groove were 14.32% ± 4.37%, 10.77% ± 2.86%, and 9.32% ± 3.77%, respectively. That indicates the bony trough direction headed medially (centrally) with a more lateral starting point from anterior to posterior on the axial plane of the proximal tibia. We believe that the differences between our findings and those of Choi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512447932">1</xref></sup> are because of different measurement standards: the lateral tibial plateau margin method used by Choi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512447932">1</xref></sup> is less reliable than the interspinal groove method used in our study.</p>
<p>An investigation by Yoon et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512447932">23</xref></sup> suggested an opposite axial direction of the bony trough compared with the Choi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512447932">1</xref></sup> study. They evaluated meniscal extrusion in 11 consecutive lateral transplanted allograft operations that involved using a novel transpatellar guide pin insertion and the keyhole method. Using MRI, they reported a mean extrusion at 1 year postoperatively of only 1.6 mm. They opined that the greater extrusions reported by others were likely to be caused by a nonanatomic (too lateral) starting point for the guide pin. When preparing the tibial bony trough using a conventional parapatellar approach for guide pin insertion, there is a tendency to commence the tunnel at a more lateral position than the original bony insertion point of the lateral meniscus because of the tight patellar tendon. This trend toward a lateral starting point at the time of guide pin insertion is, to some extent, consistent with the findings of the present study of a more medial direction of the bony trough from the front to the rear on the axial plane of the proximal tibia.</p>
<p>Our results indicate several surgical steps that can be taken to avoid oblique ATAs that increase the rate of extrusion after lateral MAT. First, although arthroscopic techniques can be used to prepare the tibial bony trough, a mini-arthrotomy may allow better visualization, especially of the anterior horn area of the lateral meniscus, which is attached immediately posterior to the lateral border of the patellar tendon. A mini-arthrotomy allows the patellar tendon to be retracted medially enough to correctly site the guide pin at a more medial (central) location to accurately create a bony trough. Second, when inserting the guide pin, the knee joint should be fully extended to loosen the patellar tendon, allowing the latter to be retracted medially as much as possible. Third, templating may be useful for intraoperative transplant sizing, reducing graft extrusion. This method involves cutting an aluminum foil template matching the length and width of the allograft transplant and inserting this template into the lateral compartment to determine the proper placement of the tibial trough and anticipate the amount of extrusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512447932">13</xref></sup> If templating indicates too much graft extrusion, the tibial trough position can be moved medially as long as the tibial attachment site of the anterior cruciate ligament is not compromised. Actually, we did not use this templating step during surgery, which may explain our finding of a higher incidence of meniscal extrusion after lateral MAT than in a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512447932">14</xref></sup> Finally, computer-assisted navigation may become useful for determining the appropriate starting position of the guide wire through intraoperative templating of the tibial plateau while considering differences among individual patients, including differences in patellar tendon size and the morphology of the proximal tibia.</p>
<p>The present study also found that the extruded graft group had a greater ATA than the nonextruded group and that ATA was the only predictor for both absolute and relative extrusion. Those findings indicate surgeons should not place the guide pin start point at too lateral a position because a too lateral position would increase the risk of graft extrusion by increasing the axial obliquity of the trough to the posterior cortex of the proximal tibia. Furthermore, the study identified cutoff values for absolute extrusion (5.64°) and RPE (7.74°). These findings suggest the need for further studies to establish intraoperatively an accurate and reproducible position of the bony trough during lateral MAT, similar to the objective tunnel position used in the reconstruction of anterior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512447932">3</xref></sup> and posterior cruciate ligaments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512447932">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study had several limitations. One limitation was the relatively small number of patients. However, the sample size had acceptable statistical power for the end point (ie, detecting a significant correlation between ATA and relative graft extrusion). In addition, the study was strengthened by its prospective design and by the use of immediate postoperative 3-T MRI for measurement of graft extrusion and trough parameters. We believe that using immediate postoperative MRI findings may more accurately show graft extrusion and trough position as opposed to using MRI findings obtained at 6 months postoperatively as in previous studies. Another limitation was that extrusion in the sagittal plane was not considered in this study. However, previous studies have usually considered meniscal extrusion as displacement in the coronal plane, and the definition and measurement methods for sagittal plane meniscus extrusion are not reliable compared to coronal plane extrusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512447932">10</xref></sup> Finally, other factors such as an oversized meniscus allograft and overtensioning of the meniscal suture during surgery could not be completely excluded. However, our current policy is to obtain true anteroposterior and lateral radiographs using a 100-mm radio-opaque rod placed under fluoroscopy guidance when taking radiographs to size the graft. Additionally, we make it a rule to determine the appropriate thread tension by pulling the thread out under arthroscopic visualization, and each tie was created using appropriate tension under arthroscopic visualization. These efforts can decrease the bias caused by other factors.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The present study found that the risk of graft extrusion following lateral MAT using the keyhole method increased as bony trough obliquity on the axial plane increased. Our findings suggest that when drilling the tibial trough, an axial angle of more than 5.64° or 7.74° is likely to result in major absolute graft extrusion or RPE, respectively. Therefore, it is best that the bony trough starting point is not made too laterally; otherwise, the consequent increase in ATA and incorrect horn positioning can lead to graft extrusion. However, early clinical outcome did not correlate with the amount of extrusion.</p>
