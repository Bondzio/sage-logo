<p>With its title taken from King’s historic speech delivered during his initial visit to Memphis in support of striking sanitation workers, this volume presents a collection of fifteen of Martin Luther King’s speeches. Arranged chronologically, twelve of the fifteen selections are previously unpublished, and they span the public life of Dr. King from Highlander in 1957 up to the familiar “Mountaintop” speech delivered on the eve of his murder in 1968. The hardcover edition also includes a CD with recordings of select speeches.</p>
<p>Editor Michael K. Honey, a professor of labor, ethnic, and gender studies and American history at the University of Washington-Tacoma, is both a King scholar and civil rights and civil liberties organizer who has authored three books on labor and civil rights. Drawing on archival material from the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change and other sources, including various union newspapers and publications, Honey expands King’s image from being solely a civil rights activist and traces his development as an economic justice advocate. In the introduction to the book and in the preface provided before each of the speeches, the editor does an outstanding job of explaining context and connecting the text of the speech with the events of the time. In particular, he offers insights into the evolution of King’s relationships with organized labor and the inherent politics and contradictions of the labor movement and its uneven history regarding institutional racism.</p>
<p>What also makes this collection unique and of particular interest to labor educators is the choice of speeches Honey selects from the archives. Most of the speeches in this volume are delivered to a variety of union audiences, from the national AFL-CIO convention in 1961, to a State Federation convention, and local and regional meetings of various unions that supported his Southern Christian Leadership Conference—including United Packinghouse Workers; United Auto Workers; District 65 of the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union; Local 1199 of the Hospital and Health Care Employees; and Teamsters, among others.</p>
<p>Through this selection of speeches, the current “I Have a Dream” winter remembrances of Dr. King are thawed from that classic moment in 1963, and we are reminded that King worked tirelessly for five more years trying to achieve his lasting vision of “economic equality,” up to the moment of his death. His speeches are a powerful reminder that King’s dream called for nothing less than a radical restructuring of American economic life and end to foreign wars of intervention.</p>
<p>King, who from the very beginning of his public career insisted that the evil of economic injustice must be fought along with racial inequality, saw the effort to eliminate poverty as a natural outgrowth of the civil rights struggle. His speeches reinforce that he was constantly seeking to build alliances between the civil rights movement and labor unions. At the time of his assassination, planning was well underway for his march on Washington, D.C., coined the “Poor People’s Campaign.” In that event King was planning to bring together poor people across races to advocate for an economic bill of rights that asked for jobs, a national living minimum wage, and affordable housing for all. King anticipated this would be the biggest civil disobedience event ever undertaken by his coalition. Much like the Occupy movement of today, King planned to stay in the nation’s capital until their grievances were addressed.</p>
<p>The speech from which the book’s title is taken is poignant in that it remains completely relevant today. It clearly shows how much King’s thinking had expanded from racial justice to include economic justice and the need to recognize and acknowledge class in our society. Says King, “Now our struggle is for genuine equality, which means economic equality.” As the emotion of this speech builds, he spontaneously offers at the end “I tell you what you ought to do, and you are together enough here to do it: in a few days, you ought to get together and just have a <italic>general work stoppage</italic> [italics added] in the city of Memphis” (p. 178).</p>
<p>King’s words put into perspective both his enduring legacy and the events of today, highlighting the progress that remains to be accomplished. This important collection broadens our perspective of King’s vision of social justice and is a must-have for labor educators.</p>
