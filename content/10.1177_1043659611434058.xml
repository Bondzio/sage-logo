<abstract>
<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> To determine the relationship between acculturation and health status among Arab Americans in southern California. <bold>Design:</bold> A cross-sectional survey with 297 adult Arab Americans used (a) a demographic and health survey, SF-36 Version-1, to assess physical and mental health and (b) the Acculturation Rating Scale for Arab Americans-II to assess acculturation. <bold>Findings:</bold> Participants reported significantly better physical health and worse mental health compared to the published norm for the 1998 U.S. population. Better physical health was associated with demographic factors and bicultural identification; better mental health was associated with attraction to American culture. Attraction to American culture predicted alcohol use, whereas attraction to Arabic culture predicted cigarette smoking. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Different patterns of association existed between acculturation and physical and mental health among Arab Americans. <bold>Implications for Practice:</bold> Findings suggest that acculturation is an important factor to consider in the well-being of Arab Americans, especially in their mental health.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Immigrants undergo a process of transition that is characterized by challenge, change, and stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043659611434058">Berry, Poortinga, Segall, &amp; Dasen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043659611434058">Spector, 2008</xref>). Acculturation is a process of cultural transition that is unique for each immigrant group and is dependent on the cultural characteristics of immigrants as well as those of their host countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611434058">Berry, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Currently, an estimated 3.5 million Arab Americans live in the United States, with about one third living in California, New York, or Michigan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659611434058">Arab American Institute, n.d.</xref>). Arab Americans are a heterogeneous ethnic group, although they share a cultural and linguistic heritage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043659611434058">Suleiman, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Arab immigration to the United States started in the 1840s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043659611434058">Suleiman, 1999</xref>). The immigration experience of Arabs has generally been associated with negative stereotypes and discrimination, which increased after the events of September 11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611434058">Ibish, 2003</xref>). This reality, coupled with the fact that a considerable percentage of Arab immigrants come from countries where political unrest prevails, predisposes them to poor mental health and social adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043659611434058">Reinmann, Rodriguez-Reinmann, Ghulam, &amp; Beylouni, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Arab immigrants’ health remains relatively unstudied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611434058">Meleis &amp; Hattar-Pollara, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611434058">Nassar-McMillan &amp; Hakim-Larson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659611434058">Salari, 2002</xref>), and most studies investigating their health have involved small or community-based samples. The limited number of studies shows high rates of hypertension, diabetes, and risk factors for heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611434058">Hassoun, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659611434058">Hatahet, Khosla, &amp; Fungwe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043659611434058">Jaber, Brown, Hammad, Nowak, et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, Arab Americans have high rates of cigarette and water pipe smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043659611434058">Knishkowy &amp; Amitai, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043659611434058">Rice et al., 2005</xref>), which are known factors for poor health outcomes.</p>
<p>In general, studies that considered the role of acculturation in the health of Arab Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043659611434058">Faragallah, Schumm, &amp; Webb, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659611434058">Jaber, Brown, Hammad, Zhu, &amp; Herman., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611434058">Meleis, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659611434058">Meleis, Lipson, &amp; Paul, 1992</xref>) used nonsystematic and unidimensional methods to assess acculturation. Overall, the findings from these studies indicate that Arab Americans are at risk for acculturative stress and unfavorable health outcomes. The findings from one study, which used nationally representative data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043659611434058">Read, Amick, &amp; Donato, 2005</xref>), showed that Arab immigrants to the United States who were noncitizens reported better self-rated health than those who were citizens, regardless of the duration of their residence in the United States. Furthermore, Arab Americans in the study who were U.S. citizens did not significantly differ from U.S.-born Whites in their self-rated health. These findings are in direct contrast to what has generally been reported about the health of this immigrant group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611434058">Hassoun, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659611434058">Hatahet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043659611434058">Jaber, Brown, Hammad, Nowak, et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although more researchers have recently taken an interest in the role of acculturation in the health of Arab Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043659611434058">Dallo &amp; James, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659611434058">Jaber, Brown, Hammad, Zhu, et al., 2003</xref>), the influence of acculturation on their health and health behavior remains understudied and unclear. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to describe the physical and mental health status of Arab Americans and to determine the relationship between their acculturation and their health. The study used a bidimensional measure of acculturation that simultaneously examined the orientation of this ethnic group on their attraction to their ethnic culture and their attraction to American culture. This approach represents a more systematic and comprehensive way to account for acculturation than has generally been used in studying this group.</p>

<sec id="section3-1043659611434058">
<title>Study Design and Procedure</title>
<p>This was a cross-sectional correlational study of a convenience sample of 297 adult Arab Americans living in southern California. The study was approved by the institutional review board of Loma Linda University in California. Eligibility criteria included being 18 years or older, having fluency in Arabic or English, and either having immigrated from any of the Arabic states or born in the United States to parents of Arabic descent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1043659611434058">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Data were collected using a survey that included three measures, all detailed below. Two of the measures (the Demographic and Health Data Survey [DHDS] and the Acculturation Rating Scale of Arab Americans-II [ARSAA-II]) were translated into Arabic for the first time. The ARSAA-II was based on the Acculturation Rating Scale of Mexican Americans-II (ARSMA-II). The translation/back-translation processes were conducted using methods described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043659611434058">Brislin (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611434058">Jones, Lee, Phillips, Zhang, and Jaceldo (2001)</xref>. Once the translation and back-translation process was completed, a panel of bilingual and bicultural experts evaluated the translated and the back-translated documents and suggested changes. Then, the changed documents were submitted to a new panel of two experts who again compared them in order to assure that they were linguistically and culturally equivalent. Finally, all the measures were pilot tested on 30 participants prior to using them in the major study. All the feedback obtained in the process was incorporated into the final versions of the surveys. The surveys were administered in English or Arabic, based on participants’ choice.</p>
<sec id="section5-1043659611434058">
<title>Demographic and Health Data Survey</title>
<p>The DHDS was a questionnaire compiled and translated by the researcher to obtain demographic and health-related data, including self-report of chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer), in order to assess morbidity and practices of cigarette smoking and alcohol use among participants. A morbidity score (MS) with a range of 0 to 4 was calculated to indicate the number of chronic diseases reported by the participant, regardless of severity.</p>

<sec id="section6-1043659611434058">
<title>The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)–Version 1</title>
<p>The SF-36 is a generic tool to assess general health that was developed by Ware and Sherbourne in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043659611434058">1992</xref>. SF-36 is widely used worldwide and had been translated and validated for use in multiple languages and numerous countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043659611434058">QualityMetric Inc., n.d.</xref>). QualityMetric follows a rigorous process of translation that has its origins in the International Quality of Life Assessment Project and has as its goal the development of conceptually equivalent and culturally appropriate translations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043659611434058">QualityMetric Inc., n.d.</xref>). A validated Arabic version was obtained from QualityMetric Inc. Studies in the Middle East showed that the SF-36 was valid and appropriate for use with Arabic language speakers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659611434058">Coons, Alabdulmohsin, &amp; Draugalis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043659611434058">Sabbah, Drouby, Sabbah, Retel-Rude, &amp; Mercier, 2003</xref>). This measure assesses physical and mental health with eight subscales: (a) Physical Functioning, (b) Bodily Pain, (c) Role Limitations Because of Physical Health Problems, (d) Role Limitations Because of Personal or Emotional Problems, (e) Mental Health, (f) Social Functioning, (g) Vitality, and (h) General Health Perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health (Ware, Snow, Kosinski, &amp; Gandek, 1993).The alpha reliabilities of the subscales in this study are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043659611434058">Table 1</xref>. The subscales can be combined in two aggregates to indicate physical and mental health. These aggregates are commonly known as Physical Composite Summary (PCS) and Mental Composite Summary (MCS). Generally, higher scores on PCS and MCS indicate better physical and mental health, respectively. Cronbach’s α reliabilities for the PCS and MCS in the current study were .90 and .87, respectively. They were comparable with those of the 1998 U.S. general population (.94 and .89, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043659611434058">Ware &amp; Kosinski, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Acculturation Rating Scale of Arab Americans–II</title>
<p>The investigator translated Scale 1 of the ARSMA-II, which has 30 items, into Arabic. ARSMA-II was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043659611434058">Cuéllar, Arnold, and Maldonado (1995)</xref> and is widely used to assess acculturation among Mexican Americans. The translated version for Arab Americans is referred to here as ARSAA-II. Factor analysis (FA) was run on ARSAA-II, and the factor scores and their interaction, which represents a bicultural mode of acculturation, were used for the analyses involving acculturation in this study. Principal axis factoring with direct oblimin rotation was used to generate two factors (a) Attraction to American Culture (AAC), which had 13 items; and (b) Attraction to Arabic Culture (AArC), which had 15 items. Two items that involve a bicultural identity were excluded because they were weakly associated with both of the factors: (a) “I associate with Arabs or Arab Americans” and (b) “I like to identify myself as an Arab American.” As expected, the two factors (AAC and AArC) were weakly and negatively correlated, <italic>r</italic> = −.330. Cronbach’s α coefficients for AAC and AArC in the study were .89 and .85, respectively.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1043659611434058">
<title>Data Analysis and Management</title>
<p>The sample size estimate was based on the anticipated statistical analyses, specifically FA and multiple regressions. Originally, data for 340 cases were obtained. However, only the 297 cases that achieved 90% completion rate on both SF-36 and ARSAA-II were retained. The retained sample size exceeded the minimum sample required for factor analyzing ARSAA-II based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043659611434058">Nunnally and Bernstein’s (1994)</xref> recommendations of a ratio of five subjects per item. SPSS™ Version 17 was used for all analyses. Missing data were substituted using the expectation maximization procedure described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043659611434058">Schafer and Graham (2002)</xref>.</p>
<p>Regressions (both multiple and logistic) were used to examine the relationship between health measures and acculturation. The demographic predictors that were entered into the regressions were determined based on correlations, <italic>t</italic> tests, and chi-square statistics (depending on their nature) in relation to the calculated health indicator scores, including the MS, PCS, and MCS. Demographic factors that were not related to the health indicator were not included in the regressions. Smoking status and alcohol use, as well as any categorical demographic variables, were dichotomized by dummy coding prior to entering them into the regression models.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1043659611434058" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The results are presented in the following order: (a) the demographic characteristics of participants; (b) the general health of participants in terms of prevalence of chronic diseases, their physical status, and their mental health status; (c) the prevalence of smoking and alcohol use in the sample; (d) findings about participants’ acculturative patterns; and (e) results that describe the relationships among the measures of health and acculturation.</p>
<sec id="section10-1043659611434058">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The mean age of participants was 38.6 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 14.3), with a range of 18 to 86 years. Females constituted 56% of the sample (<italic>n</italic> = 167) and males constituted 44% (<italic>n</italic> = 130). The majority of participants were Muslim (67%), were married (69%), and had a family mean annual income of $66,000 (median = $50,000, <italic>SD</italic> = $58,000). More than 60% of the participants had a minimum of a college degree and had been in the United States for an average of 17 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 10). Sixty percent of the participants responded to the English version of the survey, although only 15% (44) of them reported having been born in the United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1043659611434058">
<title>General Health of Participants</title>
<p>Morbidity was assessed by the prevalence of chronic diseases reported by participants. The prevalence of hypertension in the sample was 13%, diabetes 7%, heart disease 6%, and cancer (including all cancers) 1.4%. Among the participants, 11% reported at least one chronic disease and 3% reported having two or more chronic diseases.</p>
<p>General health was assessed by the SF-36. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043659611434058">Table 1</xref> shows the means of the subscales for this sample compared with those of the general U.S. population of 1998, along with alpha reliabilities and significance tests for the differences. Differences were tested using <italic>t</italic> tests for independent groups; Arab Americans in this sample reported significantly worse scores on six of the eight subscales (Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, General Health, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health) and better scores on Bodily Pain and Vitality than the general U.S. population of 1998.</p>
<p>The PCS scores in the sample ranged from 19.36 to 66.39 (<italic>M</italic> = 51.23, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.12), whereas MCS scores ranged from 8.94 to 67.32 (<italic>M</italic> = 46.69, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.28). The sample’s PCS mean was higher than the published norm for the U.S. general population in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043659611434058">Ware &amp; Kosinski, 2002</xref>). This difference was tested using the independent group <italic>t</italic> test and was significant, <italic>t</italic>(2,277) = 2.00, <italic>p</italic> =.000. This finding indicates that, overall, Arab Americans in the sample had better physical health than the general U.S. population in 1998. In contrast, the sample’s MCS mean score was lower than the norm for the U.S. general population in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043659611434058">Ware &amp; Kosinski, 2002</xref>).

<title>Smoking and Alcohol Use</title>
<p>Smoking and alcohol use were assessed using self-report. Smoking status and alcohol use rates were 13% and 14%, respectively. Smokers were significantly older (<italic>M</italic> = 43 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 11) than nonsmokers (<italic>M</italic> = 38 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 14). The mean age of those who used alcohol was 40 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 14), was not significantly different from those who did not use alcohol (<italic>M</italic> = 38, <italic>SD</italic> = 14). Neither education nor income was related to alcohol use or to smoking.</p>

<title>Acculturation of Participants</title>
<p>The two factors that resulted from FA of ARSAA-II were labeled AAC and AArC, as described in the Method section. The relationship between acculturation and demographic variables (gender, religion, marital status, employment status, age, education, language, length of residence in the United States, and income) were tested using independent group <italic>t</italic> tests, analyses of variance, and correlations, depending on the nature of the demographic variable. All demographic variables, except gender, showed significant associations with acculturation. A significant correlation was also found between both AAC and AArC and length of residence (<italic>r</italic> = .234, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; <italic>r</italic> = −.224, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, respectively). The means of AAC and AArC differed significantly, <italic>t</italic>(294) = −14.578, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001 (for AAC), and <italic>t</italic>(294) = 7.288, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001 (for AArC), between participants who responded to the English version of the survey and those who responded to the Arabic version of the survey. These findings were expected because both length of residence and language are considered proxy measures of acculturation. Although we assessed length of residence and language, we decided not to include them in the analyses because they were logically redundant with the content of the acculturation measure ARSAA-11, which is also a more comprehensive measure than language and length of residence. Additional analyses (not shown) demonstrated what we suspected as when the acculturation scale, length of residence, and language preference were entered simultaneously in our regression analyses neither length of residence nor language preference remained statistically significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we described the prevalence of chronic diseases, general physical and mental health, and cigarette smoking and alcohol use rates in a sample of adult Arab Americans living in Southern California. We also examined the relationship of acculturation with physical and mental health, and of acculturation with smoking and alcohol use.</p>
<p>The reported prevalences of hypertension (13%), heart disease (6%), and diabetes (7%) in this sample were lower than those reported for Americans in the same age-group in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043659611434058">Rosamond et al., 2008</xref>). The reported prevalences of chronic diseases in this sample were also lower than those documented for Arab Americans in other studies based on use of independent clinical measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611434058">Dallo &amp; Borrell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043659611434058">Dallo &amp; James, 2000</xref>). This finding could be related to the fairly young age of participants (<italic>M</italic> = 38.6 years) and their relatively high income and level of education. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution because this study was based on self-report rather than independent clinical diagnostic criteria. This fact is particularly important, given the fact that previous studies of Arab Americans (Hassoun, 1995; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043659611434058">Kridli, Herman, Brown, Fakhouri, &amp; Jaber, 2005</xref>) of comparable age-groups have shown that approximately 38% to 45% of their participants did not know that they had any diseases until they were tested during these studies.</p>
<p>The overall PCS scores showed that the participants in this sample generally reported significantly better physical health than that reported for the general U.S. population in 1998, which is congruent with the lower prevalence of chronic diseases reported by the participants. Although this finding is congruent with what other researchers have shown among other immigrant groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043659611434058">Singh &amp; Siahpush, 2002</xref>), it is surprising because participants in this study scored significantly lower on few of the subscales that made up the PCS. This is possibly a result of the weights that the various subscales carried in the overall summary score.</p>
<p>The findings regarding the relationship between acculturation and physical health (PCS score) was interesting in terms of how better physical well-being was associated with acculturative modes that indicated moderate identification with both the ethnic (Arabic) and American cultures. Participants who had an acculturative mode that was characterized by strong identification with both cultures—indicating competing loyalties—suffered in terms of their physical well-being.</p>
<p>Participants reported significantly lower scores on the MCS, indicating poorer mental health than that reported for the 1998 U.S. population. These findings are consistent with the acculturative stress theory proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611434058">Berry (2003)</xref> about immigrants’ psychological state and its relationship to acculturation. The re<bold>s</bold>ults also show that AAC, which represents more Americanization or assimilation into the American culture, appeared to be significantly associated with better mental health among the participants; even after all demographic variables were controlled. This finding runs opposite to what other researchers have reported about mental health and well-being among other immigrant groups in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611434058">Cuéllar, Bastida, &amp; Braccio, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043659611434058">Vega et al., 1998</xref>). This finding addresses the importance of considering and evaluating the role of acculturation when counseling or treating Arab Americans regarding their mental health.</p>
<p>The prevalence of smoking among male participants in this study (23%) is similar to that of the national rate for males in the same age-group (23.4%) but higher than that observed among southern California males (18.7%). However, the rate of smoking among females in this study was lower (4.8%) than that of females in the same age-group on the national (18.5%) and state (11.1%) levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043659611434058">UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As noted earlier, smoking was more prevalent among males than among females in this group, which is a pattern consistent with research findings about Arab Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043659611434058">Kridli et al., 2005</xref>) and Arabs in the Middle East. Smoking rate was also lower compared to Arab American samples in Michigan and in the Middle East (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611434058">Jha, Ranson, Nguyen, &amp; Yach, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043659611434058">Kridli et al., 2005</xref>). Although these findings may be partially explained by the restrictions on cigarette smoking based on California laws <italic>cigarette smoking</italic> compared with law in Michigan and the Middle East, the role of acculturation cannot be excluded.</p>
<p>A few limitations to this study should be noted. First, this study is cross-sectional in design; thus, causality cannot be established, despite the fact that factors such as demographic criteria were controlled. Second, convenience sampling was used; therefore, caution should be exercised in generalizing the findings of this study. Third, we obtained data based on subjective self-report of chronic diseases and health, rather than by clinical measures; thus, the reported rates of chronic diseases in the sample may not match their actual prevalence.</p>
<p>Despite its limitations, this study contributes to understanding Arab Americans’ acculturative patterns and adds to the limited body of knowledge about their health profile. The sample size in this study was large relative to other Arab American health studies. Furthermore, we used an independent bidimensional measure of acculturation to examine its influence on health beyond the traditional proxy measures (e.g., length of residence and language). This approach offers a more systematic assessment of acculturation than the use of proxy measures that have largely been the standard practice among researchers of this group.</p>
