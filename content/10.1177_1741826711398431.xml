<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Antiretroviral therapy improved the survival of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. With increased life expectancy, HIV-infected patients increasingly are experiencing comorbidities, most notably cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) and coronary heart disease (CHD).</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> This study utilized a prospective, cross-sectional multicentre long-term design.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> In 803 patients (82% male; mean age 44.2 ± 10.3 years) we evaluated the prevalence of CRFs and 10-year risk of CHD using the Framingham risk model. The presence of a risk factor was determined based on the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP ATP III), the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7), and the German Society of Cardiology.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The most common CRFs were smoking (51.2%), high triglycerides (39.0%), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (27.5 %) and high blood pressure (21.4%). In total, 60.3%, 21.6%, and 18.1% of patients were categorized as being at low (&lt;10%), moderate (10–20%), and high (&gt;20%) 10-year risk for CHD, respectively. In patients with hypertension, at least one antihypertensive drug was given in 91/163 (55.8%) patients. The percentage of patients on treatment with diabetes mellitus was 23/41 (56.1%). Anti-platelet therapy was prescribed to 42/102 (41.2%) patients with known CHD or CHD equivalent. In patients of moderate or high CHD risk there were more than 50% and 30% for LDL cholesterol and more than 60% and 40% for total cholesterol untreated.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The prevalence of CRFs remains high in an HIV-infected population. CRF management of HIV-infected patients deserves further improvement.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741826711398431" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Antiretroviral therapy has significantly improved the survival of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711398431">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711398431">2</xref></sup> Consequently, HIV infection has become a chronic and manageable disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711398431">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711398431">4</xref></sup> With increased life expectancy, HIV-infected patients increasingly are experiencing complications of illnesses that are not directly related to HIV infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711398431">5</xref></sup> Causative, direct viral effects, chronic vascular inflammation, treatment with anti-retroviral treatment (ART), and metabolic imbalances could significantly act on the long-term prognosis and may increase cardiovascular mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711398431">6</xref></sup> Thus, the focus on long-term management of patients with HIV infection has broadened to include comorbid conditions, most notably cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) and coronary heart disease (CHD).</p>
<p>However, the clinical presentations of CHD in HIV infection tend to be distinct from CHD patients due to traditional risk factors. Demographically, HIV patients who develop acute coronary syndrome are more than a decade younger.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711398431">5</xref></sup> Additionally, changes in the lipid profile towards an atherogenic lipid profile, lipodystrophy, or metabolic syndrome as an overall effect of the HIV infection and specific effects of ART particularly have to be considered and may be different compared to the overall population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711398431">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711398431">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711398431">8</xref></sup> Secondary to the metabolic changes, other traditional CRFs, exceptionally smoking, appear quite prevalent in the HIV-infected population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711398431">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711398431">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some studies of the prevalence of risk factors for CHD in HIV-infected individuals have been published, but data are sparse on the treatment of the CRFs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711398431">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711398431">11</xref></sup> However, as a marked increase in CHD among HIV-infected patients is possible within the next decade as a result of the overall and HIV specific CRFs, cardiovascular risk assessement, and optimization of CRFs deserves augmended attention.</p>
<p>The aim of our study was to calculate the prevalence of an estimated 10-year CHD risk in HIV-positive patients. We further addressed the treatment of individual CRFs and the implementation of the current guidelines.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1741826711398431" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711398431"><title>Participants and study eligibility</title>
<p>This study utilized a prospective, cross-sectional multicentre long-term design enrolling 803 eligible patients between September 2004 and May 2006. The study evaluates the frequency and clinical course of myocardial dysfunction and heart failure in a HIV-infected population. The design of the so-called HIV-HEART Study (HIV and HEART disease) has been published previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711398431">12</xref></sup> Males and females with known HIV-1 infection, both therapy naive and receiving antiretroviral therapy, were included in this study. Exclusion criteria for this longitudinal study were: (1) an instable cardiovascular status in the last four weeks prior to the screening visit or current hospitalization; (2) inability or unwillingness to give informed consent; (3) age less than 18 years; or (4) pregnancy. Local ethics committee approved the study and informed consent was obtained from all subjects included in this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711398431"><title>Clinical data collection</title>
<p>The study protocol includes a standardized examination with documentation of patient history, medical treatment, clinical examination, and single office blood pressure measurement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711398431">6</xref></sup> Furthermore, laboratory measurements (not necessarily in the fasting state) including total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG), virus load, and CD4-count were included into the study protocol and performed by all patients. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711398431">13</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711398431"><title>Risk factors for CHD</title>
<p>The presence of a risk factor was determined using cut-offs based on guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP ATP III), the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7), and the German Society of Cardiology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711398431">14</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711398431">16</xref></sup> Dyslipidaemia was defined as TC &gt;6.2 mmol/l, HDL cholesterol &lt;1.03 mmol/l, or fasting triglycerides &gt;2.26 mmol/l. Arterial hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg (&gt;135/85 mmHg in diabetic patients) or taking antihypertensive drugs. Diabetes mellitus was defined as anamnestic definite diagnosis or known antidiabetic drug or insulin. A family history for CHD was defined as myocardial infarction or stroke before the age of 50 years in any first-degree relative. Obesity was defined as body mass index &gt;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. In addition, patients were considered to have a history of CHD if they had one of the following events: known coronary insufficiency, previous myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, or coronary angioplasty or stenting. We defined coronary risk equivalents as the presence of cerebral infarction, symptomatic carotid artery disease, peripheral artery disease, or diabetes (with no history of CHD). An individual was considered as an ex-smoker if he/she stopped smoking for at least 4 weeks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711398431"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Estimated 10-year risk of CHD was calculated for each subject by entering the following variables into the equations of the Framingham risk model: age, gender, systolic blood pressure, total and HDL cholesterol, diabetes mellitus (yes/no), and current smoking status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711398431">9</xref></sup> Individuals were characterized as low (&lt;10%), moderate (10–20%), or high risk (&gt;20%) for developing CHD in 10 years. The Framingham risk score (FRS) gives estimates for ‘hard CHD’ which includes myocardial infarction and coronary death.</p>
<p>Analysis was performed using SPSS (release 17.0.0, August 2008). Data are expressed as number and percentages or mean ± SD. Inference about differences between the risk groups was made by the chi-squared test for frequencies, and by the Kruskal–Wallis test for quantitative variables. A significance level was set at <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05 and all probability values reported were two-sided.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1741826711398431"><title>Clinical characteristics</title>
<p>Of the total 803 enrolled candidates, finally 761 (95%) individuals who had HIV-1 infection were included in this analysis; 42 (5%) had to be excluded because of missing data (three blood pressure; one TC, 38 HDL). Similar to the population of HIV-infected persons in industrial countries, most of the participants 633 (83.2%) were male. Of the 761 patients in this study, 673 (88.4%) were of Caucasian origin. In our population the most common risk factor for HIV infection was men having sex with men in 447 of 761 (58.7%) patients. Other ways of transmission were heterosexual contacts in 159 (20.9%) and intravenous drug abuses in 73 (9.6%) of 761 patients. Only a minority was infected due to blood transfusion, living in epidemic areas, or being not able to give reliable information about risk factors. In correspondence with epidemiological data, this distribution is representative for HIV-infected patients in most industrial countries: 82% were male; the mean age of the cohort was 44.2 ± 10.3 (range 21–75) years. Women were younger than men (age 40.4 ± 9.3 vs. 45. ± 10.4 years, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001) and 15.2% of the total population was over 55 years of age.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1741826711398431"><title>Prevalence of CRFs</title>
<p>Values for estimated 10-year CHD risk and the individual risk factors are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711398431">Table 1</xref>. The prevalence of individuals at low, moderate, and high 10-year CHD risk was 353 (55.8%), 159 (25.1%), and 121 (19.1%) for men and 106 (82.8%), 5 (3.9%), and 17 (13.3%) for women, respectively. Patients with an estimated 10-year CHD risk &gt;20% were older (51.5 ± 10.6 years) compared to those with 10-year CHD risk CHD 10–20% or &lt;10% (51.2 ± 8.9 years and 39.5 ± 7.7; <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001, respectively). Tobacco abuse (51.2%) and hyperlipidaemia (23.6%) were the most common risk factors and likely played the biggest role in contributing to overall cardiovascular risk.

<p>Assessment of LDL cholesterol is preferable, but LDL cholesterol was computed (not measured) and available not for all patients, hence we additionally present TC. The treatment status of TC and LDL cholesterol for the different Framingham risk groups is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711398431">Figure 1</xref>. There were high numbers of patients not being treated in target range or even not being treated at all though having an indication for a lipid lowering drug. Especially in patients of moderate or high CHD risk, there were more than 50% and 30%, respectively, for LDL cholesterol and more than 60% and 40%, respectively, for TC untreated although having an indication.

<p>In this study we have highlighted: (1) a high prevalence of CRFs in HIV-positive patients; (2) an elevated prevalence of daily smoking and an elevated TC level as being the main contributors to increased risk of CHD; and (3) however, sufficient treatment as well as treatment targets were reached only in a minority of patients.</p>
<p>CHD, the leading cause of death, recently has been recognized as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with HIV. A recent study demonstrated increased prevalence of traditional risk factors in HIV-infected men without known CHD, leading to higher calculated 10-year Framingham risk scores when compared with non-infected controls (17% vs. 11% 10-year risk &gt;25%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711398431">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711398431">18</xref></sup> However, certain components of ART or a direct viral effect or the HIV infection itself appear to be associated with increased CHD risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711398431">19</xref></sup> Consequently, the increased frequency of observed CHD in HIV-infected patients has focused attention on appropriate strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease in this population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711398431">20</xref></sup> The European Society of Cardiology on Primary Prevention of CHD recommends that the CHD risk chart based on the FRS should be used in clinical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711398431">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our population, smoking and hyperlipidaemia were the greatest population-attributable risk factors. There was an extremely high percentage of patients smoking or being ex-smoker in our study. More than half of the cohort were current smokers at time of presentation. In the group of moderate or high cardiovascular risk, even nearly two-thirds were current smokers. As smoking is a very important and modifiable risk factor for CHD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711398431">22</xref></sup> physicians should attach great attention to provide additional support to help patients successfully stop smoking. Our results are in concert with other studies. In a French cohort comparing HIV patients aged 35–44 years on ART to a population-based cohort, the estimated attributable risks due to smoking were 65% for men and 25% for women, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711398431">9</xref></sup> Similarly, the DAD study investigators found that smoking was the most powerful predictor of CHD in patients with HIV aside from an existing history of CHD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711398431">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, lipid abnormalities were found in up to 45% of our population depending on the current Framingham risk score classification. These results are in correspondence with previous data. The prevalence of hyperlipidaemia in HIV patients is between 28–80% in different studies, with the majority of cases being hypertriglyceridaemia (40–80%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711398431">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711398431">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711398431">24</xref></sup> Specific effects of ART are important to consider. Especially, the use of PIs is associated with an increased risk for lipid disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711398431">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711398431">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711398431">26</xref></sup> This is in correspondence with our data. We found patients on PI-based ART to have higher FRS than patients on a non-PI-based ART. However, the pathogenesis of lipid abnormalities associated with HIV infection and ART mostly remains unclear. Assumed mechanisms being associated with lipid abnormalities include increased hepatic lipogenesis, impaired clearance of lipids from the bloodstream, and potential effects of immunological status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711398431">27</xref></sup> However, even though long-term treatment with ART may lead to detrimental cardiovascular effects, beneficial effects of ART in the short term, providing evidence that HIV itself, is mechanistically associated with increased CHD risk have to be mentioned.</p>
<p>The main aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment of cardiovascular risk factors in this HIV-infected population. Currently, the treatment of CHD in HIV-infected individuals should largely be guided by existing recommendations in uninfected patients, as clinical studies in HIV patients with CHD are limited. Currently there is no evidence to treat hyperlipidaemia in HIV patients to goals that are different from those for HIV-uninfected patients. However, there have been published specific guidelines and algorithms of treatment for the evaluation and management of ART related hyperlipidaemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711398431">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711398431">28</xref></sup> In our study we demonstrate that current treatment of CRFs still deserves improvement. That issue addresses all kinds of risk factors. On average only half of the patients were treated as recommended in the current guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711398431">14</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711398431">16</xref></sup> The efficacy of preventing cardiovascular risk factors could be shown in a study by Lima et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711398431">29</xref></sup> An intervention programme focused on reduction of traditional risk factors was able to decrease the frequency of patients with HIV infection and elevated cardiovascular risk estimation.</p>
<p>Primarily, patients at low risk should be prioritized for intensive lifestyle interventions. Particularly, the rate of smoking has to be reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711398431">30</xref></sup> However, where lifestyle changes and such as diet and exercise do not suffice, modifiable risk factors should be actively managed, including the use of anti-hypertensives and lipid-lowering agents. Additionally, the initial choice of ART regimen is primarily targeted at viral suppression, although metabolic profiles of drugs should be considered in patients at high cardiovascular risk. If intervention strategies are not sufficient in reducing CHD risk, then changing ART regimen should be considered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741826711398431">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741826711398431">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study has several limitations. First, laboratory values were sometimes not drawn in the fasting state, limiting the number of patients who could be accurately evaluated for TG. However, NCEP ATP III guidelines for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia are based on the measurement of TC and therefore not influencing the estimated 10-year CHD risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711398431">9</xref></sup> Secondly, the study design was cross-sectional, and therefore no information on the time profile of CRFs or cardiovascular treatment is available. Thus, the results might be confounded if CRFs prior to HIV diagnosis affected the choice of therapeutics and it is impossible to determine the cause-and-effect pathway between CRFs and HIV. Thirdly, there is no information available as to whether targets of therapy were reached in patients with diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension as well as the mismatch of patients with known CHD or CHD risk equivalent and anti-platelet therapy cannot be explained. We only were able to classify, if treatment was performed. Fourth, the Framingham risk score was not developed to estimate the cardiovascular risk in a HIV-positive population and thus the estimated 10-year CHD risk may be misclassified. Additionally, there are several risk scores adressing the cardiovascular risk, possibly under- or overestimating the cardiovascular risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741826711398431">33</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741826711398431">35</xref></sup>. However, recent data suggest that the Framingham algorithm performs well in assessing risk of CHD in HIV-infected adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1741826711398431">36</xref></sup> and current guidelines for the treatment CHD in HIV-infected individuals should largely be guided by existing recommendations in uninfected patients. Finally, not all CRFs, i.e. waist-hip ratio, inflammatory markers, and fasting blood glucose, were requested in our study, possibly underestimating the individual cardiovascular risk.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1741826711398431" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The prevalence of CRFs remains high in an HIV-infected population. CRFs management of HIV-infected patients deserves further improvement. Monitoring of CRFs in HIV-infected cohort studies must continue and intervention studies to improve CRFs in HIV-infected patients at moderate to high risk of CHD should be introduced.</p>
