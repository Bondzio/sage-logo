<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the association between self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and problem-solving skills in response to detected hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia among patients with type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Data were obtained from the American Association of Diabetes Educators Outcome System, implemented in 8 diabetes self-management education programs in western Pennsylvania. SMBG was measured by asking patients how often they checked, missed checking, or checked blood glucose later than planned. Problem-solving skill was measured by asking how often they modified their behaviors after detecting high or low blood glucose.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Most patients checked their blood glucose at least once per day. However, when blood glucose was high or low, many of them reported doing nothing, and only some of them resolved the problem. There were significant associations between self-monitoring of blood glucose and problem-solving skills for hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, after controlling for age, gender, ethnicity, education, and time since diagnosis.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>Patients reported poor problem-solving skills when detecting hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia via SMBG. Patients need to learn problem-solving skills along with SMBG training to achieve glycemic control.</p>

<body>
<p>Diabetes self-management education (DSME) is recognized as the cornerstone in supporting patient self-management behaviors and achieving optimal patient outcomes in diabetes care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712440331">1</xref></sup> Systematic review and meta-analysis reports show the effectiveness of DSME on improving glycemic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712440331">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712440331">3</xref></sup> Accordingly, the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE) has considered behavior change and maintenance as the key outcome of interest for DSME and thus has identified 7 self-care behaviors for diabetes education, including healthy eating, being active, monitoring blood glucose, taking medication, problem solving, reducing risk behaviors, and healthy coping. These behaviors have been integrated into the AADE7 Outcomes System, which includes the Diabetes Self-management Assessment Report Tool (D-SMART) and the Diabetes Educator Tool (D-ET).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712440331">4</xref></sup> In the AADE7 Outcome System, patients complete the D-SMART while their diabetes educators complete the D-ET. Both tools are designed to measure attainment of behavioral change goals, as mutually agreed upon by the patient and his or her diabetes educator, in response to educational, behavioral, and clinical interventions in clinical settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712440331">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712440331">6</xref></sup> In addition, the AADE7 Outcome System has collected information regarding how patients interpret high versus low blood glucose values and the ways that patients might modify their behaviors to manage hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.</p>
<p>As one of the key outcomes evaluated in the AADE 7 Outcome System, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) has been widely recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes but there is no consensus regarding its usefulness and effectiveness in improving glycemic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712440331">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712440331"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712440331">9</xref></sup> While the meta-analysis performed by Jansen et al supported the positive results on the effectiveness of SMBG in type 2 diabetes management,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712440331">10</xref></sup> the more recent DiGEM study, a three-arm randomized, controlled trial that examined the effect of SMBG with or without instructions on self-care in a sample of 453 patients with non–insulin-treated type 2 diabetes, revealed no significant difference in A1c level at 12 months between the 2 SMBG intervention groups and the control group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712440331">11</xref></sup> Moreover, both SMBG intervention groups had higher health care costs and lower quality of life, as measured in quality adjusted life years, than the control group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712440331">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>As controversy increases regarding the benefits of SMBG and glycemic control in this population, researchers have recommended that clinicians encourage problem solving among their patients with diabetes by using SMBG results to identify hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events and, in turn, to make behavioral changes related to medication taking, diet, and physical activity in order to achieve a better diabetes outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712440331">13</xref></sup> In addition to vigilance in following the prescribed regimen that is required for effective self-management of diabetes, problem-solving ability has been identified as important for its role in enabling persons with diabetes to detect symptoms, interpret them properly, and ultimately change their behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712440331">14</xref></sup> The AADE has also identified problem solving as one of the key areas in the AADE 7 Self-Care Behaviors for diabetes self-management education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712440331">6</xref></sup> However, it remains unclear whether SMBG patients use their SMBG results to change behaviors after detecting high or low blood glucose.</p>
<p>Though ineffective problem-solving ability has been found to be related to poor glycemic control, the relationship between problem solving and diabetes self-management behaviors is still unclear due to the fact that fewer studies have examined self-management behaviors as outcomes associated with problem solving than have looked at glycemic control and psychosocial variables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712440331">15</xref></sup> Moreover, in these studies problem solving has typically been conceptualized as a general decision-making process rather than as an approach to managing specific diabetes-related problems such as recognizing signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia that are likely to arise from time to time in someone with the disease. Thus, the purpose of this article is to examine the associations between SMBG and patients’ problem-solving skills when high or low blood glucose was detected through SMBG.</p>
<sec id="section1-0145721712440331" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Study data were retrieved from the AADE Outcome System, implemented in 8 sites of the Pittsburgh Regional Initiative for Diabetes Education (PRIDE) network in western Pennsylvania, which provides rich information about assessment, delivery, and evaluation of patient behavior changes with the delivery of DSME. Data were extracted from the D-SMART and the D-ET. This data set is maintained by the University of Pittsburgh Diabetes Institute. Only patients with type 2 diabetes (N = 1587) who had complete information on SMBG and problem solving in hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia (N = 555) were included in this study. This analysis used de- identified data from D-SMART and D-ET and thus received exempt approval from the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board.</p>

<title>Measurement</title>
<sec id="section3-0145721712440331">
<title>Self-monitoring of blood glucose</title>
<p>SMBG was measured via patients’ self-report to 3 items. The first item asked how often patients checked blood glucose with response choices being “4 or more times a day,” “3 times a day,” “2 times a day,” “once a day,” “once a week or less,” and “rarely or never.” The second and third items asked how often they missed checking blood glucose and how often they checked it later than planned. Response options for these two items were “daily,” “several times a week,” “a few times a month,” “once in a while,” and “rarely or never.” A total score was computed by summing coded responses to these three items, with higher scores indicating more frequent SMBG behaviors and greater adherence to the planned SMBG schedule (ie, less frequently missing SMBG or checking it later than planned).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0145721712440331">
<title>Problem solving</title>
<p>Patient problem-solving skills for <italic>hyperglycemia</italic> were measured by the following questions “When your blood sugar is too high, how often do you do the following? 1) change diet, 2) change exercise, 3) increase diabetes medication, 4) check meter/strips, 5) do nothing” and “When your blood sugar runs higher than usual over several days, how often do you do the following? 6) call health care provider, or 7) test ketones.” Similarly, problem-solving skills for <italic>hypoglycemia</italic> were measured by asking “When your blood sugar is too low, how often do you do the following? 1) eat more, 2) stop exercise, 3) reduce diabetes medication, 4) call health care provider, 5) check meter/strips, 6) take glucose, or 7) do nothing.” Responses for each item were “every time,” “most times,” “some times,” and “rarely or never.” Total scores were calculated for problem solving in hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, respectively, with higher scores representing better problem-solving skills when detecting high or low blood glucose.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0145721712440331">
<title>Demographic profile</title>
<p>Age at entry was computed using the year of the first diabetes education session attended minus the year of birth self-reported by the patients, while time since diabetes diagnosis was computed using the year of the first diabetes education session attended minus the year when they reported being told they had diabetes. In addition, gender, race, education, body mass index (BMI), and family history of diabetes were also used to describe the sample and as possible covariates for statistical adjustment.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0145721712440331">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>SPSS (Version 17.0) was used for data analyses. Sample characteristics were described using frequency counts and percentages for categorical variables or median and inter-quartile range for continuous variables, since all of the continuous variables examined were not normally distributed univariately. Spearman rank-order correlation and simple linear regression modeling methods, with the level of significance set at .05, were used to examine the associations between patients’ problem-solving skills and self-monitoring of blood glucose behavior. Covariates considered for inclusion through hierarchical linear regression analyses were age, gender (male as reference), BMI, and family history of diabetes (no history as reference). All of the categorical variables were transformed to be dichotomous variables in order to fit for the regression modeling. Residual analysis was performed through examination of residual plots, studentized deleted residuals, Cook’s distances, and omission diagnostics (standardized changes in regression coefficients and fitted values and covariance ratios) to assess the impact of influential observations.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Patients’ demographic and health profile including age, gender, race, education, BMI, family history of diabetes, and time since diagnosis of diabetes is reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721712440331">Table 1</xref>. The majority of the sample (N = 555) was white (86.7%), female (54.2%), and overweight or obese (median BMI = 32.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), with a median age of 59 years, a diabetes diagnosis for an average of 5 years, and at least a high school education (87.2%). Three out of 4 patients had a family history of diabetes. All of them are non–insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients. Patients in this study were relatively younger, had a higher score on problem solving in hypoglycemia, and had diabetes for a longer period of time than those excluded. No significant difference between the included and excluded sample on SMBG and problem solving in hyperglyecmia.</p>

<title>Associations Between SMBG and Problem Solving in Hyperglycemia and Hypoglycemia</title>
<p>The three variables were not normally distributed. Therefore, Spearman’s correlation coefficients were calculated. We found significant correlations between SMBG and problem solving for hyperglycemia (<italic>r</italic> = .22, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and hypoglycemia (<italic>r</italic> = .15, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), indicating that people who reported more frequent SMBG behaviors or greater adherence to their SMBG schedule had better problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145721712440331">Table 3</xref>, after controlling for age, gender, race, education, and time since diagnosis, the association persisted between SMBG (measured by frequency of SMBG or adherence to SMBG schedule) and problem solving for hyperglycemia (<italic>F</italic> = 4.857, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and hypoglycemia (<italic>F</italic> = 6.783, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). However, SMBG itself explained only a small amount of variation (11%) in problem solving during hyperglycemic events and only 8% of the variance of problem solving during hypoglycemic episodes. Younger age, female, and longer time since diagnosis were also significant predictors of problem solving when having high or low blood glucose levels.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Descriptive data show that patients perform SMBG with more than 75% reporting doing so at least once a day. Yet, disappointingly, most patients did not respond with appropriate problem solving to correct high or low blood glucose levels. Regression analysis results revealed that people who engaged in more frequent SMBG or who were more adherent to the planned SMBG schedule tended to do better in resolving episodes of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. However, only a small amount of variance in patient problem-solving skills was explained by their SMBG behaviors.</p>
<p>Our findings reaffirm those of others that patients need to learn how to use SMBG results to make subsequent lifestyle or therapeutic changes after hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712440331">16</xref></sup> Thus, the effectiveness of performing SMBG could be improved. Through examination of the studies that resulted in different results regarding the effectiveness of SMBG, we found that none of these investigators propose an overall list of problem-solving skills for dealing with hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia to include as a component that could be added to an existing SMBG intervention. In the DiGEM study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712440331">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712440331">12</xref></sup> participants were taught how to interpret SMBG results in relation to medication adjustment and/or lifestyle changes in the two SMBG intervention groups. However, the researchers did not describe the problem-solving behaviors their participants engaged in during hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic episodes, thus it is impossible to evaluate whether participants in these SMBG studies used any of the recommended strategies. Our evaluation of problem-solving skills among patients in the AADE Outcome System included queries about changing diet or physical activity, adjusting medications, checking meters, and seeking help from health care providers when high or low blood glucose levels were detected. Without measuring and examining the problem-solving skills that need to be followed after performing SMBG, we consider it premature to conclude that the use of SMBG should be abandoned in this clinical population. Moreover, problem solving might be a potential moderator in the relationship between SMBG and glycemic control. Furthermore, the study that added self-perception, self-reflection, and self-regulation to the SMBG intervention revealed that this combined intervention to be superior to usual care, though again the researchers did not report the specific skills that patients used to adjust blood glucose levels when they detected a high or low level of blood glucose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712440331">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Studies reported in the literature have examined the effect of problem solving on diabetes self-management. Glasgow et al found that problem solving, as measured by the Diabetes Problem Solving Inventory, was a significant mediator of the DSME.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712440331">18</xref></sup> A systematic review reported that problem solving improved diabetes self-management behaviors, mostly dietary behaviors, in an adult population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712440331">15</xref></sup> However, measures of problem solving varied across studies, and none of these problem-solving measures assessed specific problem-solving skills during high-risk situations in diabetes management, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. Based on this review, Hill-Briggs proposed a model of problem solving with four essential components for problem solving in disease self-management: problem-solving skill, problem-solving orientation, disease-specific knowledge, and transfer of past experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712440331">14</xref></sup> Using SMBG results to identify hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events may be considered the problem-solving orientation component, which may explain the significant correlations between SMBG (frequency or adherence to SMBG schedule) and problem-solving skills after detecting high or low blood glucose, but only with small variances in problem- solving skills accounted for by SMBG. In order to develop better problem-solving skills, diabetes educators need to teach more disease-specific information, relate this to past experiences, and teach problem-solving skills and provide opportunities to practice through role play.</p>
<p>There are several limitations of this study that warrant further discussion. First, this is a secondary data analysis using cross-sectional data and nonstandardized measures. Thus, only associations between variables were discussed here, and no temporal relationship could be inferred from our findings. On the other hand, using a clinical database makes our results more generalizable to the actual clinical population, compared to a controlled research setting. Second, we did not include data on clinical outcomes due to a large number of missing values on these variables, which made it impossible to evaluate the effect of SMBG and problem solving on diabetes outcomes. Third, measures of problem solving in hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia were limited by the participants’ interpretation of “high” or “low” blood glucose. To what extent their detected high or low blood glucose was higher or lower than the standard cut points cannot be examined through our study, thus further investigation of relationships between the amount of deviations from the cut points and problem-solving skills needs to be explored. In addition, participants may have differed in the meaning they attributed to “every time,” “most times,” “some times,” and “rarely or never” as they responded to each item on the problem-solving measure. Fourth, our sample is predominantly white and well educated, so our results may not generalize to other ethnic groups or those with less education.</p>
<p>King et al used the tools developed by Hill-Briggs and found an independent effect for problem solving (as measured by the transfer of past experience [eg, using activity logs to identify problems] suggested by Hill-Briggs) on medication adherence, diet, and physical activity, though they did not examine the effect of problem solving on SMBG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712440331">19</xref></sup> Thus, future investigations should explore both the independent and the moderating effect of problem-solving skills in response to detected hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia on the relationship between diabetes self-management behaviors and diabetes outcomes including glycemic control measured by the A1c levels and cardiovascular markers including total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, and blood pressure. Accurate understanding and recording of high or low blood glucose should also be studied in the future.</p>

<title>Implications for Diabetes Educators</title>
<p>In order to decrease the social and economic burden of diabetes and its associated complications, it is important for those with the disease to maintain blood glucose control. We suggest that patients participate in diabetes self-management education services and that diabetes educators teach problem-solving skills along with SMBG. This is important so that individuals with diabetes can maintain blood glucose levels within a normal range when they detect high or low blood glucose levels from their SMBG.</p>
