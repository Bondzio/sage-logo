<abstract>
<p>Despite advances in child maltreatment research, accurate measurement of exposure remains a key issue. In this study, we evaluated a short form (CEVQ-SF) of the Childhood Experiences of Violence Questionnaire (CEVQ) in a sample of adolescents involved with child protection services in an urban city in Ontario, Canada. Focusing on the two most readily defined maltreatment types, physical and sexual abuse, we evaluated the short form’s comparability with the full version of the CEVQ. Both versions had good internal consistency and moderate-to-good 2-week test-retest reliability. The criterion validity of the two CEVQ versions in comparison with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was satisfactory. Construct validity for both versions was demonstrated: physically and sexually abused youth had higher odds of reporting clinical traumatic symptoms compared with either type alone. The CEVQ-SF is as reliable and valid as its full version. Implications for its use in large population-based surveys are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although investigation into the distribution and determinants of child maltreatment and associated impairment of such adversities has increased over the past two decades, the measurement of child maltreatment remains a challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511416462">Gilbert et al., 2009</xref>). Official reports to child protection services (CPS) underestimate the extent of the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511416462">Gilbert et al., 2009</xref>). Community-based data capture victimization that has not been otherwise reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511416462">Gilbert et al., 2009</xref>); however, maltreatment questions are often limited in general health surveys or are untested prior to inclusion. In Canada, there has been resistance at the federal level to include questions about child maltreatment in surveys conducted to determine the distribution and determinants of children’s mental and physical health. General health surveys typically involve samples from the adult population, where much more time has passed since the potential period of exposure to child maltreatment. This may increase the risk of recall bias. Adolescents, however, remain temporally closer to their childhood maltreatment experiences. Including maltreatment questions that are brief and valid in community-based surveys of youth can offer substantial advantages. To date, there have been few questionnaires developed to ask youth about their victimization experience.</p>
<p>The Childhood Experiences of Violence Questionnaire (CEVQ) was developed for community-based studies of youth aged 12 to 18 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511416462">Walsh, MacMillan, Trocmé, Jamieson, &amp; Boyle, 2008</xref>). The CEVQ uses 18 stem questions which are behaviorally based to increase validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511416462">Hamby &amp; Finkelhor, 2000</xref>). It measures bullying (two items), physical punishment (i.e., spanking, one item), physical abuse (PA, six items), sexual abuse (SA, six items), emotional abuse (one item), and exposure to domestic violence (two items). The CEVQ includes an additional 64 questions inquiring about context (i.e., developmental stages of occurrence of abuse, perpetrators, and help-seeking behaviors). It does not include neglect, as this type of maltreatment was considered too difficult to assess with a brief questionnaire, given its considerable variation across stages of child development. The CEVQ has shown good test-retest reliability and fair-to-good criterion validity for PA and SA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511416462">Walsh et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The short form of the CEVQ (CEVQ-SF) was developed to reduce response burden while obtaining the same basic information as the full version. It has seven stem questions including bullying (two items), physical punishment (one item), and the two most readily identifiable maltreatment types, PA (three items) and SA (one item). In the CEVQ-SF, six original PA items are collapsed into three items, three SA items involving physical contact are collapsed into one item, and three SA items not involving physical contact are omitted in the modified version (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260511416462">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>This study is the first psychometric evaluation of the CEVQ-SF to assess its suitability for use in large population-based surveys aimed at measuring health and its correlates in children and youth. We evaluated the internal consistency and 2-week test-retest reliability of the CEVQ-SF, and two aspects of its validity—first, the criterion validity in comparison with the most comprehensive self-report measurement of child maltreatment, and second, the construct validity in comparison with the clinical traumatic symptoms based on the hypothesis that youth exposed to child maltreatment would endorse increased frequency of traumatic symptoms. We assessed the comparability of the CEVQ-SF with the original CEVQ on these psychometric properties.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0886260511416462">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants in this study are part of the Maltreatment and Adolescent Pathways (MAP) longitudinal study that began collecting data in September 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511416462">Wekerle et al., 2009</xref>). They were randomly selected from active CPS cases between age 14 and 17 from an urban centre’s catchment area in Ontario, Canada. These youth have higher rates of maltreatment, and this introduces efficiencies in sample size for this preliminary evaluation of the measure.</p>
<p>Youth were ineligible if they were not in contact with the CPS caseworker, were discharged from care at the time of referral, had a severe developmental delay, had severe psychological health issues (i.e., actively suicidal or psychotic episode), or were in secure custody or an inpatient treatment program. The initial recruitment rate was 70% of all eligible youth. Details of the MAP Study methods can be found elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511416462">Wekerle et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886260511416462">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Ethics approval was obtained from all participating CPS agencies as well as university-based ethics boards. All MAP research team members and researchers who accessed the data signed confidentiality agreements with participating CPS agencies. All participants provided informed consent or assent for those aged below 16.</p>
<p>Data for this study (<italic>n</italic> = 369 youth) were drawn from the MAP intake data with four self-report questionnaires: The CEVQ, CEVQ-SF, Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and Traumatic Symptoms Checklist for Children (TSCC). We also administered a 2-week retest of the CEVQ (<italic>n</italic> = 63) and CEVQ-SF (<italic>n</italic> = 36) to a subset of participants who were recruited into the MAP Study during the period November 2006 to May 2008.</p>

<title>CEVQ and the short form (CEVQ-SF)</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260511416462">Table 1</xref> presents the short and long forms of the CEVQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511416462">Walsh et al., 2008</xref>) and the algorithms to determine PA and SA. The stem question for PA in the CEVQ reads “How many times has an adult . . .” followed by abusive acts. The stem question for SA asks about abusive acts committed by “anyone.” The CEVQ-SF provides the time frame of abuse; for example, “How many times before age 16 did an adult . . .” Respondents choose one of five responses: <italic>never</italic>, <italic>1-2 times</italic>, <italic>3-5 times</italic>, <italic>6-10 times</italic>, and <italic>more than 10 times</italic>. PA and SA are determined by frequency on the CEVQ; if at least one item meets the minimum required frequency, then that case is classified as abuse. If at least one item meets the minimum required frequency for severe abuse, the case is classified as severe abuse. The threshold of severity for PA in the CEVQ-SF was set to match the algorithms of the full version. The SA classification in the CEVQ-SF is based on one item that includes several abusive acts ranging in severity; therefore a “severe” SA classification is not possible. Both versions ask about the developmental stages when abuse occurred, although wording differs slightly. Options in the CEVQ-SF include “Before you began grade school?” “While you were in grade school?” and “While you were in high school?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0886260511416462">
<title>CTQ</title>
<p>The CTQ was used for the criterion standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511416462">Bernstein et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511416462">2003</xref>). Although the CTQ has not been validated specifically for a child welfare sample, the CTQ was the most comprehensive measure of childhood maltreatment. Originally developed in a clinical context, the CTQ is a 28-item self-report questionnaire that assesses history of PA, SA, emotional abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect. The CTQ uses a mix of behaviorally anchored (e.g., I got hit or beaten) and interpretive questions (e.g., I was physically abused). It taps historical maltreatment without a specified timeframe, “While I was growing up.” For each statement, respondents are offered a 5-point scale (1 = <italic>never true</italic> to 5 = <italic>very often true</italic>). For the analysis, we created a binary abuse classification for PA, severe PA, SA, and severe SA. Severe forms were determined based on the cut-off scores set by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511416462">Bernstein et al. (1994)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0886260511416462">
<title>TSCC</title>
<p>The TSCC was administered to assess construct validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511416462">Briere, 1996</xref>). It is a 54-item self-report measure of posttraumatic symptomatology, in children and adolescents ages 8 or older, which includes the effects of child abuse and neglect, other interpersonal violence, witnessing trauma to others, major accidents, and disasters. Participants respond to statements using a 4-point scale (0 = <italic>never</italic>, 1 = <italic>sometimes</italic>, 2 = <italic>lots of times</italic>, 3 = <italic>almost all of the time</italic>). The TSCC has six clinical scales (Anxiety, Depression, Posttraumatic Stress, Sexual Concerns, Dissociation, and Anger). Raw scores are transformed into age- and gender-adjusted <italic>T</italic>-scores with a clinical cutoff of 65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511416462">Briere, 1996</xref>), resulting in a binary measure. The TSCC scales were internally consistent in the standardization sample and exhibited reasonable convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity in normative and clinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511416462">Briere, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511416462">Sadowski &amp; Friedrich, 2000</xref>). To assess construct validity, we used a binary measure to calculate the proportion of youth that met a clinical level of traumatic symptoms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0886260511416462">
<title>Demographic questions</title>
<p>We collected data about age, sex, and ethnicity at the intake interview. Youth’s CPS status included Crown wards (i.e., parental right legally terminated), community families/temporary care, Society wards (i.e., parental rights sharing agreement), and voluntary care arrangement. We measured the length of time in years the youth was involved with the CPS system in Ontario.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0886260511416462">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>We calculated the lifetime prevalence of abuse using each measure. For both versions of the CEVQ, we assessed 2-week test-retest reliabilities for PA, severe PA, SA, and severe SA with Cohen’s kappa (κ), and internal consistency for PA and SA with Cronbach’s alpha (α; for the short form, α is not available for SA with only one item). To assess criterion validity, we calculated the agreement (κ) between the CEVQ, CEVQ-SF, and the CTQ for PA, severe PA, SA, and severe SA.</p>
<p>To evaluate construct validity, we examined the likelihood of youth meeting a clinical level of traumatic symptoms. For the analysis, child abuse was classified by (1) abuse type (PA and SA) and (2) by the number of abuse types (either PA or SA or both types). For the first analysis, youth were classified into three groups: (a) no PA and SA, (b) PA, and (c) SA, where (b) and (c) may overlap. For the second analysis, youth were classified into three mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive groups: (a) no PA and SA, (b) either PA or SA, and (c) both PA and SA. The logistic regression was used to test the group difference in odds of reporting a clinical level of traumatic symptoms with a group (a) as a reference for each analysis. We then compared these associations across different child abuse measures. SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for the analyses.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Participants in this study (45.8% male) had a mean age of 16.4 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.0) at intake. Youth-reported ethnic identity was 29% White, 24% Black, 3% Latin American, 1% Aboriginal, 1% South Asian, 1% Arab/West Asian, 1% Southeast Asian, 33% Biracial/Multiracial, and 7% Other. With regard to CPS status, 63.6% were Crown wards, 5.0% were interim/temporary care, 15.2% were Society wards, and 16.3% were in community family/voluntary care arrangements. Youth were involved with CPS for an average of 5.8 years (range: 0.5-17 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.2). The group of youth participating in the 2-week test-retest reliability assessment of the CEVQ-SF had a mean age of 15.8 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.0). The CTQ scores of these youth were similar to that of all other participants.</p>
<p>The lifetime prevalence (%) of PA, severe PA, SA, and severe SA measured by the CEVQ were 55.2, 47.0, 29.6, and 25.0, respectively. The corresponding figures estimated by the CTQ were 44.0, 30.5, 22.3, and 12.5, respectively. The lifetime prevalence of PA, severe PA, and SA measured by the CEVQ-SF were 54.4, 45.5, and 20.0, respectively. In the study sample, an increased proportion of females compared with males reported PA, SA, and their severe forms in all measures. The sex difference was statistically significant for SA in all measures and for PA only in the CEVQ.</p>
<p>We compared the 2-week test-retest reliability and internal consistency between the two CEVQ versions. The 2-week test-retest reliabilities for the CEVQ in measuring PA, severe PA, SA, and severe SA were κ = 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.64, 0.95], κ = 0.70, CI [0.52, 0.88], κ = 0.73, CI [0.54, 0.91], and κ = 0.68, CI [0.47, 0.88], respectively. The reliability for the CEVQ-SF in measuring PA, severe PA, and SA were κ = 0.61, 95% CI [0.36, 0.87], κ = 0.72, CI [0.50, 0.95], and κ = 0.91, CI [0.75, 1.00], respectively. Internal consistencies in the CEVQ were α = .89 for PA and α = .90 for SA. In the CEVQ-SF, α = .85 for PA. These results showed that both CEVQ versions had a moderate-to-good reliability in measuring PA, SA, and their severe forms where applicable.</p>
<p>To compare the validity between the CEVQ-SF and the CEVQ, first, we evaluated the criterion validity of each of the two CEVQ versions in comparison with the CTQ. The agreement in measuring PA, severe PA, SA, and severe SA between the CEVQ and CTQ was κ = 0.52, 95% CI [0.44, 0.61], κ = 0.46, CI [0.38, 0.55], κ = 0.52, CI [0.42, 0.61], and κ = 0.50, CI [0.39, 0.60], respectively. The agreement in measuring PA, severe PA, and SA between the CEVQ-SF and CTQ were κ = 0.69, 95% CI [0.50, 0.89], κ = 0.52, CI [0.30, 0.74], and κ = 0.69, CI [0.46, 0.91], respectively. We also assessed the agreement between the two CEVQ versions; results for PA, severe PA, and SA were κ = 0.82, 95% CI [0.66, 0.97], κ = 0.81, CI [0.66, 0.97], and κ = 0.65, CI [0.42, 0.88], respectively.</p>
<p>Next, to evaluate the construct validity, we examined the association between abuse classifications and self-reported clinical trauma symptoms on the TSCC. The associations using the CEVQ-SF, CEVQ, and the CTQ were compared. In the first analysis, we used logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of maltreated youth reporting clinical symptoms compared with youth without PA and SA. Results based on the CEVQ showed that youth with PA, compared with those without PA and SA, were significantly more likely to report clinical levels of anxiety (odds ratio [OR] = 4.8), depression (OR = 4.5), posttraumatic stress (OR = 3.9), sexual concerns (OR = 3.2), and dissociation (OR = 5.8); the OR for anger was 1.9, 95% CI [0.7, 5.1]. Similar associations were observed in the analysis for youth with SA compared with those without PA and SA; OR ranged from 1.8 in dissociation, 95% CI [0.9, 3.5], to 3.6 in anxiety, CI [1.7, 7.8], and posttraumatic stress, CI [1.7, 7.6]. The trend of an increased report of clinical symptoms among youth with either PA or SA compared with the reference group was observed when abuse was measured by the CEVQ-SF (OR range: 2.2-2.8 for PA; 2.3-2.4 for SA for depression, sexual concerns, and dissociation with adequate cell size) and CTQ (OR range: 1.7-3.5 for PA; 1.8-4.5 for SA).</p>
<p>In the second analysis of construct validity, we examined the association between the number of reported abuse types and self-reported clinical trauma symptoms on the TSCC. In this analysis, the number of abuse types was regressed on the likelihood of reporting clinical symptoms using logistic regression. Results based on the CEVQ classification indicated that youth with both PA and SA had the highest likelihood for reporting clinical symptoms in six clinical domains, followed by the youth with either PA only or SA only. Results based on the CEVQ-SF classification showed a similar trend, although ORs were determined for only three clinical domains (depression, sexual concerns, dissociation) where cell size was adequate. The construct validity of the CTQ showed the same pattern observed for the CEVQ.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the psychometric properties of the CEVQ-SF and its comparability with the original CEVQ in measuring PA and SA in adolescents involved with the child welfare system. The CEVQ-SF minimizes potential respondent burden by reducing the number of items from its full version, from 18 stem questions accompanied by 64 context items on the CEVQ to 7 questions and 7 items on developmental timing on the short form. The findings showed that both CEVQ versions were reliable and valid and demonstrated their comparability in measuring PA and SA.</p>
<p>The lifetime prevalence of PA and severe PA on both versions were comparable. Although the prevalence of SA on the CEVQ was higher than the short form (29.6% vs. 20.0%), this seemed to reflect the inclusion of noncontact SA items (i.e., show their private parts, make you show them yours) in the CEVQ that was not included in the CEVQ-SF. The exclusion of SA cases in which only noncontact SA was identified on the CEVQ (<italic>n</italic> = 33) resulted in a lifetime SA prevalence of 20.7% on the CEVQ. Both versions had good internal consistency and moderate-to-good 2-week test-retest reliability. The criterion validity of the two CEVQ versions in comparison with the CTQ was satisfactory.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the CEVQ’s construct validity showed that either physically or sexually abused youth had an increased odds of reporting clinical levels of traumatic symptoms compared with those who did not report exposure to PA and SA. Furthermore, the youth experiencing both PA and SA as classified by the CEVQ had an increased odds of reporting clinical level of traumatic symptoms compared with those who reported only one type or neither type of abuse. These results indicate a dose–response relationship between the increased number of abuse types and increased likelihood of meeting clinical levels of traumatic symptoms in six clinical domains examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511416462">Higgins &amp; McCabe, 2000</xref>). Although the analysis of the CEVQ-SF was based on a smaller sample, it showed patterns similar to the full version.</p>
<p>This study has some limitations. The sample size for the CEVQ-SF and the test-retest reliability for both versions of the CEVQ was small. Although evaluation of construct validity for the CEVQ-SF indicated an overall trend of association between PA and SA and clinical symptoms similar to the CEVQ, further evaluation with a larger sample would provide additional information. This study included only self-report as an approach to measuring child maltreatment, given the underreporting that occurs with official CPS reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511416462">Gilbert et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, this preliminary evaluation of the short form of the CEVQ demonstrated reliability and validity comparable with the full version. As outlined by Gilbert and colleagues (2009), it is important to have accurate estimates of exposure to child maltreatment and ways of collecting information about its correlates. Such data are crucial in determining risk and protective factors and trends in child maltreatment occurrence over time. This information can then form the basis for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions, including those policies implemented with the goal of reducing child maltreatment. Evaluating the psychometric properties of child maltreatment measures is the first step in providing valid and reliable information about the extent of child maltreatment.</p>
