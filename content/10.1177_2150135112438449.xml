<title>Clinical Relevance of Reoxygenation Injury of Cyanotic Hearts</title>
<p>Part of the greater vulnerability to surgical myocardial injury in cyanotic hearts during open heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may be due to the reintroduction of molecular oxygen on the commencement of hyperoxic CPB prior to ischemic cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Clinically, when surgery is performed on cyanotic infants, CPB is usually initiated at high oxygen tension ( partial pressure of oxygen, arterial Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>) in the range of 300 to 400 mm Hg, without the consideration of possible cytotoxic effects of exposure to high partial pressure of molecular oxygen. The CPB per se<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135112438449">1</xref>
</sup> initiates potential oxidant damage via free radical generation, especially at hyperoxemic conditions, since the production of toxic oxygen<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135112438449">2</xref>
</sup> species is proportionate to Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>We proposed the new concept<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135112438449">3</xref>
</sup> of “surgical reoxygenation injury of cyanotic myocardium” in 1995, wherein unintended abrupt reoxygenation of cyanotic myocardium at the onset of routine CPB causes oxygen-mediated surgical reoxygenation injury, which may render the reoxgenated myocardium more susceptible to subsequent surgical ischemia/reperfusion injury and accentuates post-CPB myocardial dysfunction. Our hypothesis is based on the reports, where (1) cyanosis reduces endogenous myocardial antioxidants (eg, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135112438449">4</xref>
</sup> and (2) CPB per se<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135112438449">1</xref>
</sup> initiates potential oxidant damage via free radical generation. The clinical relevance of this type of myocardial injury is found in reports showing increased lipid peroxidation in preischemic myocardial biopsies of the right ventricle in children with teralogy of Fallot (TOF), indicating the occurrence of oxidant-mediated injury at the onset of CPB before ischemia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135112438449">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Using an animal model of acute compensated hypoxemia to simulate metabolic adaptation to maintain aerobic metabolism and avoid acidosis, we<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135112438449">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135112438449">7</xref>
</sup> confirmed the role of reoxygenation injury in the pathogenesis of post-CPB myocardial dysfunction and addressed the importance of controlling Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> at the onset of CPB for cyanotic hearts in the setting of acute hypoxemia. We demonstrated that reoxygenation causes oxygen-mediated damage characterized by lipid peroxidation, impairs antioxidant reserve capacity, and leads to functional depression, which was shown to be mediated by reactive oxygen species via the classic Haber-Weiss pathway and an alternate mechanism of oxidant injury, whereby superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>−</sup>) and nitric oxide (NO) interact<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135112438449">8</xref>
</sup> to form OONO<sup>−</sup>.</p>
<p>We also confirmed that a brief (ie, five minutes) interval of uncontrolled hyperoxic reoxygenation during initial hyperoxemic CPB produced sufficient injury, by showing that controlling Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> in blood cardioplegia five minutes after the onset of CPB showed no protection against injury at all.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135112438449">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The first clinical evidence of the oxidant-mediated reoxygenation injury was shown by clinical studies by Allen et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135112438449">9</xref>
</sup> and subsequently by Bulutcu et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135112438449">10</xref>
</sup> who documented that sudden reoxygenation on hyperoxic CPB resulted in a significant depletion of the antioxidant reserve capacity (levels of malondialdehyde [MDA] at 4 mmol/L of <italic>t</italic>-butyl hydroperoxide) in cyanotic infants, indicating an exposure to a large amount of free radicals during the initial 10 to 20 minutes of CPB. In contrast, minimal changes of antioxidants occurred in the acyanotic patients even with the same level of hyperoxemia. This may coincide with the finding of the correlation between the depletion of endogenous antioxidant content and the degree of preoperative partial pressure of oxygen (P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>) as described by Teoh et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135112438449">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Furthermore, Modi et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135112438449">11</xref>
</sup> proved that hyperoxemic reoxygenation on CPB progressively induced myocardial damage in patients with cyanosis, assessed by troponin I release for 10 to 30 minutes after the onset of CPB and before cardioplegic arrest. Despite the lack of supportive data regarding cardiac function and surgical outcome, these clinical investigations provide persuasive evidence of the clinical relevance of this injury as a substantial biochemical injury to intensify the subsequent ischemic insult.</p>

<title>Strategies to Reduce Reoxygenation Injury: Rationale and Clinical Trials</title>
<p>One of the strategies proposed to avoid reoxygenation injury is lowering Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> during CPB. The proposed benefits appear to be related to the Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>-dependent nature of reoxygenation injury because free radical production and myocardial injury after reoxygenation in isolated heart preparations are proportional<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135112438449">2</xref>
</sup> to Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>. The in vitro production of toxic oxygen species within the mitochondria is proportionate to Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>. A series of our studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135112438449">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135112438449">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135112438449"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135112438449">8</xref>
</sup> demonstrated a positive relationship between Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>, oxygen free radicals, nitric oxide production, and resulting reoxygenation injury. We showed that the reoxygenation injury can be avoided by strict control of level of Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> to normoxemia (80-100 mm Hg),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135112438449">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135112438449"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135112438449">8</xref>
</sup> that is, by maintaining arterial normoxemia during initial reoxygenation on CPB, within the blood cardioplegia solution, and also during the reperfusion phase after removal of the aortic cross-clamp. Avoidance of reoxygenation injury by these maneuvers may be attributable to limiting Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>-dependent generation of O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>−</sup> and OONO<sup>−</sup>. We have also emphasized the critical importance of initial level of Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> because controlling Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> only in blood cardioplegia solution five minutes after the onset of hyperoxic CPB conferred no protection of injury at all.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135112438449">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>These experimental studies were followed by clinical studies. Allen et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135112438449">9</xref>
</sup> showed that in 21 patients with cyanosis, hyperoxic reoxygenation (fraction of inspired oxygen [Fi<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>] 1.0; Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> 400-550 mm Hg) induced oxidant injury (ie, depletion of antioxidants), which was significantly reduced using lower levels of Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> (Fi<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> = 0.21 at the onset of CPB and then increased slowly to maintain Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of 200-300 mm Hg) and was more effectively avoided by leukocyte filtration. They pointed out that the use of Fi<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of 0.21 still results in a Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of 140 to 155 mm Hg, which was substantially higher than the Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of 80 to 100 mm Hg in the original concept of normoxemic CPB reoxygenation introduced in our experimental studies. Similarly, Bulutcu et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135112438449">10</xref>
</sup> performed a prospective randomized clinical study in 24 patients including ten acyanotic infants and 14 cyanotic infants to compare the antioxidant reserve capacity during the initial reoxygenation on CPB utilizing either Fi<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of 1.0 (P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>, 300-350 mm Hg) or Fi<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of 0.21 (P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>, 90-110 mm Hg). They showed that reoxygenation-induced depletion of antioxidants was significantly reduced by initiating CPB at lower Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>. These clinical reports as well as our experimental findings clearly document the following: (1) the crucial importance of initial level of Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> in determining the magnitude of injury and (2) the need to assess oxygenation status by Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> (not by Fi<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>) in order to reliably achieve reduction in reoxygenation injury. The membrane oxygenators currently in use are so efficient that oxygen concentration of less than 21% is required to achieve a Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of 80 to 100 mm Hg in the CPB prime. This can be achieved by means of delivery of nitrogen to the oxygenator. Toraman et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135112438449">12</xref>
</sup> pointed out that precise and flexible adjustment of oxygen fraction is essential to avoid hyperoxemia during CPB, which depends upon the interaction between oxygenator performance and the patient’s body surface area. They recommended that Fi<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> can be kept at 0.35 during CPB and increased to 0.45 during warming, in routine practice.</p>
<p>More recently, Zhu et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135112438449">13</xref>
</sup> performed a randomized study in 20 patients with cyanosis to evaluate the potential benefit of the graded reoxygenation. The investigational protocol was similar to the approach of Allen (CPB was primed and initiated at Fi<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of 0.21 and the Fi<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> was increased slowly to 30%-60% over the next five to ten minutes). This was compared with a standard hyperoxic CPB protocol. They showed that the graded reoxygenation protocol was associated with significantly less reoxygenation-induced injury (on the basis of levels of troponin I and MDA as well as S100 as a marker for brain damage). These beneficial effects observed by Zhu et al may be attributable to both “graded” fashion of reoxygenation and more physiological level of P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> throughout CPB in comparison with the hyperoxemic group, because final Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> was also substantially lower in the graded reoxygenation group than in hyperoxemic group.</p>
<p>Although this gradual reoxygenation is an easy, effective, and safe strategy, we speculate that the absolute level of Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> that is reached may matter more than the mode of gradual increase in Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> itself, since our earlier experimental study also showed that the benefits of simple gradual reoxygenation was nullified if Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> reached substantial hyperoxia thereafter.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135112438449">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Using a modified protocol that included both gradual reoxygenation and lowering of initial Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>, we observed further avoidance of injury. In this protocol, controlled cardiac reoxygenation (whereby CPB is started using either a hypoxic or a normoxemic prime) is combined with delayed reoxygenation until the heart has been perfused with a normoxemic blood cardioplegia solution.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135112438449">8</xref>
</sup> The salutary effects of initiating hypoxic CPB include offsetting reoxygenation injury by delaying reintroduction of oxygen until cardiac arrest, in combination with the benefits of lowering Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> at the initiation of blood cardioplegic arrest and thereafter. We speculated that several aspects of controlled cardiac reoxygenation together with cardioplegic arrest markedly limited injury, including: (1) limiting energy demand to facilitate normalization of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>concentration, improving Na<sup>+</sup>–Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange, (2) hypocalemia-induced inactivation of phospholipases and decreased release of reactive oxygen species via arachidonic acid and xanthine oxidase pathways and (3) limiting Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin and pH-dependent nitric oxide (NO) synthase activation. The importance of initiating reoxygenation in the normothermically arrested state is underscored by the finding that reoxygenation hypercontraction and sarcolemmal disruption can be prevented by temporary contractile blockade to reestablish normal cytosolic calcium control.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135112438449">14</xref>
</sup> Caputo et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135112438449">15</xref>
</sup> noted the critical importance of strictly controlling initial Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> and suggested the validity of the concept of “controlled reoxygenation.” They demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial with 67 patients with cyanosis (aged 6-49 months) that controlled reoxygenation on initiation of CPB by normoxic CPB (normoxemic for the patient, ie,  Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> 50-80 mm Hg in patients with cyanosis) significantly reduced reoxygenation injury, characterized by reduced 8-isoprostane (as an oxidant stress), myocardial troponin I, protein S100 (as a cerebral injury), and α-glutamate transferase (as a hepatic injury) in comparison with a hyperoxic CPB group (P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>: 150-180 mm Hg). It is noteworthy that the predominant fraction of perioperative troponin I release occurred after reperfusion, which was significantly reduced by lowering initial level of Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>, and that the controlled reoxygenation was associated with 40% reduction in troponin I release at 30 minutes on CPB and 38% reduction at ten minutes after CPB, signifying the clinical importance of reoxygenation injury contributing to overall CPB-induced myocardial damage. The perfusion strategy of keeping Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> as close as possible to the patient’s preoperative values will require addition of a nitrogen gas mixture to the oxygenator in order to reduce the Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of the prime fluid to less than 100 mm Hg and careful blood gas management using an in-line Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> monitor. This strategy, while somewhat complicated, could be incorporated at no additional risk into the operative management.</p>
<p>In this issue of the <italic>World Journal of Pediatric Congenital Heart Surgery</italic>, Babu and his associates documented the results from a randomized trial in 31 patients with cyanosis to test the benefit of the strategy of gradual reoxygenation, where Fi<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> was gradually increased from 0.21 to 0.6 over five minutes following the onset of CPB. This protocol was modified from the previously described method by Zhu et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135112438449">13</xref>
</sup> to shorten the duration for a gradual increase in Fi<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>from ten to five minutes because of the author’s concern about organ dysfunction (ie, brain) induced by hypoxic perfusion. However, this concern may not be valid and clinically important, since CPB perfusion at Fi<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of 0.21 does not usually cause hypoxemia, and Zhu et al noted the safety of normoxemic CPB management (Fi<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> 0.21-0.6) with evidence of sustained normal cerebral aerobic metabolism assessed by cerebral oxygenated hemoglobin and oxidized cytochrome aa3 by near-infrared spectroscopy. Surprisingly enough, Babu et al showed significant decrease in the levels of CK-MB (creatine kinase-cardiac muscle isoenzyme) in the intervention group compared with the control group (62.44 vs 88.73 µ/L) even with a brief period of controlling Fi<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> (ie, five minutes) which resulted in minimal difference in Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> at five minute of CPB (229.85 vs 256.38 mm Hg). They used a single Fi<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> management protocol thereafter, whereby Fi<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> was adjusted to maintain Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> between 200 and 300 mm Hg in both groups. Therefore, this clinically important study may provide persuasive evidence of true benefits of a brief period of gradual reoxygenation per se, without more physiological normoxemic management throughout CPB, although no statistical difference was noted in postoperative outcome. This may coincide with our experimental findings of the critical importance of control of Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> in the initial five minutes.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Modi et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135112438449">11</xref>
</sup> demonstrated that the myocardial release of troponin I induced by abrupt reoxygenation lasts for at least 30 minutes after the onset of hyperoxemic CPB, signifying an ongoing process of hyperoxia-induced injury. Therefore, it will be conceivable to speculate that a longer duration of intervention to lower P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> results in more pronounced protection.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the authors did not describe the absolute values of Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> during the initial five minutes, especially the Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of the CPB prime and the Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> at the time of application of the aortic cross-clamp, which may determine the extent of delaying reoxgenation process until cardioplegic arrest. They documented that in group A (intervention), 46% of patients underwent cross-clamp before five minutes, where full oxygenation was not completed at the induction of cardiac arrest. This means that myocardial protection against reoxygenation in some patients may be attributable to the effects from “controlled reoxygenation” in addition to lowering absolute Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>. Subanalysis depending on the Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> at the time of aortic clamping and administration of blood cardioplegia solution would be of interest and could provide clarification.</p>
<p>Although hyperoxemic CPB is still a routine clinical practice in many countries, it is likely never needed, because a Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of 400 to 500 mm Hg confers only a negligible increase in oxygen content compared with a Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of 100 to 150 mm Hg. So there is no reason for persisting in maintaining physiologically high Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>. Routine use of normoxemic management during CPB is strongly recommended. Regardless of the presence of cyanosis, there is a growing body of evidence of detrimental effects of hyperoxemic CPB, which include an impairment of glucose regulation and transport in the newborn leading to hyperoxia-induced hyperglycemia<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135112438449">16</xref>
</sup> and impairment of peripheral perfusion and skeletal muscle tissue oxygenation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150135112438449">17</xref>
</sup> Normoxic CPB management has been proved to be less detrimental and beneficial for organ protection in adult open heart surgery as well.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150135112438449">18</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, normoxemic reoxygenation by carefully controlling Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> during initial reperfusion after cardioplegic arrest has been shown to attenuate cardiac dysfunction and limit ischemia reperfusion injury, clinically and experimentally.<sup>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Despite a growing body of experimental and clinical findings verifying the existence of reoxygenation injury, many surgeons may still believe that this is an unimportant injury, and of little clinical significance, because of lack of data verifying impaired cardiac function and of biochemical parameters closely correlating with poor surgical outcome attributable to reoxygenation injury. Nevertheless, recent randomized clinical trials evaluating strategies to reduce reoxygenation injury provide persuasive evidence of the clinical relevance of this injury by showing that the modalities to regulate or control the initial oxygenation process can reduce biochemical multiorgan damage including myocardium, lung, liver, and brain after open heart surgery in patients with cyanosis. In future, a well-organized randomized clinical trial with larger volume, appropriate stratification by age and degree of preoperative cyanosis and with more sensitive methodology to assess ventricular performance will be essential to clarify the true role of this surgical injury and the validity of therapeutic modalities designed to reduce reoxygenation injury.</p>
