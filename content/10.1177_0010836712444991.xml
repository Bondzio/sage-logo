<abstract>
<p>What impact does the way a civil war is terminated have on the post-conflict democratization process? This study analyses whether certain types of conflict termination are positive for post-conflict levels of democracy. It is argued that negotiated settlements, being at large more cooperative, are more conducive for democratization than truces or military victories. Stabilizing measures rarely leave possibilities for contestation of elites and thus few incentives to open up post-war society. The empirics reveal that negotiated settlements are the best way to end a conflict if democracy is to develop in its aftermath.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the end of the Cold War, an increasing proportion of intrastate conflicts have been terminated through negotiated settlements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010836712444991">Höglund and Söderberg Kovacs, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010836712444991">Kreutz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010836712444991">Toft, 2010a</xref>). However, recent studies have questioned the possibility of negotiated settlements producing security and democratization following the termination of civil war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010836712444991">Toft, 2010a</xref>). While conflict termination refers to the cessation of armed violence, ‘successful’ resolution goes beyond the lack of gunfire. Increased levels of democracy after a civil war could be one way of reaching beyond a merely negative definition of peace. Democracy as such permits conflicts to be dealt with in a structured, rule-based, manner. It is a good way of ensuring that root causes of conflict, such as grievances, may be addressed without escalating into mass violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010836712444991">Jarstad and Sisk, 2008b</xref>). Increasing the levels of democracy in the aftermath of civil war is thus a way of promoting non-violent conflict management where grievances may be addressed and oppression can be transformed by peaceful means.</p>
<p>Yet, in the research of war and peace, peace is ‘often treated as an afterthought or a control condition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0010836712444991">Klein et al., 2008</xref>: 67). There is a strong focus on achieving a durable termination of the fighting but less attention has been spent on the quality of the following peace. While there is an increasing number of large-N studies on the durability of peace (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0010836712444991">Fortna, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010836712444991">2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010836712444991">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010836712444991">Jarstad and Nilsson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010836712444991">Mukherjee, 2006</xref>), there is not as much systematic research done on the topic of post-civil war democratization. Those studies that have been done are not in agreement on how democratization is affected by the way the conflict was resolved.</p>
<p>Democratization and the creation of durable peace are often simultaneous, but different, processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010836712444991">Jarstad, 2008a</xref>). Aspects considered positive for peace have been shown to be negative for democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010836712444991">Fortna, 2008</xref>). While some scholars argue that the creation of stability yields good grounds for democracy to grow (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010836712444991">Fortna, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010836712444991">Toft, 2010a</xref>), others see development of cooperative mechanisms as more important for the promotion of democratic growth (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010836712444991">Hartzell and Bohrer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010836712444991">Gurses and Mason, 2008</xref>). Increased research on how peace is affected by the termination of civil war needs to be appended with similar research on post-civil war democracy.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to investigate the impact that the type of termination of intrastate conflict has upon the level of democracy in post-civil war societies. It is argued that negotiated settlements are more conducive to creating a positive democratic development following civil war settlement than are military victories or truces. It uses a new set of data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010836712444991">Coppedge et al. (2008)</xref> where democracy is measured by two aspects – contestation and inclusiveness – resembling Robert Dahl’s <italic>Polyarchy</italic>. Separating the measurement of democracy into contestation and inclusiveness leaves broader implications than using commonly used indexes for measuring democracy, which often rely more on one or the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010836712444991">Coppedge et al., 2008</xref>). Dividing civil war settlements into negotiated outcomes, truces and military victories, the results reveal that negotiated settlements see much higher levels of post-civil war democratization than other types of conflict outcomes. Military victories perform even worse than truces when all post-civil war cases are looked at. Looking at cases where peace lasts at least two years, negotiated settlements still outscore the other two types of outcome, while it is no longer possible to distinguish one or the other as better.</p>
<p>The article continues with a summary of the literature on post-civil war democratization. This is complemented by an introduction to <italic>Polyarchy</italic> and a theoretical argument of what impact the type of termination will have on post-civil war levels of democracy. A total of 90 cases of conflict termination, between 1951 and 1995, are then examined through regression analysis.</p>

<title>Post-war democratization</title>
<p>There is a gap between the research on peace-building and civil war termination on one side and the democratization research on the other. Though peace and democratization after civil war are often initiated as a simultaneous process, research on the subject is not intertwined to the same degree. Recent literature has given attention to the lack of research on the relationship between civil wars and post-war level of democracy with differing results (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010836712444991">Fortna, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010836712444991">Gurses and Mason, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010836712444991">Hartzell and Bohrer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010836712444991">Jarstad and Sisk, 2008a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0010836712444991">1</xref></sup> One of the reasons for this could be that post-conflict transition is seemingly faced with a series of dilemmas where peace-building and democratization, rather than complementing each other, may prove to work as opposites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010836712444991">Jarstad and Sisk, 2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>What, then, is post-war democratization and in what way does it differ from ‘regular’ democratization? Similar to a revolution, the termination of an intrastate conflict will constitute a severe alteration to the way a country is governed before the conflict ended, establishing a new ‘game’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0010836712444991">Fortna, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010836712444991">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010836712444991">Mukherjee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010836712444991">Jarstad and Nilsson, 2008</xref>). Contrary to ‘regular’ democratization where an authoritarian regime is overthrown by a growing amount of political opponents, the opponents (rebels) in intrastate conflicts do not per definition have a normative commitment to democratization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010836712444991">Wantchekon, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, democracy, and democratization, holds elements of conflict where the opening of contestation permits people to compete for elected positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010836712444991">Jarstad, 2008a</xref>). Post-conflict democratization is not the least a matter of achieving public accountability for former – often continuously in power – warlords (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010836712444991">Wantchekon, 2004</xref>). One general assumption in research on post-civil war democratization is the need for external help in order to monitor elections to ensure that election results are respected, etc. (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0010836712444991">Wantchekon and Neeman, 2002</xref>). No matter if elites, masses or institutions are in focus, who participates in the democratization process is of utmost importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010836712444991">Wright, 2008</xref>). While the intention of democracy may be to put as much of the power as possible in the hands of the peoples, ‘the people’s involvement in its creation might be very limited’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0010836712444991">Wantchekon &amp; Neeman, 2002</xref>: 440).</p>
<p>Contrary to ‘regular’ literature on democratization (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010836712444991">Hartzell and Bohrer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010836712444991">Linz and Stepan, 1996</xref>), consolidation of democracy is often neglected in the post-civil war democratization literature. This article is no exception, but it is worth pointing out that here democratization refers primarily to positive change in the level of democracy in a country. It is therefore possible to assess changes that occur without presupposing the democracy to be consolidated or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010836712444991">Gurses and Mason, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0010836712444991">2</xref></sup> Thus the civil war ending’s short-term effect on society, whether it becomes open to the possibility of addressing grievances, rather than the consolidation of democracy is in focus.</p>

<title>Democratization and polyarchy</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Given a regime in which the opponents of the government cannot openly and legally organize into political parties in order to oppose the government in free and fair elections, what conditions factor or impede a transformation into a regime in which they can? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010836712444991">Dahl, 1971</xref>: 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Robert Dahl’s ideal type of democracy, Polyarchy, is based on the idea ‘that “positive” government owe[s] something to its citizens’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010836712444991">Apter, 1988</xref>: 205). Polyarchy is more related to grading the failure of achieving full democracy than to a comparison between ‘full’ democratic states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010836712444991">Coppedge and Reinicke, 1990</xref>). The ideal is defined by guarantees such as freedom of organization, the right to vote in free and fair elections and the ‘availability of alternative sources of information’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010836712444991">Coppedge et al., 2008</xref>: 633). These guarantees can be lined up on two separate, but related, dimensions; contestation and inclusiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010836712444991">Coppedge et al., 2008</xref>), which have also been referred to as competition and suffrage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010836712444991">Dahl, 1971</xref>).</p>
<p>The timing of when to hold elections is a complex matter in post-civil war societies. Some literature has pointed to the dangers associated with the holding of elections, not the least in relation to emergence or re-emergence of political violence. However, elections are indeed an important mechanism of dealing with the tensions of societies and may serve as a reference to the acceptance of the conflict outcome by the peoples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0010836712444991">Reilly, 2008</xref>). Low levels of participation and limitations in suffrage rights, e.g. by exclusion of women, reduces the level of inclusiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010836712444991">Coppedge et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As for the second aspect regulating the level of political competition in a country, contestation, it is more concerned with the ability to contest the ruling elite. Availability of information, the formation of parties allowed to compete in free elections and independence of the judiciary are important aspects of contestation. Limitations in any of these will result in lower levels of contestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010836712444991">Coppedge et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>An increase in inclusiveness has more to do with a single event, while contestation is built up over time. Increases in contestation should theoretically put such a strain on the system that elections follow shortly thereafter. Dahl would argue that open contestation among elites leads to greater responsiveness to the needs of the masses than a single act of mass elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010836712444991">Krouse, 1982</xref>). Rather than constitutional arrangements for the responsibilities of the government, it is the transformation, or existence, of social prerequisites where leaders act in response to the needs and wishes of their constituents that is the focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010836712444991">Lee, 1991</xref>). Merely opening up for election, while keeping the possibility of contestation low, is unlikely to bring future openness. With little tolerance in the world today for limitations in suffrage rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010836712444991">Wright, 2008</xref>), Polyarchy, however adds an important aspect which is that it takes more than only the holding of elections for a democracy to grow.</p>

<title>Type of outcome and democratization</title>
<p>Though there are several different ways for conflicts to end (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010836712444991">Wallensteen, 2007</xref>), the three most common can be categorized into (1) negotiated settlements, (2) military victories, and (3) truces or stalemates where no decisive victory, nor a formal settlement to end the conflict, is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010836712444991">Doyle and Sambanis, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010836712444991">Gurses and Mason (2008)</xref> claim that negotiated settlement is the most conducive type of conflict outcome to spur democracy. In their view, the game that made up the conflict is continued in the post-termination period where possible power gains, through the democratic structures, are constantly weighted against the possible gains through use of force. Part of the argument is derived from the idea that parties coming out of negotiation are, by then, aware of each other’s capacity. Victors would thus be unlikely to promote democratic development since such development would enhance the likeliness of losing the power they already hold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010836712444991">Gurses and Mason, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010836712444991">Bohrer and Hartzell (2005)</xref> make similar claims, finding that negotiated settlements are more likely to end up with more democratic outcomes than those wars that ended in a decisive victory for any party.</p>
<p>Among scholars who argue that victory would enhance the likelihood of long-term peace and democratization, stability is a common denominator. The undisputed power that a victor gains following conflict produces a dominant actor which, lacking strong opposition, faces small fears of being defeated politically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010836712444991">Fortna, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010836712444991">Toft, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010836712444991">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010836712444991">2003</xref>). Similar claims can be found in the literature on foreign imposed democratic regimes, where democracy is thought to develop after the conflict has been terminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010836712444991">Enterline and Grieg, 2008</xref>). The debate on the impact of different types of outcomes on post-civil war democratization is thus also a debate on the importance of cooperation versus stability. It is pretty much agreed that both victories and negotiated settlements can alter the game that made up the conflict; the question is which is more likely to spur a more open society after the conflict ended?</p>
<p>This article argues that negotiation processes contain mechanisms that make it more likely for former adversaries to continue using non-violent conflict management also after a negotiated settlement has been reached. This runs contrary to, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010836712444991">Toft (2010a)</xref>, who claims that the stabilizing effect of victories has a more positive impact. Looking at the processes that lead up to a negotiated settlement it is commonly understood that negotiation, just as armed conflict, is a means for parties to measure their comparative strength and decide about the distribution of the conflict issue. Situations are seldom as clear-cut as in theory; negotiations may occur in cases that finally have an undisputed victor and power is not necessarily balanced just because there was a negotiated settlement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010836712444991">Fearon and Laitin, 2008</xref>). There may also be different types of power-sharing arrangements between former adversaries, even though one of them comes out victoriously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010836712444991">Mukherjee, 2006</xref>). Power-sharing as such does not lead to a process of democratization; rather the contrary has been argued (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010836712444991">Jarstad, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010836712444991">Söderberg Kovacs, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0010836712444991">Wantchekon and Neeman, 2002</xref>). Some power-sharing arrangements have had the effect of ‘freezing’ the relationship between the former warring parties, thus not allowing for ‘new’ groups to enter the political arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010836712444991">Söderberg Kovacs, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0010836712444991">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>From bargaining theory we can learn the importance that the processes of negotiation play in a settlement being reached. While mutually hurting stalemates may draw the parties to start negotiations (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0010836712444991">Zartman and Touval, 2007</xref>), a resolution to the conflict is rarely met if there are not also mutually enticing opportunities for those involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010836712444991">Pruitt, 2005</xref>). Finding these mutually enticing opportunities and fostering a belief among the parties that an agreement will be followed often takes a lot of time and requires the breaking of stereotypes that have been built up during the armed conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010836712444991">Jönsson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010836712444991">Kremenyuk, 2005</xref>). This is not only true for the elites sitting at the negotiation table, but also for the general public.</p>
<p>In accordance with the thoughts of, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0010836712444991">Putnam (1988)</xref>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0010836712444991">4</xref></sup> an agreement between two adversaries also needs to be grounded in the groups’ internal structures and constituencies. In order to become a success, a negotiated settlement needs to be followed by a process where constituencies are prepared to accept the former opponents as legitimate partners, or at least trustworthy enough in order to take part in forming the future of the nation. A serious and committed negotiator will thus not allow for an outcome that falls outside what is acceptable to his party or constituents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0010836712444991">5</xref></sup> Secret negotiations that result in more or less shock-therapy peace agreements, such as the Oslo Accords, may seriously complicate the following peace process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010836712444991">Aggestam, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>It is the process, i.e. the time-span, the relatively open cooperation between adversaries and continuity of negotiations, that is believed to be a strength for the possibility of a future democratization. Just as this process may have started long before the first high-profile official meeting (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0010836712444991">Zartman, 1989</xref>), one should realize that there is likely to be a post-negotiation phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010836712444991">Jönsson and Tallberg, 1998</xref>). The post-agreement period entails re-negotiations; something that in essence is believed to be the same processes which account for the good performance of the negotiated outcomes in regard to post-civil war levels of democracy. In this period, agreements are followed by an implementation process aimed at decreasing fears through commitment and costly signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010836712444991">Jarstad and Nilsson, 2008</xref>). While war often promotes leaders acting less democratically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010836712444991">Hartzell and Bohrer, 2007</xref>), the establishment of post-conflict politics is nonetheless enhanced by the creation of relationships between former adversaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010836712444991">Saunders, 2005</xref>), which is important if they are to cooperate and act democratically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010836712444991">Bohrer and Hartzell, 2005</xref>). Thus:</p>
<list id="list1-0010836712444991" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Civil wars ending in a negotiated agreement see a higher increase in the level of democracy compared to truces and victories.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Truces share with negotiations the indecisiveness that some argue follows an outcome with no military victor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010836712444991">Fortna, 2008</xref>). However, they do not share the successful process of finding an agreement that those involved commit to work for once the guns have fallen silent. Allowing for increased contestation or inclusiveness, a government would decrease the incentives for an opposing party to take up arms again. The lack of a militarily stronger party also suggests that increased repression in political rights would make a costly war more likely. Mainly lacking the trust-building mechanisms, as well as the normalization of unarmed conflict management, it is not likely that countries where conflict was ended by a truce will fare as well as those ending by negotiated settlements in terms of increased levels of democracy. Before a hypothesis about the impact stalemates may have, however, it is important to further scrutinize the impact of military victories.</p>
<p>Underlying the claim of a positive impact of military victories on post-conflict democratization is the assumption that democracy, and democratization, in itself contains mechanisms of conflict (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010836712444991">Cederman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010836712444991">Hippler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010836712444991">Mansfield and Snyder, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010836712444991">Wright, 2008</xref>). However, a victor, standing at least to some degree undisputed, would be able to control the path of democratization. Furthermore, it is argued that a winning rebel organization is likely to open up for democratization after civil war as a token of its good intentions towards the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010836712444991">Toft, 2010a</xref>). A government would also be logically interested in a controlled democratization process after victory. There is little risk of major challengers having been silent during the civil unrest. Thus the opening up for minor contestation would contain a fairly low cost and be a much better alternative than risking renewed rebellion due to repression.</p>
<p>The claim of this article, however, is that the lack of concessions in military victories and the likely lack of trust between former adversaries and future opposition makes it unlikely a fairly undisputed ruler will open up for democratic competition. Following stalemates, where both parties have realized their incapability to militarily defeat the opponent, at least for the moment, coexistence without grave repression must exist if conflict is to remain afar. In the case of military victories, however, the return to conflict may in itself be so unlikely that there are no immediate reasons for democratization.</p>
<p>Threat of conflict would in that case be a force that, to some degree, pushes democratization forward. In the case of negotiations some, at least minimal, concessions and cooperation have already taken place. This would, as the first hypothesis stated, make conflicts ending with negotiated settlements prone to democratization in the aftermath. Victories, on the other hand, fall on the opposite side of the spectrum and truces somewhere between. Thus truces seem more likely to develop positively compared to decisive victories, leading to hypothesis 2a and 2b:</p>

<title>Data and design</title>
<p>Civil war termination is the unit of analysis and is defined simply as the inability to fulfil the criteria for a civil war. A civil war is recorded as starting the first year it causes at least 500 deaths or if at least 1000 deaths are caused cumulatively over a three-year period. It remains ongoing as long as there is no three-year period within which it causes fewer than 500 deaths and no peace agreement, entailing at least 6 months of non-conflict or a decisive outcome is registered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0010836712444991">Sambanis, 2004</xref>). Most of the data used have been assembled from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010836712444991">Doyle and Sambanis’s (2006</xref>; henceforth referred to as DS2006 in the text) dataset.</p>
<p>The two dependent variables, <italic>Contestation</italic> and <italic>Inclusiveness</italic>, are from Coppedge et al.’s (2008) dataset, which contains individual scores for every country and year between 1950 and 2000. It was transformed into my dataset to equal the change in level of contestation and inclusiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0010836712444991">6</xref></sup> To observe the change in the variables, the score in the given year (two and five years after the conflict ended) was subtracted by the score one year prior to conflict termination. Lagging the end of the conflict by one year to some degree overcomes the problem of when in a year a conflict ended (see, further, note 15 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010836712444991">Fortna, 2008</xref>: 50). Both cases where war recurred, as well as cases where war did not return, are examined. Since the data on levels of democracy from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010836712444991">Coppedge et al. (2008)</xref> only included observations until year 2000, and the dependent variable is measured five years after the conflict ended, cases that had not ended in 1995 and those ending prior to 1951 were dropped.</p>
<p>The outcome, i.e. the change in the level of contestation and inclusiveness, respectively, is positive in 59% of the cases for contestation and 54% for inclusiveness two years out. Five years out the same figures are 71% for contestation and 54% for inclusiveness. Thus there are more cases that see positive change in the level of democracy after civil war, than those that see negative change. Mean values also show positive change, apart from inclusiveness two years out where the mean is slightly negative.</p>
<p>The first independent variable <italic>Type of Outcome</italic> is constructed by three dummy variables from the DS2006 dataset, reflecting the types of outcome; negotiated settlements, truces and victories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0010836712444991">7</xref></sup> There are 19 cases of negotiated settlements in the dataset, 15 truces or stalemates and 57 victories. Thirty-four of those conflicts were won by the government side while rebels won in the 23 remaining cases. The point of reference for the coming regressions is victories, either government or rebel.</p>
<p>While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010836712444991">Fortna (2008)</xref> did not find any significant correlation between peace-keeping and democratization, others have argued that the presence of peace-keepers has a positive impact on the process of democratization (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010836712444991">Doyle and Sambanis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010836712444991">Pickering and Peceny, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010836712444991">Bueno de Mesquita and Downs (2006)</xref>, however, claim that interventions, especially those of the UN, are bad for post-war democratic development. In order to account for the possible influence of peace-keeping, two control variables were added, one identifying presence of UN peace-keepers and another one identifying non-UN peace-keepers.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010836712444991">Doyle and Sambanis (2006)</xref> argue that the type of war, i.e. whether or not it was a war of ethnic character, may have an impact on the possibilities of trust between the former belligerents in the post-civil war society. The variable <italic>war type</italic> is included from the DS2006 dataset, which codes wars as ‘<italic>“ethnic” […] where patterns of rebel recruitment and alliance for all major factions […] follow ethnic lines</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010836712444991">Doyle and Sambanis, 2006</xref>: 82).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0010836712444991">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Relating to the type of war that has been fought is the <italic>war duration</italic> variable, which measures length of the war in months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010836712444991">Doyle and Sambanis, 2006</xref>). Longer-lasting wars are thought to be more likely to experience a stable post-war environment since the parties by then are tired of the extensive duration and thus more prone to accept any possible alternative in order to get a peaceful society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010836712444991">Nilsson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The number of factions that are directly involved in the fighting is argued to have an impact on the toughness of reaching an agreement to end the war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010836712444991">Doyle and Sambanis, 2006</xref>). In the same manner it can be argued that the more parties that take part in the fighting, the more parties will be interested in taking part in the political process afterwards. This is important, not the least since far from all peace processes are equally inclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010836712444991">Nilsson, 2006</xref>). Thus, a final variable relating to the type of war that was fought is <italic>factnum</italic>, which is the number of factions that took part in the fighting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010836712444991">Doyle and Sambanis, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010836712444991">Fortna (2008)</xref> found that pre-war experience of democracy is negative for the post-conflict process of democratization. The levels of contestation and inclusiveness before the war broke out were thus included in the regressions. This allows for investigation whether or not the level of democracy before the civil war broke out has an impact on the post-civil war levels.</p>
<p>The last control variable that is added to the regression is <italic>Peacend</italic>. The variable comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010836712444991">Doyle and Sambanis’s (2006)</xref> data and is a dichotomous variable scoring 1 if peace ends within two years following termination of the conflict. The variable thus takes into account the impact that failure of peace may have on level of democracy.</p>
<p>While other controls could have been included in a model that looks at changes in levels of democracy after civil war these variables have been decided on both because there are clear theoretical claims made for their possible impact on the post-conflict period, but also because they are measured before the post-conflict period begins. For example, economic growth could have been included in the models but such a measurement has the problem of being strongly affected by the independent variable. Furthermore, it has been argued that economic growth after civil war rather depends on the level of political stability and development than serving as a cause of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010836712444991">Flores and Nooruddin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Before the empirical section begins, it is important to discuss briefly a possible endogeneity problem with the models below. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010836712444991">Enterline and Grieg (2008)</xref> claim in their study on foreign imposed regime change that certain countries seem more amenable to adopt democratic regimes than do others. The big question is whether the same is true for negotiated settlements, and most importantly whether it is the same set of factors that make the factions more likely to end conflict via negotiations that are likely to ‘cause’ them to democratize.</p>
<p>The theoretical claims above state that rather than specific traits of the warring parties, it is the dynamics of the conflict which drives parties to enter into negotiations. Furthermore, in order to reach an agreement, parties have to engage in, at least, a minimum level of cooperation and start to build trust. Theoretically, endogeneity should thus not be a problem for this study. Many of the conflicts that have ended with negotiated settlements are also conflicts that went on for a long period of time, such as the conflicts in South Africa (1976–1994), La Violencia in Colombia (1948–1966) and Guatemala (1978–1994). Nicaragua, where a conflict ended with a Sandinista victory in 1979, saw almost a decade more of conflict with the Contras before a settlement was reached in 1990. In Guatemala and South Africa, the rights of all people were at the centre both of the conflict and in the resolution of it. Neither of these conflict actors would, at first glance, seem to have much more reason to seek negotiation, or for that sake democratize, than would, for example, the NRA in Uganda in the late 1980s. It seems unlikely that either of these countries would have had more reason than the others to believe that their opponent would, or would not, adhere to an agreement if met. However, including the control for the duration of conflict in my models I also cover the issue of endogeneity empirically.</p>

<p>Two immediate conclusions can be drawn from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010836712444991">Table 2</xref>. First of all, and in support of hypothesis 1, the regression results show that negotiated settlements and post-civil war democratization are positively and significantly correlated with each other. For both contestation and inclusiveness the coefficients are strong and significant compared to the results for military victories. This is in line with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010836712444991">Gurses and Mason (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010836712444991">Bohrer and Hartzell (2005)</xref> suggesting that negotiated resolutions to conflicts are better for positive democratic progress in the coming years.</p>
<p>Secondly, the result for truces is interesting as it suggests for inclusiveness that truces fare significantly better than military victories. For the level of contestation, the coefficients are still positive but not significant. Two important conclusions can be made from this result. First and foremost it shows that many conflicts ending without a victory or negotiated settlement see improvements in level of inclusiveness. This suggests that many of these countries hold elections in the years following the cessation of violence. A second conclusion becomes apparent when relating the result to that for negotiated outcomes, and that is how apparently dire the short-term democratic process is in countries where the conflict ended in a military victory for either part. The undemocratic leadership that is often promoted in wars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010836712444991">Hartzell and Bohrer, 2007</xref>) is thus seemingly not transformed as the war ends in countries where the leadership goes unchallenged. Victors choose, for one reason or another, to continuously base their legitimacy on their success on the battlefield rather than through popular support. This is not entirely the opposite of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010836712444991">Toft’s (2010a)</xref> argument that rebel victories are the most fertile grounds for establishing democracy, as her analysis stretches further in time. However, it clearly casts doubt on the argumentation if one also wishes to consider the quality of the time period before ‘success’ is achieved.</p>
<p>Looking at the control variables, the levels of contestation and inclusiveness before the conflict is negatively correlated with post-conflict levels. Similar to the impact that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010836712444991">Fortna (2008)</xref> found using Polity IV data, this suggests that countries with previous experience of democracy are less likely to openly embrace democratization in the aftermath of conflict. The largest difference is seen on the level of inclusiveness five years out, but one should not draw too big implications from these results. Two main reasons may underlie the results; first of all they could be interpreted as a sign that former democracies are unwilling to hold elections shortly after conflict is terminated. However, as the dependent variable measures the change in levels of contestation and inclusiveness they say little about the level that individual countries ‘started’ at. Thus, countries that already have institutionalized elections have a harder time increasing their level of inclusiveness compared to countries that have no such previous experience.</p>
<p>No other control variables show any significant results in the regression. There is little evidence to suggest that interventions create a fruitful basis for democratic development following civil war. Though there are positive coefficients for UN peace-keeping, there is no significant effect of these on the level of post-civil war democracy. For non-UN peace-keeping the results are even less encouraging. This follows in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010836712444991">Fortna’s (2008)</xref> claim that the positive and negative effects of peace-keeping on democratization cancel out any effect in either direction.</p>
<p>This article has so far focused on explaining post-civil war democratization in all peace processes. The results have revealed that negotiated settlements see far better results for post-civil war democratization than for victories. Parts of the literature presented earlier, however, would suggest that democratization after conflict is likely to increase the risk of conflict recurrence. In order to account for this, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010836712444991">Table 3</xref> looks at only those cases where peace lasted at least 2 years. Thirteen out of 19 cases that ended with a negotiated settlement had not returned to armed conflict two years out. The same figure for truces is 7 out of 14, while less than half, 21 out of 57, of the military victories were still peaceful 2 years after the victory. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010836712444991">Table 3</xref> is a replica of the model used in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010836712444991">Table 2</xref> but applied only to those cases where peace lasted a minimum of two years.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010836712444991">Table 3</xref> is similar to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010836712444991">Table 2</xref> when looking at the results. Negotiated settlements still perform much better than the other outcomes; however, truces and victories are no longer significantly different from each other. Two main reasons may be given for this finding; first of all, it is possible that the victories that saw the least positive democratic development returned to violence. On the other hand, it is also possible that truces, in line with theories about the importance of post-civil war stability, may have returned to violence in those cases where opposition was allowed. The even stronger result for negotiated settlements suggests that the latter reason is likely to be true, as the cleavage between negotiated settlements and victories has increased. It is also important to note that the difference is still very big five years after the conflict ended, suggesting that even if stabilization has the positive effect that some promote, it is not able to catch up to the positive impact of negotiated solutions even five years after the conflict is terminated. Looking closer at the control variables it is also noteworthy that the pre-conflict level of contestation is no longer significantly impacting the post-conflict levels. Both at two and five years after the conflict was ended the coefficients are positive. Impossible to differentiate from zero, however, one is not to make too much of an interpretation on the slope of the coefficient. It nonetheless further implies that the cases where post-conflict leadership did not open up for contestation are the same ones that saw a recurrence of war, at least compared to the pre-war levels.</p>
<p>The way in which the war was fought, such as ethnic dimensions or number of factions, has little, if any, impact on the following democratization process. This further strengthens the importance that the type of outcome has for democratization in the aftermath of civil war. The results also show that there is reason to question the idea that democratization necessitates stability, in the sense that military victories are suggested to create. By no means is there reason to interpret the findings as a sign that democratization per definition will increase the chances for peace within a country that emerges from intrastate conflict.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0010836712444991">9</xref></sup> However, increased levels of democracy are a sign that these countries have been able to build a more qualitative peace.</p>
<p>The weak performance of interventions, be they UN or otherwise, goes against the often argued claim that third parties are needed for democratization (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010836712444991">Jarstad and Sisk, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010836712444991">Wantchekon, 2004</xref>). At least it argues against any idea that peace-keeping presence would be directly positive for establishing democracy.</p>
<p>Looking at democracy on two dimensions, it is possible to identify the impact that previous experience of democracy has on post-conflict democratization. For inclusiveness, previous democratic experience seems to be negative for post-conflict democratization processes. For contestation, however, the same observation is no longer true when looking at the cases where peace lasted two or more years. In these cases, the post-conflict government seems to have been able to avert the negative impact that the civil war has on contestation.</p>
<p>Quantitative research on post-civil war democratization, and on the interaction between peace and democratization, is in need of further development. The section on previous research, as well as the hypotheses, built assumptions on the idea that negotiated settlement is a result of a process promoting cooperation. In light of the findings from the empirics, it is hard to argue against the seemingly positive impact that negotiated settlements have. However, it is important to scrutinize what, in negotiated settlements, explains this impact. Generally, considering the notion of negotiations there is reason to believe that, if quantifiable, knowledge of how things were agreed upon, rather than the agreement in itself, is important. To put it simply, the reasoning for why military victories are expected to have an impact, good or bad, on post-conflict scenarios is based on the process of winning, i.e. the depletion or surrender of the competitor, as much as the actual victory. In those cases, process and outcome become intertwined, though cases may differ with use of power-sharing deals and similar solutions to entice the loser to surrender. Thus far, available data on negotiated outcomes lack information on both process and distribution; quantitative research needs to attempt to answer the ‘why’ questions rather than the ‘if’ questions.</p>
<p>Perhaps, most of all, the findings suggest that there is reason to cast doubt on the often present interpretations of post-conflict politics as a continuation of the civil war by political means. Such a distributive, Clausewitzian, idea predestines negotiated settlements to instability and likely failure. A more procedural approach instead, where relations are in constant reconsideration and trust is possible, would be able to depict post-conflict political, as well as peace, developments. This also implies that it is important to focus analysis on the short-term period after conflict as well as the long-term period – not the least if one is to develop an understanding of the relationship between post-civil war democratization and the recurrence of violence.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The empirical findings reveal that the way in which conflicts end has an impact on the post-conflict democratization process. Negotiated settlements see an increase in levels of contestation and inclusiveness not only in the peaceful cases, but also when looking at all cases. Military victories, on the other hand, end up on the opposite side of the spectrum. That the results were similar in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010836712444991">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010836712444991">3</xref> show that there is more to the explanation of post-civil war democracy than merely success or failure of peace. Far from stating that democracy <italic>per se</italic> will bring peace, it suggests that while negotiated settlements are kept peaceful by increased political openness victories see the opposite process.</p>
<p>In a world where major powers seem disinclined to negotiate solutions with certain parties, these findings suggest that one should reconsider strongly the claims of some stability promoters. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010836712444991">Luttwak (1999)</xref>, but also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010836712444991">Toft (2010b)</xref>, suggested that there might be reason to the claim that wars are better left to be fought to the end. As there is no information in this analysis about what happens to the different countries after the five-year period of observation is ended, one should not rush to conclusions. However, it would be reasonable to interpret the findings as a sign that there is reason to continue research on how to terminate conflicts besides military victory.</p>
<p>Who is included in the power positions after civil war, but more importantly how they come to that position, has a decisive impact on the post-civil war process of democratization. Negotiations as such seem to entail a process which may increase the chances of parties opening up the political system in the first few years after the conflict ends. This becomes very clear when comparing the results for the change in level of democracy in countries where the conflict ends by negotiations, rather than truces or military victories. Comparing the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010836712444991">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010836712444991">3</xref> suggests that more research needs to be done on the relationship between democratization and durability of peace. If not just peace, but a quality peace, is to be achieved, reliance on the creation of stability cannot be the only focus for those that work for conflict termination; because even before the conflict is fully terminated, the structures of the post-conflict society are being sown.</p>

<p>While the liberal peace thesis (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0010836712444991">Paris, 2006</xref>) claimed that stabile democracies are unlikely to wage war on other stabile democracies, countries emerging from civil war are rarely to be considered stabile democracies. This article does not aspire to contribute to the literature on the democratic peace thesis, nor does it argue any immediate pacifying effects of post-civil war democratization. Instead, an increase in the level of democracy in post-conflict countries is seen as an increase in the quality of the peace that follows.</p></fn>
