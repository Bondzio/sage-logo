<abstract>
<p>In 1 Peter 5:1-5, instructions are given to the πρϵσβύτϵροι. But who are these elders and what does the author say about their role? This article starts with an exploration of the conceptual background of eldership, before focusing on the specific references to the term in verses 1 and 5 of our passage. Following this, we offer an in-depth exegetical analysis of the instruction to elders concerning their role in verses 2 and 3, before giving brief consideration in closing to the implications of verse 5.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>In a world where Christian leaders often operate like corporate CEOs, the church might benefit from listening again to Peter’s words<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0014524612448736">1</xref></sup> to the elders in the churches to which he wrote his first letter. Perhaps then we will better understand the task of leaders, a task which may be expressed differently in each generation, yet the essence of which does not change.</p>
<p>This article proposes first to explore the identity of the πρϵσβύτϵροι referred to in 1 Peter 5:1-5, considering the term’s background, its context and also examining how the reference to νϵώτϵροι might illuminate its meaning. Secondly, the role of the πρϵσβύτϵροι will be assessed: what does it mean to shepherd the flock and what is the background to this imagery; what do the remainder of 5:2-3 suggest about the elders’ task; and does 5:5 further elucidate how elders must act?</p>

<title>2.1 Background to the concept of ‘elders’</title>
<p>Πρϵσβυτέροι, the comparative of πρϵσβύς, here used substantivally,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0014524612448736">2</xref></sup> may refer in 5:1 and 5:5 either to those who were simply chronologically older or to ‘elders’ functioning as ‘community leaders’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0014524612448736">3</xref></sup> (that is, those who due to ‘their seniority…help to form…(community) opinions and direct its affairs’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0014524612448736">4</xref></sup> The latter use originates in the third century BC when the Septuagint employs it to describe leaders in ancient Israel (Ex. 24:1); it is also used of religious leaders in Maccabean times (1 Macc. 14:20) and of Jewish leaders in Mk. 15:1.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0014524612448736">5</xref></sup> A few see the Qumran měbaqqēr as a model for Christian elders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0014524612448736">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Elliott comments that ‘leadership by elders is well attested for the Christian communities of Asia Minor in particular’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0014524612448736">7</xref></sup> Elders are mentioned in Acts 14:23; 20:17-18; 1 Timothy 5:1-2, 17, 19; Titus 1:5; 1 Clement; Polycarp’s letter to the Philippians; and the letters of Ignatius.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0014524612448736">8</xref></sup> Goppelt perceived Christian elders to be holders of an office ‘taken over from…the synagogue’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0014524612448736">9</xref></sup> as did Kirk who further believed the office originated from delegation from the apostles and episcopate<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0014524612448736">10</xref></sup> and Lightfoot who treated eldership as an office identical to that of overseers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0014524612448736">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet elders also served as ‘community functionaries’ in the Hellenistic world;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0014524612448736">12</xref></sup> it therefore seems that the concept of Christian elders did not derive solely from the synagogue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0014524612448736">13</xref></sup> Thus, Campbell’s contention is that Christian eldership developed from both Jewish and Graeco-Roman models; denying that elders were office-holders, he portrays them as ‘the senior men of the community, heads of the leading families’. Eldership ‘does not so much denote an office as connote prestige. The holders of office may be included, but the word is a sign that prestige in the community is not confined to such people’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0014524612448736">14</xref></sup> It ‘is a collective term of honour’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0014524612448736">15</xref></sup> One thus ‘cannot appoint…anyone…to be (an) elder’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0014524612448736">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Elders, then, may have included apostles and overseers but ‘we do not know who is referred to by the term…unless we know the context’:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0014524612448736">17</xref></sup> we can simply say that it is from elders’ ranks that church office-holders were drawn.</p>
<p>This has been accepted by Jobes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0014524612448736">18</xref></sup> and Elliott;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0014524612448736">19</xref></sup> Beckwith appears to reject Campbell’s thesis,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0014524612448736">20</xref></sup> albeit not engaging fully with him. Campbell’s claims seem plausible; whilst full assessment of them is precluded by space constraints, perhaps analysis of the πρϵσβύτϵροι in context may assist in exploring their identity in 1 Peter 5:1-5.</p>

<sec id="section4-0014524612448736">
<title>2.2 Πρϵσβύτϵροι in 5:1</title>
<p>Most commentators seem agreed that the πρϵσβύτϵροι in 5:1 are community leaders rather than only being chronologically older,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0014524612448736">21</xref></sup> mainly because of the subsequent instructions to them to ‘shepherd…exercising oversight’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0014524612448736">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whilst, as we have seen, elders were often chronologically older, this was not always the case: because Jewish and Hellenistic elders’ authority ‘did not rest on age alone’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0014524612448736">23</xref></sup> it seems likely that over time these Christian elders may have encompassed not only those who were chronologically older but also those who were older ‘in faith’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0014524612448736">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 5:1, Michaels translates the absence of article before πρϵσβύτϵρους as ‘any elders’, arguing that Peter thus does not assume that every community to which he writes is governed by elders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0014524612448736">25</xref></sup> Davids agrees that Michaels’ translation is defensible but declares his conclusion unwarranted, on the basis that 5:5 ‘uses an identical anarthrous construction to refer to “younger people”, certainly without implying that some churches had none’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0014524612448736">26</xref></sup> Davids’ approach seems preferable for the reason he gives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0014524612448736">27</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section5-0014524612448736">
<title>Peter the elder</title>
<p>Peter also considers himself an elder, designating himself συμπρϵσβύτϵρος (‘fellow-elder’). This term, ‘elsewhere unattested in ancient literature’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0014524612448736">28</xref></sup> is a ‘refusal of special privilege…locating (Peter)…as an elder alongside other elders’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0014524612448736">29</xref></sup> rather than claiming his apostolic office. Jobes suggests that ‘the definite article combined with the preposition <italic>sym-</italic>…may be understood as a possessive, “your fellow-”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0014524612448736">30</xref></sup> Even if this is overstated, Peter, at a minimum, ‘indicates his solidarity with those whom he exhorts, making them aware that their ministry…is an extension of his own’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0014524612448736">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Peter’s continuing self-description in 5:1, with its Granville-Sharp construction, links his identity as an elder with his witnessing of Christ’s sufferings; he also bases his self-understanding in his sharing in the glory to be revealed. Further exploration of these assertions is, however, beyond our present remit.</p>

<sec id="section6-0014524612448736">
<title>2.3 Who are the πρϵσβύτϵροι in 5:5 and does the identity of the νϵώτϵροι influence this decision?</title>
<p>It seems clear presently that the πρϵσβύτϵροι in 5:1 comprise Peter and those in the churches acting as leaders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0014524612448736">32</xref></sup> However, the reappearance in 5:5 of this term in close proximity to νϵώτϵροι has caused some to suggest it has a different meaning in 5:5 from 5:1. This is because νϵώτϵροι means, <italic>prima facie</italic>, ‘the young(er) ones’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0014524612448736">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>If νϵώτϵροι refers to the chronologically younger people, one might then have grounds to argue that πρϵσβύτϵροι in 5:5 also refers to chronological age (not community leaders as in 5:1). Selwyn takes this approach,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0014524612448736">34</xref></sup> as does Kelly, who (attempting to explain such a disparity of meaning between the references to πρϵσβύτϵροι in 5:1 and 5:5) suggests that 5:5a is a fragment detached from the traditional community code of 2:13-3:19 and transferred here by Peter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0014524612448736">35</xref></sup> Kelly does not clarify why Peter might have moved this material and his suggestion does not offer justification for his translation choice.</p>
<p>In the light of the impact its translation might have on how πρϵσβύτϵροι is understood, νϵώτϵροι has been variously regarded as referring not only to the chronologically young, but alternatively to ‘those who were not elders, that is…all the other church members’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0014524612448736">36</xref></sup> minor officials,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0014524612448736">37</xref></sup> or the recently converted or baptised.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0014524612448736">38</xref></sup> Whilst Elliott argues persuasively for the latter, Michaels understands νϵώτϵροι as denoting all who were not elders,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0014524612448736">39</xref></sup> as do Jobes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0014524612448736">40</xref></sup> and Green, who perceives that this ‘makes sense of the division of “all of you” (verse 5b) into two subgroups: “elders”…and “younger ones”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0014524612448736">41</xref></sup> Determining the exact sense of νϵώτϵροι exceeds this article’s remit, save insofar as it illuminates πρϵσβύτϵροι in 5:5; analysis thusfar suggests that since 5:5 does not seem automatically to require that νϵώτϵροι means those younger in age, this occurrence of πρϵσβύτϵροι need not necessarily refer to age either.</p>
<p>It seems reasonable, then, on the basis of their proximity to assume that πρϵσβύτϵροι signifies the same in both 5:1 and 5:5, with νϵώτϵροι in 5:5 denoting those ‘younger’ than the πρϵσβύτϵροι in faith, maturity or authority (and perhaps, but not necessarily, age). Jobes agrees with the former assumption;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0014524612448736">42</xref></sup> Michaels suggests that those described in 5:1 would, in any event, have been chronologically older,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0014524612448736">43</xref></sup> thus evading the issue.</p>

<title>2.4 Summary</title>
<p>Who, then, are the elders in 1 Peter 5:1-5? It is proposed that they are those operating as leaders within the Christian communities to which Peter writes. The concept of eldership probably derived both from Jewish and Hellenistic contexts, in which elders had influence dependent upon community status. Whilst such elders might usually be chronologically older, this was not necessarily the case: authority rested on the prestige of the family of which the elder was head and upon being one ‘to whom respect can be given’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0014524612448736">44</xref></sup> This may have led the church to focus eventually on seniority in the faith (a Christian form of ‘prestige’ and basis for respect?) over chronological age.</p>
<p>The elders in question may have been office-holders of some kind, suggested by the subsequent description of their role in 5:2-3 and, specifically, Peter’s command to ‘shepherd’ their ‘κλήρων’ ‘by exercising oversight’. However, if we accept that eldership was not itself an office, it is not possible (without certainty regarding the letter’s date and authorship) to ascertain these elders’ exact office/title.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0014524612448736">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>The collective nature of the term emphasises that leadership ‘is not to be exercised in isolation or without consultation’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0014524612448736">46</xref></sup> The term also connotes influence and ‘power based in relationships…rather than…appointment’;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0014524612448736">47</xref></sup> it is submitted that Peter’s willingness in 5:1 not to employ his apostolic designation but to identify himself as a ‘fellow-elder’ may be indicative of such emphasis on influence over office, and his self-designation must surely challenge any contemporary church leaders who rely more upon title than earning the respect of their community (a theme revisited at <bold>3.3</bold> and <bold>3.4</bold>).</p>

<sec id="section8-0014524612448736">
<title>3. What is their role?</title>
<p>5:2-3 is a composite instruction to elders concerning their role, each component of which will be analysed before synthesising these findings.</p>
<sec id="section9-0014524612448736">
<title>3.1 Shepherding, the flock and Jesus as Chief Shepherd</title>
<p>The first part of Peter’s instruction appears in 5:2, using shepherding imagery: ποιμάνατϵ τὸ ἐν ὑμῖν ποίμνιον τοῦ θϵοῦ.</p>
<sec id="section10-0014524612448736">
<title>Background to imagery</title>
<p>The shepherding image is a primary way ‘by which biblical authors conceptualised leadership’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0014524612448736">48</xref></sup> Indeed, a Palestinian shepherd had to be a leader: perhaps this is why ‘the shepherd image is one of the few…applied exclusively to leaders’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0014524612448736">49</xref></sup> not the rest of the community. Shepherding in Palestine was a ‘hazardous occupation’: ‘suitable resting…and watering places had to be found’ and the shepherd ‘had to be skilled in keeping the flock together…ensuring (its) safety’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0014524612448736">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>Laniak suggests that the background traditions are twofold: ‘the exodus/wilderness complex…(where) YHWH…(is) the ultimate Shepherd…(and) Moses…(his) undershepherd’; and the Davidic shepherd-king tradition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0014524612448736">51</xref></sup> Israel, then, was God’s flock<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0014524612448736">52</xref></sup> and God was their shepherd,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0014524612448736">53</xref></sup> as were their human rulers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0014524612448736">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>Post-exilic rabbinic teaching began to devalue shepherding, yet nevertheless this negative view was not transferred into NT thinking.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0014524612448736">55</xref></sup> Jeremias remarks that ‘OT usage, according to which Israel is the flock of God…lives on in the Synoptic gospels…In the primitive Church the comparison of the new people of God with a flock is still…common’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0014524612448736">56</xref></sup> John is an especially significant background to Peter’s instruction: Jesus here not only portrays himself as the Good Shepherd (John 10) but also commands Peter to ‘shepherd my sheep’ (John 21:16),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0014524612448736">57</xref></sup> a ‘vocation now mediated through Peter to these elders’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0014524612448736">58</xref></sup> Just as Jesus in effect charges Peter to be unlike the unfaithful shepherds of Jer. 23:1-2 (and elsewhere in the Prophets), Peter perhaps envisages these elders much as the new shepherds of Jer. 23:3-4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0014524612448736">
<title>Shepherd the flock of God that is among you’</title>
<p>The command of 5:2,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0014524612448736">59</xref></sup> then, is for elders to ‘watch out for…people’ (figuratively as shepherds), leading and guiding the church,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0014524612448736">60</xref></sup> just as Moses, David and, ultimately, God had shepherded Israel. Yet the image also evokes the Good Shepherd from whom Peter received the same charge.</p>
<p>Scholars differ regarding the significance of the tense of ποιμάνατϵ: Goppelt<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0014524612448736">61</xref></sup> and Davids<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0014524612448736">62</xref></sup> designate the aorist as ingressive and thus not calling ‘for the elders to continue what they are already doing but for constant new beginnings’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0014524612448736">63</xref></sup> Achtemeier rejects this: since the act’s continuation is, he argues, indicated ‘with the present παρακαλῶ…of v.1’, the aorist has no significance but is simply the author’s ‘normal tense for the imperative’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0014524612448736">64</xref></sup> It is difficult to choose between the two: whilst tempting to prefer the former, little justification for it is offered by its proponents.</p>
<p>However one understands this verb, its object is clear: τὸ ἐν ὑμῖν ποίμνιον τοῦ θϵοῦ. Τὸ ποίμνιον, ‘a diminutive of <italic>poimnē</italic>’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0014524612448736">65</xref></sup> meaning ‘flock’ (here, ‘a defined group of persons under a leader’),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0014524612448736">66</xref></sup> appears only three times in the NT.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0014524612448736">67</xref></sup> The possessive genitive τοῦ θϵοῦ establishes that this flock is God’s, not the elders ‘to supervise as they choose’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0014524612448736">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>The flock is further qualified by the nested modifier ἐν ὑμῖν: this seems likely to be a distributive use, signifying the distribution of the flock throughout the places where elders served.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0014524612448736">69</xref></sup> On the basis of this, Elliott expressly rejects the translation, ‘in your charge’;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0014524612448736">70</xref></sup> Michaels, conversely, considers that such a distributive use <italic>implies</italic> such a translation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0014524612448736">71</xref></sup> Achtemeier designates it a dative of sphere relating to ‘the area of…authority’, thus also supporting a translation of ‘under your charge’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0014524612448736">72</xref></sup> However one classifies this use, it seems that the flock of God to be shepherded by each elder comprises those near them in some sense.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0014524612448736">
<title>Jesus as Chief Shepherd</title>
<p>Although not in the immediate co-text of 5:2, the reference in 5:4 to the ἀρχιποίμην is significant. A <italic>hapax legomenon</italic> in the NT and Septuagint (although a similar word appears in Heb. 13:20), the word’s sense seems to be ‘Chief Shepherd’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0014524612448736">73</xref></sup> although Feldmeier believes that such a translation overemphasises a power dynamic, preferring a meaning depicting Jesus as ‘the epitome, the “archetype” of every office of shepherd’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0014524612448736">74</xref></sup> (Helpful as this is, one must nevertheless question why attributing power to Christ is problematic!) Having been described ‘in 2:25 as the shepherd of souls’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0014524612448736">75</xref></sup> ‘whose suffering and humility are paradigmatic’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0014524612448736">76</xref></sup> Jesus is now presented in 5:4 as the example for elders,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0014524612448736">77</xref></sup> the shepherd whose shepherding they should emulate (just as they also are to be τύποι to the flock).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0014524612448736">
<title>3.2 Exercising oversight</title>
<p>An integral part of the shepherd’s role was to oversee every aspect of his flock.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0014524612448736">78</xref></sup> It is therefore unsurprising that Peter now turns to this oversight language in his exhortation.</p>
<p>The present plural participle ἐπισκοποῦντϵς relates to the main verb ποιμάνατϵ but appears square-bracketed in UBS4. Important manuscripts (including א* and B) exclude it, although a majority of texts (including ק<sup>72</sup>, א<sup>2</sup> and A) incorporate it. If א* and B are correct, other manuscripts may have included it to expand and clarify the charge to elders; if instead other texts are correct, then the scribes of א* and B may have excluded it as redundant, either in the light of ποιμάνατϵ or ‘by ecclesial conviction’ (later this term was associated with the bishop’s function and scribes may have assumed that Peter would not have required elders to exercise this function).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0014524612448736">79</xref></sup> The translation committee favoured retention albeit in square brackets; Michaels supports this,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0014524612448736">80</xref></sup> as does Jobes, although she notes that the term does not significantly change Peter’s meaning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0014524612448736">81</xref></sup> We will assume that the term is textually secure, albeit remaining cognisant that the evidence against inclusion is not insignificant.</p>
<p>Ἐπισκοποῦντϵς is probably a participle of means,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0014524612448736">82</xref></sup> describing how elders are to shepherd. Achtemeier suggests treating it as a participle of attendant circumstances,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0014524612448736">83</xref></sup> but Wallace suggests that at least 90% of such participles satisfy four criteria, namely that: both participle and main verb are aorist; the main verb is imperative or indicative; the participle precedes the main verb; this participle appears in narrative literature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0014524612448736">84</xref></sup> Since only the second of these criteria is clearly met, ἐπισκοποῦντϵς seems unlikely to be a participle of attendant circumstances and should be translated ‘by exercising oversight’.</p>
<p>The collocation of shepherding with oversight was traditional,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0014524612448736">85</xref></sup> evoking the Septuagint: Jobes sees an immediate background of Is. 53:6;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0014524612448736">86</xref></sup> Elliott prefers Ezek. 11:16 and 34:1-31.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0014524612448736">87</xref></sup> Some also suggest an Essene background (CD13:7-9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0014524612448736">88</xref></sup> A similar complex of terms appears in Acts 20:17-35, including ‘elders’, ‘flock’, ‘overseers’ and ‘shepherd’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0014524612448736">89</xref></sup> These affinities likely suggest parallel stages of ecclesiological development (with elders acting as overseers),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0014524612448736">90</xref></sup> although this is not universally agreed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0014524612448736">91</xref></sup> Nonetheless, ἐπισκοπϵῖν had not yet become the technical term regarding a bishop’s function,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0014524612448736">92</xref></sup> and here elucidates the <italic>means by which elders are to shepherd</italic>, not a separate task and certainly not a distinct role.</p>

<title>3.3 Three antitheses</title>
<p>Goppelt considers that the antitheses of 5:2b-3, each containing negative and adversative particles, focus not so much on ‘what the elders are to do…but how they are to carry out their work’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0014524612448736">93</xref></sup> The first two (adverbial) antitheses probably modify ἐπισκοποῦντϵς which is nearer (although could modify ποιμάνατϵ);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0014524612448736">94</xref></sup> the third (participial) clause could be treated differently, as analysed below. Nevertheless, each antithesis essentially describes the elders’ role and how it is to be executed.</p>
<sec id="section15-0014524612448736">
<title>(a) First antithesis</title>
<p>Ἀναγκαστῶς, a NT <italic>hapax legomenon</italic>, means ‘out of compulsion’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0014524612448736">95</xref></sup> and is set in opposition to the second adverb, ἑκουσίως (meaning ‘willingly’),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0014524612448736">96</xref></sup> by μὴ…ἀλλἀ. It is suggested that elders may have been appointed by others and might have been unwilling to serve because of resulting exposure to increased hardship and even persecution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0014524612448736">97</xref></sup> Whatever the context of their appointment and service, though, elders must not serve begrudgingly<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0014524612448736">98</xref></sup> simply because it is required. What a challenge to weary leaders today who, though <italic>obeying</italic>, may not be doing so <italic>willingly</italic>!</p>
<p>The addition of κατὰ θϵόν is interesting: included by witnesses including ק<sup>72</sup>, א and A, it is omitted by B, K and L. UBS4 classifies its decision to include the phrase as [C]. However, the variant of ἐπισκοποῦντϵς also appears in this verse and may explain the degree of uncertainty reflected by this classification: Metzger makes little comment about κατὰ θϵόν, remarking only that copyists may have omitted it due to not ‘understanding its precise import’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0014524612448736">99</xref></sup> and Michaels considers its original inclusion is in ‘little doubt’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0014524612448736">100</xref></sup> Manuscript evidence certainly supports its inclusion.</p>
<p>Used with an accusative noun, the sense of κατα may be as ‘the marker of a norm’, perhaps here the standard of care required from elders or perhaps meaning that such care is ‘in accordance with God’s will’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0014524612448736">101</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first sense is preferred<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0014524612448736">102</xref></sup> because, in context, the wider passage implies that, as Chief Shepherd, Jesus stands as an example (or <italic>standard</italic>-setter?) for shepherd-elders (just as, immediately before the reference to ἀρχιποίμην, they are described as examples to the flock). To instruct that elders should aspire to the level of God’s own willingness to shepherd the flock coheres with this.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0014524612448736">103</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0014524612448736">
<title>(b) Second antithesis</title>
<p>Here is another unsuitable motivation: not only must elders’ service not issue from compulsion, it must also not be motivated by money. Αἰσχροκϵρδῶς, not found in ancient Greek writings (although the related adjective is common), denotes fondness of dishonest gain<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0014524612448736">104</xref></sup> or greed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0014524612448736">105</xref></sup> Despite the semantic element of dishonesty, Michaels denies Peter is cautioning against fraud; rather, Peter uses the word to emphasise how inappropriate money is as a motivation for elders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0014524612448736">106</xref></sup></p>
<p>It seems that elders were remunerated in the early church (1 Cor. 9:7; Gal. 6:6), but that some financial improprieties followed (1 Tim. 3:3,8; Titus 1:7,11).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0014524612448736">107</xref></sup> Despite compensation, money was not to motivate elders’ service;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0014524612448736">108</xref></sup> instead, elders must serve enthusiastically.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0014524612448736">109</xref></sup> Indicating that elders ‘are to be eager to meet the needs of others’ over personal gain,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0014524612448736">110</xref></sup> προθύμως ‘reinforces and heightens… ἑκουσίως’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-0014524612448736">111</xref></sup> Green highlights a sense of giving (contrary to prevailing social norms about giving and resulting indebtedness) ‘without expectation of return’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-0014524612448736">112</xref></sup></p>
<p>Again, a warning sounds for today’s leaders who, when weary of eldership, may console themselves that at least they get paid to do it (those who are)! This clause is ‘intended to overcome the subconscious tendency to replace genuine motivation, which is lacking, with satisfaction arising from material advantages’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-0014524612448736">113</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0014524612448736">
<title>(c) Third antithesis</title>
<p>From concern with love of money, Peter now warns against love of power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-0014524612448736">114</xref></sup> By its structure, the third antithesis seems to match the preceding two, thus describing how oversight is to be exercised. However, its participial form may suggest that it, like ἐπισκοποῦντϵς, modifies ποιμάνατϵ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-0014524612448736">115</xref></sup></p>
<p>Κατακυριϵύοντϵς literally means ‘lording it over’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn116-0014524612448736">116</xref></sup> It appears in Mark 10:42-45 (and parallels), where Jesus contrasts domineering leadership with servanthood. Michaels treats ὡς as having ‘little effect on the meaning’;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn117-0014524612448736">117</xref></sup> it may however cause κατακυριϵύοντϵς (and perhaps also γινόμϵνοι) to function substantivally,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn118-0014524612448736">118</xref></sup> rather than as a participle of means. Both interpretations seem possible.</p>
<p>The genitive object<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn119-0014524612448736">119</xref></sup> over whom the elders should not ‘lord it’ is τῶν κλήρων. The term’s etymological meaning – ‘your portions by lot’ – was by now lost, according to Marshall,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn120-0014524612448736">120</xref></sup> although Elliott suggests Classical Greek usage could refer to an allotment of land by civic authorities to a citizen, ‘usually determined by the casting of lots’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn121-0014524612448736">121</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present use, however, mirrors τοῦ ποιμνίου later in 5:3,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn122-0014524612448736">122</xref></sup> and thus denotes people. Michaels denies that it refers to an elder’s ‘spheres of authority’ within a congregation but rather the local congregation itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn123-0014524612448736">123</xref></sup> Green, conversely, probably thinks it designates subgroups of each community rather than a whole local community, although his commentary is ambiguous.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn124-0014524612448736">124</xref></sup> Laniak avoids choosing, simply using an arresting description of τῶν κλήρων as the ‘“real estate” in the new community…the people themselves’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn125-0014524612448736">125</xref></sup> Elliott equivocates, suggesting both as possible,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn126-0014524612448736">126</xref></sup> which seems perhaps all that can safely be said of the text.</p>
<p>Whilst the sense of this third prohibition is partially clarified by its echo of Jesus, the remainder of the antithesis is a more complete illumination. Called to be τύποι, the elders were to fulfil their role by being models whom the flock could imitate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn127-0014524612448736">127</xref></sup> Whilst Jewish writings rarely required leaders to set an example,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn128-0014524612448736">128</xref></sup> this phrase clearly limits Christian elders’ leadership: their authority depends wholly upon correlation between their teaching and lifestyle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn129-0014524612448736">129</xref></sup> Selwyn wishes to see the use of γινόμϵνοι, instead of ὄντϵς, as a way of suggesting the duration required to establish exemplary character.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn130-0014524612448736">130</xref></sup> Whilst questioning whether this participle can bear such exegetical weight,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn131-0014524612448736">131</xref></sup> the underlying point is helpful: elders’ faithfulness to the Chief Shepherd’s example is proven over time and leadership influence depends upon it.</p>

<sec id="section18-0014524612448736">
<title>(d) Concluding remarks</title>
<p>Hillyer comments that these antitheses echo qualifications for Jewish sanhedrin members: designated ‘elders’, ‘overseers’ and ‘shepherds of the flock’, they were to be humble, modest and not greedy for money.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn132-0014524612448736">132</xref></sup> Yet, significantly, Peter sets these antitheses for shepherd-elders within the context of Christ as Chief Shepherd: <italic>he</italic> is the standard to which elders must aspire in their shepherding leadership and, in 5:4, his anticipated appearing is their motivation for faithful service. 5:4 could elicit much fruitful reflection but sadly the motivation for elders exceeds our present remit!</p>

<title>3.4 Does 5:5 inform how elders must exercise their leadership?</title>
<p>5:5a requires the νϵώτϵροι to submit (a sense of ‘voluntary yielding in love’)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn133-0014524612448736">133</xref></sup> to the πρϵσβύτϵροι. Some query how submission can be required ‘in the same way’ as the elders’ role; Marshall suggests that ὁμοίως may imply that (i) just as πρϵσβύτϵροι must act consistently with their station in the community, so must νϵώτϵροι, or (ii) that just as πρϵσβύτϵροι must show respect to νϵώτϵροι by not domineering over them, so reciprocal respect must be shown by νϵώτϵροι accepting elders’ instructions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn134-0014524612448736">134</xref></sup></p>
<p>Commentators reject attempts to place a full stop after the reciprocal pronoun ἀλλήλοις thus relating it to ὑποτάγητϵ: it relates to ἐγκομβώσασθϵ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn135-0014524612448736">135</xref></sup> Probably either a dative of respect or of advantage, it implies a translation of ‘toward each other’.

<title>3.5 Summary</title>
<p>The elders’ role here is to lead. Yet Peter seeks to describe clearly the duties and style of such leadership. Not for Christian elders a leadership which benefits leader and not followers: they must be shepherd-leaders who nurture, protect and guide God’s people without gaining great worldly advantage. Whilst probably modestly remunerated for their efforts, elders were not to be motivated thereby in overseeing their church communities. Rather, they were to serve willingly (to God’s standard of willingness), enthusiastic even, in the face of possibly increased persecution resulting from their role.</p>
<p>A certain degree of power and influence may have been theirs yet they should not misuse it: influence and authority depended not on status but on consistency of Christian character, for it is this which the flock was to emulate. Indeed, the churches would have heard these instructions and known that whilst elders carried authority to which the Christians must submit, elders were to act humbly toward other believers:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn142-0014524612448736">142</xref></sup> arrogant domineering leadership was prohibited and submission thereto probably not expected by Peter.</p>
<p>Through it all, the Chief Shepherd is the elders’ example and also their motivation for service. The amaranth crown of glory promised to elders at Jesus’ return was their reward and reason for serving well. These elders might seem to have a thankless task but it would prove in the coming age highly esteemed by God.</p>

<title>4. Conclusion</title>
<p>The elders in 1 Peter 5:1-5 seem to have been church leaders, called by Peter just as he had been called by Christ to ‘shepherd the flock’. Theirs was not the role (nor the recompense!) of a corporate business leader: exemplary character was essential, God’s people were their overarching concern and any influence they wielded must be used for the church’s benefit and under the Chief Shepherd’s authority.</p>

<title>Paul – Champion Of Inclusion</title>
<p>W. Graham Monteith, <italic>Epistles of Inclusion: St Paul’s inspired Attitudes</italic> (Guildford: Grosvenor House Publishing, 2010. £9.99. pp. 160. ISBN: 978-1-907-65269-1).</p>
<p>St Paul is not an obvious candidate for a champion of inclusion. And yet, Monteith, in his new book, delves into the writings of and about St Paul to reveal a theology of inclusion which goes beyond seeing disability as a focus for charity to one in which people with disabilities are active members of faith communities. This book begins with a biographical exploration of St Paul’s experience of disability, concluding that whatever the nature of his disability, St Paul’s ‘thorn in the flesh’ gave him an insight into the challenges faced by those marginalised by society. Monteith provides a thought provoking analysis of the writings and attitudes of someone who has a bad press in terms of being prejudiced and intolerant of difference. He uses the ministry of St Paul as an example of how faith communities can value and enable the gifts of everyone to flourish. There is an interesting debate to be had between a theology in which disability is seen as a means for others to serve, and a theology in which disabled people are empowered to discover and use their gifts. This latter approach requires hard work and is arguably more difficult than the traditional approach of just accepting disabled people for who they are. There is a long history of viewing disability, especially profound physical and learning disabilities, as a focus for charity. There is no doubt that caring for and being with people with severe disabilities can foster a closer union with Christ. Monteith challenges this pious view of disability where disabled people are objectivised. Instead he argues that true inclusion demands that we recognise that everyone can and should play an active part in community life. This book skilfully articulates the subtle difference between viewing disability as part of the human condition and viewing disability as a focus for piety. The challenge facing the church today is to desist from seeing disability as negative, but instead to embrace inclusion by empowering everyone, including disabled people, to develop and express their gifts as members of the body of Christ.</p>
