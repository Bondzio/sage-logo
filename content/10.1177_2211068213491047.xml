<title>Purair 5 Ductless Fume Hood</title>
<p>Three new models are available with 24-, 36-, or 48-inch widths. The units exceed Occupational Safety and Health Administration, American National Standards Institute, and all relevant international standards. Ductless design eliminates installation costs and allows the unit to be positioned over a sink or benchtop apparatus. The units operate at low noise levels because they recirculate. A face velocity of 100 fpm ensures containment of fumes and particulates, and an alarm alerts the operator when the airflow falls to an unacceptable level. The rear of the unit has lighting, and all mechanisms in the head section are on the clean side of the filter, with the switches and electrical components being isolated from any contamination. The filter clamping mechanism allows for the filter to be easily installed and ensures an even seal at the filter face at all times to prevent bypass leakage. The main filter can be chosen from 14 different types of carbon, which include specialty media for vapors of organics, solvents, acids, mercury, and formaldehyde. HEPA filters for particulate filtration are also available, as is an optional polypropylene spillage tray.</p>

<title>TruTip Extraction Kits</title>
<p>The Akonni family of “smart-tip” extraction products for rapidly purifying human genomic DNA (gDNA) on the Hamilton Microlab STAR line of robotic liquid-handling workstations has expanded. The first product in the family of gDNA kits provides laboratory technicians with the ability to process up to 300 µL of fresh or frozen whole blood. This kit now has the added capability to be used to process other sample types, including buffy coat, tissue, buccal swabs, and cells. For all sample types, this kit delivers superior-quality gDNA simultaneously from 8 to 96 samples in less than 60 min.</p>
<p>The second TruTip gDNA kit now available supports the extraction and concentration of gDNA for up to 400 µL of saliva collected using the Oragene DISCOVER Collection Kit from DNA Genotek, a subsidiary of OraSure Technologies. Given the noninvasive nature of collecting gDNA from saliva samples compared with blood, this sample type is commonly used for very large-scale genetic studies.</p>
<p>TruTip extraction kits running on the Hamilton Microlab STAR system do not require a magnetic head, vacuum manifold, centrifuge, or other equipment. Both TruTip gDNA kits can be used with a variety of backend analytical tools, including quantitative PCR, real-time PCR, digital PCR, microarrays, and mid-multiplex bead-based systems, as well as traditional and next-generation sequencing systems.</p>
<p>The Akonni TruTip line of products uses a porous nucleic acid binding matrix embedded in a pipette tip and extracts DNA or RNA using well-understood chaotropic salt chemistry. These new kits for gDNA enable completion of the entire extraction process, including a fully automated onboard heat incubation step, in less than an hour and are four to five times faster than most traditional high-throughput approaches.</p>

<title>LF110 Plus CCD Camera</title>
<p>This 11-megapixel (MP) scientific cooled CCD camera now features a 35-mm KAI-11002 CCD Sensor and includes low-speed and high-speed analog to digital converters (ADCs) for a wide range of image acquisition speeds while maintaining maximum image integrity. A full-frame image of 4008 × 2672 pixels can be acquired at speeds of 2 MP/s for the highest quality images all the way up to 12 MP/s in preview mode. The LF110 achieves low image noise by matching the 11 electron noise performance of the original LF110, yet images are transferred to the PC in a significantly faster time. The LF110 also offers improved cooling efficiency. The combination of a new thermoelectric cooler with improved air flow management provides a temperature delta in excess of −40 °C without the assistance of liquid cooling.</p>

<title>96-Well SensoPlate Plus Glass Bottom Microplate</title>
<p>This microscopy plate is designed for use in high-resolution microscopy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Consisting of a black cycloolefin frame, it features an ultra-clear borosilicate 175-µm cover glass bottom affixed with a low autofluorescence adhesive. Resistant to DMSO and 70% ethanol, SensoPlate Plus is suitable for cell culture use.</p>
<p>According to Greiner Bio-One, the SensoPlate Plus glass bottom microplate offers an optimized geometry to facilitate trouble-free measurements and high-resolution imaging. Perimeter well microscopy is enhanced by the condensed distance between the microplate well and skirt bottom. Circular wells prevent disruptive shadow with the smallest possible meniscus lens, and a slightly enlarged well diameter allows an increased working volume. A perimeter ditch may be filled with liquid to minimize edge effect during lengthy incubations.</p>

<title>Reagent Reservoirs for 96- and 384-Well Pipetting Systems</title>
<p>Adopting a standard ANSI/SLAS footprint, the extended range of INTEGRA’s reagent reservoirs (100 and 300 mL) for 96-well and 384-well multichannel pipetting systems is fully compatible with all liquid-handling systems, including INTEGRA’s VIAFLO 96 and VIAFLO 384 Handheld Multichannel Electronic Pipettes. Individual pyramidal indentations (96 or 384) in each reagent reservoir allow maximum liquid recovery. VIAFLO multichannel reagent reservoirs reuse the reservoir base and dispose of the reservoir inserts. These reagent reservoirs are also designed to nest within one another without sticking and come in compact, space-saving packages.</p>

<title>Vista Vial</title>
<p>This series of pipette-friendly, two-part chromatography vials is designed for difficult-to-handle liquid samples. Its two-part design consists of a glass base and a polyethylene top that snap together to form a standard 12 × 32-mm autosampler vial. The glass base provides a wide target for pipettes and is considered ideal for highly viscous and foaming samples. The polyethylene top is available with 8- to 425-mm threaded, 9-mm threaded, or 11-mm Snap Seal neck finishes that offer a choice of closure systems. Depending on the sample, disposal of vials is easier as the plastic can be incinerated intact without the need for closure removal.</p>
<p>The Vista Vial 1.0-mL volume glass base is constructed of type 1 borosilicate glass in either clear or amber. The polyethylene top accommodates 8- to 425-mm standard and 9-mm R.A.M. screw thread closures and septa. Threaded closures and septa are available individually or preassembled. The Vista Vial with an 11-mm Snap Seal finish accepts J. G. Finneran Poly Crimp seals, Snap Top Caps, and standard aluminum seals. Vista Vial tops can be precrimped. There is no need for a decapper to remove the polyethylene top from the glass base.</p>

<title>Higher Volume 96-Format Sample Storage Tubes</title>
<p>New 2.0-mL storage tubes from Micronic combine higher sample storage capacity and absolute sample traceability in an industry-standard 96-tube rack format. The new Micronic 2.0-mL storage tubes use a unique 2D code laser encrypted on the tube bottom to enable easy identification and traceable storage of samples. The 2D code identifies the sample and its coordinates within a storage rack, the particular rack, and the location of the rack in a freezer. Produced in a modern class 7 clean room production facility from ultra-pure polypropylene, Micronic 2.0-mL tubes are certified RNase/DNase free and nontoxic. They are considered an ideal secure medium for storage of liquid or solid samples. As well as having a shape for gripping with a robotic arm, the Micronic 2.0-mL tubes fit in the 96-tube Roborack to enhance productivity enable integration with automated liquid-handling platforms. Micronic 2.0-mL storage tubes come with a choice of push-cap or screw-cap closures. Micronic recommends its single-turn tube screw cap, which stays securely in place even during repeated freeze/thaw cycles.</p>
