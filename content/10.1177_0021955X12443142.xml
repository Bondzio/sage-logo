<abstract>
<p>The forest biomass represents an abundant, renewable, non-food competition, and low-cost resource that can play an alternative role to petro-resources. The first topic of the research activity is focused on the use of wood and a pulp mill by-product—tall oil —as raw materials for the production of rigid polyurethane foams. The maximum content of the renewable resource in ready foams is 26%. By using biopolymers as a matrix, a natural way is to reinforce them with natural fibers. Further advantages are significant weight and cost savings and, at the same time, replacement of petrochemical raw materials. Three different natural fibers (cellulose, wood, and modified cellulose) were tested as a filler of foams. Rigid polyurethane foams was used as biomass support particles for immobilization of microorganisms. Suspension cultures of the organism with biomass support particles can promote the adhesion of cells to the porous matrix surface, and subsequently the cells become immobilized during the cultivation. This method for cell immobilization has a great potential for enhancing the production of proteins or chemicals in culture supernatants. The presence of natural fibers in the matrix promotes the enzyme production because the material not only functions as an attachment place but also supplies some nutrients to the microorganism and induces the production of ligninolytic enzymes. This paper discusses the studies into the use of tall oil as a renewable source in rigid polyurethane foam production</p>

<p>Rigid polyurethane (PUR) foam is one of the most important insulating materials used today in the construction industry and is the main insulation material used in the global appliances (refrigerators, freezers, etc.) industry. A general review of the PUR industry and the physics of heat transfer in cellular materials can be found.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021955X12443142">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021955X12443142">2</xref></sup> Today, these foams are based on polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (polymeric MDI) and either polyether or polyester polyols.</p>
<p>The synthesis of polymers from renewable resources has been investigated by leading research teams from different countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021955X12443142">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021955X12443142">4</xref></sup> These studies have been initiated by a search for alternative raw materials, replacing the petrochemical resources running short. Investigations in the field of polyurethanes (PU) are especially active. Interest in the use of renewable raw materials, in particular, vegetable oils for preparing PUR foams is increasing, which has the following reasons:
<list id="list1-0021955X12443142" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>petroleum resources are getting short rapidly, and their products become increasingly expensive;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>polyols from vegetable oils are competitive with petro-chemical polyols in terms of price;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the use of vegetable polyols in PUR compositions makes it possible to improve the properties of some prepared foams, especially their hydrophobicity.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Polyols with renewable carbon content are polyols that incorporate significantly higher levels of renewable-based raw materials than the conventional polyols made almost entirely from petrochemicals. To be considered a natural oil polyol (NOP), at least one of the renewable raw materials is a vegetable oil derived from growing plants, for example from rapeseed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021955X12443142">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021955X12443142">7</xref></sup> castor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X12443142">6</xref></sup> and especially soya.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021955X12443142">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X12443142">11</xref></sup> Different types of by-products and waste materials are also used for PUR production, such as paper waste<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021955X12443142">12</xref></sup> or a by-product of pulp mills—tall oil (TO).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021955X12443142">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021955X12443142">14</xref></sup> In the field of PU, NOPs have emerged as a hot topic in recent years as a result of growing interest within the global sustainability movement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X12443142">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The general aim of this work is different utilizations of forest raw resources or by-products of forest connected industries for the production of eco-compatible foams and composites suitable for many practical applications, with particular attention to the construction, packaging, and automotive sectors. The central topic of the research activity is focused on the use of wood, pulp, and paper mill by-products (bark, chips, sawdust, black liquor, and TO) as raw materials for the production of PUR by an innovative sustainable synthetic process with reduced energy consumption.</p>
<p>By using biopolymers as a matrix, a natural way is to reinforce them with biogenic or natural fibers (NFs). Further advantages are significant weight and cost savings (most cellulose fibers are cheaper and much lighter than glass fibers—approx. 1.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup> compared with 2.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup>). For this reason, the relative properties of the bio-composites are often superior to those of glass fiber composites. In addition, NFs are combustible and biodegradable. However, NFs also have disadvantages, for instance, increased moisture absorption. The properties of NFs are affected by many factors, such as variety, climate, harvest, maturity, degree of retting, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021955X12443142">16</xref></sup> There are investigations on PU resins filled with different fibers—sisal fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021955X12443142">17</xref></sup> and oil palm trunk fiber dust,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021955X12443142">18</xref></sup> but not so much on PUR—wood flour,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021955X12443142">9</xref></sup> wood and hemp fibers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021955X12443142">19</xref></sup> cellulose fibers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021955X12443142">20</xref></sup> and flax fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021955X12443142">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among the large number of applications of PUR, their use in the biotechnological field as a support for the immobilization of enzymes and whole cells has recently emerged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021955X12443142">22</xref></sup> The advantage of PUR for this purpose relies on the easy control of the pore size, stable maintenance of the quantity of cells and large-scale application at low price. In this work, PUR were used as biomass support particles (BSPs) for immobilization of the lignin-degrading fungus <italic>Phanerochaete flavido-alba</italic>. Lignin-degrading enzymes such as lignin peroxidase (LiP), manganese-dependent peroxidase (MnP), and laccase (Lac) are used in the diverse fields of industry and environment such as bioconversion of lignocelluloses into value added-products (e.g. biofuels and chemical feedstocks), pulp delignification, dye bleaching, detoxification of wastewaters, detergent manufacturing and transformation of antibiotics and steroids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021955X12443142">23</xref></sup> Large-scale production of ligninolytic enzymes has been difficult owing to the sensitivity of the production organism to agitation. However, it has been shown that the immobilization of producing microorganism on PUR appears to stabilize the enzyme production system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021955X12443142">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021955X12443142">25</xref></sup> The success of this step greatly depends on the composition and structure of the PUR. Here we analyze the effect of the PUR structure (open or closed cells) and the agent used as NFs reinforcement on LiP and Lac production by immobilized cultures of <italic>P. flavido-alba</italic>.</p>
<p>In the present article the perspective of PUR obtained from wood industry by-products and filled with NF, as a support for immobilization of enzymes is shown.</p>

<p>Polyols on the basis of renewable natural oils, suitable for obtaining PUR, can be obtained by different methods. Most often the esterification or epoxidation of oils are applied. In the present work, for producing of PUR, polyols obtained by esterification and amidization of TO with triethanolamine and diethanolamine, correspondingly were used. Different grades of TO obtained from the company <italic>Forchem</italic> (Rauma, Finland) were used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021955X12443142">Table 1</xref>) for the synthesis of polyols.

Firstly, optimum synthesis conditions of polyols suitable for obtaining PUR were determined. The synthesis process was controlled from the triethanolamine (acid value) or diethanolamine (acid value and NH value) conversion degree. It should be mentioned that the temperature in the esterification process is higher (170°C) than in the amidization process (145°C). The structure of polyols was characterized from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy data, which were obtained with a Perkin-Elmer SpectrumOne (UK) spectrometer at a resolution of 4 cm<sup>−1</sup>, 32 scans. The IR data were collected using the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) technique with a ZnSe and diamond crystals.</p>
<p>The typical formulations used in this study were polyols from TO and a higher functional polyether polyol based on sorbitol Lupranol 3422 (it contains only secondary hydroxyl groups, OH Number 490 mg KOH/g)—from BASF (Ludwigshafen, Germany). As additives’ surfactants, NIAX Silicone L620 and L6915, correspondingly for open and closed foam structures, were used. The catalysts were NIAX Catalyst E-A-1 (all NIAX products from Momentive Performance Materials (Columbus, USA)) and Polycat 5 (from Air Products (Utrecht, the Netherlands)). As an isocyanate, polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate—IsoPMDI 92140—supplied by BASF (Ludwigshafen, Germany) was used.</p>
<p>The NFs utilized in the study were wood fibers from LaSole (Percoto, Italy) and cellulose fibers from Retenmaier (Rosenberg, Germany). A biologically modified sample of cellulose fibers was also used. Modified cellulose was obtained by treatment of the same cellulose fibers with a lignocellulolytic fungus. Cellulose fibers were inoculated with the fungus and incubated for 21 days at 30°C as earlier reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021955X12443142">26</xref></sup> Characteristics of the fibers are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021955X12443142">Table 2</xref>, and the shape characteristics of the fibers are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X12443142">Figure 1</xref>.

<sec id="sec5-0021955X12443142"><title>Sample preparation</title>
<p>PUR samples were obtained by mechanically mixing appropriate amounts of IsoPMDI 92140 and the polyol system (polyols, surfactant, catalysts, blowing agent, and NFs) for 10–15 s. The unreacted mixture was poured into a plastic mould (20 × 30 × 10 cm) for free foaming. The polymerization reaction took place at room temperature for all obtained samples and was completed in about 3–5 min; the samples were conditioned before tests for 24 h. The content of different components in the composites was calculated on the basis of initial weights.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0021955X12443142"><title>PUR characterization methods</title>
<p>The physical and mechanical properties of the foams were measured in accordance with the following standards: foam density—DIN 53420; compressive strength—DIN 53421; closed cell content—ISO 4590; and water absorbance after 7 days—DIN 53428. The compressive strength of PUR was tested parallel and perpendicular to foam rise. Mechanical testing of PUR was performed on testing machines Zwick/Roell 500 N and Zwick/Roell Z100 (Ulm, Germany).

<p>Eight different PUR with a density of 45 kg/m<sup>3</sup> were used as a support for fungal cell immobilization. They included foams with open or closed cells, each without NF reinforcement or reinforced with 9% of cellulose, wood, or modified cellulose.</p>
<p>Prior to use, the foams were rinsed with 70% (v/v) ethanol for 1 h and washed thoroughly three times with distilled water. The foams were then dried and five pieces (2 × 2 × 1 cm) were weighed and placed in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 mL of potato dextrose broth. After sterilization (121°C, 20 min), the flask was inoculated with two 1 cm<sup>2</sup> plugs of a 7-days-old culture of fungi on potato dextrose agar. A control without PUR was included as a free-cell culture reference. Incubation was done in triplicate at 30°C without shaking. Conidiospores attached easily to the PUR and growth took place throughout most of the support after 11 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X12443142">Figure 2</xref>).

<p>Parallel to the foaming direction, the cell structures are oriented vertically; in general, the foam has a closed cell structure, with average cell dimensions of 535 µm vertically and 255 µm horizontally for unfilled PUR. The addition of NF to the formulation is responsible for the increase of the viscosity of the polyol composition. This is a reason why the foam structures of filled foams are more uneven, and the cell dimensions are higher. The anisotropy of foams is confirmed by physical mechanical tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X12443142">Figure 6</xref>), and the anisotropy factor is approx. 2, both from cell size measurements in SEM and from compression tests.

In general, the enzyme production was enhanced when the fungus was immobilized on PUR. Foams with open cells were superior for Lac production than closed cell foams, especially when NFs were present in the foam composition. By using foams with wood, cellulose, or modified cellulose as reinforcement fibers, the Lac activity was increased seven-fold in comparison with the case of the control culture. The maximum Lac activity (140 U/L) was obtained in cultures immobilized on the foam reinforced with cellulose. This result is in agreement with the possible induction of the enzyme activity by the lignocellulose present in these foams.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021955X12443142">31</xref></sup> In the case of LiP production, the effect of the foam structure was not so pronounced, but again the higher enzyme values were obtained in immobilized cultures on the foams reinforced with NF.

<p>Differences in enzyme production may be attributed not only to the foams’ composition but also to the dissimilar levels of fungus colonization. The mean amount of the mycelium attached to closed cell foams (71 mg of mycelium per foam piece) was lower than that attained on open cell foams (100 mg of mycelium per foam piece) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0021955X12443142">Table 6</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to deeper analyze the microorganism colonization pattern on foams, the fungal colonized PUR were observed by SEM imaging. After immobilization and enzyme production cycles, the foam pieces were dried and cut at 1.5 - and 3-mm depth. SEM images of the surface and 1.5 and 3 mm depth at a magnification of ×50 were evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021955X12443142">Figure 7</xref>). The number of the cells colonized by the fungus at each foam depth was counted, and average colonization was calculated as the percentage of the cells colonized per total number of foam cells. Graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021955X12443142">Figure 7</xref> show a comparison of the results obtained in open and closed cell PURs. All materials were heavily colonized on the surface, but the colonization in depth followed the different pattern in the two main structures tested (open and closed cells). The colonization of all NF-containing materials was evident up to a 3-mm depth in open cell PUR. In closed cell PUR, the growth of fungi at a 3-mm depth was detected only in the PUR without NF and the modified cellulose containing PUR foam. In general, open cell foams were better penetrated by the fungus than closed cell foams. The presence of natural fibers in open cells, especially cellulose and modified cellulose, also led to a more pronounced colonization in depth. This was not the case in closed cell materials whose penetration was higher in non-containing fiber PUR and modified fiber containing PUR. These results support the higher values of the enzyme production and biomass attachment obtained in open cell materials than in closed cell materials. For microorganism immobilization, it is advisable to use an immobilization support that can be colonized in the whole structure. This leads to higher biomass available for enzyme production during the production cycle. Consequently, the higher the colonization in depth the better the enzyme production is expected to be. Hence, open cells materials loaded with natural fibers showed to be superior for fungus immobilization than closed cell materials.

<p>Carriers for microorganism immobilization can be improved by modifying their structure in such a way that the colonization of a microorganism is facilitated. In addition, some microorganisms may penetrate the whole structure of the carrier because it is able to break the material by mechanical or enzymatic mechanisms. Hence, it is important to know the mechanism of microorganism colonization to improve the material characteristics for immobilization.</p>
<p>In this work, we analyzed SEM images of <italic>P. flavido-alba</italic> colonized materials to elucidate the colonization mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021955X12443142">Figure 8</xref>). Colonization of closed cell PUR was mainly performed through breakage areas of foams. It was also noticed that big cells were more often colonized by the fungus than smaller ones, which is likely because they are more easily breakable and thus the fungus may penetrate better. Open cells colonization seems to occur through natural holes of the network, so these holes may facilitate the fungus spread out in the whole structure of the material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021955X12443142">Figure 8</xref>). This may explain the higher fungal biomass and enzyme activities’ values obtained in open cell foams. There was no evidence of the breakage of PUR cell walls by the fungus mycelium.

<p>Polyol synthesis, based on TO, is an environmentally friendly process with low energy consumption, and the obtained polyols are prospective to substitute those synthesized from petrochemical raw materials. The maximum concentration of the renewable material (TO) in ready PUR is 27%. The content of the renewable raw material in the foam formulations filled with NF could reach 32%.</p>
<p>Compressive strength and Young’s modulus for light weight foams decrease with increasing filler content. By using specific surfactants, it is possible to obtain open cell foams, promising as an immobilization support for microorganisms.</p>
<p>The results reported in this paper show the possibility of using TO PUR foams reinforced with natural fibers as an immobilization support for Lac and LiP production by <italic>P. flavido alba</italic>. Further studies are needed to optimize the enzyme production and to elucidate whether a process applying a repeated-batch culturing method can be developed for large-scale production of enzymes.</p>
