<p>In opening this book, Leonidas Cheliotis argues that the arts ‘constitute an alternative lens through which to understand state-sanctioned punishment and its place in public consciousness’ (p. 1). He asserts that this relationship may ‘reveal hitherto obscured instances of social control within or outside prisons, [and] uncover a rich and possibly inspirational archive of resistance to them’ (ibid.). Right from the outset, Cheliotis is therefore presenting arts in prison as steeped in power, a contested field in which various players come into conflict over their aims, aspirations, values and approaches to criminal justice and social control.</p>
<p>Such arguments will be familiar, even unexceptional, to readers of this journal; however, Cheliotis is able to bring a distinct perspective. In particular, he articulates how these field struggles are manifested in what might be described as the late modern prison. This includes highlighting how arts in prisons have become enmeshed with the growth of managerialism by spawning a mini-industry of evaluations and claims of success in changing lives. He also discusses how access to arts has become more restrictive or even curtailed as an act of popular punitiveness. Those programmes that remain are often only available on a conditional basis, so becoming embroiled in the ‘soft’ power of incentives, privileges and responsibilization. In addition, the wider role of arts is discussed, in providing a degree of legitimacy to expanding prison populations by presenting a ‘good news’ story to a middle-class audience. In focusing on this particular context, Cheliotis is able to set the foundation for a novel and revealing approach to the issues, situated within a sociological account of the contemporary prison system with all of its problems and potential.</p>
<p>The chapters are wide-ranging in their focus, approach and ambitions. They range from the contemporary to the historical; they encompass popular and high art including writing, painting, music, cinema, theatre and architecture; they explore theoretical and practice concerns; they touch upon the psychological and social aspects of imprisonment and creativity; and they cover art produced inside prisons and outside, including creativity that is organic and spontaneous as well as that which is structured and systematized. In itself, the breadth and coverage of the chapters lay bare the extent and kaleidoscopic nature of the field.</p>
<p>The first two chapters quickly establish that this is a book that does not simply re-run familiar and easy arguments. Yvonne Jewkes opens by discussing how prison architecture has over time reflected changing penal philosophies but in the contemporary world their design is a kind of anti-art, seeking not beauty but instead a degree of bleakness and ugliness, intensifying the pain of imprisonment. Although Jewkes can cite a number of international examples where this has been resisted, it is their rarity that confirms the general rule. This is followed by Eamonn Carrabine’s exploration of a number of popular representations of prisons from <italic>The Beggar’s Opera</italic> to <italic>Oz</italic> and <italic>Bad Girls</italic>. He concludes by arguing that in the face of indifference and even demonization of particular groups, rational argument is unlikely to generate reform. Instead, it is essential to provide an ‘education in sentiment’ (p. 69), shaping and accessing consumers at an emotional level.</p>
<p>The next four chapters examine examples of the representation of imprisonment in arts including literature, theatre and documentary film. Vincenzo Ruggiero describes the work of Victor Hugo and Octave Mirbeau, suggesting that they draw upon and enliven sociological explanations for crime and criminal justice. He illustrates that <italic>Les Miserables</italic> draws upon a critique situating crime in poverty and inequality and thus supports a reductionist or abolitionist approach. In contrast, <italic>Torture Garden</italic> focuses on the role of punishment in generating legitimacy, solidarity and social control. The enduring success of a text such as <italic>Les Miserables</italic> is in its intellectual depth but also its intense sentiment, that it has characters and a narrative that engages people in their heart as much as their head. A more angry example is Tenessee Williams’ long forgotten 1930s play <italic>Not About Nightingales</italic>, the subject of Thomas Fahy’s chapter. The play was part of the wider proletarian art movement of the 1930s and took a critical approach to exposing the brutal suppression of a mass hunger strike in a Philadelphia prison. This play was created at a time of economic crisis and a social democratic recovery programme; the art of this era, in particular cinema, highlighted the shifting power structures in society, including a greater concern with social justice, a consciousness of the precariousness of life for the ordinary man and scepticism about the power of the state and corporations. While this play is interesting as an example of these changes, it is the wider movement that is of particular interest and how it both responded to and helped to solidify and shape progressive reform. The third chapter in this group is Michelle Brown’s exploration of documentary film. She focuses on Fred Wiseman’s <italic>Titicut Follies</italic> and Errol Morris’s <italic>Standard Operating Procedure</italic>. Her analysis encompasses different approaches to documentary film making and various strategies to expose state crimes and wider structures of power and inequality. While these films are effective examples of such challenges, they have to be set in the context of a media saturated with images and representations that reinforce and legitimize such power structures. The final chapter of this quartet is a fascinating piece by Andre Douglas Pond Cummings on hip-hop’s relationship with criminal justice. In this he argues that hip-hop has played an important role in exposing the extent of imprisonment for young Black men in the USA and the underlying issues of social inequality that fuel this. This is a powerful and important analysis and opens up a vitally important area. There are further issues that could be explored in relationship to hip-hop and criminal justice, including what role it has had in legitimizing the use of imprisonment, whether it has had any positive effects in shaping the lives of young people in marginalized communities and whether it has had any broader effects in fostering an appreciation of inequality and efforts to address this. This chapter deserves particular credit for opening up such areas for further enquiry.</p>
<p>There follow five chapters that address arts created by prisoners or inspired by them, including painting, music and writing. The chapters are diverse and raise a number of issues. Stathis Gauntlett provides a historical study of the folk music of Greek prisons, which grew in popularity and spawned a number of bitter commercial rivalries. Some parallels with hip-hop come to mind, but this form of music has its own story and is enlightening to hear. Mike Nellis’s overview of autobiographical writing by British prisoners is a joy to read, with his effortless grasp of the material, and the trends in both writing and criminal justice as they intertwine and diverge throughout the decades. Sarah Colvin’s piece on the writing of Red Army Faction prisoners in West Germany is also revealing in the ways that prison writing can be used. In this case, rather than communicating outwards, it was intended as a way of isolating the group members and keeping them focused on their ideological aims. This group of chapters also includes Robert Johnson’s work on prisoner poetry and W.B. Carnochan’s piece on Egon Schiele’s prison paintings, both of which bring vividly to life the psychological drivers and functions of creativity.</p>
<p>The final six chapters focus on arts-based projects in prisons including art therapies. These chapters reveal some of the conflicts, contradictions and challenges of creativity in prisons. Together they explore different aims of such projects, including reducing reoffending, improving well-being and creating awareness of human rights. However, they also explore some broader and more challenging aims. Rachel Marie-Crane Williams discusses the potential for art education to promote ‘critical pedagogy’ (p. 241), which enables those involved to reflect upon and build their consciousness of social structures and strategies to resist these. That could clearly sound dangerous to prison administrators, but with the over-representation of minority ethnic and poor men in prisons, its relevance is also obvious. Alexandra Cox and Loraine Gelsthorpe also discuss the ability of arts to contribute to ‘a flourishing society, where citizens are happy, healthy, capable and engaged’ (p. 272). The relevance of this in a painful institution like a prison will be obvious to many, but the acceptability of such an aim to a punitive public is clearly problematic. In their chapter exploring the delivery and evaluation of a music therapy course in a prison, Leon Digard and Alison Liebling draw out the tensions and complexities that arise in delivering arts in prisons, including the sometimes uncomfortable relationship between different aims, approaches and spaces that this creates.</p>
<p>This edited collection has extraordinary breadth and depth, covering a range of critical issues for arts in prisons. It successfully provides a series of accounts that are largely sociologically grounded but also in touch with the messy and complicated business of nurturing arts in prisons. This is a rich and fascinating collection that is highly recommended to both academics and practitioners in this field.</p>
