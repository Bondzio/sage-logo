<abstract>
<p>ID scanning systems have become a fixture at the entrances of private bars and nightclubs in many North American jurisdictions. This article draws from an ongoing ethnographic study to interrogate the diverse appeals of such devices to institutional audiences. The authors situate these devices within the occupational culture and routines of door staff, and accentuate how the real world operation of these tools can at times circumvent any promised security gains. They then consider why the devices are nonetheless appealing to nightclub representatives because of their potential sign value that allows bar staff to advance preferred sets of communications with influential audiences.</p>

<p>The authorities in many Western nightlife districts are concerned about the disorder that can occur in nightclubs and spill out onto public streets. Club entranceways have consequently become marked by physically-imposing bouncers. In Canada, such foyers are now also congested by large black wooden consoles. Resembling a speaker’s podium, these devices contain a computer, monitor, handheld scanner, and often a tiny video camera. Before entering, patrons must provide the attendant with official government identification, typically a driver’s license. Bouncers electronically scan the document and a set of personally identifying details are transferred to and stored on a <italic>private</italic> database. Individuals who violate establishment-specific rules can thus be banned, meaning that the next time someone scans their ID a notice to this effect pops up on the screen, and door staff do not let them enter. Such bans can last anywhere from days to years, the length of time being at the discretion of the club that initiated the ban. Crucially, these devices are networked with a host of other establishments that pay a monthly membership fee, meaning that if a patron is banned from one club, they are banned from all connected clubs.</p>
<p>Such devices are both popular and controversial. In the nightlife districts of major cities in Western Canada such as Edmonton, Calgary, and Vancouver, almost every bar or nightclub now uses such a system. And while the emergence of these devices is typically attributed to the characteristic forms of disorder that accompany the nighttime economy different constituencies find these devices appealing for assorted other reasons.</p>
<p>Privacy Commissioners in both Alberta and British Columbia have found that such ID scanning violates privacy protections. Notwithstanding such rulings most clubs continue to use such systems, and recent legislation in Alberta specifically allows establishments to use them to collect a minimal set of personally identifying information to be used exclusively for security purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1206331211430017">Legislative Assembly of Alberta, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In ruling against the use of these devices, the Alberta Privacy Commissioner paid particular attention to the fact that there is no empirical evidence that they reduce crime, violence, or antisocial behavior (Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner, Order P2006-011). In doing so, he focused on one of the most familiar questions about security technologies and anticrime initiatives more generally; “do they work?” In these contexts “working” involves a comparatively narrow frame of analysis, one that addresses only whether initiatives meet their stated anti-crime objectives.</p>
<p>In the first half of this article we touch on this question of the effectiveness of ID scanning systems. We situate these devices within the occupational culture and routines of nightclub staff. Although we do not offer a definitive conclusion as to the effectiveness of these devices, we accentuate some doubts about the ability of these devices to meet their proclaimed objectives.</p>
<p>Our second approach to the effectiveness of ID scanners is a significant departure from how the question of utility is typically framed. Here, we start from the question of whether, when looked at from the point of view of nightclubs, it actually matters if these devices reduce disorder. Although this might seem like an unduly cynical question, we demonstrate that approaching the issue in this way allows us to attend to some vital symbolic dimensions of ID scanning. These technologies are appealing to different constituencies at least in part because of how they can be marshaled to signify specific messages to preferred audiences.</p>
<p>We draw on a rich data set we amassed in 2009 comprising both primary and secondary materials. We collected newspaper and magazine articles, as well as training manuals and promotional copy. We observed the designer of an ID scanning system present the benefits of his technology to a meeting of the Alberta Gaming and Licensing Commission. We also scrutinized the two Provincial Privacy Commissioners’ rulings on these devices and several of the submissions that interveners made in these cases. We hung out in clubs, talking with door staff to gain an appreciation for these technologies in operation, insights that build on the knowledge that one of the authors (CT) has accumulated from her many years of employment in Edmonton’s hospitality industry.</p>
<p>The bulk of the data we draw on for this article, however, comes from 20 interviews we conducted with assorted parties who have an interest in and experience with such ID scanning systems. This includes door staff, an insurance agent specializing in the hospitality industry, a lawyer representing plaintiffs in a legal case pertaining to privacy concerns with the ID systems, bar owners and managers who have introduced ID scanners into their establishments, two police officers who work in an entertainment district and who are charged with exploring how the police might benefit from the introduction of scanners in nightclubs, a person responsible for managing security at a consortium of clubs, system designers, a salesperson who sells ID scanners to nightclubs, and the Alberta Privacy Commissioner. That said, this neatly demarcated list of roles held by our interviewees masks the significant fact that there is considerable occupational turnover in the hospitality industry. Over an extended period of time a single person often assumes different roles. So, for example, the doormen we interviewed had often worked at a number of establishments, some of which used ID scanning whereas others did not (at least when they worked there). This pattern was constantly repeated. We interviewed doormen who had designed and marketed an ID scanning system, bar owners who had been managers, a bar manager who had actually also worked (at different times) as a salesperson for two competing ID systems, bar owners who had managed bars, and an owner who had been a manager as well as a bouncer. This means that our interview data are particularly robust, as most of our interviewees spoke about issues from various perspectives.</p>
<p>The quotes we present from these interviews should be read in two different ways. In most cases they illustrate points articulated by several interviewees. At other times, these quotes cannot be generalized to others, as that interviewee was one of the only people who could speak from such a position, as is the case with the Privacy Commission or the insurance agent specializing in nightclubs. In such instances the quotes represent the unique insights of one of the only specialists with expert knowledge about that issue.</p>

<title>The Promise</title>
<p>Canadian municipalities are following the wider trend in Western societies of trying to capitalize on the financial potentials of the nighttime economy. The success of such initiatives is apparent in the fact that the nightclub districts of Calgary, Vancouver, and Edmonton can be more densely populated at 1:00 a.m. than in mid-afternoon. The financial windfall associated with such alcohol-lubricated revelry also presents characteristic problems of drunkenness, disorder, and public nuisance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1206331211430017">Finney, 2004</xref>). Such problems persist notwithstanding the complex legal and institutional cocktail designed to regulate alcohol consumption in bars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1206331211430017">Chatterton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1206331211430017">Valverde, 1998</xref>). ClubScan represents one new ingredient in this mix. It should be noted, however, that the term <italic>ClubScan</italic> is our own neologism. We use the term to refer to all the different proprietary ID scanning systems on the market. Each of these systems is configured slightly differently, but all operate on the same logic.</p>
<p>As noted, when a patron arrives at a club that employs such a system she must temporarily surrender a government-approved identification document that contains a scannable barcode, such as a driver’s license or passport. This practice builds on existing documentary routines, as patrons are already accustomed to having their ID checked to ensure that they are old enough to drink legally. The difference is that these documents are now scanned into a computer system which captures a subset of their personal information. The details now collected typically include their name and age, although in the recent past they collected essentially all the information on the ID, and some systems still collect more than the bare minimum that is legally permitted, including address, driving conditions, driving class, sex, date of birth, issue date, and signature. The systems also capture a picture of the patron by either scanning the image on the ID card or using a small webcam to film a brief video clip of the person entering the establishment. This footage then automatically links to that customer’s documentary details now stored on the system.</p>
<p>If a patron becomes violent or breaks any of the number of rules, in addition to tossing them out on the street or dispensing curbside justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1206331211430017">Hobbes, Hadfield, Lister, &amp; Winlow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1206331211430017">Rigakos 2008</xref>), security staff can now also locate that patron’s image on the system and ban him or her. The next time a bouncer scans that customer’s ID, a ban is signaled and is accompanied by a brief description of why he or she was banned. Beyond being a form of punishment for past misdeeds, the operative logic is that people who have behaved badly in the past are more prone to do so again, and such banning is understood to be a forward-looking risk-reduction measure.</p>
<p>Such devices apparently bring a version of computerized policing knowledge work to a corner of the security industry which has long been identified almost exclusively with the exercise of (occasionally brutal) force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1206331211430017">Hobbes, Hadfield, Lister, &amp; Winlow, 2002</xref>). In fact, ClubScan is a technological upgrade on the longstanding practice of establishments keeping an informal list or photo album (often using Polaroid “mug shots”) of unwelcome patrons. The crucial difference with ClubScan is that it is networked. Any establishment that pays its monthly fee of approximately several hundred dollars is connected with the other members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1206331211430017">
<title>In Practice</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1206331211430017">Rigakos (2008)</xref> has noted, the ambition underlying the networked component of ClubScan is that undesirable patrons are, “in effect, banished from the nighttime economy” (p. 156). And although that might be the dream, the technology is shaped by human operatives and distinctive occupational cultures that inform how these dynamics of sorting and exclusion operate in practice. A bar owner succinctly accentuated this point:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>[ClubScan] doesn’t control some magic prison gate that says who gets in and who doesn’t. There’s still the flesh and blood of the front lines who determines who walks in that door. So the door is still operating by human hands, and human hands are linked to the human brain that makes that judgment call.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The question therefore becomes how such human components inform the day-to-day operation of these devices.</p>
<p>Door staff engage in a process of social sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1206331211430017">Lyon, 2003</xref>), where they conscientiously identify risk and screen out people who might be potential problems (or who might not fit the club’s “look” and market niche) and allow desirable patrons to enter. Bouncers have enormous discretion in managing the diverse and often contradictory pressures that have a bearing on deciding who to let in and who to exclude. The legal situation pertaining to decisions about who can enter a bar is roughly akin to the discretion homeowners have in allowing people to enter their home. Bouncers, operating as the agents of the “homeowner” (bar owner/manager), therefore have almost absolute power to decide who can enter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1206331211430017">Rigakos &amp; Greener, 2000</xref>). While civil liberties regulations prohibit door staff from excluding individuals because they are a member of certain legally specified groups (visible minorities, for example) in practice, entry decisions are often informed, if not determined, by such factors. When this happens bouncers usually finesse the legality of their decision by telling a patron that they are not allowed to enter for some other reason. As one of our interviewees pithily put it; “You tell them that they have the wrong color shoes on or something like that.” It would be just as likely that they did not bother to justify their decision at all, as is apparent in one bouncer’s description of how he “explains” to undesirable patrons that he is not letting them enter:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>You just go: “You guys aren’t getting in tonight.” And they go, “Why?” And you go, “Just ‘cause you’re not getting in.” “Why?” “Cause you’re not getting in.” “Why?” “Cause you’re not getting in.” You don’t have to explain yourself to anybody. You just tell them they’re not getting in and eventually they just leave.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The point is that ID scanning is embedded in a highly discretionary decision-making context, and that bouncers attend to myriad signifiers in choosing who can enter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1206331211430017">Buford May, &amp; Chaplin, 2007</xref>). While ID scanning devices can allow such decisions to be informed by a wider network of risk-relevant knowledge, our research suggests that these tools also allow for the further articulation of localized discretion that operates along multiple axes. The devices can therefore become a means to extend and intensify local dynamics pertaining to such things as personal animosities, occupational structures, acute risk, and informal economies. As we detail below, these factors, working alone or in assorted combinations, raise questions about the ability of ID scanning to consistently or effectively exclude risky patrons.</p>
<p>The culture of door staff combines seriousness and play. Bouncers will often remind you that they are more likely to be injured at work than is a police officer. At the same time, bouncers work in an environment where most of their clients want to have a good time, alcohol and other drugs are abundant, and there are frequent opportunities for sexual encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1206331211430017">Grazian, 2007</xref>). The actual uses of ClubScan are informed by this occupational culture, as is apparent in how the technology provides opportunities for door staff to engage in their unique brand of entertainment. For example, a designer of one ID system recounted how when these devices were first introduced, just for fun most of the door staff in the city immediately started banning other bouncers, entering absurd justifications for these bans, such as, “he repeatedly comes to the club dressed as a sea turtle.” A different interviewee recounted that a doorman’s sense of humor can result in more troubling bans: “So doormen could get a hold of that information and just randomly ban people. And like for obscene reasons as well. Just silly things, like: ‘She wouldn’t perform oral sex.’ I saw that numerous times.”</p>
<p>The extensive discretion afforded security and management personnel to ban people also provides novel opportunities to carry out personal vendettas or advance relationship issues, something mentioned by almost every bouncer we interviewed,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>You’ve got people that have their own personal agendas, which is just wretched, you know? “Oh, my ex-girlfriend is dating this guy, so I’m going to scan his ID in, then I’m going to ban him,” you know? “I’m going to make sure he doesn’t get into any club in Edmonton.” (bouncer)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This reinforces the point that it is always within the purview of an owner or manager to exclude someone from his or her club, and that extends to reasons based on personal relationships. To reiterate, what is new here is the networked dimension, which means that to get back at an enemy or ex-lover, staff can (and do) occasionally ban them from all clubs on the system. Over time the absolute discretion in placing bans has been somewhat mitigated by more formal procedures for initiating bans (at least in some clubs and on some systems). That said, there are easy ways to circumvent such formalities, and the process of banning remains highly discretionary, as is the extent to which different establishments actually enforce bans.</p>
<p>While security staff place most bans on the system, bar owners can play a significant role in initiating, authorizing, and—as we will see—compromising bans. In public discussions about ID systems, bar owners are portrayed as principled businesspeople, working to keep their establishments safe and crime free. Although this is true of many owners—and without wanting to disparage all such individuals—it is worth remembering that these entrepreneurs are not selling bibles. One bouncer we interviewed who had close to 20 years experience working the door was less circumspect, remarking that “to be a bar owner is essentially and possibly [to be] one of the slimiest bastards in the world.”</p>
<p>Given that bars have notoriously short life spans, owners are under tremendous pressure to make as much money as quickly as possible. More so than many other businesses, bars also provide opportunities to launder money and can serve as fronts for criminal organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1206331211430017">Kennedy, 2005</xref>). Many of our interviewees recounted how managers, rather than using ClubScan to exclude unsavory people, will instead take steps to ensure that such individuals can get unencumbered access to their club. This is particularly noteworthy when such “friends” are drug dealers, and the owner is taking a cut of the profits from the narcotics trade occurring in or around their establishment:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I have worked at bars where guys that we know are complete shitheads would come up to the door and we’ll be like, “No, we can’t let you in!” And then one of the managers, he’s like, “Oh, he’s my buddy.” “This guy’s your buddy? This guy is not allowed in. He’s on [ClubScan]. He’s a coke dealer,” or whatever. And then the manager would be like, “Aw, he’s a friend of mine. Let him in, let him in, let him in.” So what do you do? And so that guy goes in and brings ten of his friends in and then next thing you know, that manager and that guy are letting other people in the side door. (bouncer)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The fact that some criminal organizations (i.e., gangs) also own nightclubs gives the entire ID scanning system an unnerving twist. That is, in such situations bar patrons effectively hand over their identifying information to someone who works for a criminal organization, and who then records this information on their private database. As one bouncer (who did not work at such a club) noted, “[t]here’s definitely some irony there. The guy who’s going to steal your identity is the one you’re handing it to.” Although to date there is no evidence that this is actually happening, it does accentuate the problem of the trustworthiness of the institution collecting personal data.</p>
<p>The gang issue is particularly germane to discussions of ClubScan given that these devices are now legitimized as a way to keep gang members out of clubs. This points to the complex relationship that bars can have with gangs, the full nuance of which is beyond the scope of our analysis here. Suffice to say that notwithstanding the public rhetoric, managers of many establishments do not necessarily see gangsters as a problem. Here we are referring to “serious gangsters,” who operate at the higher echelons of criminal organizations. Club managers and security personnel often know these people are gangsters, but welcome them because such individuals typically do not want to draw undue attention to themselves, they spend a lot of money, and can actually be a stabilizing influence within the bar.</p>
<p>On the other hand, rank-and-file gang members are often unwelcome because they are seen to be disproportionately violent and unpredictable. It is such individuals who are implicitly being referred to when discussion turns to how ClubScan is an anti-gang initiative. Again, however, the dynamics on the ground paint a very different picture. It is precisely because of their (often well-grounded) reputations for extreme violence that rank-and-file gang members might <italic>not</italic> be banned, or if they are banned, why those bans might be ignored. The reason for this is easy to recognize if one contemplates the real world dynamics of trying to exclude such individuals:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I’ve had the Hells Angels come in in their vests. You know you say, “No. You can’t come in,” and they’ll just walk right in. There’s nothing you can do if it’s the Hells Angels . . . So it’s ridiculous to ask someone making $10 an hour to inform when this does get into gangs . . . We shouldn’t be put in the position to say that there’s a gang member or to deny anyone entry. (bouncer)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Several bouncers feared that if they tried to ban gang members the banned patrons might return to the bar with a gun, or seek them out at home. This issue was also raised by Sgt. Curtis Robinson in his submission to the B.C. Information and Privacy Commissioner. Sgt. Robinson is a gang expert with the Vancouver Police Department:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I have personally had numerous conversations with nightclub door staff and have been advised that they have a “no hands on” policy with gang members. In other words, the gang members are not searched prior to entry to the club because the door staff are aware of the gang members’ reputations. A failure to show “proper respect” could result in staff suffering serious assaults or be targeted for a public shooting.</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Given such informal “no hands on” policies, it is at least an open question as to how much of an effect ID systems have in excluding violent gangsters.</p>
<p>The final factor that we will mention, which works against the presumption that ClubScan will effectively exclude risky people, is the practice of greasing the door. For bouncers, “greasing” involves taking money to let clients jump to the front of the line. Although some establishments profess to prohibit the practice, it is a widely recognized and longstanding way for bouncers to supplement their otherwise meager income. Bouncers can make hundreds of dollars a week in grease, and in some desirable venues during particularly popular times (such as the week of the “Calgary Stampede” rodeo) bouncers can net thousands of dollars a week in grease.</p>
<p>ClubScan introduces a new dimension to this process, as now some patrons try to grease their way past the ID scanner, paying a bouncer to let them enter the club without scanning their identification.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Absolutely there are people that try to grease their way past [ClubScan] . . . And have I seen it? Yeah, absolutely. I’ve seen guys that you know walk up to the [ClubScan], you know, hand somebody some cash, and roll right by . . . I’ve heard people greasing anywhere in ballpark of two hundred and five hundred bucks to roll by. (bouncer)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>And while this occurs, it is nonetheless a controversial practice, even among door staff. This is because of the assumption that anyone who would pay to avoid being scanned would also be particularly dangerous. Such concerns are compounded in bars where bouncers do not collectively pool the grease money, which means that one person pockets the cash while all other security staff must collectively deal with the increased risk associated with allowing such ostensibly dangerous individuals into the club unscanned.</p>
<p>There are other reasons to suspect that ID scanning might not be a meaningful check on club-based disorder beyond the ones we have identified here. So, for example, a customer who is banned using the number on his or her driver’s license can still enter a club if s/he uses their passport (or a different form of governmental ID) the next time they try and enter, as the numbers on these systems are not linked. Alternatively, given that there are several proprietary forms of ID scanning systems that are not integrated, if someone is banned from clubs on one system, they can still enter clubs that use one of the other systems. Combined, such issues should reinforce the concern raised by the Privacy Commissioner that ID scanning might not reduce club-based crime and deviance.</p>
<p>A handful of individuals we interviewed explicitly questioned whether these tools could achieve their professed goals. None were more forthright about this issue than one of the system designers, who observed that: “The incidents of violence in Edmonton are no lower than they are anywhere else. So really is there, and I shouldn’t be saying this, but is there really that much significant value to having a system?” As we detail in the next section, ID scanners do indeed appear to be valuable, but primarily because of how clubs can use them to convey a series of desirable messages to specific audiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1206331211430017">
<title>Symbolic Technology</title>
<p>A central appeal of ID scanning systems for managers and owners is that these devices can produce “sign value.” This concept is most associated with the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1206331211430017">Jean Baudrillard (1981)</xref> who introduced it to critique the traditional emphasis in political economy on the “use value” of commodities. For Baudrillard, a commodity’s value is not confined to any narrow utilitarian sense in which a thing can be used, but extends to the meanings that commodities signify about their owners. In a society saturated by communications technologies and a capitalist system fixated on producing consumer demand, sign value becomes a key way for commodities to articulate valorized notions of style and prestige.</p>
<p>For our purposes here, we emphasize a slightly modified notion of sign value as it relates security technologies. Rather than accentuate individualized commercial distinctions conveyed by mass marketed commodities, we are interested in how an array of agents (bar owners, managers, security personnel) find ID scanning devices appealing because of how they can assign meanings (sign value) to such technologies and, in so doing, further their organizational interests. The meanings of such devices are polysemous and advanced strategically, with slightly different messages being conveyed to different audiences. As we note below, such efforts are open to oppositional readings, something for which there are varying degrees of latitude depending on the specific message, audience and forums where such communications take place. In this final substantive section, then, we briefly address the sign value of ID scanners, sketching how agents of nightclubs work to invest such technologies with meanings that they hope will appeal to the public, regulators, the judiciary, and insurance agencies.</p>
<p>The largest audience for such organizational messaging is “the public,” which is also easily the most broad and vague constituency. In assorted public forums, nightclub staff proclaim that such devices make their establishment more secure. Such messages can be used to counter the bad publicity associated with continuing discussions about violence in nightclubs. However, because the public is an amorphous and internally fractured constituency, there are opportunities for groups to question this preferred reading, challenging the utility, legality and effectiveness of such devices. So, although the message about the security value of ID scanning seems to be taken for granted by wide segments of the public, there are still debates in the press, online, and sometimes at the front of a nightclub’s queue, where a small handful of patrons challenge the propriety of such devices.</p>
<p>When these devices were first introduced owners also had to counter a sense that they signified that their establishment was especially dangerous. Hence, rather than being read as a symbol of public reassurance, introducing an ID scanner can also be interpreted as a sign that this club has serious ongoing crime and violence problems. This issue has receded as ID scanning has become ubiquitous in several districts. However, we know of at least one manager who refuses to use an ID scanner specifically because he wants to avoid any insinuation that he is running “that kind” of club.</p>
<p>Bar owners also need to be attuned to the possibility that their clientele might associate the devices with other undesirable meanings. This seems to be the case with gay bars, which are among the few establishments which do not use ID scanners. A subset of the patrons of such clubs is understood to be wary of any system that would formally record their patronage. Moreover, the general clientele of gay clubs has a well-founded suspicion of the relationship between formal identification structures and persecution. In this community, then, the developer’s general preferred message about security has been unable to counter more unfavorable interpretations of these devices.</p>
<p>One consequence of having a young, inebriated, and sexually charged clientele is that bar owners are often sued for any number of untoward events that happen in their establishments. When these cases get to court, owners encounter a different audience for their messages about ClubScan’s security value. Here, they can argue to the judge that irrespective of whatever unfortunate things might have happened at their club, ID scanning (and other security practices) demonstrates that they have performed their due diligence in trying to ensure that dangerous patrons were not allowed to enter. In essence, the simple fact that they have introduced these devices is presented as a sign that they are acting responsibly. As an insurance broker who specializes in the hospitality industry put it, “. . . when you make your presentation to the judge there’s a big chance they’d typically say, ‘Wow. You made your best efforts.’” As these lawsuits can involve large sums of money, the comparatively small monthly investment in ClubScan appears particularly wise, irrespective of whether the devices have any demonstrable effect on disorder.</p>
<p>To continue this theme, it is worth noting that one of the most significant ways that bar owners manage the risks of untoward events is through specialized insurance products. Such policies have also become prohibitively expensive. The broker we interviewed who specializes in insuring nightclubs noted that the cost of liability insurance for such establishments in Edmonton is now approximately ten times what it was a decade ago. One bar owner commented that the monthly insurance costs for his comparatively small club are $11,000. Given these sums, owners are eager to obtain any break possible in their policy. ID scanning devices become important here because of how owners appeal to them in trying to get a discount on their insurance rates. Although there is no fixed discount for having such devices, insurers take their presence into consideration:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>It actually helps your insurance. It’s one of those added things. You go to your insurance place and they ask you about camera systems, and all these different systems that you have in place, right? They give you some kind of a percent off. (bar owner)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Here insurers are also working in an empirical vacuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1206331211430017">Ericson &amp; Doyle 2004</xref>), uncritically accepting that these devices reduce club-based risks or interpreting them as a sign of responsible security practices.</p>
<p>Roughly the same dynamic now occurs with liquor regulators. Drinking establishments are highly regulated and owners must conform to a litany of rules pertaining to such things as serving alcohol, fire safety, smoking, physical security, room capacity, age restrictions and food service, many of which are ultimately understood as ways to indirectly govern alcohol consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1206331211430017">Valverde 1998</xref>). Although not all these regulations are strenuously enforced, bar owners still feel vulnerable; with so many highly discretionary regulations at any moment they could find themselves in violation of assorted rules. Here, again, owners are presented with another audience to whom they must demonstrate that they are taking adequate security measures. And while owners can point to many familiar security practices such as maintaining door staff and installing surveillance cameras, ID scanning provides them an added bonus in such situations. As one bar owner emphasized, ID scanning devices allow them to represent their security commitment through a new “high-tech” product: “It’s something that is materially demonstrable. You can actually say, ‘Look at <italic>that. That</italic> is our security system. <italic>That one</italic>. The <italic>black</italic> one.’ I think that’s the benefit.” Indeed, in British Columbia regulators are particularly enamored of these devices, and now mandate that clubs with a history of security problems must introduce an ID scanning system before they have their liquor license renewed.</p>
<p>It is not preordained that these different audiences will accept the preferred readings proffered by nightclub representatives. That said, from the accounts we have heard, owners and managers believe they have quite successfully capitalized on the sign value of ID scanners, having been able to convince most audiences to interpret their devices in the ways detailed above.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>If a licensee has not had any problems with violence or otherwise unacceptable behavior, it does not make sense to collect personal information from patrons. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1206331211430017">Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Alberta, 2009</xref>)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This article has analyzed the utility of ID scanning systems when looked at from the perspective of those who own and work in nightclubs. We drew attention to some reasons to doubt that these devices can effectively seal off such establishments from excessively risky patrons. We did so by situating ID scanning in some of the real-world dynamics of working the door and running a club which can translate into a compromised human/technological process of screening, sorting and selection.</p>
<p>More significantly, we broadened our analysis to contemplate other reasons why such devices are appealing to different club-based constituencies, irrespective of whether they can effectively reduce disorder. As a result, we do not agree with the assessment by the Privacy Commissioner that heads this section. From the nightclub’s perspective, it often makes tremendous sense to deploy these technologies because of their sign value; they can proffer preferred meanings of these devices in strategic communications with influential audiences. While the Privacy Commissioner might counter that such rationales cannot justify the loss of personal privacy inherent in private ID scanning systems, if we are going to seriously address how such technologies are used, we must engage with the myriad reasons why different groups find them appealing.</p>
<p>In any such effort, it would be a mistake to assume that nightclubs are inherently interested in reducing crime and disorder. Enhancing public safety is the mandate of the police, and as a society we use many imperfect measures to assess their successes in doing so. Nightclubs—and all corporate entities—have a very different mandate, one that is concerned almost exclusively with making a profit. Consequently, efforts to reduce crime and disorder are primarily desirable to the owners and staff of such clubs if they can be strategically aligned with this bottom-line orientation.</p>
<p>Indeed, from the perspective of nightclubs, it can be irrelevant that ID scanning devices might not reduce crime/disorder. This is because clubs have been able to reap the institutional rewards that flow from the often unquestioned assumption that these devices reduce disorder, without having to actually demonstrate any such outcome. This is apparent in how clubs strategically invoke ID scanning in trying to counter claims that the nighttime economy has become prohibitively dangerous. It can also be seen in their encounters with judges, regulators, and insurance agents, where club representatives appeal to the crime reduction effects of these devices in a form of “as if” presentation, invoking hypothetical outcomes as if they were demonstrated facts. In all such scenarios, club agents invoke their ID scanners in an attempt to secure some form of direct or indirect financial benefit.</p>
<p>By way of concluding comment, we note that while our focus has been on one emergent security technology, the larger significance of our analysis pertains to how it accentuates the need for analysts to interrogate the wider meanings that institutional interests try and convey by employing security devices (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1206331211430017">Boyle &amp; Haggerty, 2009</xref>). Currently, an inordinate amount of time and energy is spent discussing whether assorted devices might meet their proclaimed goals of reducing crime, disorder, or terrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1206331211430017">Haggerty, 2009</xref>). Such an approach often misses the larger point that these devices are appealing to institutional interests for myriad reasons beyond their stated purposes, and are typically embraced long before conclusive evidence exists to demonstrate their effectiveness. Instead, the real issue often concerns how embracing such devices allows organizations opportunities to advance their larger institutional, economic, or political interests. As security efforts in the global north become increasingly technologized through the introduction of many scanners, cameras, ID systems, databases, drones, biometrics, DNA systems, and the like; analysts must contemplate the diverse institutional meanings and multiple appeals of such devices and the broader initiatives of which they are a part.</p>
