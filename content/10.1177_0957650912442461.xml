<abstract>
<p>A modelling approach is used to investigate the impacts of disruptions to natural gas supplies on the UK energy system and the effectiveness of strategic infrastructure investments which could help to mitigate these impacts. The combined gas and electricity network model is described. It is then used to project the development of the UK gas and electricity networks out to 2030 under two different scenarios for the wider development of the UK energy system. A set of plausible gas supply disruptions associated with three major gas facilities, lasting from 5 to 90 days, are hypothesised to occur in mid-winter 2025. The impacts are assessed in terms of shortfalls in natural gas deliveries and the costs of wider adjustments to the gas and electricity networks. Finally, the benefits arising from a number of strategic, mitigating investments in facilities such as gas storage or expanded liquefied natural gas import capacity are assessed. Although a full cost-benefit analysis was not possible, efficacy is assessed in terms of the frequency with which disruptions would need to occur to justify the mitigating investments.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0957650912442461" sec-type="intro"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The UK, like other European countries, has become increasingly dependent on natural gas for power generation as well as in households and industry. As production of natural gas from the UK continental shelf (UKCS) declines and the country becomes a net importer, there is an increasing anxiety about the adequacy of infrastructure to deal with supply interruptions. When the UK was self-sufficient in natural gas, it was relatively easy to adjust production volume to compensate for the loss of key pieces of infrastructure. One of the legacies of UK self-sufficiency is a very modest investment in gas storage. At the close of 2009, the UK held storage equivalent to 13 days consumption at the annual average rate of consumption. This compares with 30 days for European countries belonging to the International Energy Agency, 55 days in Italy and 70 days in France [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912442461">1</xref></bold>]. While investment in new storage and import facilities is taking place, driven purely by market incentives [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957650912442461">2</xref></bold>], anxieties remain as to whether there is sufficient strategic storage to underpin secure supplies to consumers.</p>
<p>This article describes the application of a new model, the combined gas and electricity network (CGEN) [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912442461">3</xref></bold>], to assess security of natural gas supplies, looking forward to the mid-2020s. A key part of the approach is to stress test the future energy system against hypothetical shocks. The shocks, in line with historical precedent, take the form of losses of key pieces of infrastructure rather than supply/import interruptions. The structure of this article is as follows. First, the CGEN model is described. It is then used to project the development of the gas and electricity systems out to 2030 under two different scenarios derived from the UK Energy Research Centre’s UK Energy 2050 project [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957650912442461">4</xref></bold>]. Under these scenarios, the model endogenously builds gas storage and import facilities based on commercial rates of return. The impact and cost of the loss of key facilities is then tested. The shocks are hypothesised to last for 5, 40 and 90 days and to take place in mid-winter in the year 2025. The final part of this article then considers the costs and benefits of investing in additional strategic infrastructure which would help to reduce the impact of these hypothetical shocks.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0957650912442461"><title>2 THE MODELLING APPROACH</title>
<p>CGEN is a modelling and optimisation tool for the gas and electricity infrastructure. It minimises the total operational and investment costs of the combined gas and electricity networks subject to the constraint that energy demands are met in line with statutory security standards.</p>
<p>The CGEN optimisation model can operate in two distinct modes as follows.</p>
<p><italic>Operational mode</italic>: In this mode, the network and generation assets are specified by the user. The model is run to establish the optimal values for pressures, gas flow, power generation and load shedding while meeting gas and electricity demand. The time horizon is typically hours/days and weeks.</p>
<p><italic>Planning mode</italic>: In this mode, CGEN determines new investments (e.g. new gas pipes and electricity transmission capacity) to minimise the cost of meeting final demand for natural gas and electricity subject to operational constraints. In this mode, the time horizon can be decades.</p>
<p>The objective (equation (1)) of the CGEN model in planning mode is to minimise total discounted costs related to the combined operation and expansion of the gas and electricity network while meeting demand requirements. In operational mode, only the operational cost part of the equation is used</p>
<p>The CGEN model consists of a load flow analysis of the electricity network and detailed modelling of the gas network including facilities such as gas storage and compressor stations. The interaction between the two networks is through gas turbine generators connected to both networks [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912442461">3</xref></bold>].</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650912442461">Figure 1</xref> shows that the CGEN model is arranged into distinct components that describe elements vital to the functioning of both networks. These include resource supply (UKCS, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and continental/Russian gas), energy transportation (gas and electricity networks), generation technologies and energy end use. Resource supply includes bounds on the availability of primary energy supplies (natural gas, coal, oil, etc.) and electricity imports. The gas network is modelled in detail to capture the dynamic nature of gas flows. The gas flow in a pipe is determined by the Panhandle ‘A’ gas flow equation that calculates the gas flow rate given the pressure difference between upstream and downstream nodes (The Panhandle ‘A’ equation is appropriate for high-pressure transmission gas flow calculations. Assumptions for its use are (a) pipe diameters are between 300–1200 mm; (b) Reynolds number of up to 40 million; and (c) pipelines operate at pressures between 40–120 bars. The UK gas transmission network owner and operator, the National Grid, uses the Panhandle ‘A’ equation to calculate gas flows on the high-pressure pipe transmission network) [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650912442461">5</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912442461">6</xref></bold>]. The model performs DC load flow analysis for the electricity network. CGEN includes models for generation technologies such as combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT), coal and nuclear. Generation technologies are described by a number of characteristics such as maximum power capacity and thermal efficiencies. Gas and electricity demand is split into residential and industrial/commercial components. Gas used for electricity generation is endogenously modelled within CGEN.
<fig id="fig1-0957650912442461" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>CGEN optimisation model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912442461-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>For both gas and electricity networks, transmission capacity is added, if required, to satisfy peak demand requirements. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912442461">Figure 2</xref> illustrates how the optimisation routine within CGEN explores all possible solutions to satisfy peak electricity and natural gas demand. This ranges from building additional network capacity to the re-dispatching of energy (e.g. substituting cheap natural gas from Scotland with expensive gas from LNG terminals in the south in order to avoid transmission bottlenecks). The model will select the cheapest solution over the entire planning time horizon.
<fig id="img1-0957650912442461" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912442461-img1.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig2-0957650912442461" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Gas and electricity network infrastructure expansion</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912442461-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The CGEN model performs integrated gas and electricity planning expansion. Combined operational and investment costs plus the cost of energy unserved are minimised over the entire planning horizon. In the electricity network, CGEN increases transmission capacity and establishes the optimal location for future generation plants. CGEN expands pipeline capacity using the approach developed by Andre <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650912442461">7</xref></bold>] but also includes the reinforcement of other gas network assets such as the increase in compressor capability, building of new gas storage facilities and expansion of LNG and import pipeline capacity. The model enforces the UK’s gas supply standards requiring the industry to be able to meet 1 in 20 year peak day demand (National Grid employs this standard to determine the appropriate levels of gas supply infrastructure reinforcements to satisfy a 1 in 20 year peak day demand) and 1 in 50 year cold winter demand (this requires gas suppliers to satisfy residential 1 in 50 year demand during a cold winter) (Both 1 in 20 and 1 in 50 year gas supply standards contribute to gas infrastructure expansion in the CGEN model. The gas supply standards are modelled using gas demand margins to represent both peak day (1 in 20) and prolonged winter demand (1 in 50) periods).</p>
<p>The baseline year for the scenarios described in this article is 2005 and CGEN starts with the network (pipes, terminals and transmission capacities) in place at that time. Facilities subsequently commissioned are added to capacity in 2010. The current (2011) capacity of UK LNG terminals and import pipelines is around 51 and 99.6 bcm/year (bcm, billion cubic metres) (1 bcm = 39.5 PJ), respectively [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650912442461">8</xref></bold>]. The expansion of the BBL pipe connecting Bacton with Balgzand (Netherlands), with a capacity of 3 bcm/year, was commissioned in June 2011. Two new LNG terminals have recently been completed, with a combined capacity of 17.5 bcm/year. Various other LNG projects with a total capacity of 27 bcm/year are in the planning process. Existing gas storage capacity in the UK is 4.4 bcm [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650912442461">8</xref></bold>]. The capacity of planned gas storage due to be connected to the National Grid over the next 10 years is 6.2 bcm.</p>
<p>Starting with these assumptions, CGEN then starts making endogenous decisions about further investment to meet the required security standards. The way that CGEN reinforces gas and electricity network assets is summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0957650912442461">Table 1</xref>.

<sec id="sec3-0957650912442461"><title>3 SCENARIOS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT</title>
<sec id="sec4-0957650912442461"><title>3.1 Background scenarios</title>
<p>The CGEN model requires a set of exogenous assumptions about final demand for natural gas and electricity and investment into power generation capacity (power generation capacity investment from 2005–2030 is an input to the CGEN model). These are taken from two scenarios in the set developed under UKERC Energy 2050 project. These scenarios were developed using two other modelling tools: the MARKAL model of the entire UK energy system [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650912442461">9</xref></bold>] and the WASP power generation planning tool [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957650912442461">10</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>The UK Energy 2050 <italic>low carbon</italic> and <italic>low carbon resilient</italic> scenarios were used. Both make conventional assumptions about economic growth and energy prices [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912442461">11</xref></bold>] and assume that the UK makes substantial progress in reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions towards its 80% reduction target by 2050. Energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2025 are reduced by 35% compared to 1990 levels, somewhat below the level of ambition envisaged in the UK’s fourth carbon budget for 2023–2027, which is based on a 40% reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The <italic>low carbon resilient</italic> scenario reflects additional measures taken to improve energy security and increase the resilience of the energy system. Final energy demand is assumed to fall by 1.2% pa in absolute terms and 3.2% pa relative to gross domestic product. This translates almost directly into lower imports, reducing the vulnerability of the UK economy to volatile world energy markets. This rate of demand reduction is consistent with optimistic estimates of the impact of policies planned and in place up to 2020 with trends extrapolated beyond that [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650912442461">12</xref></bold>]. In addition, to ensure diversity of supply, no single energy source (e.g. natural gas) is allowed to gain more than a 40% share of primary energy demand. The maximum share for any individual source of electricity generation is also set to 40%.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0957650912442461">Table 2</xref> shows the key indicators for 2025 from the background scenarios used to drive CGEN. Natural gas demand in the <italic>low carbon resilient</italic> scenario is 14% lower than in the <italic>low carbon</italic> one and 23% lower than the demand in 2010. This is due to three factors: a price-induced decline in natural gas demand from final consumers; a fall in the level of electricity generation; and lower market share for natural gas in electricity generation as a result of the diversity constraint. In the following section, we assess the implications of this lower level of natural gas demand for the UK’s ability to ride out supply shocks.

This was largely driven by the assumption that natural gas available through LNG markets would be cheaper than gas from continental Europe [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957650912442461">13</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957650912442461">14</xref></bold>].

<p>LNG capacity in 2020 in the <italic>low carbon</italic> scenario is 66 bcm/year, 12 bcm/year lower than would be the case if all the proposed projects in the National Grid Ten Year Statement [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957650912442461">15</xref></bold>] were to proceed to construction. In the <italic>low carbon resilient</italic> scenario, total LNG capacity in 2020 falls to 59 bcm/year because natural gas demand is lower than in the <italic>low carbon</italic> scenario.</p>
<p>In the <italic>low carbon</italic> scenario, an additional 1 bcm of gas storage capacity is added between 2010 and 2015 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650912442461">Fig. 3</xref>). In the <italic>low carbon resilient</italic> scenario, CGEN does not build any new storage facilities. By 2020, the capacity of gas storage facilities is 6.3 and 5.3 bcm, respectively, in the <italic>low carbon</italic> and <italic>low carbon resilient</italic> scenarios. This compares with the 9.3 bcm which would become available if all gas storage facilities with planning permission described in the National Grid Ten Year Statement were to proceed to construction. However, there is great uncertainty about 2.2 bcm of this capacity. The modelled gas storage capacity is lower because: (a) natural gas demand in both the <italic>low carbon</italic> and <italic>low carbon resilient</italic> scenarios is lower than in the National Grid Ten Year Statement [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957650912442461">15</xref></bold>]; and (b) the winter natural gas price premium is assumed to be approximately 30% in CGEN, while historically the premium has been in the 50–60% region.</p>
<p>In both scenarios, there was nearly a doubling of the number of days in the year when average demand could be met entirely from gas storage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0957650912442461">Table 4</xref>). The number of such days is similar in the <italic>low carbon</italic> and <italic>low carbon resilient</italic> scenarios. This is because lower gas storage capacity in the <italic>low carbon resilient</italic> scenario is offset by lower residential natural gas demand.</p></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec7-0957650912442461"><title>4.1 Characterising hypothetical shocks</title>
<p>A combined qualitative and quantitative approach was taken to test the resilience of the gas and electricity network. It is difficult to attach probabilities to large and unusual shocks. A survey of past disruptions to natural gas supplies round the world over the past 15 years was conducted. This assessed the magnitude, duration and cause of the supply disruptions. It was observed through qualitative analysis of shocks in the gas and electricity sector during the past two decades that gas network shocks usually last from days to weeks [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957650912442461">16</xref></bold>]. This analysis allowed the identification of components and assets that may be vulnerable to shocks. Having developed some hypothetical shocks, a quantitative analysis was then conducted using the CGEN model in operational mode to apply these shocks to specific supply network assets (over various durations) and measure the impact in terms of duration and magnitude of load unserved (both natural gas and electricity).</p>
<p>Note that, in reality, the hypothesised shocks would have an impact on spot markets for natural gas. This was very clear from the survey of past disruptions [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957650912442461">16</xref></bold>]. CGEN deals only with underlying resource costs. High spot market prices result in suppliers receiving scarcity rents from consumers. However, they do not change the underlying structure of resource costs. The issue of spot price movements is returned to in the final discussion.</p>
<p>Three different shocks to gas infrastructure with three different durations (5, 40 and 90 days) were tested. In each case, it was assumed that the shock occurred in mid-winter, January to March 2025. A 1 in 50 year winter gas demand was assumed. In the electricity network, normal peak winter electricity demand was assumed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650912442461">Figure 4</xref> shows the gas supply terminal capacities available in the <italic>low carbon</italic> and <italic>low carbon resilient</italic> scenarios in 2025. Each shock involves the loss of one of these facilities. The nature and duration of the shocks has historic precedence [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957650912442461">17</xref></bold>]. For instance, an explosion on the Bravo rig in the Rough field caused 4 months of disruption in 2006; and the Easington terminal was struck by lightning in 1999, limiting operation of the Rough sub-terminal.
<fig id="fig4-0957650912442461" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Gas terminal capacities in 2025 for low carbon/low carbon resilient scenarios</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912442461-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The year 2025 is chosen to test the hypothetical shocks because this will take us beyond the current major cycle of investment in gas infrastructure and, by that time, the de-carbonisation of the UK energy economy should be well under way. The shocks were chosen to cover the loss of all types of gas infrastructure, including LNG, a major gas storage facility and pipeline imports from Norway and the continent are as follows.</p>
<p><italic>Milford Haven LNG terminal</italic>: This is the largest LNG terminal in all scenarios and the obvious candidate for the application of a shock. The loss of Milford Haven will affect the network differently for each scenario and will depend on the level of demand and gas terminal capacities as determined by the planning model.</p>
<p><italic>Bacton</italic>: All continental imports (BBL and IUK pipelines) to the UK would be affected if there was a shock at the Bacton terminal. The loss of Bacton would remove 53 bcm/year supply (assuming maximum domestic supplies).</p>
<p>Easington: Norwegian supplies would be affected through the loss of access to the Langeled pipeline and the Rough gas storage facility would no longer be available.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0957650912442461"><title>4.2 Modelling impact of shocks</title>
<p>The procedure used to apply the shocks and test the efficacy of mitigating investments is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650912442461">Fig. 5</xref>. The implementation of these mitigating measures is discussed in the following section. For each shock, energy unserved along with the cost of this shortfall is calculated. This cost is calculated by multiplying the energy unserved (which depends on the magnitude and duration of the shortfall) by the value of lost load (VOLL). The assumed VOLLs, presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0957650912442461">Table 5</xref>, are based on two main studies [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957650912442461">18</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957650912442461">19</xref></bold>]. Note, however, that the analysis underlying the UK Government’s Electricity Market Reform used a higher VOLL for electricity of £10/kWh [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957650912442461">20</xref></bold>]. CGEN also adjusts the way the system operates, for example by re-dispatching CCGT plant. Natural gas used for power generation is endogenously determined for each shock.

<p>Within CGEN, there are two automatic procedures that are initiated during a shock as follows.</p>
<p><italic>Industrial gas response</italic>: It is assumed that there is a voluntary reduction of natural gas use from the industrial sector. This is fixed at 5.5 bcm/year for year 2025. This is broadly based on possible levels in a recent report by Global Insight referred to in Frontier Economics [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957650912442461">21</xref></bold>].

<p><italic>Power sector</italic>: It was assumed that there are 3 GW CCGT power plants with distillate back-up (for up to 120 h) in year 2025. In a gas emergency, it is assumed that all these plants will switch to distillate. The cost of distillate fuel is set at the price of oil and assumes that CCGT plants running on distillate have a thermal efficiency of 50%.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0957650912442461"><title>4.3 Loss of Bacton gas terminal</title>
<p>The levels of energy unserved for shocks of 5, 40 and 90 days duration at the Bacton gas terminal are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0957650912442461">Table 6</xref>. A shock at Bacton in 2025 results in the loss of 53 bcm/year of natural gas supplies for both <italic>low carbon</italic> and <italic>low carbon resilient</italic> scenarios. For the low carbon scenario, the average gas unserved per day for industrial natural gas users decreases from around 40–32 mcm (mcm, million cubic metres) as the duration of the shock increases from 40–90 days. This is due to the fact that natural gas demand is higher in the first 40 days of the period. The amount of natural gas demand not met in the low carbon resilient scenario is lower because of the far lower level of residential demand.

<p>On the other hand, the increase in system operating costs is higher in the <italic>low carbon resilient</italic> scenario because there is more room for manoeuvre to adjust system operation in order to avoid the high cost of energy unserved. The extra system costs are mainly due to the use of more expensive sources of natural gas, additional network costs (e.g. for use of compressors) and higher electricity generation costs.</p>
<p>The cost of involuntary interruptions to supply in the industrial sector is high under both scenarios. The costs increase as the duration of the shock increases, most markedly in the <italic>low carbon</italic> scenario. This reflects the loss of potential production and the use of high cost alternatives to natural gas. This highlights the need for industry to build in more flexibility (e.g. establishing fuel switching capability) to avoid the adverse affect of energy shocks.</p></sec>

<p>The energy system rides through the shock at the LNG terminal with less impact on energy supplies than shocks at Bacton and Easington. However, as with the other shocks, increases in operating costs are significant, especially when duration of shock increases. This would inevitably have an impact on spot markets and prices.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-0957650912442461"><title>4.6 Summary of impacts</title>
<p>The loss of the largest facility, Bacton, which affects both imported and domestic natural gas supplies, has the largest impact across both scenarios. The costs of the shocks due to the levels of unserved energy could run into billions (£).</p>
<p>It is not necessary to curtail electricity supplies in any of the scenarios. Exercising interruptible gas contracts, re-dispatching the electricity system, using distillate oil at certain CCGTs and interrupting industrial gas on an involuntary basis are sufficient to deal with the shocks.</p>
<p>Under the <italic>low carbon resilient</italic> scenario, the energy system rides through the loss of Easington or Milford Haven and the impact of losing Bacton is much diminished. This is because the <italic>low carbon resilient</italic> scenario is characterised by lower levels of residential natural gas demand which is strongly seasonal. In all cases, the increase in system operating costs rises as the duration of the shock increases.</p></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec14-0957650912442461"><title>5.1 Overview of approach</title>
<p>The impacts of the shocks that were explored in the previous section could be mitigated by making additional strategic investments in gas infrastructure. These would result in higher costs for consumers, but these might be outweighed by the benefits in terms of reduced impacts in the event of a shock occurring.</p>
<p>A full cost-benefit analysis would need a comprehensive assessment of a wide range of possible shocks and the probabilities of these occurring. This is beyond the scope of the work described in this article. However, a simpler approach can be taken to get a handle on the attractiveness or otherwise of strategic mitigating investments. For every given shock and mitigating investment, the benefits arising in the event of a shock can be compared with the additional annualised cost of the mitigating investment. The ratio of the benefit to the cost provides an indicator of how frequently the shock would need to take place for each of the mitigating investments to pay off in the long run. We term the ratio of the benefit to the costs as the return period for an event. Note that the return period does not refer to the financial return or payback on the investment. If we believe that the event could recur more frequently than the return period, then there is potentially a case for the strategic investment.</p></sec>

CGEN is then used in operational mode to assess their effectiveness in dealing with gas shocks of different durations. The investments are all credible projects based on existing technology. Each of them (other than distillate storage) adds capacity to the gas network. Greater distillate storage at CCGT plants reduces the need for natural gas supplies.

<p>The locations of these mitigation projects were chosen to avoid over-concentration of energy supplies in one location and to reflect the practicality of possible construction. For example, an import pipeline from Europe to the Theddlethorpe gas terminal is credible given its geographic location.</p>
<p>The maximum additional capacity in all the gas supply investments was set at 14 bcm/year. This is to reflect the typical capacity of recent gas supply investments and to allow a degree of comparison between projects.</p>
<p>In the CGEN modelling described so far, we have assumed that gas infrastructure is constructed on a merchant basis and have consequently assumed a real investor rate of return of 10%. For the mitigating investments which are of a more strategic nature, we have allowed the possibility that the investments might be made on a regulated basis with investors receiving a risk-free return. Consequently, we have also looked at the investments on the basis of a 3.5% real rate of return, the social discount rate used in the UK for appraising public investments.</p></sec>

<p>The shock at Bacton would be classed as an extremely serious event, but with investment in infrastructure, for example one LNG facility, the cost of the shock could be reduced by more than £1.5 billion. The energy unserved during a shock to Bacton over 40 days is much reduced in the <italic>low carbon resilience</italic> scenario (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0957650912442461">Table 11</xref>). The reductions in the cost of shocks due to mitigation measures are still significant, but lower than in the <italic>low carbon</italic> scenario. Due to lower overall demand, the impacts of the shocks and therefore the benefit arising from the mitigation measures are lower. Consequently, the return period for the shock is lower and it is less probable that the mitigating investment would pay off.

<p>In both scenarios, a half-full gas storage facility does not reduce the cost of shocks as much as a new LNG terminal, a full storage facility or a new gas interconnector. If a storage facility were to be built under regulated conditions, it is in any event unlikely that it would be permitted to operate half full in winter. The point of a strategic storage facility is that it should not engage in market arbitrage which is what would lead to the volume of gas stored running down.</p>
<p>We also assess how mitigating investments affect the impact of a 90-day shock at Easington (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-0957650912442461">Table 12</xref>). Gas storage, along with an LNG a terminal and gas interconnector, performs best. The reduction in the cost of a shock for 90 days potentially runs into several billions (£). The return periods for this type of shock could be as little as once in 200 years for the investment to pay off at a 3.5% regulated rate of return on investment. For instance, in the case of greater investment in gas storage capacity, the reduction in the cost of shock is over £3.1 billion. This mainly reflects the cost of avoided losses for industrial and commercial energy users.

<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957650912442461">Fig. 6</xref> graphically compares the benefits, in terms of reduced costs, of investment in additional gas storage and LNG capacity for shocks of 40- and 90-day duration for each of the shocks in each scenario. For 40-day shocks, the LNG and gas storage mitigation options are fairly well balanced across all scenarios. With longer 90-day shocks, investment in additional LNG import capacity performs marginally better. The impact of lower demand in the <italic>low carbon resilient</italic> scenario is demonstrated through much smaller cost reductions arising from the mitigating investments.

<sec id="sec17-0957650912442461" sec-type="conclusions"><title>6 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>In the past, during gas supply emergencies, UK could rely on its self-sufficiency in natural gas supplies. Over the next decade, with the UK becoming largely dependent on imports, other measures are required to ensure reliability of natural gas supplies. These include greater interconnection with Europe, increases in LNG import capacity and investment in gas storage.</p>
<p>We have shown that the costs of a gas supply/network shock can potentially run into billions (£). Government and regulators, therefore, need to weigh up the benefits of rewarding investment in strategic investments that can mitigate shocks. These can be regarded as taking out insurance against the eventuality of adverse events. If the event is expected to recur with a sufficient frequency, then the investment might make sense.</p>
<p>Using a novel modelling approach, this article has demonstrated that, if energy, and especially natural gas, demand is driven down aggressively over the next 10–15 years, then market-driven infrastructure investment could help to protect us against shocks. The impacts of the hypothesised shocks were consistently lower in our <italic>low carbon resilient</italic> scenario than they were in the <italic>low carbon</italic> one. However, if there are only modest falls in energy demand, as in the <italic>low carbon</italic> scenario, then there is a case to be made for policy intervention to secure socially desirable levels of investment.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650912442461">Figure 7</xref> shows the overall assessment across all shocks and scenarios of the return on investment of mitigation measures with respect to the magnitude and duration of outages. The results show that if a particular shock is relatively small in magnitude and duration, then distillate oil back-up performs best with regard to an attractive return on investment due to low capital costs. Over medium magnitude and duration of shock (weeks), a range of mitigation options have an attractive return on investment. These include LNG capacity expansion, a new gas interconnector and storage equivalent to the existing Rough field whether the latter is kept full or not. The LNG, gas interconnector and fully filled gas storage mitigation measures perform best over longer and larger shocks.
<fig id="fig7-0957650912442461" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Effectiveness of mitigation measures (return on investment)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912442461-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Adding to LNG capacity appears to offer the best potential for mitigating the impacts of shocks to supply in terms of the volume of energy unserved. However, this is based on the assumption that we live in a world where there is natural gas supply flexibility and those who are prepared to pay the market price get delivery of natural gas. If, on the other hand, natural gas supply flexibility and market transparency are limited, then the alternative option would be additional gas storage regulated so that gas in store is only used for emergency situations, i.e. the gas storage facility needs to be full at the start of winter and the rules governing its use clearly specified.</p>
<p>The mitigating investments would have further benefits not captured by the CGEN modelling which deals only with resource costs. In practice, these investments would help to reduce the impacts of supply disruptions on spot markets and prices while at the same time providing industrial, commercial and residential consumers with reassurance about the security of their energy supplies.</p>
<p>The analysis described in this article has only begun to unpack the complex issues relating to energy security and resilience. Specifically, the article has used a small number of stylised events to characterise the risks facing the UK. Ideally, a more statistical approach to the characterisation of such events would be desirable. However, to make this analytically tractable, a simpler parameterised version of the CGEN model is required. In addition, we only considered mitigating investments one at a time. A further exploration of the impacts of combinations of investments would be justified.</p></sec>
