<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to estimate the benefit of using a cultural characteristics scale to help diabetes educators understand how African Americans cope with diabetes.

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A descriptive correlational design was employed by recruiting hospitalized adults with type 2 diabetes at 3 metropolitan northeast coast sites. The TRIOS Afrocentric cultural characteristics measure and the Illness Perception Questionnaire were administered by paper-and-pencil to a diverse sample.

<body>
<p>Epidemiologic evidence reveals that the incidence of diabetes and its related complications disproportionately affects African and Caribbean Americans in the United States. Diabetes occurs twice as frequently in black and Hispanic Americans than in white counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712445213">1</xref></sup> Race and ethnicity has been shown to be associated with disparities in illness severity, treatment response, and health care utilization. Furthermore, in some African American populations, threatening illness perceptions, especially high consequences, symptoms, and negative emotional reactions, are associated with an inaccurate perceived risk of developing diabetes-related complications relative to individuals’ actual risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712445213">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Demonstrating associations by race and ethnicity and/or making inferences about associations within a population subgroup serves as a proxy for cultural values and beliefs that influence health behavior. Using race and/or ethnicity as a proxy for culture leaves an unclear understanding about the process or mechanism by which cultural values influence action plans for health behavior. Furthermore, using race and/or ethnicity as a proxy for cultural characteristics poses a risk of generalization that may paradoxically contribute to unintentional bias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712445213">3</xref></sup> and undermine effort to increase cultural competency to eliminate health disparities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712445213">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cultural competence requires understanding of the ways in which cultural characteristics influence illness perceptions and ultimately behavior. The purpose of this article is to report on results of a study that measured African American cultural characteristic and compared it to self-reported race and ethnicity as a predictor of illness perceptions of diabetes. The study examined the influence of cultural characteristics versus race as a proxy for culture in explaining varying illness perceptions of diabetes and perceived risk of developing diabetes-related complications.</p>
<p>The disproportionate burden of diabetes despite medical advances in the African American population (ie, fatalism)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712445213">5</xref></sup> is associated with cultural views. When African Americans appear to be less engaged or able to carry out self-management behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712445213">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712445213">7</xref></sup> in descriptive studies, numerous reasons including beliefs with cultural underpinnings are provided. For example, cultural views cited to facilitate or impede optimal diabetes self-management in African Americans include personal powerlessness and fear over discussing complications with health care providers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712445213">8</xref></sup> cultural traditions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712445213">9</xref></sup> ineffective interactions with health care providers, need for psychosocial support, and religious practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712445213">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Frequently, studies utilize self-reported race and ethnicity as opposed to measuring cultural characteristics specifically. Culture is defined by the United States Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Minority Health as “integrated patterns” of behavior resulting from language, thoughts, communications, actions, customs, beliefs, values, and racial, ethnic, religious, and social groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712445213">11</xref></sup> Clinicians may benefit from having knowledge of which cultural characteristics should be targeted when tailoring talking points about diabetes self-care behavior. Individuals within racial and ethnic groups are heterogeneous with regard to beliefs and values that predict behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712445213">12</xref></sup> Utilizing self-reported race and ethnicity poses a risk of generalization when interventions are developed that may or may not impact behavior directly.</p>
<p>Acculturation—the degree to which one assimilates into mainstream society as a predictor or moderator of health behavior outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712445213">13</xref></sup>—is another variable that has been used to understand subpopulation health beliefs and utilization. Using acculturation measures can be limiting when language is relied on as the proxy for understanding culture. Although language as a proxy for culture has been shown to be a robust predictor of acculturation, it poses limitations to understanding culturally influenced beliefs in the context of health behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712445213">14</xref></sup> Measures of cultural characteristic provide an understanding of the pattern of values and beliefs held by a patient in a parsimonious way. In order for clinicians to truly understand the context of routine disease management, attention directed toward the role that one’s cultural views play in adaptation to illness is important to planning health education interventions.</p>
<p>Diabetes is common in people from ethnic minority descent in America and although culturally appropriate health education has been shown to improve glycosylated hemoglobin for up to 6 months post knowledge delivery, program effects on quality of life or attitude remains less apparent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712445213">15</xref></sup> Individual ability to sustain glycemic control over the long term likely depends upon cultural factors that are intrinsically linked to one’s perception of illness.</p>
<sec id="section4-0145721712445213">
<title>Theoretical Foundation</title>
<p>Illness representations (otherwise known as the commonsense model) is part of<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712445213">16</xref></sup> the Leventhal self-regulation of illness theory. A central proposition of Leventhal’s theory is that illness representations are cognitive schema of the causes, timeline, symptoms, controllability, and consequences of an illness, and the purpose of the schema is to drive problem-solving behavior for action planning. Illness representation constructs have been shown to predict self-care behavior, including blood glucose monitoring, dietary adherence, physical activity, and medication adherence, and outcomes such as glycemic control, quality of life, and well-being in samples with type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712445213">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712445213"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712445213">19</xref></sup> Furthermore, it has been shown that communication interventions can alter illness perceptions to more closely match health care provider’s perceptions in order to negotiate and compromise on beliefs that can promote positive health behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712445213">20</xref></sup> If illness representations are influenced by cultural values,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712445213">16</xref></sup> then it follows that cultural values may need to be incorporated in communication interventions that are designed to negotiate illness representations in a way that will most closely resemble those shown to predict positive health outcomes.</p>
<p>According to Jones’ Afrocentric psychological theory, attitudes, values, and beliefs about self-protective and self-enhancing motivations for African and Caribbean Americans who live within the context of oppression resulting from a legacy of racism shape behavioral responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712445213">21</xref></sup> The Afrocentric cultural characteristics central to the theory are called TRIOS (temporality, rhythm, improvisation, orality, and spirituality). The TRIOS measure has been validated and shown to differentiate between white, black, and Hispanic people in America.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712445213">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Health threat messages framed for consistency with the cultural context in which coping occurs are likely to influence how an individual undertakes health protection measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712445213">22</xref></sup> The degree to which an individual identifies with a particular culture may explain some of the variance in illness representations of diabetes across populations. Based on the theoretical foundation of illness perception formation, cultural characteristics used for coping with adversity, and the foundation of health threat information delivery, we used Jones’ TRIOS measure of Afrocentric cultural views to assess the degree to which individuals align their cultural characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712445213">21</xref></sup> to their diabetes care. The following hypotheses were tested using the TRIOS measure adapted to diabetes care:</p>
<list id="list1-0145721712445213" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The Afrocentric cultural characteristics scale, TRIOS, adapted to the diabetes care context will discriminate by race or ethnicity, with those of African American descent scoring higher on each scale than other respondents.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Race will be less likely than the scores on the Afrocentric cultural characteristic scale to explain variance in illness representations such that the Afrocentric cultural characteristics scale adapted to the diabetes care context will be strongly associated with illness representations of diabetes, an important predictor of diabetes self-care behavior and wellness.</p></list-item>

<title>Research Design and Methodology</title>
<p>This study was implemented using a descriptive correlational design using paper-and-pencil surveys to assess perceptions of Afrocentric cultural characteristics used to cope with diabetes; illness representations or perceptions of the controllability, consequences, and timeline of diabetes; and descriptive data such as race and ethnicity.</p>
<sec id="section6-0145721712445213">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Surveys were administered to a subsample (N = 91) as part of a larger cross-sectional study of adult inpatients (N = 255) with both diabetes and a family history of diabetes conducted at three large northeast coast academic medical centers. Sites A (N = 46) and B (N = 7) were located in a diverse suburban community and Site C (N = 38) was located in an urban, very low income community. Additional exclusion criteria included confirmed type 1 diabetes (excluded due to different self-care motivation than type 2 diabetes) and inability to provide informed consent (ie, heavily sedated or in severe pain). Inpatients were selected because they would be more likely to be facing a health threat than outpatients and because the outpatient population demonstrates a motivation to seek care.</p>
<p>Participants’ ethnicity represented 75% (n = 16) non-Hispanic, 19% (n = 62) Hispanic, with the remaining sample reporting other or “do not wish to answer.” Race was reported to be 43% (n = 38) black, 45% (n = 40) white, 4% (n = 4) more than one race, 2% (n = 2) Asian, with the remaining representation being other and “do not wish to answer” responses. Approximately 20% (n = 17) of the sample reported not being born in the United States. About 26% (n = 23) reported not finishing high school by completion or examination. Accordingly, about 34% (n = 29) reported income levels well beyond the federal and state poverty level (below $20 000/year). Never having received diabetes education was reported by 54% (n = 48) of the sample, and 47% (n = 30) reported not having any diabetes education within the past year. Since the entire sample self-reported having type 2 diabetes, it is interesting to note that 64% (n = 55) of respondents stated that they developed their diabetes before the age of 50 years. About 31% (n = 20) reported not having experienced a diabetes-related complication. The average duration of diabetes varied by site (Site A = 18 years; Site B = 16 years; Site C = 13 years), with the urban site having the earliest age of onset. Study participants were 42% (n = 46) male and 47% (n = 42). Some participants did not wish to answer all the questions, resulting in descriptive data that would not equal 100%. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721712445213">Table 1</xref> displays the demographic and descriptive data by African American ethnicity or black race and all others (white, Asian, Hispanic). Ethnicity was defined as Hispanic or non-Hispanic and race was defined as African American/black, white, Asian, American Indian, Alaskan Native, mixed, and other. Whites, Asians, and Hispanics were clustered together because the aim of this study was assessing beliefs of African Americans and ascertaining that their scores were distinguishable from those not expected to endorse Afrocentric cultural characteristics.</p>

Items were scored negative 3 to positive 3, keeping with Jones’ validated and reliable 29-item tool. Negative scores are low Afrocentric cultural identity and high scores represent high self-identification with the Afrocentric characteristics.

<title>Illness perceptions (representations) of diabetes</title>
<p>The Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire by Broadbent measures illness representations of illness in general.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712445213">23</xref></sup> Participants were asked to “Think only of [their] diabetes” when answering the 8-item survey. The items are scaled on a 0 to 10 scale, with low scores on the construct indicating less agreement and high scores meaning more agreement. Several items are reverse coded. The cumulative score indicate that one perceives diabetes to be threatening (high score) or nonthreatening (low score). The measure has been validated and is shown to correspond with the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire by Moss-Morris et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712445213">24</xref></sup> The items include one question to assess each illness representation construct. The items are: “How much does your diabetes affect your life?” “How long do you think your diabetes will continue?” “How much control do you think you have over your illness?” How much do you think your treatment can help your illness?” How much do you experience symptoms with your illness?” “How concerned are you about your illness?” “How well do you feel you understand your illness?” and “How much does your illness affect you emotionally?”</p>

<title>Analyses</title>
<p>SPSS version 16.0 was used to calculate descriptive statistics, conduct principal components analyses, and measure internal consistency reliability. Although the original TRIOS scale was well validated with factor analyses and criterion validity, we elected not to employ confirmatory factor analyses because of the novelty of placing the questions in a specific circumstantial context of diabetes. Exploratory factor analyses were conducted on the TRIOS scale using orthogonal varimax rotation with Eigen values accepted over 1. Steven’s guidelines for extremely small samples were utilized in determining factor loadings and naming of latent variables, resulting in very rigid criteria to prevent capitalizing on chance. Items with factor loadings over .80 were retained in each component.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721712445213">25</xref></sup> Latent variables accounting for 10% variance or more explaining Afrocentric cultural characteristics were named according to Jones’ original measure (temporality, rhythm, improvisation, orality, and spirituality). Cronbach’s alphas were calculated for each latent variable. Analysis of variance was used to detect if differences in TRIOS scores or illness representation were present based on categorical classification of age, gender, duration of diabetes, ethnicity, self-management education receipt, race, immigration to the United States, highest education level, annual income, and weight. Regression analysis was used to estimate the association between new TRIOS-Diabetes Care measure scores and Illness Perception Questionnaire scores for African American ethnicity/black race participants. The data were analyzed for overfitting of the model, whereby error can inflate the statistical relationships to the point of being significant in this study but unable to be replicated in future studies. Since we have a small sample size relative to the number of variables, statistical tests were utilized stringently to avoid a type 1 error as much as possible. For example, we ensured that outliers and standard deviations beyond 3 were not analyzed to prevent pulling of the mean in any one direction that could influence statistical significance. Cooks D was less than 1, indicating the absence of outliers beyond standard deviation of 3, and no leverage points approached 1, indicating that all points had a similar influence on the predictor variables.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The results of the orthogonal rotation on the entire survey resulted in six latent variables. Four of the variables accounted for 10% variance or more and were retained to develop the TRIOS Scale-Diabetes Care. Items hung together similar to the original TRIOS scale for the entire sample. Based on the factor loadings and percent variance accounted for, we retained 4 latent variables named spirituality, accounting for 24% variance; improvisation, accounting for 14% variance; orality, accounting for 11% variance; and rhythm, accounting for 10% variance. All items retained for internal consistency reliability estimation had factor loadings over .80. The Cronbach’s alphas were as follows: spirituality, α = .94; improvisation, α = .89; orality, α = .86; rhythm, α = .71. Temporality items similar to those of the original TRIOS scale related to planning in diabetes care were not retained due to poor reliability.</p>

<title>Results of Hypotheses Tests</title>
<sec id="section15-0145721712445213">
<title>Hypothesis 1</title>
<p>Hypothesis 1 stated that the Afrocentric cultural characteristics scale, TRIOS, adapted to the diabetes care context will discriminate by race or ethnicity, with those of African American descent scoring higher on each scale. In order to determine if the TRIOS measure continues to differentiate between black versus white racial groups as the previous TRIOS measure by Jones did, we conducted a factor analysis on each group separately. The factor analyses revealed that the TRIOS measure adapted to diabetes care resulted in latent variables that were consistent with Jones’ Afrocentric psychological theory. All of the items factored similarly to Jones’ original TRIOS measure for the African American/black subsample. The entire measure explained about 59% variance in Afrocentric cultural characteristics. Items clustered according to the theory with high loadings, revealing 4 latent variables that could be named planning (10% variance explained), improvisation (14% variance explained), orality (11% variance explained), and spirituality (24% variance explained). The temporality and rhythm items factored together as one latent variable, called planning for the purposes of this study.</p>
<p>Consistent with Jones’ theory, the items for the non-African American/non-black sample factored in an unexplainable way. Items from each TRIOS category clustered with one another with high loadings that can’t be theoretically explained and accordingly lack construct validity. It was unexpected that even the spirituality items did not factor together into one latent variable for the non-African American/non-black sample. It is possible that spirituality may be based more in a religious context for some non-African American participants. Several items in the diabetes context did not factor with loadings in the direction expected, consistent with the original TRIOS survey. The items were from the temporality construct, “It is important for me to plan ahead and have goals that organize my diabetes care” and “I have made extensive plans for the future of my diabetes care.” These items from the original TRIOS measure were expected to negatively load, yet they loaded in a positive direction. It is possible that this is because planning and organization are important prerequisites to diabetes self-care management. Planning for a future with diabetes implies that one is accepting that diabetes is long term. The perception of needing to plan for diabetes is a necessary antecedent for controlling the illness through self-management and preventing complications in the future. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145721712445213">Table 2</xref> displays the TRIOS items for the African American sample and the factor loadings and the internal consistency reliability coefficients. Items that loaded below .50 were not retained for any factor because of sample size limitations that could challenge the validity of the measure. Items that were at least .50 or above that loaded consistent with the original constructs from Jones’ work were retained.</p>
<p>Composite scores on the TRIOS measure were calculated. The mean TRIOS score for the African American ethnicity and/or black race sample was 16.4 (SD ± 22.6; range, –38-67). Analysis of variance using listwise deletion determined that significant differences on the TRIOS scores were not detected based on ethnicity, race, age, duration of diabetes, education, income level, body weight, or past diabetes education received.</p>
<p>Although the Afrocentric cultural characteristics scale TRIOS factored completely different for African American and/or black participants than for all others, the analysis of variance did not allow us to detect differences in TRIOS score by race or ethnicity, possibly due to sample size limitations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0145721712445213">
<title>Hypothesis 2</title>
<p>Hypothesis 2 stated that race will be less likely than the scores on the Afrocentric cultural characteristic scale to explain variance in illness representations such that the Afrocentric cultural characteristics scale adapted to the diabetes care context will be strongly associated with illness representations (commonsense model) of diabetes, an important predictor of diabetes self-care behavior and wellness. We proceeded by regressing scores on the Illness Perception Questionnaire onto ethnicity/race, the usual proxy for cultural characteristics, to determine its ability to explain the variance in illness perceptions of diabetes. One’s ethnicity/race did not significantly explain the variance in illness perceptions of diabetes, <italic>F</italic><sub>2,79</sub> = .33, <italic>P</italic> = .72. The composite score for African American and/or black participants for the illness perception questionnaire was calculated. The mean score was 54.6 (SD ± 17.5; range, 0-76). Next we set out to estimate the ability of cultural characteristics to explain the variance in illness representations of diabetes. We estimated the effect size of the association between TRIOS scores and Illness Perception Questionnaire scores using regression analysis. Afrocentric cultural characteristics in the context of diabetes care explained approximately 14% of the variance in illness representations of diabetes, <italic>F</italic><sub>1,35</sub> = 5.4, <italic>P</italic> = . 02, with a medium positive effect (β = .37, CI, .02-.36). Those with higher Afrocentric cultural characteristic scores in diabetes care tended to have less threatening illness representations of diabetes. Those who acknowledged less Afrocentric cultural characteristics in the context of their diabetes care had more threatening illness representations of diabetes. This indicates that Afrocentric cultural characteristics are protective under health threat conditions, consistent with Jones’ theoretical propositions that Afrocentric cultural characteristics are self-enhancing, protective, and self-motivating.</p>
<p>Finally, the Illness Perception Questionnaire scores were regressed onto each of the TRIOS measure subscales (temporality and rhythm—renamed planning, improvisation, orality, and spirituality). Spirituality was able to explain 10% variance in illness representations weakly (β = .32, CI, –.002-1.0), yet significantly, <italic>F</italic><sub>1,36</sub> = 4.1, <italic>P</italic> = .05. The other subscales when used alone did not explain any variance in illness representations. When the subscales were used collectively as opposed to a total score in the model, none of the Afrocentric constructs uniquely explained variance in illness perceptions of diabetes. This implies that the TRIOS measure must be used collectively indicating that the Afrocentric cultural characteristics work synergistically together to explain coping in the diabetes care context and ultimately determining the degree of perceived threat due to diabetes.</p>

<sec id="section17-0145721712445213" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to establish validity for the central hypothesis that an Afrocentric cultural characteristics measure would be more robust than using race and/or ethnicity alone at explaining the variance in illness representations of diabetes. Illness perceptions are well known to be associated with health behaviors and wellness. The psychometrics of an adapted version of Jones’ TRIOS scale was evaluated for validity and reliability. The TRIOS scale was adapted to be specific to the context of diabetes care. We questioned whether or not the self-enhancing and protective cultural characteristics theorized by Jones to be employed by African Americans in the face of threat or adversity would apply to the context of living with a health threat. We were able to demonstrate that the TRIOS measure theoretically discriminates between African American/black participants and other ethnicity/race participants. The findings of this study allowed us to infer that ethnicity/race self-categorization is less robust than cultural characteristics in helping clinicians understand how an individual views his or her illness.</p>
<p>Illness representations are shaped in the cultural context according to the Leventhal et al self-regulation theory. The cultural characteristics employed by African Americans according to Jones’ theory have evolved as protection in an oppressive environment that is linked to a legacy of racism experienced by African Americans in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712445213">21</xref></sup> Diabetes poses a threat to emotional and physical well-being that would employ cultural protective characteristics to enhance coping, such as feeling one has lost control over diabetes.</p>
<p>The data in this study can be inferred as demonstrating that collectively, the Afrocentric cultural characteristics, TRIOS (temporality, rhythm, improvisation, orality, and spirituality), influence an illness representation parsimoniously. Planning is important to diabetes self-management. The Afrocentric cultural characteristics, temporality and rhythm, that make up the planning construct in this study are in line with the illness perception questions. For example, feeling a need to stay on top of their diabetes care, such as not being late for a diabetes care event, is important for control and preventing consequences including emotional consequences such as anxiety. Planning ahead, yet not worrying about the future are items that are closely linked to control and preventing negative consequences of diabetes. Similarly, gaining strength from one’s belief in a higher power is useful for controlling diabetes to prevent consequences while not worrying about the future. Orality is similar to disclosure and the illness representation construct social consequences of diabetes. Disclosure of diabetes was shown to be associated with insulin and/or pill adherence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721712445213">26</xref></sup> Spirituality is thought to be deeply rooted in the health belief system of African Americans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145721712445213">27</xref></sup> and has been shown to be associated with diabetes care outcomes, including glycemic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721712445213">28</xref></sup> Spirituality contributed to explaining whether or not one perceives diabetes to be a threatening illness.</p>
<sec id="section18-0145721712445213">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The statistical conclusion validity is limited by sample size for the analysis of variance. The measure was administered as part of a larger study on the legacy of diabetes for those with whom a family history or hereditary predisposition to diabetes exists. The findings are not generalizable to African Americans without a hereditary predisposition to diabetes and should be studied on a more heterogeneous sample.</p>

<sec id="section19-0145721712445213">
<title>Clinical Implications</title>
<p>Having a tool that could assist clinicians with assessing the degree to which one identifies with cultural characteristics, especially spirituality, holds potential for tailoring talking points to motivate individuals to engage in self-care behavior and may inform interventions for those who appear to have inaccurate representations of their diabetes. A threatening illness representation of diabetes would be one that considers diabetes to be short term, uncontrollable, and with high consequences (ie, social consequences such as stigma). Furthermore, the findings support the notion that race and ethnicity are unlikely to provide clinicians with an understanding of the intersection between cultural views and illness beliefs. Clinicians can gain understanding of local populations by learning about the synergistic collection of cultural characteristics. Using talking points derived from cultural characteristics measures may offer a solution to closing communication gaps between providers and patients. Furthermore, illness perceptions can be changed to be more concordant with health care providers’ views and to be less threatening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721712445213">29</xref></sup> Clinicians may find the TRIOS measure useful to develop talking points. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145721712445213">Table 3</xref> contains some talking points that are culturally derived from the TRIOS measure. The cultural characteristics planning (temporality and rhythm), improvisation, orality, and spirituality likely offer self-protection and motivation for coping with diabetes. Tailored health threat communication is advantageous because it is personalized and as such has an incremental effect on memory,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145721712445213">30</xref></sup> which may facilitate learning.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article presents the results of a descriptive study that tested the central hypothesis that Afrocentric cultural characteristics robustly explain whether or not individuals found diabetes to be threatening. Ethnicity and/or race, the long-standing proxy for cultural characteristics used for understanding health behavior, was unable to explain the degree to which participants viewed their diabetes as a threat. Cultural characteristic measures have the potential to be used to develop talking points to understand patients’ views of diabetes. Health care provided with physician-patient concordance in race is preferred by many patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145721712445213">31</xref></sup> Less patient-centered communication styles have been reported when mainstream physicians care for African American patients with a dominant style.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145721712445213">32</xref></sup> Gaps in patient and provider concordance in illness representations (otherwise known as commonsense models of illness) exist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712445213">20</xref></sup> and influence health behavior and outcomes.
