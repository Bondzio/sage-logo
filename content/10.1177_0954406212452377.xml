<p>There are many reasons for offering a Special Issue on parametrically excited systems at this point in time. Here are the main motivators: (a) it is clearly of widespread interest to demonstrate the diversity of the origins of such systems on the one hand, and on the other to recognise the fact they are all, in general, defined by the existence of time-varying coefficients in the governing equation motion; (b) parametrically excited systems are characterised by particularly distinctive behaviour and phenomena; (c) they are associated with a vast number of applications in science and engineering, with emerging fields expanding through the rediscovery of the benefits of introducing intentional time-periodicities into certain systems of interest; and (d) last but not least – this current time can be seen as an anniversary – the article that represents a milestone for their investigation was published about 180 years ago by Faraday.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212452377">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406212452377">2</xref></sup> Thus, before immersing ourselves in the research collected in this Special Issue, it is logical and natural to look back to those pioneered researchers who set the scene at the end of the 19th-century and in the early years of the 20th-century.</p>
<p>Faraday<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406212452377">1</xref></sup> (22 September 1791 to 25 August 1867), a British scientist and philosopher, gave completely descriptive observations and findings organised under 129 headings, accompanied by 29 figures, related to <italic>the phenomenon of parametric resonance</italic>: notably that surface waves in a vertically excited fluid-filled container exhibited twice the period of the excitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406212452377">2</xref></sup> The German physicist Franz Melde<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406212452377">3</xref></sup> (11 March 1832 to 17 March 1901) noted this phenomenon when he created an experimental arrangement containing a string with one end tied to a rigid support and the other end fastened to the prong of a tuning fork: the longitudinally driven string performed transverse vibrations at a frequency nearly half that of the tuning fork. John William Strutt,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406212452377">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406212452377">6</xref></sup> 3rd Baron Rayleigh (12 November 1842 to 30 June 1919), an English physicist and a Nobel Prize winner, made significant improvements in the theoretical understanding of parametrically excited systems. He indicated that the phenomenon recognised by Faraday and Melde is manifested in an even simpler example: ‘a pendulum, formed of a soft iron bar and vibrating upon knife-edges. Underneath is placed symmetrically a vertical bar electro-magnet, through which passes an electric current rendered intermittent by an interrupter whose frequency is twice that of the pendulum’. He explained that the magnetic force produces the same effect as if gravity was periodically varied. In addition, he noted that the same equation of motion corresponds to ‘the case of a periodic variation in the effective mass of the body’. He also added that the same equation of motion can be obtained ‘by causing the point of support of a pendulum to vibrate in a vertical path’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406212452377">4</xref></sup> which is nowadays widely used as an illustrative example for a parametrically excited system. Rayleigh carried out theoretical investigations, showing analytically the main features of a parametrically excited oscillator: although the system considered is damped, the equilibrium position may become unstable, i.e. its amplitude of vibration can be unlimited in a certain region. He gave the expressions for its boundaries and explained that there is a critical value of damping that diminishes its existence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406212452377">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406212452377">6</xref></sup> In Strutt,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406212452377">5</xref></sup> these results were obtained using Hill’s method of infinite determinants. George William Hill<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406212452377">7</xref></sup> (3 March 1838 to 16 April 1914), an American astronomer and mathematician, was the first to use infinite determinants to study the equation containing multiple time-periodic terms with even arguments in connection with the orbit of the Moon so as to explain, to 8 and later 12 decimal places, observations of the distance to the Moon as a function of time. In view of this important contribution made by Hill, which was actually a reprint of the work that he published in 1877 at his own expense, the term ‘Hill’s equation’ is today related to the class of homogeneous, linear, second-order differential equations with time-periodic coefficients, which are considered to be a general form of the equation of motion of parametrically excited systems. Another equation of recognisable form in this field is named after French mathematician Émile Léonard Mathieu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406212452377">8</xref></sup> (15 May 1835 to 19 October 1890), who treated it analytically while considering the problem of vibrations of an elliptic membrane. The ‘Mathieu equation’ is a homogeneous, linear, second-order differential equation in which the coefficient of the linear term contains both a constant term and a time variant harmonic function. Fundamental results related to parametrically excited systems and Rayleigh’s findings were also enriched in 1906 by mathematician Andrew Stephenson:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406212452377">9</xref></sup> he pointed out that it is not only the double frequency effect that should be associated with parametric resonance, but that there is a whole series of cases when the excitation frequency is approximately related to the natural frequency of the system by 2/<italic>r</italic>, where <italic>r</italic> is any integer.</p>
<p>Since then this subject has assumed an important role in scientific investigations, posing challenging tasks and requiring constant and advanced improvements on both the theoretical- and application-driven aspects. The linear dynamics of parametrically excited systems has long been recognised as nontrivial, whereas their nonlinear dynamics have repeatedly been shown to be extremely rich and intriguing. Recently, a general interest in nonlinear dynamics and structural stability, together with new and beneficial applications, as well as the need to improve vibration performance and explore higher dimensional problems, has revived the subject. The following 10 research articles are seen to follow this trend and at the same time to underpin the reasons for creating this Special Issue.</p>
<p>This Special Issue opens with an exciting article by Rocio E Ruelas, David G Rand and Richard H Rand, ‘Nonlinear parametric excitation of an evolutionary dynamical system’. The article contains considerations of the nonlinear effects in the equation with periodic coefficients whose model corresponds to a model in the Rock–Paper–Scissors game, with biological and social applications and periodic effects that are potentially seen as fitness changes caused by seasonal fluctuations in the weather, or earning changes caused by seasonal variation in consumer spending. The subsequent contribution, ‘Nonlinear parametric vibrations of a composite column under uniform compression’ by Jerzy Warminski and Andrzej Teter is also concerned with a nonlinear problem, but the object of consideration is a prismatic, thin-walled composite column with a channel section and the two mode response is taken into account with a view to exploring its behaviour near the principal parametric resonances. Gang Liu’s and Robert G. Parker’s study, ‘Nonlinear, parametrically excited dynamics of two-stage spur gear trains with mesh stiffness fluctuation’ is one more belonging to the class of nonlinear problems, but is related to two-stage gear systems, with a model that includes key design parameters such as mesh stiffness variation, mesh phasing, contact ratios and mid-shaft stiffness, and offers results that provide guidelines for vibration reduction by tuning design parameters. The paper ‘Self-excited vibration of workpieces in a turning process’ by Xianguo Han et al. was also motivated by a practical problem – the dynamic interaction between the cutter and the workpiece during a turning process. Here, the cutter provides a moving load that is a source of parametric excitation, and the dynamic model includes the time-dependent reduction of the workpiece diameter and the regenerative chatter mechanism. Two turning experiments were carried out to validate the model proposed. The succeeding article by Matthew P Cartmell, Ivana Kovacic and Miodrag Zukovic is dedicated to the investigations of a special configuration exhibiting autoparametric interactions which involve three massive elements (two pendula and one rod) arranged in such a way that the vibrational response of some of them parametrically excites the other. An intriguing phenomenon is demonstrated in this system when one pendulum is decoupled and stops oscillating completely under certain conditions. The Special Issue then continues with a group of articles related to control and vibrations suppression. In the article ‘Bifurcation control for a parametrically excited cantilever beam by linear feedback’, Hiroshi Yabuno, Masahiko Hasegawa and Manami Ohkuma propose a control method for a parametrically excited cantilever beam to avoid the jumping phenomenon by shifting the bifurcation set based on linear feedback, which they also experimentally confirm. Then, Horst Ecker and Thomas Pumhossel suggest that parametric stiffness excitation can be employed to suppress self-excited vibrations in drive systems, as such vibrations may have a negative impact on performance. In his article ‘Experimental studies on damping by parametric excitation using electromagnets’ Fadi Dohnal adds his contribution to the existing idea of vibration suppression using parametric excitation, discussing experiments in a chain system, a flexible cantilever and a flexible rotor. In the article ‘Surface and volumetric effects in a fluid subjected to high-frequency vibration’, Iliya I Blekhman et al. present results that are suitable for the control and optimisation of some technological processes. Being inspired by Faraday’s work, they study theoretically and experimentally the phenomena appearing on a free surface and in the surface layer of an oscillating fluid, presenting some new results regarding the influence of surface effects on the average velocity of fluid flow. The Special Issue ends up with the article by Andrea Cardoni et al. on ‘Modal interactions in ultrasonic plate transducers for industrial applications’, which has been driven by recent applications of power ultrasound systems in the food industry, the environment, and within manufacturing. Their results are seen as very useful for the development of efficient ultrasonic devices in which one would be able to control certain nonlinear behaviour exhibited through modal interactions typical of autoparametric systems.</p>
<p>All the articles included in this Special Issue clearly emphasise the justifications listed at the beginning of this Editorial. Besides noticing this, the reader should also be aware that these articles raise many further questions to be answered in their conclusions, and that they propose and discuss directions for future research. Thus, in addition to enabling the reader to gain an insight into the current trends in the analysis and applications of parametrically excited systems, this Special Issue is meant to offer new and renewed ideas, as well as to initiate completely new lines of activity. We hope that this Special Issue will prove to be interesting and stimulating for our readers.</p>
