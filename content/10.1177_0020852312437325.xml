<p>Sanford Borins (2011) <italic>Governing fables: Learning from public sector narratives</italic>, Charlotte NC, Information Age Publishing, 291pp. ISBN 978-1-6175-4908 (pbk); 978-1- 61735-4915 (hbk).</p>
<p>Sandford Borins has written this book ‘to encourage public management to take the narrative turn’ (p.xi). He argues that narratives are such a ‘universal and compelling means of creating meaning and engaging an audience [that] they should be an essential way of communicating management concepts and skills’(p.3).</p>
<p>In the first chapter, he introduces core narratological concepts, reviews relevant literature and proposes a taxonomy of dominant fables and counter fables. His basic framework – which is then used throughout the book – consists of a 2x2 with personal growth/decline of the narrative’s protagonist as the two vertical columns and organizational renewal/decline as the two horizontal rows. Quite soon, however, (after 26 pages) Borins plunges into his empirical material, where he stays for the next 111 pages, until his final 25 page conclusion. The empirical matter he examines is, as he himself avers, highly diverse. We are introduced to films, both dramas and documentaries, television series, historical and policy analytic books, novels and a range of other material. So fans thereof can read a scholarly analysis of their TV favourites such as <italic>Yes Minister</italic> and <italic>The West Wing</italic>, or of political thriller movies such as <italic>Thirteen Days, </italic>but they will find these alongside much more ‘serious’ material such as Roy Jenkins’ analysis of Churchill’s opposition to appeasement, or Allison and Zelikow’s modern classic <italic>Essence of Decision</italic>. In all this the author is not seeking to establish the definitive interpretation or judgement on each of the tales: on the contrary, he insists on the advantages of ‘polyphonal’ narratives, and highlights the frequent presence of counter narratives, either alongside or lurking within some of our best-known stories of political and public service life. In the conclusions he revisits his 2x2 framework (see above) and finds it useful in, for example, showing that, taken together, US narratives are more diverse, or ‘balanced’ than those about the UK. Finally, he advances a ‘cumulative model of public sector leadership’. This model, he argues, consists of three narratives – a ‘<italic>public</italic> narrative of goal and agenda-setting, the <italic>internal </italic>narrative of decision-making and implementation; and the <italic>personal</italic> narrative of professional conduct, personal commitment and moral or ethical choice’ (pp.249 – italics in the original).</p>
<p>Borins is certainly to be congratulated for opening up this whole area to public administration students and scholars. And it is clear that this is no rushed foray into a potentially fashionable new territory. The author has been teaching narratives for many years and has been able both to collect an impressive range of detailed empirical knowledge and to mull and trim his positions on a series of the key conceptual and interpretive issues. Overall, this is a considered work, which benefits from the author’s evident long-time immersion in the narratives that he dissects. It is also, throughout much of its length, an enjoyable work to read (which certainly cannot be said of every academic text in our field!). There is a lot of deft interpretation of particular narratives, and it is always nice to have one’s own prejudices confirmed (the Cuba missile crisis movie <italic>Thirteen Days</italic> came out while I was teaching my own students <italic>Essence of Decision</italic> and, like Borins, I found it distinctly limp and a waste of a good opportunity).</p>
<p>At the same time there are some doubts – at least for this reader. I was not entirely convinced that the effort to introduce a generic, normative model of public sector leadership (mainly right at the end) was either convincing or necessary. Nor was I wholly persuaded that the diversity of materials (particularly given the acknowledged lack of any sampling procedure to ensure representativeness) provided a firm basis for much generalization. Are we really supposed to treat <italic>Yes Minister</italic>’s portrayal of leadership as somehow comparable to that in <italic>Essence of Decision</italic>? Is it really of so little importance that the one is a TV comedy, written for laughs, while the other is a scholarly work based on mountains of documents, interviews and careful analysis? Yes, they are both narratives, but created in radically different ways for fundamentally different purposes. The import of these differences is never fully discussed.</p>
<p>Another point of concern is the theoretical ‘harvest’ that can be gleaned from the book. By the end, the 2x2 mentioned above seemed a tad inadequate as the main vehicle within which the range of issues the book itself had raised were to be discussed. I had hoped for a deeper theoretical treatment of narrative polyphony, and perhaps some way of operationalizing that in narrative analysis. Whilst I share the author’s bias in favour of multi-vocal narratives, I did not find his concluding discussion enabled me to progress much beyond this instinctive and perhaps rather obvious preference. Nor did the brief opening overview of ‘narratology’ seem to yield many useful theoretical tools (or, if it did, such tools were not much used through the main empirical sections). This may have been partly because of the unexplained omission of the some of the specifically managerial and public administration literature dealing with ‘organizational storytelling’ (e.g. Boje’s works) or ‘decentred narratives’ in the public sector (e.g. Bevir and Rhodes).</p>
<p>In sum, I found this a thoroughly worthwhile text – and one that should prove especially handy for teachers. It offers a useful overview of a hitherto largely neglected aspect of our field. It contains a lot of shrewd, well-informed – and enjoyable – interpretation of narratives with which many teachers and students will already be familiar. It deploys a handy conceptual framework for classifying its subject matter. That it also leaves some important questions largely unanswered places it firmly in the company of many other good books.</p>
