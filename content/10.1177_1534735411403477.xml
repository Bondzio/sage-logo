<abstract>
<p>The present study aimed at evaluating the anticancer and radiosensitizing potential of juglone against a chemoresistant and radioresistant tumor (B16F1 melanoma) growing on C57BL/6J mice. Volume doubling time, growth delay, and median survival were used to assess the in vivo anticancer and radiosensitizing potential of juglone. In vitro radiosensitizing potential of juglone was studied using clonogenic, comet, and reactive oxygen species induction assays. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with sublethal doses of juglone caused a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth as evident from the growth delay and median survival values. Comet assay using tumor tissue and blood showed differential toxicity of juglone, where higher levels of DNA damage was seen in tumor tissue compared with blood cells. Pretreatment of tumor-bearing mice with optimum dose of juglone before radiation resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition compared with radiation alone. From the clonogenic assay, the authors observed a sensitization enhancement ratio of 1.37 for the combination treatment compared with radiation alone. Furthermore, comet assay studies revealed the potential of juglone to enhance the radiation-induced DNA damage and cause a delay in its repair. Juglone pretreatment before radiation also resulted in a significant elevation in the intracellular reactive oxygen species levels compared with radiation alone. In conclusion, the results of this study show the potential of juglone to inhibit the growth of melanoma in vivo. The study also revealed the potential of juglone to augment the radiation-induced cell death of melanoma cells, which may be attributed to oxidative stress–mediated DNA damage and its delayed repair.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As per the recent World Health Organization (WHO) report, cancer remains a major global health threat with an estimated worldwide death of 12 million by the year 2020. The effectiveness of radiation in combating cancer was established more than 100 years ago, and it still continues to be one of the mainstays of cancer therapy with approximately half of all cancer patients receiving radiotherapy in some form during the course of their illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534735411403477">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534735411403477">2</xref></sup> Chemotherapy, on the other hand, has developed more recently, and since then extensive research efforts in the field of drug discovery and development have yielded a respectable armamentarium of potent anticancer agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534735411403477">3</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the treatment of most human solid tumors remains largely palliative,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534735411403477">4</xref></sup> and thus the need for more effective antineoplastic agents still remains. Intrinsic tumor resistance and normal tissue toxicity appear to be 2 major biological determinants in the failure of chemotherapy as well as radiotherapy. It is now generally believed that the effective treatment of most solid tumors is less likely to be achieved with 1 “magic bullet” and that a combination approach involving second-generation chemotherapeutics along with other treatment modalities may be required to attain better therapeutic outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534735411403477">5</xref></sup> One of the strategies that has been proposed to improve the therapeutic outcome in cancer is to manipulate radiation-induced cell kill by combining a radiosensitizer or a chemotherapeutic agent along with radiotherapy. Many chemotherapeutic drugs have been combined with radiation with varying degrees of success, and many more are still under clinical evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534735411403477">6</xref></sup> Nevertheless, there is still a need to look for novel chemotherapeutic agents that could effectively be combined with radiation to improve the cancer therapeutic outcome.</p>
<p>Exploring the natural resources for the development of new anticancer agents has proven to be extremely beneficial. It is estimated that about 67% of the pharmaceuticals approved for cancer therapy during the period between 1974 and 1994 were derived from natural sources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534735411403477">7</xref></sup> Quinones comprise a broad class of phenolic compounds that exhibit an array of pharmacological properties and are widely distributed in nature. Plants that are rich in quinones have been extensively used in traditional folk medicine for the treatment of various ailments, including cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534735411403477">8</xref></sup> These compounds are of great interest to researchers, because of the fact that several important anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, mitomycin C, and so on contain the quinone nucleus. Many other natural compounds with quinone nucleus such as β-lapachone, plumbagin, and so on have also shown promising anticancer activity both in vitro and in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534735411403477">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534735411403477">9</xref></sup> Besides, several groups including ours have shown plumbagin to possess radiosensitizing potential as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534735411403477">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534735411403477">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Walnut (<italic>Juglans regia</italic> L) belonging to the family Juglandaceae has a long history of use in traditional folk medicine for the treatment of various ailments. Different parts of the tree are reported to possess antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, diuretic, laxative, and anticancer properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534735411403477">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534735411403477">15</xref></sup> The aqueous extracts of walnut are also reported to possess strong antioxidant properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534735411403477">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534735411403477">16</xref></sup> Herbal preparations of walnut are known to suppress the growth of spontaneous mammary adenocarcinoma in Swiss albino mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534735411403477">17</xref></sup> The major active ingredients of walnut include naphthoquinones such as juglone, α-hydrojuglone and β-hydrojuglone alongside others such as vitamin C, caffeic acid, ellagic acid, hyperin, and kaempferol. Juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4 naphthoquinone), a structural analogue of plumbagin is reported to possess potent cytotoxic properties in vitro against human cancer cell lines, including human leukemia (HL-60) cells, doxorubicin-resistant human leukemia (HL-60R) cells, human lung carcinoma (A549), and human gastric cells (SGC-7901).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534735411403477">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534735411403477">20</xref></sup> In an earlier study, we reported the effect of juglone on B16F1 melanoma cells in vitro and concluded that the cytotoxic potential of juglone was mediated by multifactorial mechanisms involving oxidative stress, cell membrane damage, and clastogenic effect ultimately leading to cell death by both apoptosis and necrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534735411403477">21</xref></sup> In the present study, we evaluated the in vivo anticancer potential of juglone against a chemoresistant and radioresistant B16F1 melanoma solid tumor model. To our knowledge, there are no previous reports about the radiosensitizing potential of juglone. Therefore, the present research work was also aimed at evaluating the in vitro and in vivo radiosensitizing property of juglone against B16F1 melanoma cells.</p>

<title>Animals and Tumor Model</title>
<p>C57BL/6J mice, procured from the National Institute of Nutrition (Hyderabad, India), were maintained under controlled conditions of temperature (23 ± 2°C), humidity (50 ± 5%), light (14 hours and 10 hours light and dark cycles, respectively) and were allowed access to sterile food and water ad libitum. The animal care and handling were according to the guidelines of the WHO (Geneva, Switzerland) and the Indian National Science Academy (INSA; New Delhi, India). For experimental purposes, 8-week-old to 12-week-old mice of either sex, weighing 20 to 25 g, from an inbred colony were selected. All the animal experiments were carried out with the prior approval from the institutional animal ethics committee (Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, India). Solid tumors were grown on the dorsal side of the mice by an intradermal injection of 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> viable cells.</p>

<title>Irradiation</title>
<p>All radiation studies were carried out using a <sup>60</sup>Co gamma teletherapy facility (Theratron Atomic Energy Agency, Canada) at the Shirdi Saibaba Cancer Hospital (Manipal, India). The radiation doses used in the present investigation were based on our earlier studies (unpublished observation).</p>
<p>For in vitro experiments, exponentially growing cells with or without juglone treatment were exposed to gamma radiation at a dose rate of 1 Gy/min and source to surface distance (SSD) of 73 cm. For in vivo experiments, local tumor irradiation was carried out at a dose rate of 1.33 Gy/min in a field size of 4 in. × 4 in. (10.1 cm × 10.1 cm). Tumor-bearing animals with or without drug treatment were anesthetized (50 mg/kg body weight (BW) of ketamine and 8 mg/kg BW of diazepam), immobilized in a specially designed, well-ventilated perspex box in such a way that only the tumors protrude out into the radiation field. All the other parts of the body were shielded with 4 half-value layer (HVL) of lead (5 cm thick) kept in a shielding tray fitted to the collimator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534735411403477">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

The slides were left to gel for 10 minutes at 4°C, before a third layer of 200 µL 0.75% LMPA was added to the slide and left for 10 minutes at 4°C. The slides were then dipped in cold lysing solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris base, and 0.2 M NaOH, 1% Triton X, 10% DMSO; pH 10) for at least 2 hours at 4°C. The slides were then transferred to an electrophoresis unit containing electrophoresis buffer (300 mM NaOH, 1 mM EDTA; pH ≥12.3), and were left immersed in the solution for 20 minutes to allow DNA unwinding before being subjected to electrophoresis. Electrophoresis was carried out for 20 minutes at a voltage of 0.7 V/cm and a current of 300 mA. Next, the slides were rinsed with neutralization buffer (0.4 M Tris; pH 7.4) and stained with ethidium bromide. The stained cells were then observed and photographed at 20× magnification using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51, Olympus Microscopes, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 515- to 535-nm excitation filter, a 590-nm barrier filter, and a CCD camera (Cool SNAP-Procf Digital Color Camera Kit version 4.1, Media Cybergenetics, Silver Spring, MD). Images of a minimum of 100 cells per treatment were analyzed using the Komet software (version 5.5, Kinetic Imaging Ltd, Bromborough, UK).

<title>Optimum dose selection for anticancer activity</title>
<p>Tumor-bearing animals were injected with single sublethal doses of juglone, namely, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mg/kg BW, and the tumor growth kinetics were monitored and recorded as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534735411403477">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534735411403477">Table 1</xref>.

Although the tumor size in mice treated with 0.5 mg/kg BW juglone reduced only marginally, the tumor size in mice treated with 1 and 1.5 mg/kg BW reduced significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) on day 14 compared with vehicle-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534735411403477">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534735411403477">Table 1</xref>). However, there was no significant reduction in the tumor volume when the dose of juglone was increased from 1 to 1.5 mg/kg BW.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Intrinsic chemoresistance/radioresistance as well as the presence of hypoxic cells make the effective treatment of most solid tumors a daunting task. To improve the therapeutic outcome in cancer, several attempts have been made to combine a chemical agent/radiosensitizer with radiotherapy. However, clinical usefulness of most sensitizers remains ineffective and controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534735411403477">2</xref></sup> As a result, efforts are now being directed at combining chemotherapeutic agents with radiation to improve the therapeutic outcome. In this regard, various chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, irinotecan, and so on have been combined with radiation with varying degrees of success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534735411403477">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534735411403477">31</xref></sup> However, chemoradiotherapy with conventional chemotherapeutic agents is associated with toxicity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534735411403477">32</xref></sup> which necessitates the search for novel anticancer compounds with radiosensitizing properties.</p>
<p>Owing to their ease of availability, cost-effective nature, and safer toxicity profiles, screening of plant and other natural products has gained considerable interest in modern drug discovery programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534735411403477">33</xref></sup> Walnut has been used in traditional folk medicines for the treatment of cancer. In the present study, we investigated the in vivo anticancer and radiosensitizing potential of the main active constituent of walnut, juglone, against B16F1 melanoma cells. The acute toxicity studies carried out using the probit analysis revealed that juglone administered by intravenous route had an LD<sub>50</sub> value of about 4.2 mg/kg BW. To our knowledge, there are no previous reports of any toxicity studies of juglone administered via intravenous route in mouse. However, Westfall et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534735411403477">34</xref></sup> reported an LD<sub>50</sub> value of 2.5 mg/kg BW in mice when administered through the oral route. Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS, National Library of Medicine) reported an LD<sub>50</sub> value of 25 mg/kg BW for juglone in mice administered via intraperitoneal route. In another report, administration of juglone in dogs at a dose of 5 mg/kg BW intravenously was found to cause slight hemorrhages in the lungs with no direct effect on cardiovascular system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534735411403477">35</xref></sup> From our studies, we observed slight toxic symptoms such as weight loss and reduced activity when juglone was injected at a dose of 3 mg/kg BW. However, no toxic effects were seen in animals treated with lower doses of juglone (up to 1.5 mg/kg BW).</p>
<p>Okada et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534735411403477">36</xref></sup> studied the effect of juglone in vivo against Ehrlich ascites tumor cells transplanted in Swiss mice and reported that juglone induced mitotic abnormalities such as decreased mitotic figures with concomitant metaphase arrest, indicating its therapeutic potential. Similar observation was also made by Sugie et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534735411403477">37</xref></sup> wherein male F344 rats administered with juglone had lower incidence and multiplicity of azoxymethane-induced intestinal tumors. On the contrary, Monks et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534735411403477">38</xref></sup> reported that juglone promoted the 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated skin carcinomas in SENCAR mice when applied topically for 40 weeks. In another study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534735411403477">39</xref></sup> juglone treatment promoted the skin tumors in female ICR/Ha Swiss mice pretreated with DMBA. However, treatment of these mice with juglone alone (without DMBA pretreatment) did not induce any tumors in these mice. This shows that there is still ambiguity regarding the in vivo anticancer potential of juglone, which formed the basis of the present investigation. In the present study, based on the acute toxicity data, sublethal doses of juglone were chosen for evaluation of its in vivo anticancer activity. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with juglone (1 mg/kg BW) resulted in significant inhibition (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) in tumor growth parameters as evidenced by the 5×, GD, and median survival values. Results from the present investigation indicate the potential of juglone as an anticancer agent, in agreement with the earlier findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534735411403477">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534735411403477">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reactive oxygen species are generally very small, highly reactive molecules that can be generated as by-products of cellular metabolism. The overproduction of ROS can cause damage to various biomolecules, including lipids, DNA, and proteins, ultimately leading to cell death. It is well documented that increased generation of ROS leading to an altered redox homeostasis is a common feature in most cancer forms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534735411403477">40</xref></sup> Taking that into consideration, it has been hypothesized that pro-oxidant compounds that induce ROS in the cells result in the dysregulation of already altered ROS levels in cancer cells leading to their loss of viability. In contrast, untransformed normal cells having a normal redox status are believed to be more resistant to the ROS insults. This diversity in the biochemical property of cancer and normal cells are now being exploited for their possible beneficial role in cancer therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534735411403477">41</xref></sup> To that effect, numerous studies have been carried out to evaluate the preferential sensitivity of cancer cells to small molecule pro-oxidants such as quinone-based electrophiles,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534735411403477">9</xref></sup> redox cyclers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534735411403477">42</xref></sup> and organic endoperoxides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534735411403477">43</xref></sup> Juglone, a small molecule pro-oxidant compound belonging to the quinone class, induces apoptotic and necrotic cell death in cancer cells essentially by oxidative stress–mediated mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534735411403477">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534735411403477">21</xref></sup> Based on the existing literature as well as from our previous studies, the observed anticancer potential of juglone in vivo may be attributed at least in part to its ROS-generating ability.</p>
<p>Reactive oxygen species are known to induce DNA damage by causing single-strand breaks, double-strand breaks, and so on. The alkaline version of the single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay is a versatile method to detect DNA single-strand breaks, double-strand breaks, or cross-links in virtually any cell type.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534735411403477">44</xref></sup> To study if the observed tumor growth inhibition could be a result of DNA damage induced by juglone, we measured the DNA damage levels in the tumor tissue. Juglone treatment caused a significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) elevation in the DNA damage levels of tumor tissue on day 1 posttreatment. On day 7 posttreatment, the OTM levels were only slightly higher than the control levels indicating repair of the damaged DNA. Thereafter, the OTM levels reached normal values. Tirapazamine, a well-known chemotherapeutic agent was also shown to induce DNA damage in the tumor cells in vivo, and this DNA damage in the tumor tissue was reported to be closely associated with the tumor cell kill.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534735411403477">45</xref></sup> From the present study, it is clear that the DNA damage induced by juglone in the tumor tissue could have resulted in the tumor cell kill ultimately resulting in the observed delay in tumor growth parameters.</p>
<p>Conversely, many chemotherapeutic agents are also reported to induce DNA damage in blood lymphocytes at their therapeutic doses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534735411403477">46</xref></sup> Therefore, to evaluate the effect of juglone on the DNA damage levels in the blood cells, alkaline comet assay was performed using the blood cells of the animals treated with optimum dose of juglone. Results indicate that on day 1 posttreatment, juglone induced significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) increase in the OTM levels, which, however, reversed back to normal levels on day 7 and thereon. The present results suggest that juglone also causes moderate levels of initial normal tissue toxicity, which, however, may be mitigated by formulating juglone using various drug-targeting strategies as was demonstrated for plumbagin in our earlier report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534735411403477">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>As discussed earlier, a bimodality approach involving a combination of chemotherapeutic agent along with radiation may help in improving the therapeutic outcome in cancer. Many of the potent phytochemicals such as plumbagin, withaferin A, and so on have been shown to augment the radiation-induced cell killing against various cell lines in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534735411403477">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534735411403477">48</xref></sup> Furthermore, our earlier studies have also demonstrated the radiosensitizing potential of these plant-based compounds against various cancer models in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534735411403477">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534735411403477">24</xref></sup> To our knowledge, there are no earlier reports about the potential of juglone to modify the radiation-induced cell killing. In the present study, exposure of melanoma cells to juglone prior to treatment with different doses of γ-radiation resulted in a significant reduction in the surviving fraction of melanoma cells in comparison with the radiation-alone group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1534735411403477">Figure 6</xref>). A sensitizer enhancement ratio of 1.37 was observed, which may be considered as significant levels of sensitization based on the earlier reports where SER value of &gt;1.1 were considered significant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534735411403477">49</xref></sup> Also, the analysis of the clonogenic assay data using the method of Chou and Talalay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534735411403477">29</xref></sup> gave a mean CI value of 0.99 suggesting that the interaction between juglone with gamma radiation was more of an additive nature and not synergistic. Several other clinically approved anticancer agents are also known to elicit an additive response in combination with radiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534735411403477">50</xref></sup> These findings further corroborate the results of our in vivo studies where treatment of mice with juglone before local tumor irradiation resulted in significant delay in the tumor growth parameters as compared with independent treatments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1534735411403477">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1534735411403477">Figure 5</xref>). These results clearly indicate the ability of juglone to enhance the radiosensitivity of melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo.</p>
<p>Effective repair of the damaged DNA is a critical event that determines the radiosensitivity of cancer cells, and inhibition of DNA damage repair is proposed to be one of the key mechanisms in radiosensitization. β-Lapachone, a plant-based quinone with established anticancer properties, was shown to enhance the radiosensitivity of cancer cells by inhibition of DNA repair mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534735411403477">51</xref></sup> In the present investigation, we studied the effect of juglone on the radiation-induced DNA damage and repair. At 0 time (immediately after various treatments), we observed significantly elevated OTM levels in the combination treatment compared with the individual treatments. Results from the repair studies shows significantly higher levels of OTM in combination treatment compared with the independent treatments even at 6 hours incubation. However, at the 24 hours incubation time point, the DNA damage levels in all the treatment groups reached baseline levels (data not shown). These results clearly indicate the potential of juglone to slow down the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage in melanoma cells, which may have resulted in the observed radiosensitizing effect of juglone.</p>
<p>It is a known fact that under aerobic conditions, radiation causes generation and accumulation of ROS such as superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical, and peroxyl radical, which could damage DNA as well as hinder its repair process. The intracellular antioxidant defense mechanisms normally help restore the elevated oxidative status in the cells. However, the presence of an agent that could deplete the cellular antioxidant defenses before subjecting to radiation could enhance the cell kill in cancer. We earlier reported the potential of juglone to deplete the intracellular reduced glutathione and induce oxidative stress in melanoma cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534735411403477">21</xref></sup> In the present study, combined treatment of melanoma cells with juglone followed by radiation resulted in significant increase in the intracellular ROS levels compared with the control as well as individual treatments, which may have resulted in the observed radiosensitization effect by enhancing DNA damage and slowing down its repair.</p>
<p>The toxicity of quinones is generally attributed to their ability to undergo redox cycling with consequent production of semiquinone radicals and ROS leading to oxidative stress–mediated cell death. Although the exact mechanism of radiosensitization potential of juglone is not clearly understood, the observed additive nature of its radiosensitizing potential against melanoma cells may be attributed to the ability of juglone to induce ROS-mediated DNA damage (comet assay) leading to cell death (as evidenced by clonogenic assay). Also, the presence of hydroxyl group on the position 5 of the naphthoquinone ring may have contributed to the observed ROS levels that resulted in the radiosensitizing effect of juglone. Similar findings were also reported in earlier studies where juglone with hydroxyl group in the fifth position was reported to considerably increase the toxicity against rat hepatocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1534735411403477">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534735411403477">53</xref></sup> However, the involvement of other mechanistic pathways in the radiosensitizing potential of juglone needs further investigation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study has shown the potential of juglone to inhibit the growth of melanoma cells in vivo. Also, this study has for the first time shown the potential of juglone to enhance the radiation-induced cell kill in melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. In view of these findings, and the existing earlier reports of its use in traditional folk medicine, juglone deserves further studies on its toxicity aspects using a spectrum of preclinical models.</p>
