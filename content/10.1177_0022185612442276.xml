<abstract>
<p>This article examines a number of decisions from 2011 that have further defined the scope and operation of the Fair Work Act 2009. The year 2011 was one in which Fair Work Australia took the dramatic step of terminating industrial action on the basis of a threat to the economy. This article considers that Full Bench decision, and the role of arbitration to resolve that dispute. Further, in a series of decisions dealing with good faith bargaining, Fair Work Australia has continued to demonstrate the common-sense approach it will take to applications under the Fair Work Act. The rights and obligations of bargaining representatives have now been made somewhat clearer. Finally, 2011 saw the adverse action provisions of the Fair Work Act go under the spotlight, including before a Full Bench of the Federal Court of Australia, demonstrating the approach the Courts will take to protect the exercise of workplace rights by employees.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0022185612442276" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>During 2011, Fair Work Australia (FWA) has continued to clarify the operation of the Fair Work Act 2009 (the FW Act), which is still in its relative infancy. This has been a year in which the operation of good faith bargaining (GFB) laws have continued to be explored, and the adverse action provisions of the FW Act have been considered in a series of cases handed down by the Federal Court and Federal Magistrates Court.</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, FWA in 2011 will be remembered most for its role in the Qantas dispute, which captured the interest of the mainstream press more than any other case during 2011. FWA made the most of the spotlight, flexing its muscles to suspend protected industrial action on the basis of a threat to the economy. This is the first time the Tribunal has made such an order on this basis.</p>
<p>Following from the Tahmoor cases in 2010, the Tribunal has also continued to outline how GFB will operate. In <italic>J.J. Richards &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Transport Workers’ Union of Australia</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022185612442276">1</xref></sup> (the <italic>J.J. Richards</italic> decision), the Tribunal recognized that a bargaining agent may in fact obtain a protected action ballot order before bargaining has commenced. In <italic>Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union v Australian Taxation Office</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022185612442276">2</xref></sup> (the <italic>AMACS</italic> decision), FWA explained how a bargaining agent’s obligation to provide relevant evidence will operate. In <italic>Sergeant Richard Bowers v Victoria Police</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022185612442276">3</xref></sup> (the <italic>Bowers</italic> decision), the Tribunal recognized that an employee who acts as a bargaining agent will not have an automatic right to be paid by his or her employer for such work.</p>
<p>Adverse action has also been a hot topic during 2011. Key decisions have been handed down by the Federal Court and Federal Magistrates Court, most notably in <italic>Barclay v The Board of Bendigo Regional Institute of Technical and Further Education</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022185612442276">4</xref></sup> (the <italic>Barclay</italic> decision), where a Full Bench of the Federal Court explained that an employer’s evidence of its subjective reasons for terminating an employee’s employment will not be the end of the Court’s inquiry. As has been confirmed in the later decisions of <italic>Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association v International Aviations Service Assistance Pty Ltd</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022185612442276">5</xref></sup> (the <italic>ALAEA</italic> decision) and <italic>Stephens v Australian Postal Corporation</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022185612442276">6</xref></sup> (the <italic>Stephens</italic> decision), a Court will need to look beyond an employer’s stated subjective intention to determine whether an employer has taken adverse action based on a workplace right.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0022185612442276"><title>The <italic>Qantas</italic> Decision</title>
<p>In October this year, the federal government demonstrated its willingness to use the FW Act to intervene in the industrial dispute between Qantas and the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association (ALAEA), the Transport Workers Union (TWU) and the Australian and International Pilots Association (AIPA) (hereafter the Unions). This application was made by the Federal Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations (the Minister), who urgently applied for an order under s. 424 of the FW Act, seeking termination or suspension of all protected industrial action being engaged in or threatened by Qantas and the Unions.</p>
<p>By the time of the Minister’s intervention, Qantas and the Unions had been negotiating several new enterprise bargaining agreements for some time. Alongside these negotiations, the Unions had engaged in protected industrial action, which included strikes, costing Qantas an estimated AU$70 m in damage. On 29 October 2011, Qantas took employer response action, grounding its fleet worldwide and giving notice of a lockout of employees commencing on 31 October 2011.</p>
<p>While the Minister is empowered under the FW Act to make a written declaration terminating protected industrial action if he or she is satisfied that the industrial action is threatening ‘to cause significant damage to the Australian economy or an important part of it’, the Minister instead applied to FWA for this same relief.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022185612442276">7</xref></sup> Accordingly, the Minister applied to FWA under s. 424(1) of the Act, seeking to suspend or terminate the protected industrial action on the basis that FWA should be satisfied that the protected industrial action has threatened, is threatening, or would threaten to cause significant damage to the Australian economy or an important part of it. An urgent sitting of a Full Bench of FWA was convened to hear the Minister’s application.</p>
<p>Unchallenged evidence was put before the Full Bench as to the importance of airline passenger and cargo transport to the economy, and the effect of the grounding of the Qantas fleet on the aviation and tourism industries. The Tribunal noted that the actions of the Unions, even taken together, would have been unlikely to threaten to cause damage to the tourism and air transport industries. However, Qantas’s proposed lockout of employees threatened to cause damage to, as well as indirectly threaten, those industries. Accordingly, the Full Bench considered that the requirements of s. 424(1) had been satisfied. On 31 October 2011, FWA terminated the protected industrial action with immediate effect.</p>
<p>In reaching its decision, FWA acknowledged that the protection of the economy under s. 424(1) should be balanced against the fact that protected industrial action is permitted under the Australian industrial relations system. Nonetheless, the primary consideration under s. 424(1) was the effect of the protected action on the economy. The Full Bench considered that suspension of protected industrial action would not achieve this outcome, and that immediate termination of that protected industrial action was appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
<p>The effect of the decision was that Qantas and the Unions had a period of 21 days, extendable by a further 21 days on agreement, during which they were to reach agreement on all outstanding issues in the absence of protected industrial action. However, no agreement was reached within 21 days, and nor was an extension of the bargaining period agreed to.</p>
<p>Each of the elements for compulsory arbitration of the dispute under s. 266 of the Act were satisfied – an order under s. 424 had been made, the negotiation period of 21 days had ended and the bargaining representatives had not settled all of the issues that were in dispute. FWA was then required to make an ‘industrial action-related workplace determination’ as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>This move to compulsory arbitration is a move ‘back to the future’. Compulsory arbitration has not been a feature of the Australian industrial relations landscape for some time. Practitioners, no doubt, will be eagerly watching to see how this matter plays out. The Qantas industrial dispute demonstrates the significant power that FWA has to intervene in industrial disputes in certain circumstances. The important point to bear in mind is that the Qantas situation is an unusual one. FWA explained that enterprise bargaining should be encouraged, and that protected industrial action has been a part of Australia’s industrial relations system for many years. However, if that industrial action threatens to cause significant damage to an important part of the Australian economy, then FWA will terminate the industrial action.</p>
<p>Clearly, a threat to cause significant damage to the Australian economy is a high threshold to cross. It is difficult to see many industrial disputes satisfying this threshold. Accordingly, employers should not see a lockout of employees as an easy short cut to ending employee protected industrial action. In almost all cases, it will not be possible. Unless the relevant degree of threat to the economy exists, or there is another basis for seeking to suspend or terminate the industrial action, employees and employers will be free to continue to engage in protected industrial action during negotiations.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0022185612442276"><title>Good Faith Bargaining Cases</title>
<sec id="sec4-0022185612442276"><title>The <italic>J.J. Richards</italic> Decision</title>
<p>In the <italic>J.J. Richards</italic> decision, a unanimous Full Bench of FWA found that a bargaining agent may obtain a protected action ballot order before good faith bargaining negotiations had commenced. The appeal to the Full Bench was from a decision by Harrison C to grant an application by the Transport Workers Union (TWU) for a protected action ballot under s. 443 of the FW Act.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022185612442276">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Under s. 443, FWA must make a protected action ballot order in relation to a proposed enterprise agreement if an application has been made under s. 437 and FWA is satisfied that each applicant has been, and is, genuinely trying to reach an agreement with the employer of the employees who are to be balloted.</p>
<p>The appellants contended that a protected action ballot order could not be made unless: a) bargaining with the employer had commenced; and b) if the employer was unwilling to bargain, the applicant had exhausted the steps available to him under the Act to force the employer to do so. The appellants submitted that evidence of both of these factors was needed to demonstrate that an applicant has been, and is, genuinely trying to reach an agreement. J.J. Richards argued that it would be ‘inconvenient and absurd’ if the Act permitted a protected action ballot order before these steps had been taken.</p>
<p>It further argued that if Harrison C’s construction of s. 443 was permitted to stand, default bargaining representatives may be able to obtain a protected action ballot order despite unsuccessful applications for majority support determinations, in turn giving rise to the potential for a small group of union members, without the support of the majority of the workforce, to disrupt work and affect the pay of others.</p>
<p>The Full Bench of FWA considered the meaning of ‘genuinely trying to reach agreement’ under s. 443 in the context of a protected action ballot order. The Tribunal considered a range of provisions of the Act, finding that if the legislature had intended that a protected action ballot order be available only if bargaining had commenced, then it would have employed language to that effect. The Full Bench found that the ordinary meaning of s. 443 is clear, and that there is no basis to depart from that ordinary meaning.</p>
<p>The Tribunal confirmed that the Act does not require a bargaining representative to seek a majority support determination, GFB order or scope order before that bargaining representative can be found to have been ‘genuinely trying to reach agreement’. Instead, where a bargaining representative legitimately requests an employer to bargain and it is clear that the employer does not agree to do so, then it is likely that the representative will have been found to be genuinely trying to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>The Full Bench explained that a default bargaining representative might obtain a protected action ballot order even though they had made an unsuccessful application for a majority support determination. It noted that this was in keeping with the right of the union to attempt to bring an employer to the bargaining table by resorting to the protected industrial action provisions. The Full Bench added that a decision to organize protected industrial action rather than pursue a majority support determination is not necessarily indicative of a lack of genuineness. Certainly, this case confirms that unions will have a number of strategic options open to them at the outset of negotiations.</p>
<p>With the information available, the Full Bench found that the TWU had been making a genuine attempt to reach an agreement with J.J. Richards at the time the protected action ballot order application was made. The Court determined that the Commissioner’s construction of the legislation was correct and the conclusion of facts was not affected by errors, and the appeal was dismissed.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0022185612442276"><title>The <italic>AMACS</italic> Decision</title>
<p>The <italic>AMACS</italic> decision considered the role of FWA in facilitating bargaining under the FW Act. The Australian Municipal, Administrative, Clerical and Services Union (AMACS) stated that the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) had failed to meet GFB requirements by not complying with s. 228(1)(b) of the Act, which requires bargaining representatives to disclose relevant information (other than confidential or commercially sensitive information) in a timely manner. The ASU sought orders that the ATO provide answers to three questions that had previously been put to the ATO, but which the ASU considered the ATO to have answered inadequately.</p>
<p>The ASU submitted that the ATO had not provided satisfactory responses to the questions to assist them in bargaining. It was not contended that the ATO was trying to ‘dodge’ questions, but simply that the questions had not been answered fully.</p>
<p>In response, the ATO submitted that it had provided relevant and timely information and had made a genuine effort to respond to the questions, but that the questions placed a considerable burden on the ATO because they were complex, broad and ambiguous and the ATO was not in possession of the information the ASU was seeking. The ATO submitted that it would be unreasonable to expect it to undertake analysis in order to comply with GFB obligations under the Act. The ATO relied on the decision of Smith C in <italic>Finance Sector Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022185612442276">9</xref></sup> as authority for the principle that there is no requirement to <italic>create</italic> information for the purpose of providing relevant information in accordance with the GFB requirements. The ASU responded that there was no restriction in the terms of s. 228(1)(b) that relevant information includes only information currently existing in documentary form.</p>
<p>Commissioner Deegan explained that she could only make a bargaining order if she was satisfied that the ATO was not meeting, or had not met, the GFB requirements. The evidence showed that the ATO had made considerable efforts to respond to the ASU questions in a timely manner and was not attempting to ‘dodge’ the questions. Accordingly, Deegan C was not satisfied that the ATO had failed to comply with GFB requirements.</p>
<p>Commissioner Deegan explained that the test under s. 228(1)(b) is not whether the information provided by one bargaining representative is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of another bargaining representative. Rather, s. 228(1)(b) requires bargaining representatives to provide ‘relevant information’. While Deegan C was not willing to accept the broad submission that a bargaining representative will never be required to compile information to meet the GFB requirements under s. 228(1)(b), her Honour was satisfied that an order requiring the ATO to conduct that sort of research would be unreasonable, if not impossible in some respects.</p>
<p>This decision demonstrates that while the Act requires a bargaining representative to disclose relevant information in accordance with its requirements, a reasonable and timely response will be sufficient to meet those requirements. A bargaining representative will not be required to provide more than a reasonable response, simply because a different bargaining representative is not satisfied with the reasonable information that has been provided.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0022185612442276"><title>The <italic>Bowers</italic> Decision</title>
<p>In the Bowers decision, FWA dismissed an application by bargaining representative Sergeant Bowers that Victoria Police provide him with paid leave to enable him to prepare for, and participate in, the enterprise bargaining negotiations that were taking place between Victoria Police and the Police Federation of Australia.</p>
<p>Sergeant Bowers, a police prosecutor, was the bargaining representative for 132 other police officers. He submitted that, due to his work commitments as a prosecutor, he was only able to attend a small number of meetings (which were generally held on a Thursday between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.), and he was unable to adjust his working hours in order to attend the meetings.</p>
<p>Victoria Police submitted that it was prepared to be flexible in rostering, and to allow Sergeant Bowers to take accrued leave so that he would not suffer financially as a result of taking part in the negotiations. Victoria Police also submitted that it made a number of assurances to Sergeant Bowers, including providing him with plenty of notice of meetings, as well as offering for a member of the police negotiation team to meet separately with him if he required it. Sergeant Bowers was also allowed to use office space, telephones and computers as required during negotiations.</p>
<p>Victoria Police argued that the FW Act did not impose a requirement that an employee bargaining representative be paid to attend bargaining, and nor did it impose a requirement that the employer schedule meetings when all bargaining representatives could be present, or that all bargaining representatives should be equally resourced in their ability to bargain. Victoria Police further submitted, on a public policy ground, that should someone who appointed themselves as a bargaining representative be entitled to have paid time off work to attend bargaining meetings, then that would encourage more people to appoint themselves, which may potentially create a logistical nightmare for bargaining. Finally, Victoria Police submitted that an employee bargaining representative is not acting in the course of his or her employment, but is simply representing his or her own (and perhaps others’) interests and should therefore not be entitled to paid leave to conduct such activity. Victoria Police advised that no other full-time employee had been given time off to participate in the bargaining, except those in Victoria Police management whose duties included negotiating on behalf of the employer.</p>
<p>In his response, Sergeant Bowers stated that it was not financially possible for him to attend the bargaining meetings in the way they had been progressing. He submitted that to do so would represent in excess of a one-fifth cut in pay during the period of negotiations and that all other options such as restructuring his work hours in order to take time off would be impractical.</p>
<p>When determining the application, Smith C considered whether Sergeant Bowers and those he represented were suffering a disadvantage in terms of the GFB requirements by him not having paid time off work to attend the bargaining meetings, and whether or not Victoria Police was taking Sergeant Bowers seriously and giving genuine consideration to his proposals and genuinely trying to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>Commissioner Smith found that there was no evidence that Victoria Police was trying to prevent Sergeant Bowers from attending bargaining meetings by not affording him leave, and nor was there any suggestion that Victoria Police was demanding a working pattern of Sergeant Bowers that would prevent him from participating in the current negotiations. Commissioner Smith stated that an employee who is acting in their capacity as a bargaining representative is undertaking an essentially voluntary act, and an employer declining to pay a person who volunteers to act as a bargaining representative does not amount to a failure to bargain in good faith. He noted that while there is clear statutory encouragement for enterprise bargaining between employers and employees, the requirement to bargain in good faith does not carry with it, in the circumstances of this case, a duty to provide paid leave to the bargaining representative. Nonetheless, Smith C acknowledged that some bargaining representatives are paid to attend negotiations, and he recognized that paying individuals to attend negotiations may be worthwhile to help build trust.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0022185612442276"><title>Adverse Action Cases</title>
<sec id="sec8-0022185612442276"><title>The <italic>Barclay</italic> Decision</title>
<p>The case of <italic>Barclay</italic> is a landmark decision, being the first time a Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia has considered the operation of the adverse action provisions of the FW Act. In this case, an employee, who was also a union official, alleged that he was subject to adverse action due to being a union official engaging in industrial activity.</p>
<p>Mr Barclay was employed as a senior teacher at the Bendigo Regional Institute of Technical and Further Education (BRIT). He was also the sub-branch President of the Australian Education Union (AEU). In his union capacity, but using his work email, Mr Barclay sent an email to AEU members who were employees of BRIT, in which he stated that several union members had reported that they had witnessed or been asked to produce false and fraudulent documents for the upcoming BRIT reaccreditation audit. Mr Barclay had not raised these allegations with BRIT management prior to sending this email. In the email, Mr Barclay also warned the recipients of the email not to create false documentation and encouraged them to contact the AEU if they needed advice or support in relation to the matter.</p>
<p>The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of BRIT became aware of Mr Barclay’s email, and he asked Mr Barclay to show cause as to why he should not be disciplined for failing to report the alleged misconduct to senior management. Mr Barclay was subsequently suspended on full pay, denied access to his work email account and directed not to attend BRIT’s premises for the duration of the suspension. Mr Barclay and the AEU alleged that these actions contravened s. 346(a) and (b) of the Act as they were adverse actions taken by BRIT because Mr Barclay was a member of the AEU who was involved in industrial activities. While BRIT conceded that the measures taken were indeed ‘adverse actions’, they submitted that those actions were not taken for a prohibited reason.</p>
<p>Mr Barclay was unsuccessful at first instance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022185612442276">10</xref></sup> Justice Tracey found that adverse action had been taken; however, evidence of the CEO’s subjective intention for engaging in the conduct led to a conclusion that the action was not taken for a prohibited reason. This was consistent with previous cases under the predecessor of s. 346, which proceeded on the basis that the employer’s subjective reasons for taking the action go directly to the issue of whether such action was taken for a prohibited reason. The CEO provided a convincing and credible rationale as to why she undertook the steps she did, demonstrating that she was concerned by the statement that false and fraudulent documentation had been prepared for the purposes of the audit. The CEO wished to establish whether there was any foundation for the allegation. Mr Barclay and the AEU appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court.</p>
<p>The Full Court of the Federal Court, by majority, found in favour of Mr Barclay and AEU. Justices Gray and Bromberg found that Mr Barclay was an officer of the AEU, and that in sending the email in question, Mr Barclay was acting in his union capacity. Justices Gray and Bromberg held that the central question under s. 346 is:<disp-quote>
<p>why was the aggrieved person treated as he or she was? If the aggrieved person was subjected to adverse action, was it ‘because’ the person did or did not have the attributes, or had or had not engaged or proposed to engage in the industrial activities, specified by s 346 in conjunction with s 347?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022185612442276">11</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Justices Gray and Bromberg held that in determining the answers to these questions, the subjective intention of the employer will be relevant, but it will not tell the whole story. Instead, the ‘real reason’ for the conduct needs to be ascertained. Accordingly, a Court must inquire as to what actuated the conduct of the employer, rather than what the employer thinks he or she was actuated by. The real reason for the adverse action may be conscious or unconscious, and where unconscious, the adverse action will not be excused simply because the employer had a benevolent intent.</p>
<p>Justices Gray and Bromberg found, on the facts, that it would be impossible for BRIT to divorce from its action the objective fact that the email was sent by Mr Barclay in his union capacity and as part of his union activities. Accordingly, their Honours found that a reason for BRIT taking adverse action against Mr Barclay was because he was a union official and engaged in industrial activity.</p>
<p>Their Honours also explained that in determining whether adverse action has been taken based on the exercise of a workplace right, it would not be relevant to compare the treatment of the employee in question with a consideration of how another employee who acted in the same way would have been treated. Their Honours distinguished this approach from the approach taken to contraventions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth), under which a contravention will only be established by comparing the treatment of the person concerned with the treatment of another person without the disability. No such ‘comparator’ test is relevant under the FW Act. The FW Act protections focus on the safeguarding of particular employees, rather than considering how another employee who acted in the same way may have been treated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022185612442276">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Justice Lander described the test that should be taken by the Court as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>In assessing whether or not the persons’ evidence ought to be accepted, the Court will no doubt have regard to all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the taking of the adverse action to determine whether or not the reason which is claimed to be the reason for taking the adverse action is truly stated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022185612442276">13</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Accordingly, the Court agreed that BRIT was required to establish that the real reason for the conduct taken against Mr Barclay was dissociated from the real reason or reasons for the conduct taken against him. However, Justice Lander dissented on the basis that the primary judge had considered the decision-maker’s evidence, and that it could not be said that the primary judge did not weigh up that evidence or exclude any other evidence.</p>
<p>This case makes it clear that in seeking to discharge the reverse onus of proof, employers will need to be able to demonstrate that an employee’s exercise of a workplace right was not even an unconscious or unintentional reason for the employer’s adverse action. To fall outside the ambit of s. 346, the employer must objectively show that the real reason (or reasons) for the action taken against the employee is ‘dissociated from the circumstances’ of the aggrieved person exercising a workplace right or engaging in industrial activity. Employers should exercise caution when contemplating action against employees who have exercised a right in their capacity as a union member, official or as part of their industrial activities. Particular regard must be had to the type of activity the employee is engaging in to determine whether it is within the scope of employment or a protected activity under ss 346 and 347.</p>
<p>BRIT has argued that the consequence of the Court’s decision would be that an employer could never discharge the reverse onus of proof where an employee, acting in their capacity as a union official, engaged in misconduct. At the time of writing, the Full Court of the Federal Court remains the highest appellate consideration of these provisions. However, BRIT has been granted special leave to the High Court to challenge the Full Court of the Federal Court ruling.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022185612442276">14</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0022185612442276"><title>The <italic>ALAEA</italic> Decision</title>
<p>The <italic>ALAEA</italic> decision demonstrates the importance of industrial freedom of association under the FW Act. In this decision, the Federal Court sent a strong message to employers that employees have a right to raise concerns about their pay rates and entitlements without the fear of being sacked or victimized.</p>
<p>Mr Puspitono was employed by the International Aviation Safety Association (IASA) as a licensed aircraft maintenance engineer. Mr Puspitono had complained to IASA’s management regarding insufficient overtime and superannuation payments, and issues with his roster. Some, but not all, of these issues were addressed by IASA. On 7 April 2009, Mr Puspitono was scheduled to work until 5:30 p.m., but during that shift, his hours were rescheduled so that Mr Puspitono was to work overtime beyond 5:30 p.m. Mr Puspitono sought an assurance that this overtime work would be paid. He was not given that assurance, and accordingly left work at 5:30 p.m. without authorizing the release of a late scheduled aircraft.</p>
<p>Mr Puspitono’s employment was terminated on 5 May 2009; however, following an unfair dismissal application, the Federal Court made consent orders for his reinstatement. Mr Puspitono returned to work on 24 July 2009. Shortly after the reinstatement, in response to a renewal authorization application, IASA assessed Mr Puspitono’s performance as unsatisfactory. IASA passed this assessment on to one of its major clients, the Indonesian airline Garuda, which consequently did not reauthorize Mr Puspitono’s qualification as an engineer. As a result, on 16 October 2009, Mr Puspitono’s employment was again terminated.</p>
<p>The court held that IASA did not discharge its onus in proving that it did not take adverse action against its employee. Accordingly, the Court found that IASA contravened ss 340 and 346 of the Act in dismissing Mr Puspitono, in making a negative assessment of him and in sending that negative assessment to Garuda.</p>
<p>In deciding that both the making of the negative assessment and the forwarding of the assessment to Garuda constituted an adverse action, Barker J had particular regard to the real and substantial impact of the negative assessment on the employee’s position. The manager who made the assessment had only known the employee for a short amount of time, and the surrounding information he used to form the assessment was hearsay. The assessment made Mr Puspitono’s continued employment less secure, because without the authorization, he was at risk of being dismissed. The subsequent action of IASA in sending the assessment to Garuda made Mr Puspitono’s employment even less secure, as the likelihood of authorization being withheld and dismissal following was even greater. Barker J noted that the failure of IASA to call evidence from the management staff member who made the decision to send the assessment to Garuda was an additional factor relevant to IASA’s failure to discharge its onus in respect of the adverse action.</p>
<p>Mr Puspitono was awarded AU$76,553 in compensation, which included an amount paid by Mr Puspitono for his return to Indonesia after his visa was cancelled following the termination. Non-economic loss of AU$7500 was awarded, and Barker J held that a pecuniary penalty should be awarded as well.</p>
<p>Following the approach in <italic>Barclay</italic>, Barker J held that the identified adverse action was taken ‘because’ the employee tried (unsuccessfully) to exercise his identified workplace right and/or because he (successfully) exercised it through the union representatives. The case confirms that the new adverse action protections under the Act can and will be enforced, despite the string of recent unsuccessful claims that have been heard. In view of the outcome of this case, employers should take great caution when responding to the actions of an employee engaged in industrial activity.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-0022185612442276"><title>The <italic>Stephens</italic> Decision</title>
<p>Continuing in the line of cases post-<italic>Barclay</italic>, the Federal Magistrates Court in the <italic>Stephens</italic> decision confirmed that in order to successfully discharge the reverse onus of proof in defending an adverse action claim by an employee, an employer must prove the real reasons for its decision.</p>
<p>Mr Stephens had been employed by Australia Post as a driver and sorter on a fixed-term contract. On 3 December 2009, he sustained a work injury that resulted in him being unfit to attend work on several occasions. Mr Stephens completed the relevant paperwork for workers’ compensation under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1998 (Cth) (the SRC Act) and returned to work on suitable duties. However, Australia Post did not receive Mr Stephens’ paperwork until 6 January 2010. Mr Stephens was terminated on 7 January 2010 on the basis of misconduct during two incidents that occurred on 5 January 2010. The first incident involved Mr Stephens’ failure to pick up mail according to his schedule, and the second concerned a confrontation he had with his supervisor. Mr Stephens provided explanations for both incidents, namely that a conversation with his area manager about his compensation claim had led to him being behind time on his pick-ups, and the confrontation, which resulted in him swearing at his supervisor, was a one-off incident that occurred in the heat of the moment.</p>
<p>Mr Stephens submitted that in terminating his employment, Australia Post was in contravention of s. 340(1); it was an adverse action under s. 342(1) item 1(a) taken because he had workplace rights under the SRC Act, and because he had exercised some of those rights and could exercise other rights. Mr Stephens submitted in the alternative, under s. 340(1)(b), that he was terminated in order to prevent him from exercising his workplace rights under the SRC Act. Second, Mr Stephens alleged that the termination contravened s. 351 since it was taken because of a physical disability suffered as a result of the work injury. Third, he submitted that the termination contravened s. 352 since it occurred because he had been temporarily absent from work due to his injury. Mr Stephens claimed an order for reinstatement as consequential relief under s. 545(2)(c) of the FW Act.</p>
<p>Federal Magistrate Smith rejected Australia Post’s threshold contention that the termination was incapable of being an adverse action. Australia Post argued that any benefits to which Mr Stephens was entitled would not be under a ‘workplace law’ within the definition of ‘workplace rights’ in s. 341. However, the Court found that the SRC Act fell within paragraph (d) of the definition of ‘workplace law’ as defined in s. 12 of the FW Act. Accordingly, Mr Stephens had workplace rights under this Act, and the reverse onus was on Australia Post to establish that Mr Stephens’ termination did not occur because of the existence, or possible future existence, of any of the rights under the SRC Act, and that it did not occur for the reason or with the intention of preventing him from exercising any right under the SRC Act.</p>
<p>Federal Magistrate Smith did not accept that Australia Post had discharged this onus. Despite arguments submitted by Australia Post that Mr Brennan, the person who made the decision to terminate the employee, based his consideration only on the two factors outlined in the letter of termination dated 7 January 2010, Smith FM stated that this evidence was difficult to accept given:
<list id="list1-0022185612442276" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the doubts as to Mr Brennan’s credibility as a witness and the reliability of his evidence (he had a poor memory and guarded presentation when questioned at trial);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the almost total lack of contemporaneous documentation as to the investigations and deliberations leading to the decision;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the unexplained unfairness in terms of the procedures implemented;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the disproportionate nature of the decision; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the unexplained failure of Australia Post to call a significant witness from its human resources department who advised the decision-maker.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Importantly, Smith FM stated that other considerations appeared to be manifestly relevant to such a serious decision as termination, for example, consideration of the employee’s excuses and explanations, his general work history and contribution, as well as wider workplace considerations such as the effects of the summary dismissal on the organization’s productivity and operations. Accordingly, consideration of the employer’s financial liabilities in relation to the employee’s continuing employment, particularly in relation to the pending compensation claim, would also be potentially relevant considerations. Australia Post failed to explain how these various considerations were identified and assessed, and how they were then either given weight or excluded from the final decision. Although the evidence did not lead the court to a satisfactory conclusion as to the true reasons for the decision, the employer did not establish that the reasons were disassociated from the circumstances of the employee’s workplace rights.</p>
<p>First, this case demonstrates that the protection of workplace rights is not limited to those that directly arise under the FW Act itself. Other legislation that regulates the relationship between an employer and employee may be found to constitute a workplace law under the Act, and accordingly be classified as a ‘workplace right’ under s. 341. Second, this decision makes it clear that in order to defend claims of adverse action, employers will be required to have reliable evidence of the decision-making process that leads to adverse action being taken.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec11-0022185612442276" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The year 2011 has been a landmark for FWA and the FW Act. The Qantas dispute has demonstrated FWA’s significant power to intervene in certain industrial disputes, and the return to an arbitrated outcome for this dispute has piqued the interest of many commentators. While it is difficult to point to other employers who, by way of a lockout, might similarly threaten the Australian economy, this case demonstrates the range of measures FWA has in its arsenal to resolve certain disputes.</p>
<p>FWA has continued to demonstrate a common-sense approach to GFB, such as by finding that the requirement of a bargaining representative to provide relevant information may be satisfied where reasonable efforts have been made, even where the information provided does not meet the objectives of the requesting bargaining representative. FWA has also found that a bargaining representative may obtain a protected action ballot order even where bargaining has not yet commenced. In a separate decision, FWA confirmed that an employee who is also a bargaining representative will not ordinarily be entitled to be paid for work performed as a bargaining representative.</p>
<p>Finally, the Courts have demonstrated the importance of the general protection provisions of the Act, and shown a willingness to enforce these provisions where appropriate. In particular, the decided cases demonstrate the importance of freedom of association for employees, and, on the other hand, the caution that employers should exercise when dealing with employees enjoying workplace rights. The right of employees to raise concerns about their pay rates and entitlements will be protected by the Courts.</p>
<p>The Courts have confirmed that an employer must discharge the burden of dissociating the employer’s adverse action from the employee’s exercise of his or her workplace rights. Further, as <italic>Barclay</italic> and later authorities have demonstrated, an employer’s subjective intention will not be the end of a Court’s inquiry. A Court will always need to look behind an employer’s stated intention to determine the true reason for an alleged adverse action.</p></sec>
