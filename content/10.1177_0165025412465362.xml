<abstract>
<p>The current study aimed at investigating own- vs. other-species preferences in 3-month-old infants. The infants’ eye movements were recorded during a visual preference paradigm to assess whether they show a preference for own-species faces when contrasted with other-species faces. Human and monkey faces, equated for all low-level perceptual characteristics, were used. Our results demonstrated that 3-month-old infants preferred the human face, suggesting that the face perception system becomes species-specific after 3 months of visual experience with a specific class of faces. The eye tracking results are also showing that fixations were more focused on the eye area of human faces, supporting the notion of their importance in holding visual attention.</p>

<p>Perceptual narrowing is a domain-general developmental phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165025412465362">Scott &amp; Monesson, 2009</xref>), in which the perceptual system from being broad at birth becomes fine-tuned as a function of experience. This phenomenon has been described as a decline in the capacity to discriminate unfamiliar or rare stimuli during the first year of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165025412465362">Nelson, 2001</xref>). Initially, the perceptual systems allow young infants to respond to any inputs. Then, as infants will be selectively exposed to specific classes of stimuli, a fine-tuning will take place only for the stimuli experienced in the species-typical environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165025412465362">de Schonen, 1989</xref>). Some authors have suggested that this perceptual narrowing may account for the improvement that is observed in several aspects of perceptual development over the first years of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0165025412465362">Scott, Pascalis, &amp; Nelson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In face perception, several studies have demonstrated that the ability to differentiate between two faces within an uncommonly experienced face category (other species or other race) declines in infants from 6 to 9 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165025412465362">Kelly et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165025412465362">Pascalis, de Haan, &amp; Nelson, 2002</xref>). This narrowing phenomenon also extend to non-primate faces such as sheep’s faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165025412465362">Simpson, Varga, Frick, &amp; Fragaszy, 2011</xref>) and can be prevented by providing infants with experiences with those unfamiliar categories of faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165025412465362">Pascalis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165025412465362">Heron-Delaney, Anzures et al., 2011</xref>). These data on face discrimination agree with the hypothesis that early experiences in species-specific environments affect the developmental process of the perceptual system which becomes “expert” in processing some stimuli rather than others.</p>
<p>Those studies leave open the question of whether or not infants will develop a preference for their own-species faces in the same time that they specialized for their processing, and whether or not the specialization is associated with modification of the visual exploration of own- versus other-species faces. In particular, as the human eye has a unique appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165025412465362">Kobayashi &amp; Kohshima, 1997</xref>), it might attract more attention than other animals’ eyes.</p>
<p>The hypothesis that infants prefer the most prototypical faces in their own environment was supported by differential looking-time experiments showing a preference for the gender of their principal caretaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165025412465362">Quinn, Yahr, Kuhn, Slater, &amp; Pascalis, 2002</xref>) and for the own-race faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165025412465362">Bar-Haim, Ziv, Lamy, &amp; Hodes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165025412465362">Kelly et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165025412465362">2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding the species, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165025412465362">Heron-Delaney, Wirth, and Pascalis (2011</xref>) demonstrated that newborns, 3.5- and 6-month-old infants paid more attention to pictures of human beings than of non-human primates. They concluded that newborns’ exposure to human faces during their first few days of life was sufficient to develop a representation of human faces that differentiate human from non-human primate faces. However, the preference could have been related to the difference in the low-level perceptual properties between the two stimuli that concerns the presence or absence of fur. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165025412465362">Di Giorgio, Leo, Pascalis, &amp; Simion (2012</xref>) tested neonates’ preference for a human face (HF) and a monkey face (MF) equated for all the low-level perceptual properties. They did not find a preference, suggesting that Heron-Delaney, Wirth et al.’s (2011) result for neonates was more likely due to the physical and perceptual characteristics of the pictures used than a precise representation of a human face.</p>
<p>The purpose of the present study was to assess whether 3-month-olds show a preference for own-species faces when contrasted with non-human primate faces, employing the same controlled visual stimuli used by Di Giorgio and colleagues. We chose to test 3-month-old infants because previous behavioural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165025412465362">Kelly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165025412465362">Quinn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0165025412465362">Turati, Valenza, Leo, &amp; Simion, 2005</xref>) and neurophysiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165025412465362">Halit, de Haan, &amp; Johnson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0165025412465362">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002</xref>) suggested that the first signs of cortical specialization for faces can be observed around this age.</p>
<p>We predicted that, due to their extensive experience with human faces, 3-month-old infants would look longer at the human face than at the monkey face. In addition, we employed an eye-tracking system to compare the spatial repartition of eye-fixations for the two different categories of faces. Previous eye-tracking studies have found different patterns of exploration for different categories of faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025412465362">Gallay, Baudouin, Durand, Lemoine, &amp; Lecuyer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165025412465362">Liu, Quinn, Wheeler, Xiao, Ge, &amp; Lee, 2011</xref>). For instance, 4-month-old infants spent more time exploring the internal features when the faces were presented upright and the external features when they were upside-down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025412465362">Gallay et al., 2006</xref>). Asian infants from 4 to 9 months of age exploring same- and other-race faces show a decline in fixation duration for the internal features with age for the other-race faces, but not for the same-race faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165025412465362">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). To our knowledge, no studies have investigated infants’ face fixation when presented with non-human faces. In order to avoid assumptions about the location and size of the observers’ areas of interest, we used a parametric method for the analysis of fixation pattern. This method, called <italic>i</italic>Map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165025412465362">Caldara and Miellet, 2011</xref>), highlights the areas of the images where the fixation number, or duration, are statistically larger and can be used to assess difference in fixation patterns between stimuli.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 10 Caucasian 3-month-old healthy and full-term infants (5 females, <italic>M<sub>age</sub> =</italic> 97.6 days). Seven additional infants were tested but not included in the final sample. All the infants included in the final sample looked at the two Areas of Interest (AOI) for each face (eye region and mouth region). Five of the excluded babies showed a strong position bias for all trials (that is, they looked to one direction more than 90% of the time) and two did not look to the eye region of any face at all. Infants were tested only if awake and in an alert state after parents gave their informed consent.</p>

<title>Stimuli</title>
<p>Four greyscale digitized full-frontal images of human and monkey faces (Rhesus Macaques) were prepared using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0165025412465362">Figure 1</xref>). The human faces (Psychological Image Collection at Stirling [PICS]; http://pics.stir.ac.uk) were the same stimuli used in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165025412465362">Di Giorgio et al. (2012</xref>). Pairs of stimuli comprising a human face and a monkey face were presented side by side on the screen. Monkey faces were manipulated, taking off the hair on the cheeks, to equate HF and MF for all the low-level variables (that is, low-spatial frequency, contrast and luminance). The stimuli were about 18.5 cm high x 13.5 cm wide (about 34° x 26° of visual angle).</p>

<title>Apparatus</title>
<p>Infants were placed in an infant seat at a distance of about 60 cm from a 19-inch (1024 x 768 pixels) computer screen where the stimuli were presented. A system for the automatic registration of eye movements made by Applied Science Laboratories (ASL) was employed and consisted of an infrared camera located at the bottom of the computer screen. The eye-tracking system automatically detected the position of the pupil and the corneal reflection of the infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in the eye. Because these signals changed as a function of the observer’s gaze direction, the apparatus determined, with a frequency of 50 Hz, the x–y coordinates corresponding to the participant’s fixation points during stimulus presentation. Stimulus presentation and data collection were performed using E-Prime 1.1.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0165025412465362">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Each infant was tested on a single occasion. The experiment started with a three-point calibration phase, immediately followed by the test phase. During the calibration, a smiley face cartoon was presented in the centre of the screen. When the infant started to look at it, the smiley face moved to the top left corner of the screen and remained in this position until the infant fixated on it. Then, it moved to the bottom right corner and remained in this position. These three positions were used to compute the pupil-corneal reflection from three points on the screen, allowing the system to derive gaze direction during test phases. The calibration’s accuracy was checked and repeated if necessary. A visual preference procedure adapted to 3-month-old infants was used. Applying the ASL algorithm, a fixation was defined as a period of at least 100 ms during which the fixation point did not change by more than 1 degree of visual angle. The experimental session began with the presentation, in the middle of the screen, of a central fixation point particularly attractive for the infant (i.e., a coloured moving smiley). This central fixation point was used to attract infants’ attention toward the computer screen where the stimuli were shown, and to check that the infants’ gaze was aligned with the horizontal midline of the screen during the entire experimental session. As soon as the infant looked at the central fixation point, the first pair of stimuli, a HF simultaneously presented together with a MF, automatically appeared on the computer screen and the central fixation was removed. Each pair was presented for 8 seconds. Then, the central fixation point reappeared in the middle of the screen and the trial loop started again. Each of the two pairs of stimuli was presented five times, in a pseudorandom sequence, for a total of 20 trials. The left vs. right position of the stimuli within each pair was counterbalanced.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Two separate series of statistical analyses were performed. In the first series of analyses, the total number and total duration of the babies’ fixations as well as the mean fixation duration on each stimulus were compared. To get insight into the babies’ visual scanning of the stimuli, a second series of analyses was run to examine and compare the spatial repartition of the number and duration of the fixations within the human face and the monkey face.</p>
<sec id="section7-0165025412465362">
<title>Overall looking time</title>
<p>With our fixation threshold settings (duration &gt; 100 ms, max displacement &lt; 1° of visual angle), we collected a total of 3166 fixations, 1929 of which were located on-stimulus either on the Human face (HF, n<sub>HF</sub> = 1086) or on the Monkey face (MF, n<sub>MF</sub> = 843). To test whether 3-month-old infants exhibited a visual preference towards the human face, we performed <italic>t</italic>-tests for dependent samples on the total number and duration of the on-stimulus fixations. The averages of the infants’ total fixation duration (sum over the 20 trials) were 32.43 s (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.85) and 25.04 s (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.08) for the HF and MF stimuli, respectively (<italic>t</italic>
<sub>9</sub> = 3.18, <italic>p </italic>= 0.0055, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.94). Normalizing the time spent on the human face and monkey face for each infant using the total looking time on the faces did not affect the group results (HF: <italic>M</italic> = 55.6%; <italic>t</italic>
<sub>9</sub> = 2.13, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03, <italic>d</italic> = 1.35). The tendency to look more at the human face was homogenous in our sample. The difference between the time spent looking at the human faces and monkey faces was positive for nine out of 10 infants (<italic>B</italic>
<sub>(10, 0.5)</sub> = 0.0011). The longer time spent looking at the HF was associated with a larger average number of fixations (HF: <italic>M</italic> = 108.6, <italic>SD</italic> = 41.7; MF: <italic>M</italic> = 84.3, <italic>SD</italic> = 28.05, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>9</sub> = 4.07, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0014, <italic>d</italic> = 0.68) while the average duration of the fixations on the human and monkey faces were not significantly different (HF: <italic>M</italic> = 0.322 s, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.112; MF: <italic>M</italic> = 0.321s, <italic>SD </italic>= 0.98, <italic>t</italic>
<sub>9</sub> = 0.04, <italic>p</italic> = 0.516, <italic>d</italic> = 0.006).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0165025412465362">
<title>Statistical mapping of the eye data</title>
<p>A difficulty with the data analyses based on areas of interest is the definition of the areas themselves. For instance, when subjectively decomposing a face into its up or down or left or right parts, we treat as equal a fixation on the eye or on the eyebrow, on the cheek or on the mouth. To overcome this bias we used a data-driven form of analysis known as <italic>i</italic>Map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165025412465362">Caldara &amp; Miellet, 2011</xref>). We used this statistical mapping method for fixation data to represent and compare the distribution of the number and of the duration of the fixations on the human and monkey stimulus. The statistical maps are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0165025412465362">Figure 2</xref>. Briefly, we grouped the fixation data from the two stimulus positions and from the two exemplars of the human face and monkey face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0165025412465362">Figure 2a</xref>). We ended up with two fixation maps (human and monkey) for each infant. Like fMRI maps, the fixation maps were convolved with a bi-dimensional Gaussian filter (<italic>SD</italic> = 10 pixels) to account for eye-tracker accuracy. The resulting smoothed maps were then compared over the 10 babies to compute <italic>Z</italic>-scores on a pixel-by-pixel basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0165025412465362">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0165025412465362">2c</xref>). The <italic>Z</italic>-score maps represented either the number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0165025412465362">Figure 2b</xref>) or the duration of fixations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0165025412465362">Figure 2c</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0165025412465362">Figure 2</xref>, these maps can be used to directly figure out which areas significantly attracted infants’ attention.</p>

</fig>
<p>The eye region of the human faces and the monkey faces both attracted most of the infants’ eye-fixations. Overall, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0165025412465362">Figure 2c</xref> shows that the monkey’s maps are more widespread, indicating that the babies explored the monkey face and the human face differently. This descriptive account is confirmed by the statistics of the maps of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0165025412465362">Figure 2c</xref>, showing multiple areas with significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) peaks in looking duration for the monkey face whereas the significant peaks were concentrated in only four areas for the human face.</p>
<p>Using these <italic>Z</italic>-score maps, we compared the number and duration of fixations on the human face and the monkey face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0165025412465362">Figure 2d</xref>). The <italic>Z</italic>-difference maps were obtained by subtracting the monkey’s map from the human’s maps. Thus, the areas of significantly larger fixation number or fixation duration in favour of the human face appear in white (delimited by a black border). Conversely, the areas of significantly larger fixation number or fixation duration in favour of the monkey face appear in black (delimited by a white border). One should be very careful when interpreting the significant changes on the <italic>Z</italic>-difference maps because of the variance in the location of the perceptual cues between the two stimuli. For example, we can find areas of significant difference in the number of fixations for the human face and the monkey face that are located just a few pixels away. These local effects on the <italic>Z</italic>-difference maps should be interpreted in light of the Z-score maps showing large areas of significantly longer fixation around the eye region in both the human face and the monkey face. Nevertheless, the maps of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0165025412465362">Figure 2c</xref> show that the infants were looking differently to the human face with a much focused pattern of fixation on the eye area.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Overall, although our sample is limited, the results of the present study provide evidence that 3 months of visual experience with human faces are sufficient to shape their face-perceptual system and to guide a visual preference which is based on species-specific facial differences.</p>
<p>The comparison of our data with the data obtained with newborns employing the same paradigm and the same stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165025412465362">Di Giorgio et al., 2012</xref>) demonstrated the lack of visual preference for own-species faces at birth and its presence 3 months later. Our interpretation is that the face-processing system is initially unspecified and becomes tuned with experience to own species faces. The data corroborated previous evidence as for the preference for human face over monkey face in 3.5-month-old infants, even though they differed in the respect of the preferences observed in newborns (Heron-Delaney, Wirth et al., 2011). It suggests that newborns’ visual preferences are mainly guided by the low-level perceptual characteristics embedded in the visual stimuli, whereas 3-month-old infants’ preferences for human faces are mainly guided by the visual experience with that kind of face.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate that, in line with previous studies, infants’ attention was attracted by the upper half of both kinds of faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165025412465362">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0165025412465362">Turati et al., 2005</xref>). However, they did not scan them in the same way. Indeed, monkey-face fixation maps are more widespread than the human-face fixation maps. Moreover, although the eye region of both kinds of faces attracted infants’ attention, they were more focused on the eye area of the human face. These differences suggest a species-specific fixation pattern and support the notion that the human eyes are important in holding the visual attention observed for human faces during infancy. It will, however, be important to run new experiments to test whether the human eyes maintain their power to capture infants’ attention even when they are positioned within a non-human primate face, or whether their relevance is due to their position within a human face.</p>
<p>There are several limitations of the present study: one being the use of only two faces per category; the second one being that the monkey faces have been modified to limit the differences with the human faces, in particular by removing the presence of fur on the face. However, by reducing the differences between the two kinds of faces, we create the best conditions to observe perceptual narrowing. This makes the task difficult for the neonates, who showed no preference for the human face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165025412465362">Di Giorgio et al., 2012</xref>) and best render the improvement in face-processing occurring over the first 3 months.</p>
<p>Our results are consistent with the notion of general perceptual narrowing during infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165025412465362">Nelson, 2001</xref>) and with the hypothesis that the face-perception system is broad and unspecified and becomes tuned and shaped by the faces experienced in the environment in the first few months of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165025412465362">de Schonen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165025412465362">de Schonen &amp; Mathivet, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165025412465362">Di Giorgio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165025412465362">Nelson, 2001</xref>). Additional evidence supporting this conclusion comes from studies concerning race preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165025412465362">Kelly et al., 2005</xref>), which showed that 3-month-old infants, but not newborns, preferred to look at own-race faces compared to other-race faces, and gender preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165025412465362">Quinn et al., 2008</xref>), which showed that Caucasian newborns did not prefer Caucasian female over male faces, whereas by 3 months of age, infants responded preferentially to same-race faces and to faces depicting the gender of the primary caregiver. Interestingly, the presence of a broad face-perception system shaped by the visual inputs experienced early in life has been demonstrated not only in human newborns, but also in non-human primate newborns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165025412465362">Sugita, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To conclude, as well as to extend the knowledge about face perception in infancy, the present study suggested that the face perception system is not species-specific at birth and that three months of visual experience with the human face are sufficient to shape and specialize the face system to become species-specific.</p>
