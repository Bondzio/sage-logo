<abstract>
<p>Over the past 40 years, the European Union (EU) has developed the most advanced system of coordination of social security rights in the world, as a corollary to the free movement of workers. Notwithstanding, problems with the acquisition, transfer and fruition of supplementary pension rights still undermine labour mobility across the member states. This article aims to describe EU pension regulation in the field and illustrates how the EU has employed two different approaches to tackle the problem. The first approach is to directly facilitate the portability of supplementary pension rights – which deeply affects national social policy. The second is to develop transnational schemes leading to a single market for occupational pensions – an exercise in market-making integration. This article explores the main problems in implementing the portability principle and puts forward tangible solutions to unblocking the situation. This sheds light on the persistent tensions between supranational regulation and national pension policy, showing the need for a holistic strategy to resolve both institutional and technical issues.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pensions are the typical example when discussing national social policies of member states where the role of the European Union (EU) is limited. Yet, in the last decades, national pension schemes have elicited great interest among European institutions. Beyond the budgetary constraints – consistent with the implementation of the European Monetary Union (EMU) and the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) – the safeguard of pension rights for mobile workers has been debated. Some long-term developments have had the effect of limiting national prerogatives, leading to a complex interplay between national welfare states and EU regulation. On the one hand, the EU has influenced domestic adaptation through market integration, the hardening of fiscal and monetary discipline and the coordination of national social and employment policy. Hence, European economic integration has directly affected the boundaries of social citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468018112455656">Ferrera, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468018112455656">2009</xref>). On the other hand, as stressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468018112455656">Ebbinghaus and Wiß (2011)</xref>, most countries have recently reduced the role of public pension schemes and, at the same time, extended that of supplementary schemes. Pension systems characterized by a ‘single-pillar’ design at the end of the 1980s are now converging towards forms of a ‘multi-pillar’ design. Pensioners’ income is – and will increasingly be – compounded of benefits accruing from different pillars (public, occupational and individual schemes). The parallel development of these schemes will provide broad protection against old-age risks. This is consistent with the partial privatization of pension systems and the progressive individualization of old-age risks.</p>
<p>Supplementary schemes embody both economic and social goals, which are two sides of the same coin. They are set up to insure workers against the longevity risk, but they also represent an effective human resources and labour market strategy. The schemes constitute a source of financing for the domestic economy (or in certain cases for the firms themselves) but at the same time they embody solidarity elements stemming from collective bargaining among the social partners. Their social and economic functions are thus mixed and vary in each country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468018112455656">1</xref></sup> As a result, the guarantees required to accommodate such diversity clash with the freedom to provide services across the EU. As we stress below, the progress in economic integration and the completion of the Single Market – as well as the gradual development of supplementary pensions – have contributed to the evident mismatch between EU regulation and national solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468018112455656">Haverland, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468018112455656">Mabbett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468018112455656">Schmidt, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Pertinent for this article is EU regulation aimed to facilitate intra-European migration and reduce restrictions on labour mobility despite increased multi-pillarization of pension insurance provisions. Even though the proliferation of occupational private schemes challenges the public monopoly provision and a member state’s capacity to impose mandatory affiliation, this does not mean that the nesting of these nationally bound schemes within the EU happens seamlessly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468018112455656">Ferrera, 2005</xref>: 211–212). In the following we focus on two instruments that the EU has considered to increase the portability of supplementary pension rights: the first directly promotes the portability of supplementary pension rights for mobile workers; the second envisages the completion of the single market for occupational pension funds. Through a comparative analysis of these two fields, this article sheds light on both the main limits to effective supranational influence and the most promising strategies to improve both areas of intervention.</p>
<p>The article proceeds as follows. The second section illustrates why the portability of pension rights is so important, and yet so problematic to accomplish (looking at the factual and legislative obstacles that impeded the EU from directly intervening in the area). The third section provides an overview of EU regulations for the portability of supplementary pension rights and the present debate on how to unblock the current stalemate. The fourth looks at the main issues at stake in the completion of a single market for occupational pensions. The article goes on to analyse and explain the limited implementation of the Directive on the Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORPs) and its effects on portability. We then explore the potential for a revision of the regulation of occupational retirement schemes. The fifth section concludes by providing a critical reading of the causes of limited EU integration in this field and its potential solutions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1468018112455656">
<title>Portability of pension rights: Why it is so important, and why it is so problematic</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468018112455656">Holzmann and Koettl (2010</xref>: 2) identify three crucial reasons why portability of social security, and not only of pension rights, is so important and should not depend on the country of residence. The first-best economic solution would be that individual labour mobility decisions be unaffected by the lack of portability of social benefits for which acquired rights have been established. In social policy, these rights are key to a family’s lifecycle planning and social risk management. From a human rights perspective, nationals and migrants have the right to social protection (according to national legislation and international conventions) and these rights should generally be portable across countries and professions.</p>
<p>From an international perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468018112455656">Holzmann et al. (2005</xref>: 5) distinguish four regime types of social protection for international migrants, ranging from granting more to less protection: (1) access to social security benefits and advanced portability regulated by bilateral agreements between the migrant-sending and the migrant-receiving country; (2) access to social security benefits in the absence of bilateral agreements; (3) no access to portable social security benefits; (4) undocumented and legal migrants who participate in the informal sector of the host country.</p>
<p>After 40 years of legal experiments – starting with Regulation 1408/71 – national public retirement schemes in the member states have been reined in. So, the EU unambiguously falls into the first category described above, which grants the highest protection to mobile workers. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468018112455656">Holzmann et al. (2005</xref>: 7), ‘The labor market integration policy of the EU has created the most advanced (and complex) multilateral system worldwide of legal provisions on the portability of social security benefits for migrants.’</p>
<p>In the realm of pensions, however, this applies only to statutory, mainly public (first pillar) schemes and not to the increasingly important supplementary pensions. In the second pillar, there exists neither a single market for occupational pensions nor any portability tool aimed to safeguard the adoption, preservation and transferability of acquired social rights. Such an unfinished state of affairs risks constraining social policy and the broadly defined human rights prerogatives of the over 12 million EU-27 citizens who live today in member states other than their country of origin. However, the EU’s main concern is that lacking portability significantly affects employment decisions, thus limiting the freedom of movement of workers, one of Europe’s fundamental freedoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468018112455656">CEC, 2007</xref>: 5–6).</p>
<p>In the following, we look at EU legislation in this field and its persistent limits. The free movement of labour has been one of the EU’s pillars since 1957. Exercising this freedom requires active measures, among which the coordination of statutory social security rights and the portability of supplementary social rights are key. Regulations 883/2004 and 987/2009 (which modernize and simplify Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72) create such a coordination regime for statutory, largely public pension schemes. This regime prevents EU citizens from being insured twice or from losing their benefits when moving to another country. At the same time it does not harmonize national regulations, respecting the principle of subsidiarity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468018112455656">2</xref></sup> The coordination regime is based on four straightforward principles. Equal treatment prohibits discrimination with respect to the conditions of affiliation, entitlement or payment of a benefit and is broadly interpreted by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The aggregation principle forces the competent member state to take account of periods of insurance and employment completed under another country’s legislation in deciding whether a worker satisfies the eligibility requirements. This prevention of overlapping benefits precludes anyone from obtaining undue advantages from contributing to social security systems in two or more member states during the same period of insurance. Exportability means that social security benefits are paid throughout the EU and prohibits member states from reserving payment of benefits to residents only.</p>
<p>These rules have significantly improved the mobility of labour, by allowing the accumulation of pension rights from various statutory schemes across the EU for more than 40 years. However, the regulations limited the material scope of coordination, excluding all other contractual provisions that serve to implement an insurance obligation such as: collective agreements among social partners, collective contracts with employers and individual contracts with financial providers. These represent the bulk of supplementary pension schemes in Europe. The only exceptions allowed are those non-statutory schemes, voluntarily included into coordination by the public authorities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1468018112455656">3</xref></sup> Two main reasons determined the exclusion of schemes not based on a member state’s law: first, the legal basis of the regulations – Article 51 of the Treaty of Rome – mentions no other social security arrangements; second, in the early 1970s, supplementary pensions were almost non-existent in the founding continental member states and the development of the EU’s internal market had only just began (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468018112455656">ILO, 1990</xref>: 2–3).</p>
<p>With the 1986 Single European Act, integration progressed with renewed vigour, blurring the boundaries between economic and social spaces. A number of countries with established traditions of supplementary pension provision accessed the European Community, and as existing member states developed occupational pension schemes, the limits of the coordination regime started generating two sets of problems. First, mobile workers insured in non-statutory, largely supplementary occupational pension schemes are simply not covered by social security coordination regulation, and hence require the recognition of their rights. Second, the distinction between statutory and non-statutory schemes is outdated, leading to application problems of separate but overlapping legal instruments (for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468018112455656">Ghailani et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though it may seem the natural thing to do, extending the coordination regulations to supplementary occupational schemes is impractical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468018112455656">CEC, 2012</xref>: 21). It would require a system of mutual recognition between supplementary schemes of excessive diversity, a major obstacle. If large funds applied the four coordination principles and coped with mobile members, small ones might still have to bear excessive administrative costs. Finally, a coordination regime in the form of an EU regulation would not allow for needed flexibility. This is under EU law granted by Directives, which leave member states with some leeway as to the exact rules to be adopted to achieve a particular result.</p>
<p>The European Commission therefore developed two separate instruments to deal with the complex set of technical and institutional problems mentioned above. The first instrument directly improves the portability of supplementary pension rights for mobile workers through dedicated legislation. The second envisions the completion of the single market of supplementary, occupational pension funds, which will indirectly help labour mobility across the EU.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1468018112455656">
<title>Portability of supplementary pension rights across Europe</title>
<p>Supplementary pension rights have been on the EU agenda for over 15 years. Lack of portability hinders geographical and occupational labour mobility. In some member states, occupational pensions cover a major share of the workforce, contributing significantly to retirement income. In those states where employers use these pensions both to retain their employees and for internal financing – prominent features of coordinated market economies – workers are unwilling to join or leave such schemes if they may lose out on their benefits whenever they change jobs.</p>
<p>With regard to this problem, the EU developed a number of legislative tools to deal with it. The only one in force today is Directive 98/49 on safeguarding the supplementary pension rights of employed and self-employed persons moving within the Community. However, this lack of more specific regulation is not an oversight. The Commission has repeatedly toyed with the proposal for a Portability Directive. The most tangible attempts in the mid-2000s were overambitious and have met with fierce resistance by some countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468018112455656">Ghailani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468018112455656">Mabbett, 2009</xref>). The recent Green and White Papers on Pensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468018112455656">CEC, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468018112455656">2012</xref>: 17–18) put it on the agenda again, in order to avoid the legislative disarray and fragmentation that followed an incremental approach to the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468018112455656">Oliver, 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-1468018112455656">
<title>Legislative attempts from Directive 98/49/EC to the failed Portability Directive</title>
<p>One of the tangible initiatives towards improving the portability and security of supplementary pension schemes is Council Directive 98/49. However, compared to Regulation 883/2004, it grants considerably less protection to supplementary pension right holders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468018112455656">Pennings, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1468018112455656">4</xref></sup> The Directive defines a supplementary pension as any occupational pension scheme established in conformity with national legislation, such as: a group insurance contract or pay-as-you-go (PAYG) scheme agreed by one or more sectors; a funded scheme or a pension promise backed by book reserves; and any collective arrangement intended to provide a supplementary pension for employed or self-employed persons.</p>
<p>The Directive ensures equal treatment. For example, workers who leave a pension scheme shall not lose vested pension rights when they move to another member state (depending on whether they would have kept these rights when switching employers with the initial country). Member states have to take the necessary measures to ensure the preservation of vested pension rights for members of a supplementary pension scheme when contributions are no longer being paid to that scheme. The protection is similar to that granted to persons who remain within the same country. Moreover, exportability is also assured: the payment of supplementary pensions cannot be restricted to the territory of the competent state.</p>
<p>The Directive improves the legal position of persons insured in supplementary pension schemes. Vested rights are preserved and pension rights are also paid upon retirement in another country, but obviously, these are only safeguard rules. In fact, the Directive does not deal with waiting or vesting periods, and does not contain any aggregation principles whatsoever.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1468018112455656">5</xref></sup> Hence, accumulated pension rights that are not vested in the original supplementary fund (i.e. when the specific eligibility criteria are not met) are not aggregated and are therefore lost.</p>
<p>In order to rectify this – and as follow-up to the renewed Lisbon strategy, which aimed to deliver more jobs and bring flexibility to the labour market – the Commission proposed a Directive on improving the portability of supplementary pension rights in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468018112455656">Kalogeropoulou, 2006</xref>). The proposal covered occupational supplementary pensions outside the material scope of Regulation 883/2004. Portability of supplementary pension rights included the acquisition and transferability of benefits as well as the preservation of dormant pension rights. However, it omitted taxation issues and cross-border membership.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1468018112455656">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The proposal recommended a mandatory two-year vesting period, a one-year waiting period and a minimum age of 21 for the acquisition of pension rights. It also included the obligation to reimburse or transfer the contributions of outgoing workers who have not yet acquired pension rights when employment is terminated. Member states were given substantial leeway to ensure the preservation of dormant rights due to the heterogeneity of occupational pension schemes in the EU, and have the possibility to exempt low-value dormant rights, due to high administrative costs. Workers were also granted the right to transfer acquired rights to other saving schemes, without incurring any losses. Unfunded schemes were exempted (book reserve and PAYG plans) and the method of calculation was left to the member states.</p>
<p>Despite these exemptions, the Portability Directive struck at the core of the Bismarckian occupational pension model. Long vesting and waiting periods are a fundamental human resources strategy enabling the smooth functioning of labour markets in coordinated market economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468018112455656">Hennessy, 2008</xref>). As a result, it was impossible to reach the required unanimity of member states voting in the Council of the European Union.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1468018112455656">7</xref></sup> Following the European Parliament’s amendments, the Commission published a new proposal in October 2007. This proposal sought to balance two main trade-offs: reducing obstacles to mobility without undermining the sustainability of (mainly small) supplementary schemes; and developing retirement plans that support outgoing workers without undercutting the rights of active scheme members.</p>
<p>This new ‘Directive on minimum requirements for enhancing worker mobility by improving the acquisition and preservation of supplementary pension rights’ removed all references to capital transfers; limited and more clearly defined the scope of the measure; refined some of the technical language; and revised the acquisition of rights and added considerable detail on information requirements. Despite the amendments and several compromises put forward by successive presidencies, the Council never agreed on a common position. The bone of contention remained the conditions governing vesting criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468018112455656">Ghailani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468018112455656">Oliver, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1468018112455656">
<title>Revamping occupational pension portability</title>
<p>In sum, the contrast between supplementary private and statutory public schemes is striking. Whereas an encompassing (if complex) coordination regime for public pensions has been in place since the 1970s, nothing more than a safeguard for vested rights exists for occupational pensions. The recent Green and White Papers on Pensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468018112455656">CEC, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468018112455656">2012</xref>) have restarted the debate as they both acknowledge that such a state of affairs is untenable and legislative action should be pursued.</p>
<p>Despite the Commission’s past failures to propose a Portability Directive acceptable to the Council, a renewed attempt may be not as naïve as it sounds. The 2005 draft Portability Directive was based on articles of the Treaties related to social security measures for migrant workers and to the approximation of national provisions concerning the functioning of the internal market. These required unanimity voting in the Council, which has never been achieved. The Lisbon Treaty changed this by shifting decision-making on social security measures from unanimity to qualified majority voting in the Council, which renders adoption more likely.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1468018112455656">8</xref></sup> Beyond the renewed (but possibly unsuccessful) attempt to redraw a Portability Directive, there are several other options to directly improve the portability of occupational pensions across the EU (for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468018112455656">Ghailani et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A softer approach, not necessarily requiring the Community method (that is, ordinary legislative procedures), would be to oblige each member state to eliminate any obstacles to the transfer of pension rights across borders. This would leave the choice of legal instrument to achieve this goal to them. Such an approach would respect the principle of subsidiarity implicit in social and labour law, which was one of the reasons that prevented the adoption of the Portability Directive originally.</p>
<p>A ‘voluntaristic’ extension of the scope of the coordination regime to supplementary schemes would also be an option: individual member states may shoulder the burden of proof explaining why no declaration can be made to bring a generally binding scheme within the scope of Regulation 883/2004. Voluntary adherence to the coordination regime would probably increase in this case.</p>
<p>Finally, the clarification of the roles and structures of the different pillars constituting each member state’s pension system would enormously benefit the applicability of both prudential (such as the IORP Directive analysed below) and portability rules at the European level. Most advisors and competent institutions such as the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468018112455656">EIOPA, 2012</xref>: 26) and the European Parliament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468018112455656">EP, 2011</xref>) agree and favour the compilation of an EU-27 matrix of pension provision. Such a matrix would finally clarify the dividing lines between first (mostly statutory and public), second (occupational and private) and third (individual and private) pillar schemes.</p>
<p>At least three sources of incoherence and discrimination can be traced back to the dichotomy of statutory versus non-statutory schemes. First, Regulation 883/2004 covers very heterogeneous pension arrangements, some of which could benefit from a portability regime (such as the mandatory funded private schemes that became popular in Eastern Europe). Second, various schemes are neither covered by coordination nor prudential rules, lowering the protection offered to their members (for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468018112455656">CEC, 2010</xref>: Annex). Third, the discretion of member states to choose which rules to apply offers ample room for abuse as identical schemes are arbitrarily subject to prudential rules, or excluded and covered by the coordination regime.</p>
<p>Despite the advantages, there are several caveats. The number of differing plans in Europe is huge (55,000 just in the UK) and ‘such clarification is of a highly political nature because it touches on the principle of subsidiarity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468018112455656">EIOPA, 2012</xref>: 20). Member states retain full responsibility for the organization of their pension systems and for the role played by each of the pillars involved in the member’s dominant mode of capitalism.</p>

<title>Completion of the single market for pension insurance</title>
<p>As stressed above, the completion of a single market of pensions could help protect the rights of mobile workers. In this section we provide a brief summary of EU legislation in the area, while showing its limited impact on portability. The creation of a single market for insurance services started in the 1970s. During that decade the first generation of Directives enforced the freedom of establishment, that is, the opening of branch offices and agencies across the member states (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468018112455656">Ferrera, 2005</xref>). Later Directives 88/357 and 90/619 laid down the conditions for the freedom to provide services, thus allowing insurance carriers to cover risks located in the territory of another member state without having to set up a branch office or agency (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468018112455656">Hartlapp, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468018112455656">Natali, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In parallel, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) progressively clarified the scope of the Directives’ application, defending the principle of social solidarity. National social security was excluded from the single market for insurance services and a body of case law on the implementation of EU competition rules was developed. This meant that any future regulation would have an ‘internal market’ rather than a ‘social policy’ imprint.</p>
<p>One of the first rulings was in the joint cases of Poucet and Pistre in 1991. In both cases, the Court declared that French pension schemes for artisans, as well as sickness and maternity insurance for the self-employed, are not an economic activity (an undertaking) and therefore not subject to competition law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468018112455656">Leibfried, 2010</xref>). In the Albany case of 1999, a textile company (Albany International BV) refused to pay contributions to its industry pension fund, arguing that this obligation violated EU competition law. The case reached the ECJ, which ruled in favour of the pension fund because of the presence of distributive solidarity arrangements and its nature as an outcome of collective bargaining – a practice that could not be considered as violating antitrust norms under Treaty rules.</p>
<p>Even though regulation of supplementary pensions had attracted the attention of the EU following the accession of pension veterans Ireland, Denmark and the UK, none of the above-mentioned Directives dealt with them directly. The first failed attempts to regulate occupational retirement provision followed the Single European Act and continued during the build-up of the Economic and Monetary Union. An initial proposal made by the Commission in 1991 did not win unanimous support in the Council, mainly due to French and German opposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468018112455656">Hennessy, 2008</xref>). In 1995, a new Directive on institutions for retirement provision had to be withdrawn under pressure from several member states. A new phase therefore started with the setting up of the High-Level Group on the free movement of people and with the publication of the Green Paper on Supplementary Pensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468018112455656">CEC, 1997</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section7-1468018112455656">
<title>The IORP Directive</title>
<p>A partial breakthrough happened with Directive 2003/41 on ‘Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision’, which is part of a strategic framework to put in place the Financial Services Action Plan for the years 1999–2005. The Directive was a compromise between the member states, which reached a minimum common denominator, concerning both internal market and social welfare issues. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468018112455656">Haverland (2007</xref>: 899), it ‘will lead neither to a full liberalization of pension markets, nor to the establishment of a European social policy regime at EU level’.</p>
<p>The Directive balanced the interests of Bismarckian countries with Beveridgean ones that have liberal occupational pension systems such as the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468018112455656">Hennessy, 2008</xref>). The former were given a number of guarantees not to disrupt the internal financing and human resource functions that occupational pensions play in highly organized coordinated market economies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468018112455656">Estevez-Abe et al., 2001</xref>), such as the exclusion from the scope of the Directive of book reserve plans, which are prominent in Germany and Austria, and PAYG schemes (e.g. AGIRC and ARRCO in France). The Netherlands, whose occupational pension funds have quasi-monopolistic features, required stricter guarantees for the respect of national social and labour law, including compulsory membership and the outcomes of collective bargaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468018112455656">Haverland, 2007</xref>: 898). Hence, the scope of the Directive is limited, as member states succeeded in safeguarding their domestic rules, especially for occupational schemes with solidarity aims.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, the Directive does impose common minimum standards for the operation of funded, occupational and independent (from the employer) retirement schemes in the EU; it also allows for the pan-European provision of pensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468018112455656">Hewitt Associates, 2010</xref>: 3).</p>
<p>As for prudential rules, IORPs must be registered in a national register run by persons of good repute, have properly constituted rules and have liabilities calculated and certified by specialists. Members and beneficiaries must then be informed about their rights, the financial situation of the institution and the terms of the scheme. Competent authorities supervise IORPs through inspections and other powers of intervention (for a summary of the Directive, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468018112455656">Arnot, 2004</xref>). The Directive requires IORPs to be appropriately funded, giving each member state the right to set its own funding requirements. In cases where occupational, defined-benefit schemes are underfunded, providers must adopt a recovery plan. This is not permitted for IORPs undertaking cross-border activity, which must be fully funded at all times. The Prudent Person Principle grants substantial freedom in investment strategies. Asset portfolios are invested in the best interest of members to guarantee security, quality, liquidity and profitability. Investment in risk capital should not be unduly restricted: each member state can subject occupational schemes to more detailed investment rules, but cannot prevent them from investing up to 70% of their portfolio in shares and corporate bonds and up to 30% in currencies other than those of the future pension liabilities.</p>
<p>As for its pan-European character, the Directive establishes the freedom for authorized IORPs to provide cross-border services anywhere in the EU. It imposes two reciprocal obligations upon member states: to allow undertakings located in their territories to sponsor authorized IORPs located in other (home) member states, and to allow IORPs authorized in their territories to accept sponsorship from undertakings located in other (host) member states. An IORP can manage the schemes of firms located in other member states by adopting the prudential rules of the country where it is established. At the same time, the social and labour law of the host member state (applicable to the relationship between the sponsoring undertaking and the members) continues to apply, as well as the eventual additional investment and information requirements.</p>
<p>The new legislation applies to more than 140,000 occupational pension institutions, covering a quarter of the EU labour force with assets amounting to circa 30% of its GDP. As argued elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468018112455656">Guardiancich, 2011</xref>), despite its potential scope, the IORP Directive is not quite the solution to the portability of occupational pensions in Europe. First, the mobility problems of the European workforce are not solved except for workers shifting between different schemes contained in the same pan-European IORP. Second, the cross-border application of the Directive has been a major disappointment, confirming Haverland’s gloomy predictions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1468018112455656">
<title>Pan-European pension funds</title>
<p>Setting up cross-border IORPs entails substantial financial and operational risk advantages to both the financial service providers and to the social partners involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468018112455656">Ernst &amp; Young, 2009</xref>: 17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468018112455656">Guardiancich, 2011</xref>: 22–24). Among financial advantages, economies of scale reduce asset management costs and more efficient insurance solutions reduce financial risks. The IORP regulations allow for greater financing flexibility, especially when defined-benefit plans are incorporated. Pension coverage for mobile employees is more tax-transparent. Operational risks and costs are reduced due to simplified governance and oversight. There are fewer providers and internal management time is reduced due to ‘one-stop-shops’. The plan sponsor’s strength improves as it can now implement consistent multi-country benefit plans with common structures, easily reacting to acquisitions and divestitures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468018112455656">Hewitt Associates, 2010</xref>: 5–6).</p>
<p>Given the potential advantages, many assumed that the IORP Directive would open the way to a genuine internal market for occupational pensions. Yet these expectations were betrayed for the most part. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468018112455656">EIOPA, 2011</xref>) noted that by June 2011 there were only 84 cases of cross-border activity in the European Economic Area, only six more than 12 months before. The cross-border IORP market was divided between seven home and 23 host member states. Among home member states, the UK and Ireland had 31 and 28 IORPs, respectively; Belgium had nine; Austria, Cyprus, Finland, Germany, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and Norway each had between one and five IORPs.</p>
<p>As for the number of cross-border operations conducted by individual IORPs, only 17 out of 84 operated in more than one host member state. Moreover, there are correlations between countries: half of all cross-border operations that occurred were between the UK and Ireland. Three factors explain the high concentration. First, multinational companies set up cross-border operations where expatriates work; second, most of these funds predate the IORP Directive and were established on the basis of bilateral agreements between countries; and third, both the UK and Ireland have a lax definition of what constitutes cross-border activity.</p>
<p>Hence, there are probably not more than a dozen genuine pan-European pension funds operating as of 2012, encompassing at most a few thousand members. Moreover, it is impossible to assess the exact amount of collected assets, since separate information on foreign and domestic members is not available.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is still a long way to go to establishing an internal market for occupational pensions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468018112455656">EIOPA (2012</xref>: 8) points out, there are complementary explanations for low cross-border activity. Several confirm Haverland’s suppositions: due to its hands-off approach – lobbied for by some member states – the Directive does not iron out the differences between member states in social and labour law, in the interaction between occupational and first-pillar (social security) schemes, nor in the tax treatment of supplementary pensions. Counter-intuitively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468018112455656">Hewitt Associates (2010</xref>: 7) argue that few implementation issues have a technical (regulatory, actuarial, legal) background. Other explanations may also be relevant: a lack of demand may exist to sponsor IORPs on a cross-border basis, fuelled by the length and number of the notifications that need to be sent between competent authorities.</p>
<p>Hence, not only cross-border IORPs embody the asymmetry between European social and economic goals, but also experience has shown that the set-up process is excessively demanding. First, compliance with host member state social and labour law (as well as tax regulations) can be mind-numbingly complex. The diversity of national regulations represents a serious obstacle to even considering the set-up of a pan-European fund; and shows that reconciliation between the European economic and social spaces is far from complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468018112455656">Scharpf, 2002</xref>). Second, the setup procedure is extremely time-consuming: it takes nine to twelve months to create a cross-border IORP from scratch, and six months to add an additional host country. There is often resistance from existing stakeholders who are concerned about moving into unknown cross-border arrangements. Open communication and the involvement of local management in the governance of the new cross-border IORP are the best ways to appease their concerns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1468018112455656">
<title>The recalibration of the IORP Directive</title>
<p>Even though this article agrees that parts of the IORP Directive should be amended to encourage cross-border operations, the current situation is not as bleak as it seems. National regulators, transnational employers and the financial services industry all show growing interest for pan-European pension solutions, even within the existing legislative context. Moreover, the Commission itself is actively pursuing multiple initiatives to consolidate a single market for occupational pensions.</p>
<p>Regulators in member states responded to the IORP Directive in a decidedly varied fashion. Some home countries, e.g. Ireland and the UK, decided to rely on their reputation as veterans in the provision of occupational pensions. Others were more proactive, creating dedicated pension vehicles such as the Organization for Financing Pensions (OFP) in Belgium, the Société d’Épargne Pension à Capital Variable (SEPCAV) in Luxembourg and the Premium Pension Institution (PPI) in the Netherlands. Back in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468018112455656">2008</xref>, Mercer found that managers in multinational companies lamented the lack of off-the-shelf pan-European pension products. However, the situation is bound to improve as 19 out of 25 major providers planned to offer a distinctive cross-border product by 2011. Over half intended to offer more than one vehicle, favouring Belgium’s OFP that is praised for its flexibility.</p>
<p>As for sponsors, despite the many difficulties involved in going pan-European, first movers have appeared. The establishment of functioning pan-European funds proved not only that cross-border IORPs are a reality, but also that they can be created under adverse circumstances (e.g. Nestlé has moved a Dutch, underfunded, defined-benefit fund to a cross-border OFP in Belgium).</p>
<p>Finally, the European Commission has proceeded in two directions. It has commissioned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468018112455656">Hewitt Associates (2010)</xref> to prepare a feasibility study for a pan-European fund for researchers, and is currently pushing forward with this project. Additionally, it has asked the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468018112455656">EIOPA (2012)</xref> for help reviewing the IORP Directive in order to render the set-up of cross-border funds more palatable.</p>
<p>The 500-page document is too broad to be reviewed in detail and largely concerns the prudential rules contained in the IORP Directive. However, a number of provisions deal directly with cross-border operations. First, the definition of cross-border activity needs to be clarified as it ‘has created considerable difficulties in both the operation of cross border IORPs and the notification, authorization and approval processes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468018112455656">EIOPA, 2012</xref>: 29). Second, the elucidation, delimitation and separation of social and labour law (responsibility of the host member state) from prudential regulation (responsibility of the home member state) would increase clarity in cross-border operations and decrease the duplication of supervisory tasks. The associated costs may be possible litigations among member states. The status quo, instead, would lead to a slow and gradual clarification of the rules through experience and ECJ case law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468018112455656">EIOPA, 2012</xref>: 58–61). Finally, the Commission intends to review IORP’s technical aspects and simplify cross-border operations when the host member state imposes additional investment and information requirements (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468018112455656">EIOPA, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468018112455656">Guardiancich, 2011</xref>: 27–28).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article has provided a fine-grained description of EU legislation in the field of old-age retirement, with a specific focus on the portability of pension rights. This is a crucial issue for the completion of the European internal market, in view of the beneficial effects on labour mobility and economic efficiency. At the same time, the European solutions illustrate those major technical and political tensions between supranational regulation and national pension systems, which impede the creation of a functional international regime of portability of supplementary pension rights for mobile workers. We have analysed two alternative strategies to improve this policy domain: the direct regulation of the portability of supplementary pension rights across the member states, and the completion of the single market for occupational pensions.</p>
<p>Our analysis sheds light on the difficulties of European economic and social integration in this field. Despite the different fate of the two legislative tools (no agreed regulation on the portability of supplementary pensions, whereas the Directive on the completion of the single market of occupational pensions has been passed), the comparison shows that integration in this social policy area is crucially limited by institutional differences between member states (e.g. the impossibility to agree on common standards). The need to abide by the national social and labour law as well as each member state’s prerogatives in setting additional requirements and safeguards have effectively nipped the occupational pension market in the bud.</p>
<p>The article has proposed a number of strategies to improve the portability of supplementary pension rights for mobile workers in the EU. If a revision of the IORP Directive is already on the European Commission’s agenda, a renewed attempt to introduce a Portability Directive is certainly one among many options on the table. This may be helped by the greater room for manoeuvre granted to policy-makers by the Lisbon Treaty. However, a major concern expressed by most of the actors involved is the lack of knowledge and common understanding of the roles played by the constituent parts of national pension systems. An exhaustive survey of pension provision in Europe would be highly beneficial and would shed light on the interactions between statutory, occupational and individual pension schemes across the EU.</p>
