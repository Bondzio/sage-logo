<title>Background:</title>
<p>Gluteus medius tears may be present in as many as 25% of late middle-aged women and 10% of middle-aged men, and they are often misdiagnosed. Outcomes of endoscopic repair of gluteus medius tears have seldom been reported.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513481575">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To report the early outcomes of endoscopic repair of partial- and full-thickness gluteus medius tears.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513481575">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513481575">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Between April 2009 and January 2010, data were prospectively collected for all patients undergoing endoscopic gluteus medius repair by one of the authors. Inclusion criteria for the study were patients undergoing repair for either high-grade, partial-, or full-thickness tears. Only patients with endoscopic evidence of a gluteus medius tear were treated surgically. In the case of an articular-side tear, a transtendinous repair technique was used, whereas in the presence of a full-thickness tear, the tendon was refixated to the bone directly.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513481575">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>A total of 15 patients met the inclusion criteria. The cohort included 14 women and 1 man, with an average age of 58 years (range, 44-74 years). Endoscopically, 6 cases were found to be partial-thickness tears. Nine were either full-thickness tears or near-full-thickness tears, which were completed for the repair. Follow-up was obtained on all patients at an average of 27.9 months postoperatively (range, 24-37 months). Fourteen of the 15 patients showed postoperative improvement in all 4 hip-specific scores used to assess outcome, with an average improvement of more than 30 points for all scores. Satisfaction with the surgery results was reported to be from good to excellent (scores of 7-10 out of 10) in 14 of 15 patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513481575">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that endoscopic surgical repair, whether performed through a transtendinous or full-thickness technique, can be an effective treatment of gluteus medius tears at a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Longer term follow-up studies are necessary to determine whether these therapeutic and functional gains are maintained.</p>

<body>
<p>Gluteus medius and/or minimus tears can impart significant functional impairment to patients and may be a source of debilitating and chronic peritrochanteric hip pain. Initially described in the late 1990s by Bunker et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513481575">5</xref></sup> and Kagan,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513481575">17</xref></sup> these tears bear many morphologic similarities to the soft tissue anatomy about the shoulder, thus inspiring the term <italic>rotator cuff tears of the hip</italic>. Although acute tears of the gluteus medius or minimus have been reported in patients without antecedent peritrochanteric pain, they are less common than attritional tears associated with chronic peritrochanteric pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513481575">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513481575">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513481575">29</xref></sup> Despite a growing interest in the pathoanatomy and treatment of abductor tears of the hip, the mechanism of injury remains unclear. Many authors speculate that, like in the shoulder, an analogous progression of stepwise degeneration occurs within the muscle-tendon unit and at its bony interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513481575">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513481575">30</xref></sup> These changes are believed to ultimately cause insertional failure as early tendinitis and tendinopathy lead to partial undersurface tearing and eventually to complete avulsion of the abductor attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513481575">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513481575">2</xref>). Some even postulate that abductor deficiency or tendinosis is closely linked with the development of osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513481575">26</xref></sup> Overall, tears of the gluteus medius occur more commonly than do gluteus minimus tears. However, partial-thickness tears may be more common than complete ruptures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513481575">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513481575">20</xref></sup> Women appear to be more likely to sustain symptomatic tears than men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513481575">30</xref></sup></p>

<p>The true incidence of gluteus medius and minimus tears in the general population is unknown. In patients treated surgically for displaced femoral neck fractures or osteoarthritis, a 20% to 22% incidence of associated gluteus medius and minimus tears has been encountered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513481575">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513481575">15</xref></sup> Abductor tears may remain undiagnosed for years. Patients with chronic lateral hip pain frequently carry inaccurate diagnoses such as refractory trochanteric bursitis, piriformis syndrome, radiculitis, osteoarthritis, or sciatica.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513481575">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513481575">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513481575">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513481575">22</xref></sup> In addition to manifesting as focal peritrochanteric pain, abductor tears may result in compensatory changes in gait and kinematics, which can ultimately influence adjacent body segments and result in a host of injury patterns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513481575">27</xref></sup> Heightened clinical suspicion and advances in imaging modalities have increased awareness and recognition of the high frequency of these tears<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513481575">23</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546513481575">Figure 3</xref>). Recently, the anatomic footprint of the gluteus medius and minimus tendon insertions has been mapped out.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513481575">28</xref></sup> With an enhanced understanding of the pathoanatomy of abductor tears, indications for surgical repair have evolved.</p>

<p>Traditionally, open transosseous repairs or suture anchor repairs have been advocated to treat complete abductor ruptures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513481575">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513481575">17</xref></sup> Excellent outcomes have been reported in small anecdotal reports and case series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513481575">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513481575">17</xref>,33</sup> With the growing trend toward limited invasiveness, endoscopic techniques have been developed to gain access to the peritrochanteric space. Both partial- and full-thickness tears have been successfully treated in this manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513481575">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513481575">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513481575">32</xref></sup> Limited case series have demonstrated secure tendon-to-bone fixation with these techniques and favorable short-term outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513481575">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513481575">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513481575">32</xref></sup> The purpose of this study was to add to the paucity of clinical outcomes data on this subject and to report the early outcomes of endoscopic repair of both partial- and full-thickness gluteus medius tears at a minimum 2-year follow-up.</p>

<title>Patient Inclusion and Data Collection</title>
<p>Between April 2009 and January 2010, data were prospectively collected on all patients undergoing hip arthroscopy by the senior surgeon (B.G.D.).

The exclusion criteria were revision surgeries and previous hip conditions such as fractures, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, and avascular necrosis. Objective data such as sex, age, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were also collected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546513481575">Table 1</xref>).

<title>Physical Examination</title>
<p>A detailed physical examination was conducted on all hips before surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513481575">23</xref></sup> Hip abductor strength was measured with the patient lying laterally, the affected leg extended at the hip and the knee, and with the hip slightly internally rotated. The muscular strength was documented on a resisted muscular contraction (RMC) scale of 0 to 5, in which 0 is no power and 5 is full strength.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546513481575">
<title>Imaging</title>
<p>All patients underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the affected hip to evaluate for intra- and extra-articular pathologic abnormalities. Eleven patients had an MR arthrogram (MRA), whereas 4 had a plain MR.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0363546513481575">
<title>Indications for Gluteus Medius Repair</title>
<p>All patients who underwent surgery had clinical signs of a symptomatic gluteus medius tear, which included peritrochanteric pain with tenderness over the greater trochanter and objective abductor weakness on manual muscle strength testing that did not improve with physical therapy for more than 3 months and nonoperative treatment. Patients must have also had at least temporary subjective relief from a trochanteric bursal injection. Nonoperative management strategies included activity modification, a period of relative rest, oral anti-inflammatory medication, and modalities. High-grade partial- or full-thickness tearing was a mandatory finding on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as absence of significant retraction that would preclude a successful arthroscopic repair. Endoscopic confirmation of a repairable gluteus medius tear was needed as well before repair was undertaken (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513481575">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>All surgeries were performed by the senior surgeon (B.G.D.) with the patient in the supine position. In all cases, diagnostic arthroscopy of the hip joint was first performed to check for loose bodies, chondral defects, labral tears, synovitis, ligamentum teres tears, and other intra-articular lesions. If needed, lesions were corrected accordingly, and labral tears were refixated when possible; otherwise, either selective debridement or labral reconstruction using a hamstring autograft was performed.</p>
<sec id="section13-0363546513481575">
<title>Peritrochanteric Diagnostic Arthroscopy</title>
<p>After all intra-articular procedures were completed, traction was released and the arthroscope was placed in the peritrochanteric space. Trochanteric bursectomy was performed followed by examination of the entire peritrochanteric space, including the gluteus medius and maximus insertions. The extent of the gluteus medius tear was graded on a scale from 1 to 4. Grade 1 was defined as a 0% to 25% partial tear of the tendon thickness, grade 2 a 26% to 50% tear, grade 3 a 51% to 99% tear, and grade 4 a full-thickness tear.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0363546513481575">
<title>Transtendinous Repair Technique for Partial-Thickness Tears</title>
<p>A transtendinous repair technique was used for partial-thickness undersurface tears as previously published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513481575">23</xref></sup> Before repair was undertaken, the gluteus medius insertion was probed and was confirmed to be destabilized on its undersurface from its attachment to the lateral facet. A longitudinal incision was then made in the tendon in line with its fibers over the middle of the lateral facet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546513481575">Figure 4</xref>). Through a transtendinous window, the torn fibers were identified on the deep side and were debrided with the shaver. The lateral facet was decorticated to create a bleeding bed of bone for healing, using a bur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546513481575">Figure 5</xref>). The repair was then performed. A 5.5-mm biocomposite corkscrew anchor (Arthrex Inc, Naples, Florida) was placed in the lateral facet under fluoroscopy, and 2 horizontal mattress stitches were passed, with one limb of each suture through the anterior part of the tendon and one limb of each suture through the posterior part of the tendon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546513481575">Figure 6</xref>). This was repeated depending on the extent of the tear. The sutures were then tied down with a standard arthroscopic knot-tying technique, closing the tendon over the lateral facet. This technique resulted in a side-to-side repair of the longitudinal tendon split while firmly approximating the tendon to the footprint on the lateral facet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0363546513481575">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Full-Thickness Repair Technique</title>
<p>A full-thickness repair technique was used for full-thickness tears of the tendon and near-full-thickness tears that were completed for the repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513481575">Figure 2</xref>). Proximal row fixation was achieved with two 5.5-mm biocomposite corkscrew anchors in the proximal part of the lateral facet. All 4 limbs of the suture from each anchor were passed through the tendon using a suture lasso (Arthrex), resulting in a total of 4 horizontal mattress stitches in the proximal row. These were tied arthroscopically. Distal row fixation was achieved crisscrossing all the sutures to two 4.75-mm Swivel-Lock anchors (Arthrex) in the distal part of the lateral facet. This provided added compression of the tendon against the bone, completing the suture-bridge construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0363546513481575">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<title>Rehabilitation</title>
<p>Patients who underwent gluteus medius repair were instructed to use 2 crutches and undergo 20 pounds partial weightbearing for 6 weeks along with the use of a low-profile abduction brace (X-Act ROM hip brace; DJO Global LLC, Vista, California) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0363546513481575">Figure 9</xref>) that was worn 24 hours a day, 7 days a week except for bathing. The abduction brace was discontinued thereafter. Active hip abduction and internal rotation was avoided as well as passive external rotation and adduction for 6 weeks. Patients were subsequently weaned off crutches by 6 to 8 weeks as they met appropriate milestones for pain control, range of motion, and neuroproprioception. A slow progression to full strength and activity was achieved over a 3- to 4-month period.</p>

<title>Outcome Measures</title>
<p>All patients were prospectively assessed. The protocol included the pre- and postsurgical administration of 4 hip-specific questionnaires: the modified Harris hip score (mHHS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513481575">6</xref></sup> the nonarthritic hip score (NAHS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513481575">7</xref></sup> the Hip Outcome Score–Activities of Daily Living (HOS-ADL), and the Hip Outcome Score–Sport-Specific Subscale (HOS-SSS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513481575">25</xref></sup> Patients were asked to estimate their pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 to 10, where 0 was considered to be no pain at all and 10 was considered to be the worst possible pain. These scores were recorded at the preoperative visit, at 3 months postoperatively, and repeatedly once a year afterward. Patients were also asked to rate their level of satisfaction after surgery, with 10 being extremely satisfied and 0 being not satisfied at all. Range of motion and pain were measured again by the same method used preoperatively. Patients who were unable to follow up in the clinic at more than 2 years postoperatively were contacted via telephone for the same follow-up questioning.</p>

<sec id="section18-0363546513481575">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Based on an observed effect size of 36 points in the Harris hip score in preliminary data with a standard deviation of 20, an a priori power analysis was performed that showed a minimum of 12 patients would be needed to achieve statistical significance.</p>
<p>The patients’ pre- and postoperative results were compared using a 2-tailed Student <italic>t</italic> test for comparison of continuous variables and chi-square test to compare categorical variables. Alpha values of &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A mounting body of evidence now supports the notion that tears of the gluteus medius and minimus contribute substantially to recalcitrant lateral hip pain and associated functional disability<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363546513481575">‖</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513481575">Figure 1</xref>). Despite advances in radiologic imaging and improvements in clinical awareness, many tears remain occult and misdiagnosed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513481575">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513481575">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513481575">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513481575">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513481575"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513481575">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513481575">30</xref></sup> In our study, patients had undiagnosed abductor tears for an average of 38.7 months before an accurate diagnosis was obtained. Once these tears were appropriately recognized, they were treated endoscopically with favorable results, including statistically significant improvement with respect to all 4 hip scores and VAS. Fourteen of 15 patients (86.7%) reported good to excellent satisfaction (7 to 10 of 10). Twelve of 15 patients (80%) increased their strength by at least 1 grade on manual muscle testing. The patient who reported poor satisfaction was noncompliant with postoperative weightbearing restrictions, smoked tobacco against recommendations, and underwent spinal fusion 6 months after gluteus medius repair. All of these factors may have contributed to this one poor outcome.</p>
<p>The true incidence of gluteus medius and minimus tears in the general and athletic population remains unknown. Similarly, the natural history of untreated tears is unclear. Some authors postulate that hip abductor disease may be causally linked to the onset of osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513481575">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513481575">26</xref></sup> The hip abductor mechanism has been termed the “rotator cuff of the hip” due to its morphologic similarities with the soft tissue anatomy about the shoulder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513481575">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513481575">17</xref></sup> Shared anatomic and biomechanical properties between the shoulder and hip hint at an analogous pathoanatomic process in the progression of accelerated osteoarthritis due to mechanical alterations in joint and periarticular soft tissue anatomy. The pathoanatomy of rotator cuff tear arthropathy has reemerged in recent years as an area of intense research interest over the past decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513481575">11</xref></sup> Loss of an efficient force couple due to rotator cuff tear insufficiency may lead to altered contact forces, abnormal shear across the articular cartilage, and accelerated degenerative disease of the joint. The high rate of concomitant intra-articular injury encountered in our series could be consistent with this association. Additional basic science and clinical study are necessary to further clarify this relationship and determine if early recognition and treatment can alter the natural history of this process.</p>
<p>Treatment for symptomatic tears of the gluteus medius and minimus has gained considerable attention in recent years with a growing interest in hip preservation and arthroscopic hip surgery. In their report on national trends in hip arthroscopy, Colvin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513481575">8</xref></sup> noted that there has been an 18-fold increase in the number of arthroscopic hip surgeries among American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery board-eligible candidates in the past 10 years. Furthermore, the authors found that greater than 50% of sports medicine fellowships offered hip arthroscopy as a component of their educational curriculum and that most had added this element in the past 3 years. As more orthopaedic trainees complete fellowships that include training in advanced hip arthroscopy, and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of the shoulder continues to grow in popularity, it is plausible to surmise that endoscopic treatment of abductor tears may become more commonplace in the future.</p>
<p>Developments in endoscopic techniques have enabled arthroscopic hip surgeons to achieve robust and durable repair constructs formerly addressed through open means using modern implants adapted from arthroscopic shoulder techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363546513481575">¶¶</xref></sup> Additional advantages of an arthroscopic/endoscopic approach include the ability to inspect and treat associated intra-articular lesions and enhanced recognition of partial undersurface abductor tears through a minimally invasive approach. Endoscopic treatment of calcific tendinitis, refractory trochanteric bursitis, and external coxa saltans has been successful in limited case series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513481575">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513481575">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513481575">18</xref></sup> In these earlier reports, no patients required abductor repair.</p>
<p>There is scant literature as of yet on endoscopic gluteus medius repair. In the first published series on endoscopic suture anchor repair of gluteus medius tears, Voos and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513481575">32</xref></sup> reported that at an average 25-month follow-up, all 10 patients in their series had complete resolution of their lateral hip pain and full restoration of motor strength. In their series, tears were either full thickness or at least grossly visible from the peritrochanteric space. In a study on partial-thickness tears of the gluteus medius, Domb et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513481575">10</xref></sup> described the morphologic characteristics of the abductor undersurface and inherent challenges associated with detection. In their review, the authors proposed a technique for endoscopic footprint optimization and abductor repair, employing deep exposure of undersurface tearing through a longitudinal split, debridement of tendinosis, and subsequent transtendinous suture repair of healthy tissue.</p>
<p>Of the 15 patients treated in this series, 6 underwent endoscopic treatment using a transtendinous approach. Based on the relatively “hidden” nature of these tears, it is likely that earlier clinical series on endoscopic trochanteric bursectomy failed to address subtler undersurface damage to the abductor. Although early outcomes were reportedly favorable in these series, the success of such a limited approach may decline with time. To our knowledge, this study is the largest series to date of endoscopic gluteus medius repairs with a minimum 2-year follow-up. It represents the first series of patients treated endoscopically for both full-thickness and partial undersurface tears of the gluteus medius. At an average follow-up of more than 2 years, favorable results have been demonstrated. These promising early clinical outcomes support endoscopic treatment as a viable and reproducible means of restoring native peritrochanteric footprint anatomy, resolving lateral hip pain, and improving function. Long-term follow-up will provide additional insight into the durability of endoscopically treated abductor tendon tears as techniques and technology continue to improve.</p>
<p>Overall, our results concur with the favorable results demonstrated in prior case series and reports on open and endoscopic abductor repair.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0363546513481575">##</xref></sup> Strengths of this study include 100% patient retention, well-documented preoperative outcome data, and prospectively collected outcome measures. A number of pertinent limitations in this study should be mentioned. There are considerable inadequacies in the use of MRC to detect subtle objective variations in strength between subjects preoperatively and postoperatively. A quantified mechanism may represent a superior measurement tool to further clarify clinically significant differences in objective strength. We do not routinely obtain postoperative MRI scans on our patients unless sufficient clinical indications exist to suggest disruption of the repair. However, a postoperative MRI would have been useful to determine if radiographic markers of healing were present and corresponded with the functional and objective clinical improvement that we noted in this cohort.</p>
<p>In this study, we noted a very high rate of intra-articular lesions that were addressed concurrently. However, the variety of concomitant surgical treatments presents a confounding variable in generating clinically relevant conclusions from this study. Preoperatively, patients in this study had primarily peritrochanteric pain. They gained at least temporary subjective improvement from a trochanteric bursal injection. However, intra-articular hip pain has a characteristically inconsistent pattern of referral and localization. Furthermore, intra-articular pathology can compromise clinical outcomes (patients 3, 5, and 12), even when successful repair is performed and lateral hip pain improves. We therefore believe that it is useful from both a diagnostic and therapeutic standpoint to observe structures within the intra-articular space, assess their relative degree of health, and treat them accordingly to optimize clinical results. Nonetheless, for some patients, it may be plausible to surmise that a portion of their lateral hip pain was improved by addressing their associated intra-articular lesions. It is therefore difficult to prove whether clinical improvement in this study was due to gluteus medius repair or intra-articular work. Since the average age for patients enrolled in this study was 58 years, one would expect associated radiographic and clinical evidence of chondral, labral, and synovial injury that may be contributing to the overall pain spectrum. However, with clear documentation of concomitant intra-articular lesions, it would be difficult to justify ignoring intra-articular abnormalities that could potentially contribute to enhanced clinical outcomes. Because there is no clear evidence in this study that lateral hip pain was altered by abductor repair vs intra-articular work, it is the opinion of the authors that the surgeon should address all potential pain generators that may be accessed at the time of index abductor repair.</p>
<p>Further limitations of this study include a small sample size and lack of a nonoperatively treated control group, subjective outcome scores, and short-term follow-up.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Over the past decade, injury to the gluteus medius has been increasingly recognized as a significant contributor to lateral hip pain and dysfunction. Improvements in imaging modalities and a growing clinical awareness have led to earlier detection of these injuries. Moreover, an expanding body of literature has aided surgeons’ understanding of the pathoanatomy of gluteus medius tears. Consequently, modern repair techniques and tools have evolved to address all tear types in a robust manner. Our study demonstrates that excellent subjective and objective results can be achieved using endoscopic repair techniques and that these results are durable at short-term follow-up. Further study will be necessary to determine if these initially favorable outcomes are sustained at longer term follow-up.</p>
