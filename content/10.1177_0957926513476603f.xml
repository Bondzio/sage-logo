<p>While there are a number of handbooks for thesis writing on the market (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957926513476603">Cooley and Lewkowicz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957926513476603">Murray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957926513476603">Rudestam and Newton, 2001</xref>), most of these books are not targeted specifically at readers from a particular discipline. Since theses vary considerably from one discipline to another in terms of content and organization, there is a clear need for discipline-specific instructions on thesis writing. Bitchener’s book, specifically dealing with thesis writing within one single discipline – applied linguistics – can be seen as a timely and valuable resource for postgraduate students in this particular discipline. It offers practical advice on thesis writing by taking readers step-by-step through the process of writing the genre of thesis and explaining in detail ways to organize the content and structure of a thesis.</p>
<p>Chapter 1, ‘Background’, introduces the objectives of the book and its intended audience. An overview of the content of the book is also provided in the chapter. As Bitchener points out, the book aims to provide first-time thesis writers with guidance on how to present their research. While the target audience of the book is primarily Master’s students who have to write a thesis, it would also prove to be a useful guide for doctoral students who have not yet completed a thesis. Given the book’s practical nature, the introductory chapter does not include a detailed theoretical discussion of terms such as ‘genre analysis’ and ‘moves’, but introduces these terms in a non-technical way.</p>
<p>Each of the following chapters in the book (i.e. Chapters 2–8) is titled according to one part-genre of the genre of thesis, that is, Abstract, Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Results, Discussion of Results, and Conclusion. Each of these chapters is structured in a very similar way. It introduces the functions, content and structure of the part-genre, and analyses its key linguistic features. In particular, Bitchener draws on discourse analytical studies into the genre of the research report, especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957926513476603">Swales’ (1990)</xref> genre analysis approach, when presenting the moves and sub-moves in each part-genre. A sample thesis titled ‘Willingness to communicate in a second language classroom’ written by Katherine Cao, who won the Applied Linguistics Association of New Zealand Best Master’s Thesis award, was used for illustration throughout the book. It is a very clearly written thesis and involves both quantitative and qualitative lines of enquiry.</p>
<p>Take Chapter 3 as an example. In addition to explaining the organization and move characteristics of a thesis introduction, Bitchener also discusses various issues such as the use of active and passive voice, the first-person pronouns (i.e. ‘I’ and ‘we’) and the linguistic features of meta-discourse. He also explains the tense options for different moves, such as establishing a research territory, establishing a niche and occupying the niche. Examples in the chapter are very well-chosen and succinctly discussed, and readers would find them very useful and illuminating. For example, Bitchener includes a helpful list of words and expressions which can be used to signal the research niche.</p>
<p>Each chapter is made up of a combination of analyses, suggestions and illustrations. The sample texts (presented in text boxes) and the accompanying analyses are clearly marked through the use of different fonts and font sizes, thereby increasing the readability of the entire book. As the structure of the book is relatively straightforward, readers can easily refer to the specific sections in which they are interested and compare the structures or linguistic features of different part-genres as they wish. It is also worth mentioning that, throughout the book, Bitchener attempts to avoid being dogmatic by reiterating that there is no one single ‘correct’ way of writing a dissertation: ‘There is no hard and fast rule on this’ (p. 51) and ‘Opinions vary about …’ (p. 53). Instead, readers are encouraged to identify the moves and sub-moves in the sample texts by themselves before reading the author’s analysis.</p>
<p>Moreover, the book includes a helpful ‘Frequently Asked Questions’ section at the end of each chapter, which deals with the important questions that students may have in mind when they have to write a particular chapter of the thesis. In addition, suggestions for further activities and further reading can be found at the end of each section. These suggestions not only help postgraduate students reflect upon their writing practices with respect to the issues discussed in each chapter of the book, but also help teachers highlight the functions and content of different parts of the thesis in a postgraduate writing course. Finally, the list of moves and sub-moves in the four-page appendix at the end of the book also provides a very useful reference guide for students who are nearing the completion of their theses.</p>
<p>However, the book is not without its shortcomings. First, given that almost all of the examples in the book are taken from one single Master’s thesis, one may doubt whether one single thesis contains all or most of the moves and sub-moves that are used in thesis writing. Second, the thesis chosen can be seen as a rather ‘standard’ or ‘traditional’ thesis in terms of its structure. It may therefore be worth mentioning the different possible variations of the genre.</p>
<p>Aside from these minor shortcomings, <italic>Writing an Applied Linguistics Thesis or Dissertation</italic> is clearly a reader-friendly guide for thesis writing. It presents a very detailed move structure of the genre of thesis and provides practical advice on thesis writing for postgraduate students. It is also written in an accessible manner throughout, with minimal use of technical terms or jargon. It is without doubt that the book can be used as a valuable resource for academic writing or thesis writing courses at the postgraduate level. It can also be used as an excellent reference book for students who have to write a thesis in applied linguistics or in a cognate discipline. I would therefore recommend this book to thesis supervisors and students who may need help with thesis writing.</p>
