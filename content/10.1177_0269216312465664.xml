<title>Results:</title><p>Few respondents (15%) reported that their services operated a policy on providing information about off-label use. Most (65%) would always make a clear record of the drug prescribed, and this was highest for doctors, with 39%–73% always operating in line with the ‘must do’ aspects of General Medical Council guidance. This proportion was lower for nurse (42%–55%) and pharmacist (0%–30%) responders in part because their guidance is based on the previous, less pragmatic General Medical Council guidance. Examples given for off-label use, together with general comments, provided additional insight into respondents’ practice.</p></sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216312465664">
<title>Conclusions:</title><p>Compared to before and to nurse and pharmacist prescribers, doctors appear better able to adhere to their regulatory body guidance. Given that all the independent prescribers in palliative care can prescribe the same drugs, consistent regulatory guidance is required.</p></sec>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The term ‘off-label’ refers to the use of a drug for an unlicensed indication, or in doses, preparations, patient population or route of administration that are beyond the specifications of its Marketing Authorization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312465664">1</xref></sup> The practice is widespread, particularly in specialties such as paediatrics, pain medicine and palliative care, with up to one quarter of all prescriptions in the latter falling into this category.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216312465664">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216312465664">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although such use of drugs is legal, there are implications for prescribers, as outlined in guidelines for best practice produced by regulatory bodies such as the General Medical Council (GMC). However, in a survey undertaken in 1999, we found that &lt;5% of doctors in palliative care would always obtain verbal consent, document in the notes or inform other professionals of such use, as was then recommended by the GMC. Concerns expressed included the high prevalence of off-label use making this impractical or creating unnecessary anxiety for patients or carers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312465664">4</xref></sup> There have since been several developments: specialist pain and palliative care society guidance has been published,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312465664">5</xref></sup> the latest GMC guidance takes a more pragmatic stance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312465664">6</xref></sup> and there are now independent nursing and pharmacist prescribers, with their own respective Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) guidance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312465664">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216312465664">8</xref></sup> Thus, we have undertaken the present survey to obtain a contemporary view of how medical and non-medical independent prescribers adhere to current regulatory body guidance relating to the off-label use of drugs in palliative care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269216312465664" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The survey was undertaken in November 2010 as part of a University of Nottingham medical student Bachelor of Medical Sciences (BMedSci) project in conjunction with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://palliativedrugs.com">palliativedrugs.com</ext-link> Ltd. As part of the terms and conditions of use of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.palliativedrugs.com">www.palliativedrugs.com</ext-link> website, members agree to receive invitations to undertake online surveys from time to time.</p>
<p>A questionnaire was developed, based on the one previously used,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312465664">4</xref></sup> taking current guidance into account so that doctor, nurse and pharmacist respondents completed one relevant to their respective guidance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216312465664">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312465664">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312465664"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216312465664">8</xref></sup> Respondents who did not answer ‘always’ to questions 5 and 6 were invited to give reasons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216312465664">Table 1</xref>). Respondents were also asked to list up to three drugs that they most frequently use off-label for which they document such use and provide additional information to patients and carers, noting the indication, route of administration and reason(s) for their greater care. Finally, general comments were invited about this area of practice.</p>

<p>The membership database was used to identify UK doctors and nurses who were registered as working in palliative medicine or as an independent nurse prescriber, respectively. The database does not contain specific information on independent pharmacist prescribers; so, all UK pharmacist members, from a wide range of clinical settings, were invited to take part. As a check, the first question asked doctor, nurse and pharmacist respondents, respectively, to confirm that palliative medicine was their primary specialty, or that they were an independent nurse or pharmacist prescriber of palliative care drugs. An answer of ‘no’ resulted in a request to exit the questionnaire.</p>
<p>An invitation e-mail containing a link to the questionnaire was sent out explaining that the purpose of the survey was to explore the issues of documentation and information giving when using drugs off-label. The number of questions and the likely time it would take to complete the survey were noted, and that the results would be collated anonymously for presentation on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://palliativedrugs.com">palliativedrugs.com</ext-link> and elsewhere. No incentives were offered for its completion. E-mail marketing software (1-2-All, ActiveCampaign, USA) monitored how many invitations reached their destination, were opened and resulted in the questionnaire being accessed. The software used to develop and host the questionnaire (iSalient, ActiveCampaign, USA) presented one question at a time and recorded the number of participants completing each question. Each participant could only complete the survey once. After 1 week, a second and final e-mail invitation was sent out to those who had not responded, with the survey closed 11 days later. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics.</p>

<title>Demographics of the respondents</title>
<p>Overall, the main workplace for respondents was an inpatient hospice (147, 44%), although for nurses it was the community (57, 66%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216312465664">Table 1</xref>). Doctors had a wide range of years of experience, with 11–20 years the modal number of years qualified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216312465664">Table 1</xref>). Independent nurse and pharmacist palliative care prescribers of palliative care drugs are a relatively new phenomenon, but again there was a range of experience, with the modal number of years as an independent prescriber of more than 4 and 3–4 years for nurse and pharmacist respondents, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216312465664">Table 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269216312465664">
<title>Responses to the questionnaire</title>
<p>Only a minority of respondents (50, 15%) reported that their service operated a policy on providing information to patients and their carers about the use of drugs off-label (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216312465664">Table 1</xref>). The majority of respondents would always make a clear record of the drug prescribed (217, 65%) and was highest for doctors (163, 73%). The same number of doctors also responded that they would always make a clear record when not following common practice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216312465664">Table 1</xref>). Reasons given for not always doing either of the above included that such use was so common that to document every single instance was impractical, that it is not always known or remembered when the use was off-label, that it was reserved for less-established off-label uses and that it would depend on the setting, with clearer documentation used when providing advice to colleagues outside of a hospice.</p>
<p>When prescribing a drug that is routinely used for an off-label indication, only 7 (3%) doctors would always draw the patient’s attention to the licence when obtaining consent and 48 (22%) would never do. However, for drugs where there is little evidence to support the off-label use, 87 (39%) doctors would explain to the patient the reason(s) for its use, with only 10 (4%) never doing so (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216312465664">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Only 71 (21%) respondents would always explain to patients/carers in broad terms the reasons why medicines are not licensed for their proposed use and only 9 (3%) would always use written information to support such explanations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216312465664">Table 1</xref>). The most frequent examples of drugs used off-label for which respondents would document such use and provide additional information to patients and carers are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269216312465664">Table 3</xref>. The main reasons given for taking greater care with these drugs was to clarify the indication for use in order to reduce anxiety and increase adherence; for example, the use of amitriptyline for pain rather than depression and the use of ketamine because of its reputation as a drug of misuse. The inclusion of gabapentin, which is licensed for peripheral nerve pain including that due to cancer infiltration, provides an example of the challenge faced by practitioners in always correctly identifying the use of a drug as off-label or not.</p>

<p>Invited comments covered three themes. First, given the widespread off-label use of drugs, strict adherence to the guidance, particularly when such use was common practice, was considered impractical and could overwhelm patients and carers creating unnecessary anxiety. Second, the difficulty of remembering every instance of when a drug is being used off-label. Finally, some respondents made no distinction between licensed and off-label use with regard to the amount of information they would provide to a patient.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This survey of UK independent prescribers in palliative care provides a more contemporary and wider view of practice than our 1999 postal survey sent only to medical directors of hospices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312465664">4</xref></sup> No other directly relevant surveys appear to have been undertaken in the interim. As then, relatively few services appear to operate a specific policy for providing information.</p>
<p>Previously we found that only a minority (115, &lt;5%) of doctors were always following the relevant GMC guidance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312465664">4</xref></sup> Since then, GMC guidance has been updated and is more pragmatic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312465664">6</xref></sup> In relation to the ‘must do’ aspects of the current GMC guidance (questions 5, 6 and 8; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216312465664">Table 1</xref>), almost three quarters of doctors reported that they always make a clear record of the drug prescribed and, where not following common practice, the reasons for prescribing the drug. When prescribing a drug for which little evidence is available, fewer (~40%) reported always explaining to a patient the reason(s) for its use, although only 10 (4%) would never do so. Overall, our results suggest that a higher proportion of doctors are now working in accordance with GMC guidance.</p>
<p>In relation to the aspects covered by the remaining questions, current GMC guidance is discretionary. It now states that ‘Some medicines are routinely used outside the scope of their licence … Where current practice supports the use of a medicine in this way it may not be necessary to draw attention to the licence when seeking consent …’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312465664">6</xref></sup> In keeping with this, few (3%) doctors would always draw the patient’s attention to the licence in this setting and about one-fifth would never do so. It also states, ‘… Where patients, or their carers express concern you should also explain, in broad terms, the reasons why medicines are not licensed for their proposed use …’ Again, in accordance with this, relatively few (14%) doctors would always offer such an explanation, although only a minority (4%) would never do so. The GMC guidance states that such explanations ‘may be supported by written information’, although over half reported that they never do so.</p>
<p>The NMC and GPhC guidance are essentially the same,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312465664">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216312465664">8</xref></sup> and reflect the older GMC guidance. They state that independent nurse and pharmacist prescribers must ‘… make a clear record of all medicines prescribed and the reasons for prescribing an off-label medicine …’ and ‘… should explain to the patient/carer, in broad terms, the reasons why medicines are not licensed for their proposed use …’. At best, only about half of the nurses and one-third of the pharmacists were always following this guidance. Furthermore, any information provided ‘should be’ (GPhC) or ‘may be’ (NMC) supported by written information: no pharmacist reported always doing this and 60% of nurses reported never doing this. Overall, our results suggest that independent nurse and pharmacist prescribers find it challenging to adhere to current professional guidance.</p>
<p>With regard to written supporting information, both GMC and NMC guidance highlight leaflets produced for paediatric practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312465664">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312465664">7</xref></sup> A specific palliative care example is available,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312465664">1</xref></sup> and one will also be included in the updated specialist pain and palliative care society guidance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312465664">5</xref></sup> due to be published soon. It will be interesting to examine what, if any, impact this has on practice.</p>
<p>The most frequently cited drugs and their indications will likely be familiar to practitioners in palliative care, as would the main reason for taking greater care being to avoid confusion, allay anxiety and increase adherence. As illustrated by the inclusion of gabapentin, along with the general comments received, identifying every off-label use can be challenging, which has implications for practice and for surveys of this kind.</p>
<p>The nature of this survey meant that we were only able to superficially explore this area and more detailed qualitative work would be of value, including exploring the views of patients and carers. Our survey was also UK specific, but given that such issues are international, our results should be of interest to prescribers in other countries. Other limitations include not covering practice regarding unlicensed medicines. At the time of developing the survey, this was an area of uncertainty, as the mixing of two or more licensed medicines prior to administration had recently been considered to produce a new, unlicensed preparation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312465664">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312465664">10</xref></sup> We also did not include supplementary nurse or pharmacist prescribers, mainly because of problems in identifying them. However, they can only prescribe off-label within the terms of a clinical management plan, via which, in essence, a doctor delegates prescribing responsibilities to them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312465664">11</xref></sup> Other limitations include a lack of formal confirmation that nurse and pharmacist respondents were independent prescribers and the untargeted approach to pharmacists that resulted in a low response rate. Due caution should be applied to our findings for both these groups. However, obtaining the necessary approvals to identify independent prescribers through the NMC or GPhC was not possible within the timelines of the project.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that compared to our previous survey, doctors in palliative medicine are better able or willing to adhere to the latest GMC guidance. Independent nurse and pharmacist prescribers appear to find their requirement to always follow their current guidance in every instance of off-label use more challenging. Because all the independent prescribers in palliative care can now prescribe the same drugs, it is reasonable that there is regulatory consistency in this area of practice. Bringing the NMC and GPhC guidance in line with the latest GMC guidance would seem a logical step.</p>
