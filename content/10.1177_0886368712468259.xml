<abstract>
<p>The increasing importance of defined contribution plans, both as employer-provided plans and as mandatory individual accounts, has increased the responsibility placed on workers for making financial decisions. While early on it was assumed that workers would be capable of managing these accounts, studies have documented that many workers make financial mistakes. Financial education has been used as a remedy, but experience has shown that many workers are not interested and others do not follow up on changes they indicate they intend to make. The use of defaults for investments and increased transparency concerning fees are two further developments that have addressed this problem. Now, attention is turning increasingly to financial advice. However, often financial advisers have conflicts of interest that affect the quality and cost of the advice they provide. Some countries are enacting laws that address this issue.</p>

<body>
<p>The shift from defined benefit to defined contribution plans reallocates responsibility for investment decisions to individual workers. The choices workers make can have an important effect on their level of retirement income. By comparison, traditional defined benefit plans place less burden for decision-making responsibility on individual workers. Instead, financial professionals make decisions as to financial management of investments. Proponents of defined contribution plans argue that workers are capable of learning about financial markets and investments and making good financial decisions. Traditional economics, which assumes well-informed, rational decision makers, supports that position. Behavioral economics, however, focuses on the problems that many workers have making financial decisions. Many workers are not interested in, and some are not capable of, learning the financial information needed to adequately manage an individual account. In addition, the market for financial services is more complex and less transparent than most other markets for goods and services.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886368712468259">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this article, we discuss financial literacy and financial advice as they affect participants in defined contribution plans. They cause plans to take on added expenses in order to try to reduce the errors workers make.</p>
<p>We begin by discussing the lack of financial literacy and some of the types of errors that workers make in managing defined contribution pensions. We document that lack of financial literacy is widespread in a number of countries. We then discuss financial education, defaults and financial advice as possible responses. Financial education is seen often to have limited success, in part due to lack of interest by some workers. This discussion is followed by commentary on problems that have arisen with financial advice, including legal issues that arise when advisers do not have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of their clients. Then we explain how laws and regulations are evolving in different countries in response to the conflicts of interest. We offer conclusions in a final section.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886368712468259">
<title>Errors Investors Make</title>
<p>Making investment decisions is a complex process that requires an understanding of risk diversification as well as knowledge about different types of investments. A U.S. survey found that 34% of investors were “overwhelmed” by the options facing them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0886368712468259">2</xref></sup> Another study found that only 31% of U.S. workers are confident in their ability to manage their investments during retirement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0886368712468259">3</xref></sup> A Canadian study found that workers rated choosing the right investment for their individual account pension plan (RRSP plan in Canada) as more stressful than seeing the dentist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0886368712468259">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>While traditional economic theory assumes that investors do not make systematic errors, increasingly economic theory, using insights from behavioral economics, suggests otherwise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0886368712468259">5</xref></sup> Pension participants make at least three types of investment errors: insufficient diversification of their investment portfolio, unsuitable level of risk holdings in their investment portfolio and inappropriate portfolio adjustments, for example, in response to a market downturn.</p>
<p>In an attempt to improve the choices workers make, Sweden has provided investment information to the participants in its mandatory individual accounts pension system about their investment options. Survey results in Sweden, where workers can choose from more than 600 mutual funds,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0886368712468259">6</xref></sup> suggest that some participants may have been confused about their participation in the investment process. While 18% actually chose their investments (rather than taking the default), 34% thought they had.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0886368712468259">7</xref></sup> Another Swedish survey indicated that of those Swedes who made a choice, 73% could not name all the funds they had invested in and 41% could not name any of them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0886368712468259">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>A World Bank survey of the mandatory individual account pension systems in Latin America found that workers and retirees encountered problems in making a number of decisions required of them by those systems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0886368712468259">9</xref></sup> Workers problems extend beyond simply making investment decisions regarding the composition of their investment portfolio. They had difficulty choosing a pension fund management company, deciding whether to make additional contributions, deciding whether to switch into the privatized system (when that choice was open to them), deciding in what form to receive benefits (phased withdrawal, annuity) and choosing a life insurance company to provide an annuity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0886368712468259">
<title>Financial Literacy</title>
<p>A major reason why pension participants make investment errors may be a lack of financial literacy. Many do not have basic financial knowledge, lacking an understanding of financial terms and how financial markets work.</p>
<sec id="section3-0886368712468259">
<title>Causes of Financial Illiteracy</title>
<p>Numeracy is an aspect of financial literacy. It is the ability to apply simple mathematical concepts. One example of a lack of numeracy is exponential growth bias, which results in a lack of understanding of compound interest. Studies have shown that many people have a tendency to do linear (straight line) projections of growth of account balances, rather than exponential (upward curved) projections that are the result of compound interest. For this reason, they underestimate the benefits of saving because they underestimate its future value.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0886368712468259">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Literacy, the ability to understand written materials, is a basic skill needed for financial literacy. A study in the United Kingdom found that one fifth of young persons aged 16 to 19 years had low levels of literacy (17%) and numeracy (22%), making it difficult for them to function in the labor market.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0886368712468259">11</xref></sup> These people would also have difficulty dealing with issues relating to investments.</p>
<p>The errors participants make can be due to their lack of information when making investment decisions. Lack of information can include lack of knowledge about investing and lack of information about stock markets. Pension participants may lack information for financial decision making due to both the amount of information they have assimilated and the amount available to them. As a result of government or employer attempts to overcome the lack of information of some workers, some workers, however, may suffer from the opposite problem—information overload.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0886368712468259">12</xref></sup> They may have too much information, which also causes difficulties for workers in attempting to make investment decisions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886368712468259">
<title>Prevalence of Financial Illiteracy</title>
<p>A study of financial literacy in 28 countries found that according to its measure, the leading countries for financial literacy are Brazil, Mexico, Australia, United States and Canada.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0886368712468259">13</xref></sup> Nearly all of these countries place heavy reliance on defined contribution plans.</p>
<p>Even among countries that rank relatively high in financial literacy, many people lack basic financial knowledge. For example, a study in Canada found that 16% participating in an employer-provided pension plan did not know whether the plan was an individual account (defined contribution) or traditional pension (defined benefit) plan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0886368712468259">14</xref></sup> Studies generally show that people do not know what happens to bond prices when interest rates rise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0886368712468259">15</xref></sup> Apparently out of concern that workers do not know the meaning of <italic>pension account</italic>, the term <italic>pension pot</italic> is being used in the United Kingdom instead.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0886368712468259">16</xref></sup> Studies have indicated that a lack of financial literacy is prevalent in many countries. International research demonstrates that many workers lack financial literacy in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Italy and New Zealand.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0886368712468259">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the United States, studies document that many workers lack basic financial knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0886368712468259">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0886368712468259">19</xref></sup> A more recent survey of studies concluded that Americans lack basic financial literacy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0886368712468259">20</xref></sup> In another survey in the United States, only a third of respondents correctly answered three questions about inflation, interest rates and risk diversification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0886368712468259">21</xref></sup> Many people may not understand commonly used financial market jargon, such as “equity.” A survey of U.S. pension participants found that 10% did not know what the word “fund” meant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0886368712468259">22</xref></sup> A study in the United States found that fewer than one third of young adults had basic knowledge about risk diversification, interest rates and inflation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0886368712468259">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Chile is a leader of the social security movement toward mandatory individual accounts, having established such a system in 1981. In Chile, according to the 2009 Social Protection Survey, 94% of respondents indicated that they did not know anything about the pension options that existed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0886368712468259">24</xref></sup> This lack of knowledge existed even though the pension system had been in existence for more than 25 years. A study in Chile<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0886368712468259">25</xref></sup> found that workers with lower levels of financial literacy and lower education and income tended to rely on their employers, coworkers and friends more than on cost fundamentals in choosing a pension fund. As a result, they may make poor fund choices that adversely affect their retirement security.</p>
<p>One problem for people with low levels of financial literacy is that people tend to think they know more than they do. For example, a survey in Australia found that 67% indicated that they understood compound interest but only 28% were able to determine the correct answer to a problem involving that concept.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0886368712468259">26</xref></sup> Therefore, even before governments can successfully provide financial education, they need to convince workers that they need it.</p>

<sec id="section5-0886368712468259">
<title>Financial Education</title>
<p>Financial education has been a response to the problem of financial illiteracy for participants in defined contribution systems.</p>
<sec id="section6-0886368712468259">
<title>Growth in Financial Education</title>
<p>The growth in financial education provided by governments and employers in a number of countries is a direct result of the growing importance of defined contribution plans as voluntary or mandatory parts of retirement income systems. Financial education can cover topics such as investment terminology, asset allocation, risk tolerance and retirement goal setting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0886368712468259">27</xref></sup> Using financial education to address the lack of financial literacy of pension participants is not a quick fix but needs to be a long-term, sustained and costly effort.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0886368712468259">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several international organizations, such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the International Organisation of Pension Supervisors,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0886368712468259">29</xref></sup> have taken an interest in financial education for pension participants in defined contribution systems. In 2008, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development created the International Network on Financial Education.</p>
<p>A survey by the International Organisation of Pension Supervisors found that 16 out of 19 financial supervisors of pension systems provided some type of financial education.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0886368712468259">30</xref></sup> The pension supervisors not providing financial education tended to be fairly recently organized, with intentions of providing financial education in the future. In Chile, the pension supervisory authority has a specific budget set aside for financial education.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0886368712468259">31</xref></sup> Chile has launched several initiatives to encourage financial literacy. In Mexico, the pension supervisory authority has undertaken a comprehensive program of financial education.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0886368712468259">32</xref></sup> This program has provided financial education not only to workers and those nearing retirement but also to children in schools.</p>
<p>In the United States, 13 out of the 50 states require that children in secondary (high) school are required to take a class in personal finance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0886368712468259">33</xref></sup> In 2009, more than 20 U.S. federal government agencies had programs aimed at improving financial literacy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0886368712468259">34</xref></sup> One of the often overlooked aspects of programs aimed at improving financial literacy is their cost, in the case of these programs being paid out of general government tax revenues.</p>
<p>Related to financial education has been an increased focus on the content of periodic statements provided to pension participants. This focus is part of an effort to improve communication to participants. These statements are being used to attempt to improve the financial literacy of participants and their understanding of their pension plans. However, there is little consensus as to what information, beyond basic account information, should be provided and how it should be provided. In particular, there is no consensus as to whether projections of possible future account balances should be included and how they should be calculated so as to indicate the possible effects of financial market risk. Communicating to pension participants about risk is a difficult and unresolved aspect of financial education.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0886368712468259">35</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0886368712468259">
<title>Effectiveness of Financial Education</title>
<p>In the United States, financial education often occurs at the workplace. Evidence suggests that financial education programs have had some success in helping people who participate in them make better decisions concerning saving for retirement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0886368712468259">36</xref></sup> Studies of workplace financial education programs have shown improved financial literacy after taking the programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0886368712468259">37</xref></sup> These results, however, may be affected to some extent by selection bias, in that positive results are found for programs for people who voluntarily participate due to their interest in learning about the subject. Some studies show limited effects of financial education, which may be in part because the financial education provided was of limited duration, such as a onetime presentation. Also, some people have difficulty following through on their intentions for making changes following financial education.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0886368712468259">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Studies indicate that many people are not interested in financial education. One U.S. survey found that 56% of employees did not review the educational material provided by their pension plans. In that survey, 52% said that they do not have the time, interest or knowledge to manage their 401(k) plan adequately.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0886368712468259">39</xref></sup> These results indicate that provision of information alone is insufficient to deal with problems of financial literacy.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of financial education may depend in part on details as to how it is presented, with behavioral economics providing insights as to effective methods. A study of Chilean workers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0886368712468259">40</xref></sup> found that framing investment information relating to investment choices as gains rather than losses had a large effect on the way the information was perceived, particularly by people with lower levels of education.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0886368712468259">
<title>Transparency</title>
<p>A further alternative to dealing with problems of financial literacy is to make financial products more transparent in their features and costs. Often, pension participants do not understand the fees they are paying.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0886368712468259">41</xref></sup> Lack of understanding of fees may in part be the result of lack of transparency concerning fees. In addition, attempts can be made to standardize financial products, simplify them and limit their possible features so as to facilitate comparisons across financial products by pension participants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0886368712468259">42</xref></sup> A further approach is to standardize disclosure in order to make it easier for pension participants to compare costs and risks across financial products. Attempts have been made to assure that disclosures are made in “plain English,” meaning that they are written in language that is comprehensible by people with low levels of education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0886368712468259">
<title>Defaults</title>
<p>Transparency and financial education, however, rarely are sufficient to deal with the problems many participants face when they are given the responsibility for managing their investments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0886368712468259">43</xref></sup> One way of dealing with the lack of interest in and lack of knowledge of financial market issues of some participants in defined contribution systems is to establish defaults that provide reasonable outcomes for workers opting out of the decision-making process. Studies have shown that defaults can have a major impact on pension participants in some circumstances.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0886368712468259">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0886368712468259">45</xref></sup> Sweden has a default investment in its mandatory individual account system for people not choosing an investment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0886368712468259">46</xref></sup> Australia has also established a system of investment defaults for its mandatory individual account system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0886368712468259">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Defaults are a form of implicit advice, incorporating decision-making outcomes that experts view as desirable. With defaults, individuals who lack interest or knowledge in making financial decisions rely on the default investments to be a reasonable option. In addition, others who are knowledgeable may accept the default as a form of advice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0886368712468259">
<title>Banning Some Products or Practices</title>
<p>Another approach to protecting unsophisticated investors is to ban certain financial products or practices. For example, in the United States, financial advisers are not permitted to charge fees based on the performance of the clients’ portfolio, except for wealthy clients who are presumably sophisticated investors. Similarly, in the United States, participants in defined contribution plans and individual retirement accounts are prohibited from making certain investments, such as using their pension funds to purchase their home, short selling or investing in collectibles, such as artwork.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0886368712468259">
<title>Financial Advice</title>
<p>Because of the limited success of financial education, due to the lack of interest and engagement among some workers, attention by employers has also focused on making financial advice available to pension participants. While financial education provides general information about investments and financial markets, financial advice provides specific suggestions as to what investments to make. The use of advisers allows for specialization and economies of scale in the acquisition of financial skills and knowledge. With advisers, not everyone needs to become an expert. Financial expertise can be a specialized skill rather than one that is generally held.</p>
<sec id="section12-0886368712468259">
<title>Problems With Advice</title>
<p>Workers seeking financial advice concerning investment decisions may encounter problems relating to the advice they receive. These problems include use of jargon and confusing terminology relating to fees, lack of knowledge of the adviser about the client’s goals and risk tolerance, lack of disclosure of fees, conflicts of interest of financial advisers affecting the quality of advice, lack of fiduciary protection against conflicts of interest and a problem called hat switching. With hat switching, a financial adviser has different levels of responsibility to the client depending on the circumstances. For example, under some circumstances in the United States, advisers are required to provide advice in the best interest of their clients, while in other circumstances they are only required to provide advice that is suitable for their clients. This situation is not permitted in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>For a financial adviser to provide quality advice, that adviser must have some knowledge of the goals and risk tolerance of the client. This issue is formalized in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, in Know Your Client requirements that establish minimum standards for advisers concerning information they obtain from their clients. The United States has the suitability standard.</p>
<p>Financial advisers have conflicts of interest when they have a financial stake in the advice that they provide. For example, that occurs if the adviser receives greater compensation when he recommends investments with higher fees for the recipient of the advice. If the adviser is also a salesperson, he will probably advise purchasing the financial products he sells rather than other products.</p>
<p>Information financial advisers provide to participants can be tainted by conflicts of interest that the advisers have. Mutual funds, for example, often provide information about investing, but rarely does that information include the advice to determine how much the person is paying in fees, and to look for low-cost providers and funds. Lack of knowledge about fees charged can lead to participants paying higher fees than if they were better informed.</p>
<p>Workers with low financial literacy may be vulnerable to exploitation through bad advice, when the adviser can take advantage of his greater knowledge and profit by steering clients to more expensive options. In part because of problems clients have encountered when they seek financial advice, trust in financial services is at a low level. A recent survey in the European Union found that pension and investment services are mistrusted by many people, being ranked 50th among the services surveyed, ranking lower in trust than the market for used cars or for gambling.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0886368712468259">48</xref></sup> A survey in Australia indicated that 42% of people did not trust financial advisers and would not follow their recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0886368712468259">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Part of the problem arising from conflicts of interest is that financial advisers in some countries do not have a fiduciary duty to their clients. For example, in the United States, stockbrokers generally do not have a fiduciary duty to their clients when they provide advice that is incidental to their work as a broker. Financial advisers have a clear information advantage over their clients that they can exploit for their gain when they do not have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of their clients. This may result in agency costs, which are costs that clients bear when an agent does not act in the best interest of the client. Agency costs can include the client paying higher fees, taking on greater risk and having too much trading of their portfolio (churning), which causes them to incur transactions costs. A lack of educational standards for advisers, a lack of uniform certification requirements and insufficient regulation of conflicts of interest prevent financial advisers in some countries from achieving the quality expected of an advice profession.</p>
<p>An audit study in the United States has documented a number of problems with the financial advice that clients receive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0886368712468259">50</xref></sup> The study found that advisers push for actively managed portfolios with high fees, even if clients start with well-diversified portfolios with low fees. That study found that financial advisers tend to profit from investor errors. For example, some investors sell during downturns and buy during upturns, known as “chasing returns.” Rather than “debiasing” their clients, some advisers support that strategy, presumably because it involves greater sales commissions for themselves, even though it results in worse outcomes for their clients.</p>
<p>Australia has recognized the importance of pension participants receiving quality financial advice in its system of mandatory individual pension accounts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0886368712468259">51</xref></sup> It did a study where it rated the quality of financial advice that people received. Out of 64 cases reviewed, it found that only 2 people received what it considered to be high-quality financial advice. The majority (37 people) received adequate advice, while a significant minority (25 people) received poor-quality advice. People receiving poor advice received advice that was inappropriate for their situation.</p>
<p>One aspect of advice that makes problems of quality difficult to resolve is that most people are not capable of judging whether they receive good advice. In the Australian study, most people who received poor advice thought that they had received good advice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0886368712468259">52</xref></sup> People may have difficulty assessing the quality of advice they receive. Nonetheless, according to a survey by the Investor Protection Trust, about 20% of adults aged 65 years or older in the United States report having “been taken advantage of financially in terms of an inappropriate investment, unreasonably high fees for financial services, or outright fraud.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0886368712468259">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>A study in Singapore concerning the quality of financial advice received used “mystery shoppers,” who were people that took part in the study, but their advisers were not aware that the advice they provided would be graded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0886368712468259">54</xref></sup> The study found that frequently financial advisers did not obtain enough information from their clients to make suitable recommendations. For example, less than half asked about the clients’ risk preferences. It found that fees were not disclosed or discussed in nearly half of the cases studied. In 28% of the cases, the advice was judged to be suitable by independent financial experts; in 40% the advice might be suitable and in 28% the advice was not suitable for the clients’ needs.</p>
<p>Financial advice can provide a valuable service to clients. However, a U.S. survey found that 83% of those surveyed indicated that they would be interested in receiving professional assistance in managing their 401(k) plan, but only 10% took advantage of that option when it was offered.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0886368712468259">55</xref></sup></p>

<title>Effects of Advice</title>
<p>Several studies have examined the effects of advice on various outcomes. Hung and Yoong<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0886368712468259">56</xref></sup> examined survey data relating to defined contribution plan participants in the United States to study whether advice resulted in improved investment results. They found little evidence of improved results. In an experiment, they found some evidence that unsolicited advice was ineffective, but when participants actively solicited advice, the advice resulted in improved outcomes. Employees with low levels of financial literacy were more likely to solicit advice and to benefit from the advice.</p>
<p>Because of conflicts of interest, recipients of advice may actually have worse outcomes than those not receiving advice. A study in Germany of bank customers who used a financial adviser compensated through commissions found that the portfolios of those customers had lower rates of return net of costs than customers not using an adviser.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0886368712468259">57</xref></sup> Similarly, a U.S. study found that mutual funds recommended by financial advisers underperformed other mutual funds on a risk-adjusted basis, taking into account fees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0886368712468259">58</xref></sup> Furthermore, relating to the usefulness of advice concerning asset allocation of investments, a study has found that the issue of asset allocation in savings is of relatively little importance to most American workers because they have so little invested in capital markets. Issues of savings rates and retirement ages are more important.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0886368712468259">59</xref></sup></p>

<title>Financial Advice Reforms</title>
<p>A number of countries are considering the issues of the quality of financial advice and its cost and are considering reforms that would increase consumer protection.</p>
<list id="list1-0886368712468259" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>United States</italic>: The U.S. Department of Labor is working on proposed regulations to improve the quality of advice to pension plan participants. Proposals have been made to extend fiduciary standards that apply to investment advisers to brokers. Similarly, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing data on the costs and benefits of extending fiduciary obligations to brokers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0886368712468259">60</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>United Kingdom</italic>: To improve the quality of advice, the United Kingdom has made it illegal, starting at the end of 2012, for advisers to receive commissions for selling products to clients. Advisers who sell products tend to recommend the products they sell, which may not be the best products for particular clients. Instead, advisers will be required to charge their clients fees for their services. This approach will reduce conflicts of interest that advisers have. It will have the further advantage that the compensation advisers receive will be more transparent. This reform is being made because the receipt of commissions has been viewed as the root cause of the pension misselling scandal in the United Kingdom. Previously, financial advisers receiving commissions for making recommendations to pension participants had an obligation to make recommendations in the best interest of the participant, but it had become clear that because of commissions that approach was not working.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>One criticism of banning commissions is that a single fee paid at the time of the advice may be too expensive for some pension participants, effectively preventing them from receiving advice. If the upfront fees are too expensive for a participant to pay at one time, advisers in the United Kingdom are permitted to spread the fee charged over a period of time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0886368712468259">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>An additional new requirement in the United Kingdom is that advisers will be required to inform their clients whether their advice is independent, meaning that they provide advice over a full range of investment options, or is restricted, meaning that the advice the provide is only over a limited range of investments options, such as the options provided by the company they work for.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0886368712468259">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>As of the end of 2012, a new agency in the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority, will have responsibility for protecting consumers in financial markets. A regulatory issue this agency will face is the trade-off between protecting some consumers from detriment by not permitting certain risky investment products and limiting the choice of others.</p>
<list id="list2-0886368712468259" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Australia</italic>: Australia is implementing legislation to improve the quality of advice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0886368712468259">63</xref></sup> To address problems associated with financial advice, Australia has instituted the Future of Financial Advice reform. This reform takes effect in July 2013. By eliminating commissions for advisers, the reform eliminates the problem of “hat switching,” which occurs when an adviser receives fees for advice but also receives commissions depending on what he advises that the client purchases. In addition, advisers have a statutory requirement to act in the best interest of their clients, which is commonly considered to be a fiduciary duty. Thus, when they recommend a financial product, they will have the duty to recommend the product that is in the best interest of their client, not merely suitable for the client. Also, the reform attempts to improve the transparency of fees. Relating to the issue of fees, when advisers provide ongoing advice, they will be required to renew their fee agreement with clients every 2 years in order to help assure that clients are clear as to the fees they are paying. In addition, the reforms attempt to facilitate the provision of “scaled” advice, which would be advice on a limited set of issues, at lower fees, rather than a full-scale review of their financial situation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>The Netherlands</italic>: The Netherlands is addressing problems related to financial advice. The Minister of Finance is considering legislation to improve the quality of advice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0886368712468259">64</xref></sup> The Minister is considering requiring that every adviser have a college degree, that there be more emphasis on continuing education for financial advisers and that examination questions for advisers’ certification correspond more to the actual situations for which they provide advice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Singapore</italic>: Singapore is considering reforms of the way financial advice is provided. The Singapore regulator has already introduced limits on fees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0886368712468259">65</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>India</italic>: India has banned load fees charged on purchases of investment products.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0886368712468259">66</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>While a number of countries are taking steps to increase the availability of unbiased financial advice to pension participants, the question remains whether implementing costly reforms will help participants in terms of improving pension outcomes.</p>

<sec id="section15-0886368712468259">
<title>Legal Issues</title>
<p>As the foregoing discussion indicates, countries around the world face similar issues when structuring a legal framework intended to increase access to financial advice while also ensuring that advice is not degraded by conflicts of interest, fraud or misrepresentation of the adviser’s qualifications. Examples also exist to illustrate the potential legal issues that result when a population is not financially literate.</p>
<sec id="section16-0886368712468259">
<title>Misselling in the United Kingdom</title>
<p>In the late 1980s, U.K. citizens were permitted to choose more individualized pensions, known as personal pensions, where they could select the pension provider, rather than participate in the public pension scheme or a scheme offered by their employers. Insurance companies and financial advisers aggressively sold personal pensions without complying with the regulations that required them to understand the risk preferences and financial positions of their customers. A study commissioned after the misselling came to the attention of regulators concluded the lack of regulatory compliance was widespread.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0886368712468259">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>The misselling caused many employees who bought personal pensions to be worse off than if they would have stayed in their employer’s occupational scheme. At least at the time, the benefits formulas of occupational schemes tended to result in higher benefits than the investment returns on the personal pensions. Also, employers did not contribute to personal pensions; only employees contributed to them. In comparison, employers typically did contribute to occupational schemes. So, the employees who were sold personal pensions forfeited their employer’s contributions and received lower returns on the money they personally contributed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0886368712468259">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some experts held both the financial services industry and the regulatory system to blame for the misselling scandal. The financial services industry provided compensation incentives for their sales forces to market personal pensions. This illustrates the potential effects of conflicts of interest, particularly when a new market opens up due to a rapid shift in a country’s retirement funding paradigm. At the same time, regulators had little experience with the products being sold and the marketing techniques being used because of the shift in the paradigm to increase employee choice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0886368712468259">69</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section17-0886368712468259">
<title>Australia’s Attention to Defaults</title>
<p>Australia’s government-run pension system, known as the Age Pension, is a pay-as-you-go pension program that is both means and asset tested. Australia also has a mandatory employment-based system, known as the Superannuation Guarantee (SG System), that requires employers to contribute 9% of income for most employees to an individual account.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0886368712468259">70</xref></sup> Because the Age Pension is means and asset tested, retirees with higher SG System account balances are less likely to qualify for the Age Pension. In 2010, a panel constituted by the Australian government to study the SG System released its report, which has come to be known as the “Cooper Report.” The two-part report addresses many perceived deficiencies in the SG System and made recommendations for improvement. The panel’s findings on the importance of defaults are of particular interest. The panel determined that having a financially literate population as a long-term goal would be useful. However, critical to the Cooper Report’s recommendation was its finding that shorter term issues could not be resolved through education and financial literacy. Instead, it based its recommendation for a low-cost, more heavily regulated default system on the principle that not all members of the SG System are able or want to be involved in investment selection. Australia is currently in the process of moving toward the MySuper default product recommended in the Cooper Report.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0886368712468259">71</xref></sup></p>

<title>Regulation of Investment Advice in the United States</title>
<p>The issues of financial literacy and financial advice have become more important as the population ages, the United States becomes increasing reliant on a defined contribution paradigm and the twin problems of high unemployment and a volatile stock market challenge retirement wealth creation.</p>
<p>Over the past 2 years, the most controversial regulatory issue of import for this paper has been whether the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Employee Benefits Security Administration of the Department of Labor will apply fiduciary obligations to a larger set of financial services entities and individuals. The Employee Benefits Security Administration proposed regulations to accomplish that in 2010 and, after congressional hearings, widespread publicity and significant industry concern, withdrew the proposed regulations in 2011. Reportedly efforts continue to revise the proposed regulations for reissue. In response to a legislative requirement, the SEC staff studied the differing levels of client obligation, from fiduciary to suitability, discussed above as well as the hat-switching problem. In a report issued in 2011, the SEC staff recommended adoption of a single federal fiduciary standard that would apply to brokers as well as investment advisers. The costs and benefits of such an approach remain under study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0886368712468259">72</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Studies have documented widespread financial illiteracy in many countries. While lack of literacy and numeracy are causes of lack of financial literacy, financial literacy rates are considerably lower than literacy rates. Financial education has been the focus of efforts to deal with financial illiteracy, but studies have documented that it often has limited success, perhaps because many workers are not interested. In addition, some workers have had difficulty following through on changes that they intended to implement following financial education. Thus, while some programs have succeeded in improving financial knowledge, they have done less well in changing financial behavior.</p>
<p>The limited effectiveness of financial education has shifted the focus in some countries to issues of financial advice. Workers seeking financial advice, however, have encountered a number of problems. Perhaps the most significant is conflicts of interest that financial advisers may have, combined with not having a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of their clients. Conflicts of interest arise because of the ways that the compensation of advisers is determined. For example, a financial adviser may receive higher compensation when he recommends a financial product that charges the recipient of the advice higher fees. Studies in several countries have documented that many clients are receiving financial advice that is not appropriate for their needs. The level of fees charged is another issue. Frequently, fees are not disclosed or are not disclosed in a manner that is salient to the client. Because of the problems with the quality and cost of financial advice, a number of countries are considering reforms of the ways that financial advice is provided.</p>
