<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>. Patient decision aids facilitate treatment decisions. They are often evaluated in terms of their effect on decisional conflict, as measured by the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). It is unclear to what extent lower DCS scores are accompanied by observable patient behavior or emotions. <bold>Objective</bold>. To help interpret DCS scores. <bold>Design</bold>. In a Dutch university hospital, statements on behaviors or emotions during decision making were collected from asymptomatic aneurysm patients and healthy employees. Subsequently, they rated the intensity of decisional conflict that each statement expresses on a 1 to 10 scale. Selected statements were prospectively tested in aneurysm patients and cancer patients facing treatment dilemmas. <bold>Measurements</bold>. Associations between patients’ DCS scores and reported behavior and emotions were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. <bold>Results</bold>. Participants provided 363 statements on behaviors and emotions during decision making, of which 28 were mentioned more than 4 times. Nine forms of behavior and emotions were selected as they were graded with the least variable median ratings of intensity of decisional conflict. Among 100 patients facing a treatment dilemma, each point increase in DCS lowered their odds for “immediately making the decision” (odds ratio [OR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93–0.98), whereas the odds of “fretting regularly” (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02–1.08) and “feeling nervous when thinking of the decision” (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01–1.06) where higher. <bold>Conclusions</bold>. A decrease in decisional conflict scores leads to less decision postponing behavior, fretting, and nervousness. Research should focus on which DCS scores are needed to make deliberate decisions and which scores hinder patients in decision making.</p>

<body>
<p>Whenever multiple treatment options are available, without one option being superior, patient preferences need to be incorporated in treatment decision making. This may be challenging to patients, especially in high-stake decisions involving risk, loss, or regret.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12453500">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12453500">2</xref></sup> For example, women considering adjuvant radiotherapy after surgery for endometrial cancer have to weigh the reduced risk of tumor recurrence against the risk of radiation-induced harm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X12453500">3</xref></sup> Men offered prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening have no guarantee that taking the test decreases their overall mortality risk, and participating in screening may expose them to the potential harm of diagnostic follow-up and iatrogenic consequences of prostate cancer treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12453500">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12453500">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patient decision aids have been developed to explore patient preferences and values and to facilitate decision making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X12453500">6</xref></sup> These tools contain information on treatment options and outcomes related to the patient’s health status. Such decision aids are often considered effective if a controlled study has shown that their use lowers scores on the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X12453500">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X12453500"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12453500">8</xref></sup> This DCS expresses the degree of uncertainty within an individual about which course of action to undertake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12453500">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X12453500">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>To those using the DCS, it is not always intuitive how to interpret the magnitude of the scores. It is unclear what observable behavior or emotions are expressed by patients at different levels of decisional conflict. Some symptoms such as hesitation, verbalized concern, self-focusing, and restlessness were defined when the concept of decisional conflict was initially introduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12453500">1</xref></sup> It was suggested that people with high decisional conflict scores were more likely to delay the decision, change their mind, or express decisional regret.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X12453500">10</xref></sup> One study found that increasing decisional conflict scores independently predicted men blaming their doctor for bad outcomes if they had undergone PSA testing for prostate cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12453500">11</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the empirical documentation of these behavioral expressions of decisional conflict in the health care setting is limited.</p>
<p>If signs and symptoms of patients in decisional conflict could be identified, this would help to further validate the DCS and interpret the magnitude of DCS scores. Moreover, one could determine the extent to which DCS scores need to be decreased to realize an improvement that is, besides statistically significant, also relevant to the patient.</p>
<p>To be able to interpret numeric DCS scores, we collected statements on behavior and emotions people experience during decision making. We invited patients and healthy hospital employees to rate the intensity of decisional conflict that each statement expresses, and we prospectively tested them in other patients faced with decisions about treatment. In our analysis, we compared these patients’ DCS scores with the extent to which they reported behavior and emotions associated with decisional conflict.</p>
<sec id="section1-0272989X12453500" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was conducted in a Dutch university hospital and comprised 3 phases, based on Thurstone’s classic method of equal-appearing intervals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12453500">12</xref></sup> This method is used to measure the attitude toward a given construct. First, a large number of statements are collected that relate to the construct being measured. Second, judges rate these statements in categories of favorableness toward the construct. The statements with the least variable median ratings are used to construct a questionnaire. Third, participants administer the questionnaire by agreeing or disagreeing with each item. The ethical board waived formal ethical approval as the study neither intervened in the patients’ medical treatment nor affected their psychological integrity.</p>
<sec id="section2-0272989X12453500">
<title>Phase I: Collecting Statements about Behavior and Emotions in Decision Making</title>
<p>The first phase was conducted in 2 groups of participants. Patients with an asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm were informed by their doctor and were asked verbal consent to participate in the study immediately after their visit to the outpatient clinic. The second group consisted of healthy employees of the hospital’s clinical epidemiology and quality assurance departments. They were approached by the investigators via e-mail. These 2 groups were selected to secure a wide range of reported behaviors and emotions when experiencing decisional conflict.</p>
<p>Participants provided written statements about behavior they had displayed or emotions they had experienced while having to make important decisions (e.g., “I ask my family for advice” or “I become nervous whenever I think of the decision”). They could think of both medical and other important decisions they had been facing, which had been either easy or difficult to decide about. Two investigators independently assessed all statements. They removed statements from the resulting list if they were incomplete or when both investigators found them unrelated to decision-making behavior. Disagreements in classification were reconciled by discussion with a third investigator. In the same way, similar statements were grouped. A frequency table was drawn for the list of statements. Statements were regarded as being representative and included in the second phase if they had been mentioned more than 4 times.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0272989X12453500">
<title>Phase II: Rating the Intensity of Decisional Conflict Each Statement Expresses</title>
<p>In the second phase of the study, other aneurysm patients visiting the outpatient clinic at that particular time were approached, together with the same hospital employees who had been invited to participate in phase I. They judged the intensity of decisional conflict as expressed by each of the included statements on behaviors and emotions. Participants were instructed to think of somebody who has to make a difficult decision about undergoing major surgery. They were asked to grade each statement on a 1 to 10 scale, using round numbers, with 1 representing no uncertainty and 10 meaning severe uncertainty about which course of action to undertake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12453500">1</xref></sup> Median values and interquartile ranges (IQRs) of the ratings were then calculated for each statement. The statements with the least variable median ratings were selected as they represent the most specific intensity of decisional conflict.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0272989X12453500">
<title>Phase III: Prospective Testing of the Statements with Patients in Decision about Treatment</title>
<p>In the third phase, a convenience sample of aneurysm patients and cancer patients who had just discussed treatment options with their doctor at the outpatient clinic was invited. Newly diagnosed aneurysm patients had discussed whether or not to undergo elective surgery. Patients with prostate cancer and endometrial cancer had discussed the pros and cons of (adjuvant) radiotherapy.</p>
<p>The remaining list of statements, representing specific degrees of decisional conflict, was presented to them in a questionnaire to fill out at home once only. This also contained the DCS in Dutch,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X12453500">13</xref></sup> the items concerning anxiety from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and some demographic questions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X12453500">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X12453500">15</xref></sup> For each statement developed in the first 2 phases of the study, participants were invited to reflect whether they actually displayed the behavior or experienced the emotion as specified. They could respond to the statement by either “yes, this is applicable to me” or “no, this is not applicable to me.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0272989X12453500">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The presence of the reported behaviors and emotions was related to decisional conflict scores, as measured by the DCS, by means of logistic regression analysis. The DCS score was used as the independent variable and the presence or absence of the behaviors or emotions as the dependent variables. Effects are reported as odds ratios per point increase on the DCS, with 95% confidence intervals. Given the multiple logistic regression analyses, we focused on <italic>P</italic> values less than 0.01 in identifying significant associations between reported behaviors and emotions and DCS scores.</p>
<p>Confidence intervals around the odds ratios were estimated to be about 0.05 wide. This effectively means that significant odds ratios of 1.04 or higher (per DCS score unit) could be found at the 1% significance level. Data were processed and analyzed using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc., an IBM Company, Chicago, IL).</p>

<title>Phase I: Collecting Statements about Behavior and Emotions in Difficult Decisions</title>
<p>Following their visit at the outpatient clinic, 31 consecutive asymptomatic aortic aneurysm patients provided 123 statements about behavior they had displayed or emotions they had experienced while making difficult decisions.

<title>Phase III: Prospective Testing of the Statements with Patients in Decision about Treatment</title>
<p>In the third and final phase, 100 aneurysm and cancer patients completed the questionnaire. In particular, male patients of about 70 years of age and with varying levels of education participated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272989X12453500">Table 2</xref>). After the visit to their doctor in which treatment options were explained and pros and cons were discussed, about half of the patients stated to be sure regarding their preferred treatment option (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272989X12453500">Table 2</xref>). They had a median DCS score of 27 (IQR, 15–39) on a 100-point scale.

<p>Three questionnaires could not be used in the univariate logistic regression analysis due to missing DCS scores. Based on the remaining 97 questionnaires, 3 of 9 statements showed a significant association between DCS score and the likelihood of patients reporting to express the corresponding behavior or emotion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272989X12453500">Table 3</xref>). For each point increase in DCS, the odds of “immediately making the decision” were 4% lower (odds ratio [OR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93–0.98). The odds of “fretting regularly” (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02–1.08) and “feeling nervous when thinking of the decision” (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01–1.06) increased with 5% and 4%, respectively. Resulting from these ORs, a 10-point increase in DCS score led to a 34% decreased odds of immediately making the decision, a 63% increased odds of fretting regularly, and a 48% increased odds of nervousness.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0272989X12453500">Figure 2</xref>, the number of patients who agreed with these 3 statements is plotted against several levels of decisional conflict. An increase in DCS score from 20 to 30 points was associated with a substantial decrease in the number of patients who made the decision immediately (from 73% to 57%). The same increase in DCS score was associated with more patients fretting regularly about their treatment decision (from 18% to 26%) and becoming nervous (from 9% to 22%).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we evaluated associations between DCS scores and the likelihood of expressing specific behaviors or emotions, previously identified as associated with important decisions. The odds of fretting regularly and feeling nervous when thinking of the decision were higher in those with higher decisional conflict scores, whereas the odds of immediately making the decision were lower.</p>
<p>Six other forms of behavior and emotion, which were judged to express a moderate intensity of decisional conflict, were not significantly associated with the DCS. Apparently, these behaviors and emotions are expressed independent of the strength of a patient’s rational dilemma about treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272989X12453500">16</xref></sup> The 3 associations found between behavior or emotions and DCS score were rather weak. For example, a considerable number of patients with high DCS scores stated not to display the forms of behavior and emotions despite their attribution to the category of high conflict. These weak associations may be explained by the fact that the DCS was not developed to measure decision-making behavior or emotions but instead a patient’s internal conflict in medical decisions. The forms of behavior and emotions we indentified here may, for instance, depend more strongly on character traits than on the psychological burden of having to make a treatment decision.</p>
<p>Although decisional conflict is all about what people go through when confronted with a difficult decision, the concept of decisional conflict has rarely been related to behavioral outcomes, emotional states, or measures of character traits in the hospital setting. In a clinical trial on active surveillance for early prostate cancer, higher DCS scores were associated with higher neuroticism scores, whereas high extraversion was associated with lower DCS scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X12453500">17</xref></sup> Patients with strong intentions regarding invitations to influenza vaccination, genetic testing, treatment options for localized prostate cancer, and early stage breast cancer were found to have lower levels of decisional conflict than those whose intentions were uncertain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X12453500">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X12453500">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X12453500">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X12453500">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the end, a decision between several reasonable options has to be made that fits patient preferences and values regarding treatment outcomes. Pathologic degrees of decisional conflict might lead to decisions with disadvantageous benefit v. harm tradeoffs and even unwanted treatment outcomes such as death or severely impaired quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272989X12453500">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore, a reduction in decisional conflict is usually the primary outcome measure in studies in which patient decision aids are deployed to facilitate treatment decision making. The underlying theory of the DCS is that high scores could lead to hypervigilant coping strategies, in which patients make hasty decisions that give immediate relief from the stress and conflict.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12453500">1</xref></sup> Yet, the full range of consequences is overlooked because of emotional excitement and limited attention.</p>
<p>However, some degree of decisional conflict may actually be essential to make high-stakes therapy decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12453500">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X12453500">21</xref></sup> Although empirical studies are lacking, according to the concept of decisional conflict, patients should be sufficiently aroused and motivated to engage in decision making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12453500">1</xref></sup> We advocate refinement of the expressions of decisional conflict into a continuum: More studies are needed to discriminate between benign features of decisional conflict, leading to deliberate health decisions, and harmful symptoms of decisional conflict, as well as in which range of DCS scores these symptoms may occur. Moreover, studies should also consider the time frame: There may be a time when features of decisional conflict are very healthy, but persistence for too long may be harmful.</p>
<p>Several potential limitations need to be addressed regarding the present study. First, the process for selecting the measures putatively related to decisional conflict was not built on a specific theory or driven by professionals in treatment decision making. We explicitly chose to follow a pragmatic approach by involving patients and healthy volunteers in identifying the forms of behavior and emotions, in order to attune to daily practice and to illustrate decisional conflict scores in concrete terms of daily life. Second, the external validity of our findings might be limited since predominantly male patients of about 70 years of age were included. Third, higher levels of decisional conflict were underrepresented in our patient sample, which corresponds to previous findings of patients overestimating their stability while in decision making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X12453500">22</xref></sup> Therefore, we were unable to make more refined analyses for patients with scores at the upper end of the scale, and chances to detect significant associations of those behavioral responses that correspond with a higher decisional conflict declined. Further research is warranted with a different case mix of patients in terms of demographic data and levels of decisional conflict.</p>
<p>In conclusion, future users of the DCS may be interested to learn that a decrease in decisional conflict scores leads to less fretting, nervousness, and decision-postponing behavior. In contrast, DCS scores are not seamlessly associated with other behaviors or emotions, such as the likelihood of asking for advice from friends or family or seeking contact with other patients facing a similar decision. Future research should focus on which levels of decisional conflict are needed to make deliberate decisions, which levels would hinder patients in decision making and doctors should act upon, and to what extent DCS scores need to be decreased to realize an improvement that is relevant to the patient.</p>
