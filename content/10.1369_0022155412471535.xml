<abstract>
<p>To simultaneously visualize individual cell nuclei and tissue morphologies of the zebrafish retina under bright field light microscopy, it is necessary to establish a procedure that specifically and sensitively stains the cell nuclei in thin tissue sections. This necessity arises from the high nuclear density of the retina and the highly decondensed chromatin of the cone photoreceptors, which significantly reduces their nuclear signals and makes nuclei difficult to distinguish from possible high cytoplasmic background staining. Here we optimized a procedure that integrates JB4 plastic embedding and Feulgen reaction for visualizing zebrafish retinal cell nuclei under bright field light microscopy. This method produced highly specific nuclear staining with minimal cytoplasmic background, allowing us to distinguish individual retinal nuclei despite their tight packaging. The nuclear staining is also sensitive enough to distinguish the euchromatin from heterochromatin in the zebrafish cone nuclei. In addition, this method could be combined with in situ hybridization to simultaneously visualize the cell nuclei and mRNA expression patterns. With its superb specificity and sensitivity, this method may be extended to quantify cell density and analyze global chromatin organization throughout the retina or other tissues.</p>

<p>The zebrafish is a good model to study the etiology of age-related macular degeneration in humans because similar to the human macula, the zebrafish retina is also enriched with cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022155412471535">Østerberg 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155412471535">Clark 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022155412471535">Branchek and Bremiller 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022155412471535">Curcio et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022155412471535">Bilotta et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022155412471535">Doerre and Malicki 2002</xref>). To study retinal degeneration, it is desirable to quantify precisely how the retina loses cells both spatially and temporally. A direct way to quantify cell loss is to count the number of cell nuclei under light microscopy because each retinal cell has one cell nucleus.</p>
<p>Direct nuclear counting can, however, be difficult because of the high nuclear density in the retina. This difficulty arises from the lower vertical resolution of light microscopy compared to its planar resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155412471535">Bertero and De Mol 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022155412471535">Lauer 2002</xref>). The vertical resolution can be greatly influenced by the thickness of tissue sections. For thick sections, when the boundaries of the cell nuclei are oriented obliquely to the axis of optical imaging, the images of two closely juxtaposed cell nuclei may merge together from a top view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412471535">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155412471535">Fig. 2</xref>). In thin sections, this problem may be less severe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412471535">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, thin tissue sectioning provides weaker nuclear signals, which could be problematic when nonspecific cytoplasmic staining is too strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412471535">Fig. 1C</xref>). Therefore, to reliably quantify the loss of retinal cells in particular retinal regions under bright field light microscopy, it is necessary to specifically and sensitively stain the cell nuclei in thin tissue sections.</p>

<p>The above need can be met by integrating JB-4 plastic resin’s superb capability of preserving tissue morphology and Feulgen reaction’s highly specific nuclear staining. JB-4 embedding is based on glycol methacrylate polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022155412471535">Higuchi et al. 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155412471535">Cole 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022155412471535">Helander 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022155412471535">Ladekarl 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155412471535">Miller and Meyer 1990</xref>). Because the polymerization occurs after the monomeric reagents infiltrate the biological samples, JB-4 embedding faithfully preserves sample morphology. In addition, the hard JB-4 resin is suitable for sectioning at thicknesses as low as 0.5 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022155412471535">Bancroft and Gamble 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To stain the cell nuclei, four general types of dyes or reagents are frequently used. These are based on electrostatic binding, hydrophobic interactions, covalent modifications, or immuno-reactivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022155412471535">Kiernan 2008</xref>). Feulgen nuclear staining, invented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022155412471535">Feulgen and Rossenbeck (1924)</xref>, is based on a covalent reaction between Schiff’s reagents and the aldehyde groups generated by HCl hydrolysis of the bond between the deoxyribose residues and the bases of DNA molecules. This reaction generates pinkish products and consequently stains the cell nuclei that store the majority of the cellular DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022155412471535">Overend and Stacey 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412471535">Lessler 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022155412471535">Van Duijn 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022155412471535">Chieco et al. 1994</xref>). Thus, this chemical reaction underlies the superb specificity of Feulgen nuclear staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022155412471535">Pearse 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022155412471535">Kurnick 1955</xref>). Procedures that combined JB4 embedding and Feulgen staining have been reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155412471535">Schulte and Wittekind 1989</xref>). However, this study was performed on 4-µm-thick sections of tissues with sparsely distributed nuclei. Because thick sectioning is not suitable for counting densely packed zebrafish retinal cells, a specialized protocol for visualizing the cell nuclei in thin sections of the zebrafish retina was needed.</p>
<p>Here, we report a protocol that combines JB4 plastic embedding and Feulgen staining to visualize zebrafish retinal cell nuclei. We analyzed the effects of JB4 section thickness, extent of HCl hydrolysis, and Schiff reaction conditions on nuclear staining and visualization. As a result, we optimized a protocol that produces sensitive and specific nuclear staining of thin sections of the zebrafish retina. In conjunction with three-dimensional reconstruction algorithms, this method has the potential to be utilized for reliable nuclear quantification.</p>

<p>To find out the optimal conditions for HCl hydrolysis of tissue DNA molecules, JB-4 sections of zebrafish eyes were incubated with 1 N, 2 N, 3 N, 4 N, or 5 N HCl in coplin jars at room temperature for periods from 30 minutes up to overnight. The slides were then washed with distilled water for 10 min to remove excess HCl and then incubated with Schiff’s reagents (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; Catalog #: sc-301793) for 2 hrs at room temperature. To determine a sufficient time for Schiff reaction, sections that were treated with 3 N HCl overnight were incubated with Schiff’s reagents at room temperature for 30 min to 5 hrs. To determine the durability of the Feulgen staining, the stained sections (by 3 N HCl overnight hydrolysis and 2 hrs of incubation with the Schiff’s reagents) were rinsed for 30 seconds with tap water and then washed with distilled water for 5 min, 30 min or overnight at room temperature.

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Feulgen staining is based on two basic chemical reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022155412471535">Overend and Stacey 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412471535">Lessler 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412471535">Fig. 3N</xref>). First, HCl hydrolysis breaks up the bond between a base and a deoxyribose residue of a DNA molecule, resulting in an aldehyde group on the dexoyribose residue of the DNA backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412471535">Fig. 3N</xref>). Second, the resulting aldehyde group condenses with Schiff’s reagents to produce a pink-colored quinonoid compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412471535">Fig. 3N</xref>). Thus, the amount of the pink product correlates directly with the amount of DNA material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022155412471535">Böhm and Sprenger 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022155412471535">Duijndam and Van Duijn 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022155412471535">Böcking et al. 1995</xref>). When biological samples are embedded in JB-4 resin, the JB-4 matrix will hinder the penetration of the chemical reagents and slow down the above mentioned chemical reactions. Thus, compared with thin sections, although thick JB-4 sections contain more DNA material for Feulgen staining, the reduction in the chemical reactions implies that staining intensity may not increase proportionally with the increase in thickness. In addition, thick sections could jeopardize the image quality because of the limitation of the vertical resolution of light microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155412471535">Bertero and De Mol 1996</xref>). Thus, to best visualize zebrafish retinal nuclei, we need to seek a balance between signal intensity and image resolution. We therefore systematically analyzed, as presented below, how HCl hydrolysis and Schiff reaction conditions, as well as the thickness of JB4 sections, affect Feulgen staining of zebrafish retinal nuclei.</p>

<title>HCl Hydrolysis Conditions for Feulgen Staining</title>
<p>HCl hydrolysis for Feulgen staining can be carried out under many different conditions. To determine the optimal HCl concentrations for Feulgen staining of zebrafish retina embedded in JB-4, we treated 4 µm JB-4 sections in 1 N, 2 N, 3 N, 4 N, or 5 N HCl for various durations before treating them with Schiff’s reagents. We then judged the extent of Feulgen staining by visual inspection of the intensity of the pink staining. We found that higher HCl concentrations and longer incubations produced stronger staining than lower HCl concentrations and shorter incubation times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412471535">Fig. 3A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412471535">J</xref>). Furthermore, lower HCl concentrations were able to be combined with longer incubation times to increase the staining intensity. Thus, for quick and reliable hydrolysis, we recommend incubating JB-4 embedded tissue sections with 5N HCl for 45 min. Alternatively, a 3 N HCl overnight treatment is sufficient to achieve a similar extent of hydrolysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022155412471535">
<title>Duration of Schiff Reaction on Feulgen Staining</title>
<p>Because the Schiff reaction is a covalent condensation reaction between the aldehyde groups and Schiff’s reagents, the duration of the Schiff reaction will also affect the ultimate amount of pink staining that is produced. We thus next compared the effects of various Schiff incubation durations on the staining intensity, using 4-µm-thick JB4 sections that were treated with 3N HCl overnight. We found that staining became stronger with longer Schiff incubation but reached the maximum intensity after 2 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412471535">Fig. 3K</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412471535">M</xref>). Thus, we conclude that a 2-hr incubation with Schiff’s reagent is sufficient for Feulgen staining of JB-4 sections to visualize the cell nuclei.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0022155412471535">
<title>Section Thickness on Nuclear Distinguishability and Chromatin Morphology</title>
<p>We next compared how the section thickness affects Feulgen staining and the distinguishability of nuclear boundaries. We found that the intensities of staining in 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-µm sections were all strong enough to visualize the cell nuclei of all types of retinal cells. However, we found that the thicker the section, the harder it was to discern individual nuclei because of the increased image overlap of neighboring nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155412471535">Fig. 2</xref>). Considering that sections can frequently be torn apart when sectioned at 2-µm thickness, we recommend sectioning at 3 µm to reveal discrete nuclei and overall tissue morphology.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we were surprised to notice that the Feulgen staining of 2-µm-thick sections was also strong and sensitive enough to distinguish the euchromatic from heterochromatic regions in cone nuclei, though not in rod photoreceptors; these two types of chromatin display morphological differences that greatly resemble those observed under transmission electron microscopy (TEM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155412471535">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155412471535">B</xref>). This capability of Feulgen staining to distinguish euchromatin from heterochromatin in cones may have very useful applications. Because the regulation of global chromatin organization in the cell nuclei is an important epigenetic mechanism to regulate gene expression, it makes sense to examine a causal relationship between chromatin organization and various cone dystrophies. Considering how time-consuming the conventional TEM procedure is, our Feulgen staining procedure offers an easy and robust alternative for examining the global chromatin organization in cone photoreceptors in zebrafish.</p>

<title>Comparisons Among Feulgen, Methylene Blue-Azure II, and Nuclear Fast Red Staining</title>
<p>Methylene blue-azure II and nuclear fast red are cationic dyes that stain tissues through electrostatic binding to negatively charged molecules. Thus, they are frequently used to stain the cell nuclei because DNA is negatively charged. However, they also stain other negatively charged cytoplamic molecules, which results in cytoplamic staining that can be either useful or problematic, depending on the staining purposes.</p>
<p>We thus next compared Feulgen staining with methylene blue-azure II and nuclear fast red staining for nuclear observation. For this comparison, we used 2 µm JB-4 sections rather than thicker sections for better resolution. We found that both methylene blue-azure II and nuclear fast red produced strong nonspecific cytoplasmic staining, making it difficult to distinguish individual retinal cell nuclei. It was particularly difficult to distinguish cone nuclear staining from cytoplasmic staining because of the weaker cone nuclei staining. We then tried to reduce the cytoplasmic background staining by increasing the destaining time. But extensive destaining was not helpful because it nonspecifically reduced both the nuclear and cytoplasmic signals. For example, after a 30 min wash, both the nuclear and cytoplasmic staining had become very faint; after an overnight wash, staining was almost completely removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0022155412471535">Fig. 5A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0022155412471535">B</xref>). In contrast, covalent Feulgen nuclear staining endured extensive destaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0022155412471535">Fig. 5C</xref>). Thus, although Feulgen staining is more time- consuming, it gave much more specific and stable staining than methylene blue and nuclear fast red.</p>

<title>Combination of Whole-Mount In Situ Hybridization With Feulgen Staining</title>
<p>We next performed Feulgen staining on samples that were already probed by whole-mount in situ hybridization. We found that HCl hydrolysis and Schiff reaction did not affect the blue precipitation produced by alkaline phosphatase from the substrates of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0022155412471535">Fig. 6A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0022155412471535">B</xref>, arrows). However, compared with Feulgen staining of regular 5-dpf fish eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0022155412471535">Fig. 6C</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0022155412471535">D</xref>), the in situ procedure rendered the cell nuclear boundary fuzzy, which might have been caused by the dispersion of the chromatin material from the nuclei. In addition, it appeared to cause tighter packaging of the cell bodies in the retina. Despite this drawback, this combinatory procedure will still have very useful applications when individual nuclei are not required to be distinguished or when other tissue types with sparsely distributed nuclei are to be examined. Thus, Feulgen staining is compatible with alkaline phosphatase-based colorimetric detection that is frequently used in whole-mount in situ hybridization; the two procedures can be combined to visualize the nuclei and mRNA expression patterns simultaneously.</p>

<p>Feulgen staining is compatible with alkaline phosphatase-based colorimetric detection that is frequently used in conventional whole-mount in situ hybridization. (A–B) Both the blue in situ hybridization signals (arrows) and Feulgen staining were visible. A peripheral retinal region is magnified 3 times in B. (C–D) Feulgen staining of regular 5-dpf fish that was not pretreated with the in situ hybridization showed more distinguishable nuclear boundaries. A peripheral retinal region is magnified 3 times in D.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, we optimized the following protocol to perform Feulgen staining of JB-4-embedded zebrafish retina to visualize cell nuclei and tissue morphology:</p>
<list id="list1-0022155412471535" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Fix the zebrafish eyes in 4% PFA overnight at room temperature.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Embed the eyes in JB-4 resin according to manufacturer’s protocol (Polysciences).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Section the JB-4-embedded zebrafish eyes at 3 µm for general visualization of the cell nuclei or at 2 µm to visualize the chromatin distribution patterns in the cone photoreceptors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Collect the sections on glass slides.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Treat the JB-4 sections in 3N HCl overnight or 5N HCl for 45 min at room temperature to hydrolyze DNA molecules.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Wash the slides with distilled water for 10 min to remove excess HCl.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Incubate HCl-hydrolyzed JB-4 sections with Schiff’s reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 hrs at room temperature.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Wash the slides with distilled water for 5 min to remove excess Schiff’s reagent.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mount the sections in Permount and seal under a coverslip for microscopy.</p></list-item></list>
<p>This simple and robust method is sensitive and specific for visualizing cell nuclei with various degrees of chromatin condensation. The nuclear visualization is sensitive enough to study the global distribution patterns of the heterochromatin and euchromatin in the zebrafish cone photoreceptors. This allows a convenient comparison of the variations in chromatin organization between different retinal regions. In principle, this method may also be utilized for cell quantification if combined with proper algorithms for three-dimensional reconstruction from consecutive JB-4 sections.</p>
