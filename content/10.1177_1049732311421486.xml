<abstract>
<p>Despite the important instrumental and emotional role that parents play in the lives of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and congenital heart disease (CHD), qualitative researchers have not examined the similarities and differences between caregivers’ experiences. Informed by thematic analysis, in this qualitative study I explored what it is like to care for a child with a chronic illness from the perspective of CF and CHD parents at a children’s hospital in Canada. Pediatric caregiver stress was qualitatively different between CF and CHD parents, whereas temporal dilemmas were unique sources of stress for CF parents only. To alleviate stress, all parents drew on a three-way, interrelated process to comprehend their child’s illness and acquire perspective. By opening up the social worlds of parents, I illuminate important similarities and differences in the caregiving experience of parents of youth with CF and CHD, and offer novel contributions to the literature.</p>

<body>
<p>Childhood chronic diseases such as congenital heart disease (CHD) and cystic fibrosis (CF) are illnesses that persist for greater than 6 months and affect children’s daily functioning. Given advances in health care over the past several decades, more children with illnesses that were once life threatening are now reaching adulthood. In what is termed the acute-to-chronic-disease era, approximately 20% to 29% of North American children are currently living with chronic health conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311421486">Branstetter, Domian, Williams, Graff, &amp; Piamjariyakul, 2008</xref>). This begs clinicians to better attend to the needs of this new group of children who are characterized by complex medical and psychosocial needs.</p>
<p>Although quantitative and qualitative researchers have studied the impact of caring for a chronically ill child, to my knowledge there have been no qualitative studies that contrasted and compared the experience of parents who care for children with CF and CHD. In addition to describing both the commonalities and context-specific, idiosyncratic differences in their caregiving experiences, and developing descriptive theoretical frameworks, such comparative qualitative literature is required to identify groups that experience greater psychosocial morbidity and appropriately direct health services. Given the strong relationship between parental and child health outcomes, understanding the experiences of parents of youth with CF and CHD might help clinicians to assist parents in better supporting their children. Thus, by opening up the social world of parents, the purpose of this study was to explore what it is like to parent a child with CF or CHD, and to compare these experiences.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732311421486">
<title>Review of the Literature: Parenting a Medically Fragile Child</title>
<p>Because they magnify notions of dependence and vulnerability, childhood illnesses have been described as a condensed symbol or concretized metaphor of childhood itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311421486">Young, Dixon-Woods, Findlay, &amp; Heney, 2002</xref>). The notions that (a) children are “natural innocents,” (b) illness in childhood is rare, (c) illness threatens our cultural investment in who children are, (d) we associate illness with death, and (e) illness is not the natural order of things all intensify notions of childhood innocence and invoke a sense of catastrophe in the cultural imagination (Young et al.). A review of the research evidence, outlined below, revealed five themes that characterize the experience of parents who care for children with chronic diseases. These include discussing the negative physical and psychosocial health implications of caring for a child with a chronic health condition, the ways in which childhood diseases threaten the integrity of parenthood, the systemic barriers that parents encounter in efforts to better care for their child, parents’ desire to normalize their child’s life, and the sense of hope that results from caring for a medically complex child.</p>
<p>With regard to the parents of healthy youth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421486">Ingersky, Shaw, Gray, and Janicke (2010)</xref> found that the parents of youth with chronic illnesses report higher rates of psychosocial distress. Ingersky et al. examined the prevalence of subclinical posttraumatic stress symptomology among children and parents affected by multiorgan transplant, HIV, and sickle cell anemia. All three parent groups reported higher levels of posttraumatic stress in comparison to the parents of healthy children; parents of youth awaiting organ transplantation reported the highest rates of psychological morbidity. Illustrating the important relationship between parental health and child health outcomes, parents’ posttraumatic stress symptomology was associated with greater perceived child symptoms. Other recent quantitative studies have also revealed high rates of psychosomatic stress among the parents of children with chronic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311421486">Cabizuca, Portella-Marquest, Mendlowicz, Coutinho, &amp; Figueira, 2008</xref>). For example, in a prospective study of parental adjustment to childhood cancer, mothers displayed high levels of anxiety and insomnia in relation to both fathers and healthy families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311421486">Sawyer, Antonious, Toogood, Rice, &amp; Baghurst, 2000</xref>). Similarly, fathers of children with asthma report excessive worry, anxiety, and uncertainty related to caregiving, and live with chronic concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311421486">Cashin, Small, &amp; Solberg, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311421486">Foster et al. (2001)</xref> explained that, given the uncertainty associated with CF in the future and the intrusive nature of treatment into one’s daily life, the parents of youth with CF, described as an insidious disease, experience stress. Parents recall how periods of relative health in the life of the child with CF falsely lulled them into a deceptive sense of security, and they feared the progressive nature of the disease (Foster et al.). For parents who care for children with heart disease, the constant vigilance—or being “on call” and required to oversee their child’s complex medical technology—is also stressful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311421486">Maciever, Jones, &amp; Nicol, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311421486">Rempel &amp; Harrison, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>These parents also encounter systemic barriers. For example, it is stressful for parents to interact with unsupportive health professionals who do not listen to their concerns and treat their child as a diagnosis, rather than as a unique individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311421486">Kratz, Uding, Trahms, Villareale, &amp; Kieckheffer, 2009</xref>). Parents report that there are also school-related barriers associated with caregiving. School policies related to their child’s medication use are experienced as restrictive, and parents often break school policies to ensure that their child has access to medication in a timely fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311421486">Cashin et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Research findings also suggest that parenting a child with a chronic illness might threaten parental integrity and identity. In a qualitative study that examined the experience of caring for a child with cancer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311421486">Young et al. (2002)</xref> found that cancer disrupts both the mother’s and child’s biography. These mothers are embedded within dominant constructions of motherhood which emphasize that good mothers subsume their own needs under those of their child. Within the context of caring for a child with cancer, however, mothers protect their precarious biographies and construct new identities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311421486">Hodgkinson and Lester (2002)</xref> also found that the mothers of children with CF encounter a threatened identity in which important aspects of their former selves, such as spending time with friends or attaining more education, are lost. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311421486">Grob (2008)</xref> discussed the compromised parental integrity associated with caring for a newborn with CF. Although genetic screening should be heralded as an important medical breakthrough, the disease is at the forefront of the initial parenting experience, and marks the end of a normal relationship with the infant (Grob). Although parents eventually find ways to powerfully connect with their child, the neonatal period is characterized by threatened parental integrity.</p>
<p>Although some researchers have critiqued the notion of normalcy in which the chronic state of illness might be equated with the norm, parents of youth with chronic illnesses express concerns related to their child’s normalcy. In a qualitative study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311421486">Earle, Clarke, Eiser, and Sheppard (2006)</xref> found that although the mothers of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) strive to normalize their child’s life, the search for normalcy is potentially damaging if it continues to elude parents. Rather than a state, mothers describe normalcy as a transient process that is characterized by peaks and valleys, and something that is realized only once it is threatened. Mothers experience a sense of normalcy only in between visits to the hospital, when they temporarily forget about ALL (Earle et al.). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311421486">Hill, Higgins, Dempster, and McCarthy (2009)</xref> also found that striving for normalcy is a central concern for fathers who care for children with ALL. In the posttreatment maintenance phase, fathers minimize their child’s difference and encourage their child to partake in precancer activities. Fathers often encounter resistance to normalcy from women spouses, who are more likely to adopt an overprotective stance even during their child’s remission (Hill et al.). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311421486">Anderson (1981)</xref> found that although the parents of chronically ill youth label their child as normal and engage in normalizing practices that diminish difference, they insist that their child engage in nonnormative behaviors, such as isolating themselves from other children to avoid infection, without considering such practices as incongruent with their understanding of normalcy.</p>
<p>Recent studies have explored the positive aspects associated with caring for a child with a chronic health condition. In a qualitative study that explored the experience of fathers who care for children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, fathers described their child’s illness as a catalyst for a more meaningful, rich, and engaging interaction with their child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311421486">McNeill, 2007</xref>). In addition to broadening a narrowly defined gender role to include space for caregiving, fathering a child with a chronic health condition was associated with a more intimate and loving interaction. In another recent qualitative study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311421486">Samson et al. (2009)</xref> examined the “fabric of hope” for parents of children with Duchene’s muscular dystrophy (DMD). Despite their initial despair, as time passes, parents’ perceptions toward their child change as they come to recognize their child’s unique individuality, regardless of illness. Parents experience a sense of serenity, and despite their child’s significantly reduced life expectancy, the child is described as the fabric of hope itself. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311421486">Kratz et al. (2009)</xref> also reported that there are positive experiences associated with caring for a child with a chronic illness, such as gaining appreciation for the things that really matter, and personal growth.</p>
<p>From this review of the literature, it is evident that the parents of youth with CF, CHD, and other chronic illnesses experience reduced psychosocial and physical health related to caregiving. They encounter systemic barriers to caregiving, experience threatened parental integrity, and question whether their child is normal. Recent literature has also documented the transformative aspects associated with caring for a child with a chronic health condition and, rejecting the dominant assumption that caregiving belongs to the sole preserve of motherhood, has also illuminated the perspective of fathers.</p>
<p>Although this literature has been critical to furthering a better understanding of caregiving, there are several limitations that provided the rationale for this study. Although CF and CHD caregivers’ experiences have been studied separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311421486">Grob, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311421486">Rempel &amp; Harrison, 2007</xref>), the research is characterized by an absence of studies that contrasted and compared their experiences. CF and CHD are different childhood diseases that differ greatly in terms of trajectory and treatment. Given the differences between these two conditions, exploring and contrasting the corresponding parenting experiences between them was a novel and intriguing line of investigation that, given several years of volunteer work with these two populations, also sparked a great deal of personal interest.</p>
<p>More specifically, recognizing that the similarities far outweigh the differences, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732311421486">Stein and Jessop (1982)</xref> suggested that a noncategorical approach to studying pediatric chronic diseases facilitates a better understanding of the total life experience of children and their families, and considers the whole child rather than simply the diseased organ or system. In addition to being a cost-effective approach within the context of scarce health care resources, such a noncategorical conceptualization, which focuses on the similarities between chronically ill children, facilitates a continuum-based approach to understanding illness and is ultimately less stigmatizing (Stein &amp; Jessup). Such noncategorical research might also facilitate the development of theories that better describe the commonalities between parents of youth with CF and parents of youth with CHD.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a comparative approach might also illustrate the context-specific idiosyncrasies that characterize the unique and particular experiences of parents of children with CF and CHD. For example, this type of investigation allowed me to compare the differences between those parents who care for children with chronic but manageable diseases such as CHD, and those who care for children with fatal illnesses such as CF, which are characterized by gradual health losses over time. It also allowed me to explore how these very different illness trajectories might potentially influence their storied experiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421486">Ingersky et al. (2010)</xref> suggested that comparative research is required to identify, develop, and deliver specific services to children and caregivers who have greater psychosocial morbidity.</p>
<p>Parents’ attitudes toward their child’s illness influence child health outcomes, such as adjustment to illness and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311421486">Hill et al., 2009</xref>). For this reason, it is important to explore how the parents of children with a variety of chronic diseases construct their child’s health. Gathering such information might allow professionals to educate parents on the relationship between parental and child health outcomes, so as to better support their child’s social and emotional adjustment to illness. Therefore, the needs to capture both the similarities and differences between the experiences of parents of children with CF and parents of children with CHD, identify groups with greater psychosocial morbidity, and better support children with CF and CHD were powerful rationales for this research. Thus, in this study I sought to address the following research questions: What is it like to parent a child with CF? What is it like to parent a child with CHD? Are there similarities and differences in the parenting experiences between these parents?</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section3-1049732311421486">
<title>Research Setting and Participants</title>
<p>This study was approved by the research ethics board at a metropolitan children’s hospital in Toronto, Canada, and took place in the CF and CHD outpatient clinics. Although the primary purpose of the investigation was to explore the perceptions of the parents of children with CF and CHD toward their child’s physical activity, the results I report in this article relate to parents’ emergent discussions about their child’s illness. Recruitment for the study was facilitated by two nurses in the CF and CHD clinics, and a purposeful sampling strategy was employed. After the nurses identified eligible participants using the patient database, I called parents to request participation and arranged a convenient interview time. During the interviews, some participants mentioned that I appeared familiar; nevertheless, I had no formal previous research or clinical role with any of the participants, and they were unknown to me.</p>
<p>Twenty-nine parents from separate families participated, including 10 men and 19 women (16 parents from the CF clinic and 13 parents from the CHD center). Although all participants provided care to a child between the ages of 10 and 18 years with CHD or CF, medical history and disease severity varied. Although some children had never been hospitalized, others had been hospitalized on several occasions and had undergone numerous procedures. At the time of the study, 3 participants’ children were hospitalized, and 1 participant’s child was receiving oxygen therapy and was currently on the lung transplant list. Most parents had more than one child but only one sick child; 3 of the participants in the CF sample and 1 of the participants in the CHD sample, however, were providing care to two children with chronic diseases.</p>
<p>Parents were from the ages of 35 to 55 years. Although the majority of participants could be characterized as White, during the interviews, some participants self-identified as African Canadian, Spanish, Middle Eastern, or East Indian. Although most parents described themselves as healthy, a few parents were dealing with health problems such as excess weight, diabetes, or physical injury. In terms of employment, parents fulfilled a number of occupational roles. Some were professionals such as nurses, teachers, and engineers; other parents were engaged in jobs such as trucking or farming, and a few were unemployed and were receiving unemployment insurance benefits. Some participants described themselves as stay-at-home parents. Although it was not the case for all of the stay-at-home parents, most had made the decision to stay home to provide care for the sick child. Most participants were in long-term married relationships, but some were divorced, remarried, or single. Parents were from a range of urban and rural locations across Ontario and Quebec.</p>

<sec id="section4-1049732311421486">
<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311421486">Smith (2011)</xref> suggested that narratives—both constructing and listening to stories—are perennial and central to the human condition itself, offering rich and provocative tales that facilitate a detailed understanding of how people with illnesses make sense of their experiences within their cultural contexts. Because the narrative approach is underutilized with the CF and CHD population—and might offer novel and ideographic insights about parenting experiences—it was thought to be an important conceptual framework. Specifically, the narrative approach guided my analysis by sensitizing me to the health and illness stories that parents construct about their child within the context of culture, and whether these stories confirm or deviate from dominant cultural story lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311421486">Frank, 1995</xref>). I was interested in whether parents constructed the restitution, chaos, or quest narratives typified by Frank and described below, to story their child’s health or, rather, whether novel narrative structures were adopted.</p>
<p>The availability of an explanatory framework or narrative structure by which to explain their experiences is of great importance to those with illnesses or those touched by it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311421486">Ezzy, 2000</xref>). When life is disrupted by illness and the integrity of the self is threatened, narrative allows for the reconstruction of the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311421486">Whitehead, 2006</xref>). Although illness narratives are told within the context of one’s personal history, they speak to social and political dimensions associated with contemporary social life (Ezzy). As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421486">Nettleton, Watt, O’Malley, and Duffey (2005)</xref>, who stated that “the story reveals as much about the culturally available discourses as it does about the minutiae of a teller’s life” (p. 49), it is evident that in listening to an individual’s illness narrative, we learn much about the discursive cultural resources that patients and caregivers have available to them to interpret their experiences, and we gain insight into the ideological structures that shape their stories.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311421486">Frank (1995)</xref> proposed that there is a typology of three illness narratives that characterize how people with illnesses and those who care for them interpret their experiences. As the culturally preferred story line, the restitution narrative is characterized by a departure from health when one discovers that one is ill. Adopting Parson’s classic sick role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421486">Parsons, 1975</xref>), in which the ill person is temporarily abdicated from normal responsibilities, the patient engages in a brief period of convalescence. The restitution narrative concludes with the patient’s eventual triumph over illness and his or her return to the land of health. In contrast, the chaos narrative lacks a clear start and finish; rather, the patient or caregiver remains totally consumed by illness. The chaos narrative is characteristic of chronic and incurable illnesses, or those conditions that lack a clear diagnosis, such as chronic fatigue syndrome. The chaos narrative is characterized by feelings of terror and loss of control, as well as by the sense that the body has been engulfed by illness. Stories of bodies in chaos are never resolved, and patients therefore brace themselves for continued losses. Given that it rouses terror and forces us to contemplate our own invincibility and ontological insecurity, the horror associated with the chaos narrative renders it culturally unsayable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421486">Nettleton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311421486">Smith &amp; Sparkes, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the quest illness narrative is more than one’s departure from health to illness and back to health again; rather, body and self are profoundly transformed through illness, and illness is seized as a tool for introspection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311421486">Whitehead, 2006</xref>). Values are reprioritized through illness, and illness acts as the impetus for social change or the discovery of destiny (Whitehead). Although there are weaknesses associated with using narrative as a way to understand illness by, for example, foreclosing a discussion on the elusory nature of embodiment, narrative can be a useful tool for understanding how parents make sense of illness in a world of health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311421486">Radley, 1997</xref>).</p>

<title>Thematic Analysis</title>
<p>Informed by the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311421486">Braun and Clarke (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311421486">Boyatzis (1998)</xref>, thematic analysis was the qualitative research method that guided the development and analysis of this study. Thematic analysis is a foundational method through which the researcher seeks to identify, analyze, and report patterns and themes in the data; it is, therefore, a way of organizing, describing, and interpreting a qualitative data set. Although thematic analysis is a flexible and diverse qualitative method that is compatible with realist and constructivist paradigms, it has not garnered the same degree of attention as the other major research canons. Braun and Clarke suggested that either “bottom-up” or “top-down” approaches might be adopted in a thematic analysis. By remaining close to the data, not attempting to fit them into preexisting frameworks, and drawing on multiple theories to interpret my results, my analysis was data driven and can be characterized as a “bottom-up” approach. I did not simply aim to reflect and describe parents’ experiences at the literal or semantic level; rather, at the latent level, I made efforts to contextualize and interpret the narratives within the parents’ life worlds.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732311421486">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>In employing thematic analysis as the method in this study, I conducted semistructured interviews, which were well suited for this vulnerable population of caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311421486">Mason, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732311421486">Stevens, Lord, Therese-Proctor, Nagy, &amp; O’Riordan, 2010</xref>). I developed an interview guide based on my review of the literature on parenting children with chronic illnesses, my theoretical framework, and my personal experiences as a pediatric qualitative health researcher. For example, questions included: Can you describe what it is like to care for a child with CF/CHD? What would you tell other parents about what it is like to care for a child with CF/CHD? Furthermore, although the interview guide was semistructured in nature, participants’ responses drove further lines of inquiry. For example, when parents discussed novel concepts such as stress or time, I prompted further inquiry by asking them to elaborate on their statements: Would you be able to provide me with an example of when you felt stress because of your child’s illness? The interviews were conducted in clinic rooms and were 45 to 85 minutes long. The interviews were terminated after saturation in the data was attained, and after data collection failed to reveal novel concepts.</p>
<p>To facilitate a thematic analysis of the data, all interview data were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim as the study was occurring. I also recorded detailed field notes during the process, as well as potential analytical insights. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311421486">Braun and Clarke (2006)</xref>, first, to completely immerse myself within the data and to familiarize myself with it, I engaged in multiple in-depth readings of the data. Second, for the purposes of coding the raw data, or the smallest units that can produce meaningful insights related to the phenomena, the data were read again and coded. In this case, commonly occurring words and phrases across the data corpus—such as <italic>stress, burden</italic>, or <italic>exhaustion</italic>—were coded. In addition to coding as much of the available data as possible, I ensured that the data collection process was not context stripped. This involved ensuring that the coded data included the context under which the discussion occurred.</p>
<p>Third, the coded data were collated and organized into higher order themes. This careful and recursive decision-making process involved making important judgments about (a) which codes were similar and dissimilar, (b) which codes could be grouped together, and (c) where particular codes “fit,” thus facilitating the generation of inductive themes. This iterative process involved continually moving back and forth between codes and themes and the relationship between them. Fourth, through a process of revision, the themes were collapsed and refined. Fifth, to define the essence of each theme and what it meant in relation to other themes, the themes were carefully defined and named. Theme names adequately describe and explain what a theme is about, and offer sufficient evidence or data to corroborate and describe it. This process was assisted by my doctoral supervisor in the form of peer debriefing. He reviewed half of the transcripts and dialogued with me about my interpretations to challenge the identified themes and their connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311421486">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 2000</xref>). Finally, in my presentation, below, I provide a story about the data, both within and across themes. In doing so, as an analyst who is both a cultural member and critical commentator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311421486">Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006</xref>), I offer a story that interprets how the parents of youth with CF and CHD understand their child’s illness.</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>Three main themes are reported in this study. First, although a sense of stress was ever present for all parents, parents of children with CHD and CF narrated stress in different ways. Second, the temporal losses associated with both the time-consuming nature of treatment and the life- limiting nature of the disease were specific sources of stress for parents of children with CF only. Finally, parents of both children with CF and children with CHD dealt with the chronic stress of caregiving by coming to terms with their child’s illness and learning to put things into perspective.</p>
<sec id="section10-1049732311421486">
<title>“Always in the Back of My Mind”: The Stress of Parenting a Child With a Chronic Illness</title>
<p>When explaining what it is like to parent a child with CF or CHD, parents described their child’s condition as stressful. Stress was a chronic burden that was always in the back of one’s mind. The nature of parents’ stress varied and included such worries as the deterioration of the child’s health, whether their child adhered to treatment, and the negative impact of illness on scholastic performance. Caring for a sick child was associated with detrimental consequences for parents, and although participants did not disclose clinical mental health conditions to me, they did report negative feelings such as depression and anxiety, or engaging in deliberate self-harm behaviors.</p>
<p>There were important differences in the way parents of children with CF and parents of children with CHD narrated their experience of caregiver stress. For parents of children with CHD, stress was located in the past, in history and memory. Some parents had lived with an undiagnosed cardiac baby—or “blue baby”—for months or even years. When parents approached clinicians regarding their infant’s poor health, they were sometimes questioned skeptically, or told that they were simply overanxious. Although clinician skepticism and blame were stressful, an intuitive sense that their child was not well motivated them to seek out second opinions and to have their claims legitimized. Although stress remained high for parents of children with CHD throughout this process, arriving at the hospital and receiving a diagnosis that confirmed their initial beliefs was associated with relief. Stress for these parents remained high during the process of surgical repair to correct their child’s heart defect and, in some cases, parents had to endure their child receiving multiple stressful surgical procedures.</p>
<p>The experience of stress for parents of children with CHD rapidly dissipated in the postsurgical repair period, and despite parents’ initial fears about open-heart surgery, the functional benefits of surgery to their child became apparent immediately. For example, observing that their once “blue baby” now had a “normal pink complexion” resulted in relief. Similarly, observing their child gradually resume normal feeding behaviors and gain weight signified to parents that their child was beginning to recover. For example, the father of a child with CHD explained that it was stressful to observe his child’s failure to thrive in the presurgical period. When his child began to thrive in the postsurgical period, however, he experienced relief:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Yes, at the beginning it was stressful. He was only seven months old. He was like, 11 pounds, and friends of ours that had babies at the same time, you see them getting big and strong. That gave us worries, then. After his surgery, he just caught up to everyone else.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The father of an adolescent patient with CHD eloquently narrated the stress and fear associated with being on “survival mode” in the presurgical period, when his daughter was gravely ill:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It was a big stress at the beginning; at the beginning, the first year and [a] half until she had an operation. She was about four weeks old . . . she did not develop as a normal kid and was behind, until she had another operation, when she was about a year old. That was difficult. We could not feed her and keeping her on the right track. Then everything settled. She became better and the problems went away. Just making it, just surviving. She had a few operations, and it did not seem that she would pull through or make it. It was scary.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, parents of children with CF narrated their experience of caregiver stress in qualitatively different ways from one another. Not unlike the parents of youth with CHD, the initial diagnostic period was characterized by shock and sadness, and, as described by one father, learning about the life-limiting nature of the disease was particularly devastating and stressful for him and his wife:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>She [wife] was upset by that. She had learned about the lifespan. That is what really upset her, that she [daughter] was going to die before her. A parent never wants to have a kid die before her, and that is what we were upset about.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Parents also explained that as they became more educated about CF and ensured that treatment become a routine component of everyday family life, over the course of time CF entered a period of relative normalcy. Unlike parents of children with CHD, however, parents of children with CF narrated a qualitatively different experience of stress that was chronic and never resolved. In particular, parents projected their stress into the future, and it had a protracted dimension. Knowing that a time would come when their child’s health would deteriorate—and that their child would eventually succumb to CF—was a chronic and unresolved concern for these parents. Despite how normal their child appeared at the moment, they worried about their child’s deterioration in the future and vehemently fought to delay the onset of that deterioration. The mother of a hospitalized adolescent with CF explained that her entire family constantly worried about her son’s potential deterioration and death in the future. Although she did not “fill in the blanks,” she explained how her son’s hospitalization shattered any semblance of normalcy, and reminded her about the finality of CF:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I would have to say that it has impacted our life for us as parents. It has constantly been on our mind. “When will he get sick? Will he die?” That has played huge on [husband] and I. [Our other two sons]—I think they think about it, sometimes, but not in any impact. Because when you look at him [sick child], he looks healthy and he is “go, go, go,” so it does not seem to be an issue. Him coming here [hospital] on Saturday has made a big impact even on his siblings. . . . He [husband] and I are constantly asking ourselves, “What would we do if . . . ? How would we prepare for . . . ? How sad would that be if . . . ?”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another mother also explained that it was stressful to think about her son’s health deterioration in the future. She felt a sense of helplessness in knowing that there was nothing that she could do except encourage him to abide by the doctor’s orders:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You feel useless and helpless . . . and then they talk about there being no cure for CF. Sometimes I think we worry about that too, and him getting sicker in the future. You try to find answers, but there is really nothing that I can give him. Just that, you know, we have to do what the doctor says, and follow the rules and keep on going.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, parents of children with CF and children with CHD had qualitatively different narrations of caregiving stress. For parents of children with CHD, stress was located in the past and dissipated postsurgically. In contrast, for parents of children with CF, stress was unresolved and had a future orientation in which they worried about their child’s deteriorating health and death. Below, I describe a unique source of stress experienced only by the parents of youth with CF: stolen time.</p>
</sec>

<title>“Stolen Time”: The Temporal Dilemmas of Parents of Children With CF</title>
<p>The parents of youth with CF narrated significant temporal stress related to caring for a child with a chronic illness. Time was perceived to be stolen by CF, and parents’ narratives about time had both literal and metaphoric dimensions. Parents described the tedious and time-consuming nature of engaging in daily physical therapy with their child. Treatment detracted from parents’ spontaneity and freedom, and time was experienced in highly structured ways. Furthermore, the time-consuming nature of physical therapy required parents to conceptualize their daily time differently. Ensuring that there was adequate time to complete treatment was of great importance to parents, weighed heavily on them, and dictated their use of time. Other activities, such as engaging in recreation or socializing, were secondary to ensuring that their child completed treatment on time.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of treatment in the lives of parents, during the interviews parents self-reflexively considered how treatment had come to dominate their time. Although it was of utmost importance to parents and was a nonnegotiable facet of CF care, the effort required to plan treatment was stressful. Parents were cognizant of the daily toll that treatment had on their and their child’s use of time. One mother expressed stress and frustration as she described how the time-consuming nature of CF treatment, as well as the dietary requirements, interfered with important family time:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When you want to go on day trips, it is like, “Hurry up, get it done, we want to get going.” You end up pushing him [child with CF]. “Okay, now you have to eat something. We want it done [therapy] before we go out for the day.” Sometimes, when you are gone all day, and you get home at 9:00 p.m. at night. We bring it with us to do in the car. It is always at the back of our minds. It never leaves. You are planning from the minute you get up as to how we will coordinate this mask and physiotherapy.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, the father of a 10-year-old child with CF who was hospitalized at the time of the study explained the high degree of planning required to ensure that his daughter completed her treatment, along with its impact on the entire family’s routine. Because CF treatment was performed prior to school, his daughter had to wake early, which interfered with her sleep:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The one thing that [daughter with CF] jokes about is that, “You wake me up so early for school and my friends wake up twenty minutes before the bell rings.” With [her], we have to get up; she has to have her physiotherapy done in the morning, and she has to have it done at night. The answer to that is that we see the effect in time. We need to plan our day. We need to wake up earlier than other families. This includes [wife] and myself . . . we need to plan to wake up early to fit in this physiotherapy. We need to plan it in at night time to make sure that we fit it in before bed, along with homework. The answer is time. We have to plan the day out. Other families can “fly by the seat of their pants” and do this and that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Additionally, when discussing the interaction between their child’s illness and time, parents of children with CF described time in a metaphorical and abstract sense. Parents were cognizant of their child’s reduced life span, and this was experienced as stressful. Within the context of reduced life time, parents described wanting to get the most out of life possible in the time they had. Some parents described a temporal reorganization in which they took strides to do certain activities now, such as spending as much time with their child as possible or signing up for a particular set of lessons, which, had they had a healthy child, they would have done later. For example, learning about reduced life expectancy was experienced as particularly stressful for the father of a child with CF. This couple chose to parent their child according to dominant gender ideologies, and thus, his wife was the primary caregiver. To compensate for reduced life time, the father encouraged his wife to spend as much time with their child as possible:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A parent never wants to have a kid die before her, and that is what she was upset about. That is why I was trying to tell her to “Spend as much time as you can with her.” And just think: every waking moment that you have, spend it with her. Even if you have both of them or one by themselves, spend that time with her. I had her quit her job and that is why I work sixteen hours a day. So that she can spend more time with them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, within the context of a reduced life time, the father of two children with CF described the importance of living for the moment. In the event that CF compromised the ability to engage in certain enjoyable activities in the future, he ensured that his children had the opportunity to pursue their interests immediately:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We want to live for the moment, while we can do these things. We have another girl in our town who is a few years older than our daughter who has been in the hospital multiple times. If my daughter wants to take singing lessons now, I do not care how much it costs—she is going to take them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Stolen time was a unique source of stress for the parents of youth with CF only, and did not characterize the experience of parents of children with CHD. Some parents of children with CF compensated for reduced life time by ensuring that they were living for the moment. Below, I explain the process by which parents alleviated the stress associated with caregiving.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732311421486">
<title>Learning to Put Things Into Perspective</title>
<p>Parents alleviated stress by coming to an understanding of their child’s illness and learning to put things into perspective. Specifically, they drew on three interrelated processes to understand their predicament; I describe these subthemes below.</p>
<sec id="section13-1049732311421486">
<title>The more disabled other</title>
<p>Parents came to an understanding of their child’s illness by comparing their son or daughter against those children who were thought to be more ill. Although parents were cognizant of their stress at all times, they were also aware of how much worse things could be. When contrasting and comparing their child with a more severely disabled “other,” it appeared that parents had constructed their own tacit hierarchy of illness, that is, their own understanding of what constitutes a really sick child. For parents of children with CHD, children with CF were thought to be more ill than their own child. This spontaneous comparison made by these parents might be because youth with CF and CHD receive care in adjacent clinics, and are thus often exposed to one another.</p>
<p>For all parents, the image of the “dying child with cancer” served as a powerful representation of just how sick a child might become. Parents’ understanding that things could be so much worse occurred through observations of the social and spatial milieu around them. For example, parents interacted with other families whose child had received more prolonged treatment, profound disruptions to family life, or even the deterioration and death of the child. The father of two children with CF explained that in relation to other illnesses, CF was manageable:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>This is the best fatal illness that you can have. Many of the elements of the illness are up to you. We can do them [treatments] at home. We do not have to come in for chemotherapy or radiation. We are not in a wheelchair. The treatments take a long while, but again, the fact that the only difference for my kids is that they are having enzymes with lunch. It is not much at all.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Parents contemplated how difficult it must be to parent a more chronically ill child. Despite displaying empathy for these other parents, interacting with more severely disabled children in the hospital setting dampened parents’ stress, allowing them to narrate their experience in a more positive light. Although seeing other sick children did not make parents feel better, it did allow them to put things into perspective and to develop an understanding that their situation was bearable after all. When one walks through the pediatric health center in which this research was undertaken, it is very common to see children with a wide variety of illnesses, as well as the various stigma symbols that conjure up a visual iconography and mark their young bodies as deviant—such as wheel chairs, intravenous poles, or nasogastric feeding tubes. During the interview, the mother of a child with CF explained that walking through the health center served as a stark reminder of others’ more extreme suffering in relation to one’s own child, and her narrative took the form of a plea to the unknowing public:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You take a walk through the hospital. Take one look. Even when your child has the worst diagnosis with the heart or cancer, you look at those kids; there are those worse than you. It does not make you feel better but it puts it in perspective, it does. You do not dwell on anything, and you are just thankful.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Comparing their child with a more severely disabled other was the first process by which parents learned to put things into perspective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049732311421486">
<title>“Walk a mile in my shoes.”</title>
<p>The “healthy normal child” served as a point for comparison for parents of children with CF and CHD, and was a part of the process of coming to terms with their child’s condition. For instance, because they lacked the same experiences, participants frequently explained that the parents of healthy children would never be able to grasp the difficulty associated with parenting a chronically ill child. With a sense of resentment, some parents trivialized others’ relatively minor health concerns, such as broken bones or colds:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We tell people about [daughter] and how we are in hospital and how we have been in the hospital seven times. They will tell you a story of how once their child’s fever went up to 101 degrees and they freaked out. Right? How you felt that one time in your 10-year-old’s life is a weekly to daily occurrence for us, in our life. If [daughter] is wheezing and coughing, at any time, it can go downhill. Even if she is fine today, next week she could be in the hospital, and that is at all times. So we are always living on that edge . . . it is definitely more stressful. Other families with CF-ers [children with CF] will [understand]. Families with completely healthy kids who have never been in the hospital and have had a fever once, I do not think they quite understand.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Parents consistently emphasized that it was difficult to really comprehend what it was like to parent a chronically ill child if one lacked personal experience. Stating that “others do not understand,” they drew stark divisions between parenting a healthy child and a sick child. Participants felt connected to the parents of other ill children, and were detached from parents who cared for healthy children. For example, the father of two children with CF poignantly said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If you had not heard news about your child being given a death sentence, then you do not know how I feel. Sorry, you could have gone to school, but you do not know how I feel, or cannot put yourself in my shoes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Recognizing that their child was not like healthy children, and that healthy families would not be able to understand their experiences, was part of the process by which parents brought legitimacy and gravity to their experiences and learned to put things into perspective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049732311421486">
<title>My child’s pain is greater than my own</title>
<p>Recognizing that their child bore the greatest burden was the final process that parents drew on to better comprehend their child’s illness. Parents were cognizant that because their child’s body—and not their own—was inflicted by illness, the child was experiencing greater suffering; parents put their own pain into perspective by reminding themselves that their child hurt more than they did. For example, the mother of a child with CF said, “What I feel is nothing compared to what it puts on him.” Similarly, although another mother expressed stress related to her child’s nonadherence to treatment, as the interview progressed, her anger dissipated and she became reflective. Witnessing her son’s ongoing struggle with CHD put things into perspective, making her realize the relatively trivial nature of her own health issues in relation to her son’s CHD:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You know, they make you strong, watching what they go through. I do not even care. I mean, I do care about myself. But they really do make you stronger, watching them go through something like that. If you have watched your kid go through that, you can go through anything. When you get told that you are sick, it will not hit you as hard, when you have watched our kids grow up that way, yes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, the parents of youth with CF and CHD brought meaning to their child’s illness, and learned to gain perspective by drawing on three interrelated processes. The parents of children with CF and those of children with CHD constructed their child’s illness in similar ways. By comparing their child against a more disabled other, parents were able to dampen their fears and put things into perspective. By recognizing that parents of healthy children would never be able to understand their experiences, parents drew stark divisions between sick and healthy children, thus giving legitimacy to the grave nature of their parenting experiences. Although parents acknowledged that their child’s illness had resulted in personal turmoil, they humbled themselves and found courage in the recognition they did not bear the greatest burden of suffering. The three thematic findings from this study—caregiving stress, stolen time in CF, and learning to take perspective—are analyzed below within the context of the literature.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1049732311421486" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The conceptual insights that informed this study lend much interpretive value to the analysis and make a novel contribution to the literature by illustrating how the parents of youths with CF and CHD story their experiences. Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311421486">Frank’s (1995)</xref> typology of illness, there appear to be qualitative differences in the ways that parents of children with CHD and parents of children with CF narrated their stressful parenting experiences. Although stress related to parenting a child with CHD is ever present and requires managing a chronic childhood illness, parents were elated that they had pulled through a difficult experience and survived, and they recalled that their most stressful experiences were a thing of the past. Thus, these parents were characterized by a frightening departure from a state of health at the time of diagnosis. Adopting a sick role when hospitalized, children and parents experienced a prolonged convalescence that tested survival. The postsurgical period marked their child’s return to relative health; they had triumphed over CHD and it was a thing of the past. It appears that these parents adopted a protracted restitution narrative, marked by a departure from health, a socially appropriate occupation of the sick role, and a triumphant return to health (Frank).</p>
<p>In contrast, the parents of youth with CF utilized different stress narratives that contained elements of both chaos and quest typologies. The diagnosis of CF was met with initial shock, remorse, and a sense of chaos. As parents educated themselves about CF and routinized treatment as an everyday part of life, CF then entered a period of normalcy. Although it was not characteristic of most participants, a few parents storied quest narratives. They dialogued about how the onset of CF was a life-altering learning moment that had led them to engage in introspection; they learned to reprioritize values and weigh up what was really important. These parents knew, however, that their grasp on health was precarious and fragile at best. Chaos was projected forward and involved taking stock of the fact that their child’s health would deteriorate in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311421486">Tluczek, Orland, &amp; Cavanagh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311421486">Whitehead, 2006</xref>). In this regard, these parents were never afforded an opportunity to triumph over illness; their stress narratives contained elements of suffering and pain in the shadowy future. As clinicians and researchers, it is important that we be aware of the very different illness narratives that the parents of youth with CHD and parents of youth with CF take up in the process of storying their stressful caregiving experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311421486">Frank, 1995</xref>). For parents of youth with CF, who live with chronic unresolved stories and a protracted sense of chaos, it might be important to facilitate the development of more hopeful ways of storying their experiences. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311421486">Glasscoe and Smith (2011)</xref> suggested that psychologists might help these parents to construct coherent stories that hold both positive and realistic narratives about the future.</p>
<p>Parents of children with CF also described significant temporal stress that was absent from the narratives of parents of children with CHD. For the former, time appeared to be “stolen” in both a literal and abstract sense. The time-consuming nature of treatment was onerous and stressful for parents, requiring so much scheduling that it detracted from spontaneous opportunities and a sense of freedom. These parents alluded to time in a more abstract sense than parents of children with CHD. They were aware of their child’s reduced life span, and this was distressing. Although not characteristic of all parents, some parents described wanting to get the most out of life in the time that they had. In contrast, the parents of youth with CHD did not dialogue about stolen time. Although this requires further research, it appears that after surgical repair, the treatment burden for CHD was experienced as minor, and parents did not consider their child to be life limited.</p>
<p>Although the narrations of parents of children with CF about stolen time are a unique contribution from this study, other authors have discussed how CF changes perceptions toward the passage of time. Findings from qualitative studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311421486">Swisher and Erikson (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311421486">Berge, Patteron, Goetz, and Milla (2007)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311421486">Foster et al. (2001)</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311421486">Glasscoe and Smith (2008)</xref> emphasize the time-consuming and intrusive nature of treatment for families affected by CF. In addition to being a daily reminder of living with a fatal condition, the neverending cycle of treatment is extremely stressful for parents. Parents constantly worry about the consequences associated with nonadherence to treatment, often neglecting their other healthy children (Foster et al.). Additionally, time collapses for parents of children with CF. Rather than experiencing a linear series of events in their child’s life, the temporal experience is punctuated by illness-related emergencies in the child’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311421486">Glasscoe &amp; Smith, 2008</xref>). Thus, although the management of other childhood diseases might also be perceived as time consuming, temporal losses appear to be a unique feature that distinguishes CF and CHD caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311421486">Jessup &amp; Parkinson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311421486">Tluczek, Chevalier McKenhnie, &amp; Lynam, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Temporal theories aid in better understanding the concept of stolen time for parents of children with CF. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311421486">Gibson, Zizelsberger, and McKeever (2009)</xref> suggested that “etched into the social fabric of Western societies is a conception of time that encourages individuals to exert control over its passing, to be future oriented, enjoy free time, and not waste time” (p. 554). Gibson et al. explained how time is a resource for control and conflict and, in late modern capitalist states, time is conceptualized as an objective entity which must be seized, controlled, and quantified. As though time stands outside of the social meanings that we ascribe to it, Newtonian linear time emphasizes the progress of productive rational actors toward the efficient attainment of outcomes. The dominant time culture, which is engrained in childhood and embedded within the cultural imagination, has profound implications for how we understand childhood development. Children learn about the importance of attaining taken-for-granted temporal roles, such as graduating or gaining employment, and are schooled about the dangers and negative moral implications of excessive idle time.</p>
<p>The dominant linear time culture might be particularly damaging for those such as “futureless” children or people with certain life-limiting conditions who might not achieve temporal milestones on time (or at all). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311421486">Gibson et al. (2009)</xref> suggested that for those with life-limiting conditions, for whom the future is uncertain, modernist conceptualizations of time might be oppressive and lead to a profound sense of powerlessness. Always measured against normative standards of time, people with disabilities find themselves lacking. Gibson et al. proposed a radical reconceptualization of time. In addition to dismantling the social and temporal discourses that shape the existence of people with disabilities, they proposed that we address the inequalities of times by celebrating the cycles and processes that occur in the shadow time of the present. Similarly, in his discussion of those living with HIV/AIDS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311421486">Ezzy (2000)</xref> discussed a philosophy of living in the present. Engaging with present time and not investing in or depending on the future characterizes such a philosophy. Informed by Aristotle’s politics, those who live with a philosophy of the present are agentic subjects who act on their environments, yet embrace the finite nature of human life and forces that exist outside of their control. They can look to the future without a dependence on it to enjoy today.</p>
<p>Although we all vary in our capacity to resist the dominant time culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311421486">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>), most parents of children with CF spoke of a loss of time, and this roused stress and sadness. Thus, it appears that living with a philosophy of the present is not characteristic of how these parents cope with their child’s illness or how they conceptualize time. As we all are, it appears that the parents of youth with CF are embedded within dominant conceptualizations of time. They are aware of, and hold their child against, the temporal norms associated with modernist linear time.</p>
<p>In addition to taking stock of the temporal dilemmas that are unique to parents of children with CF, professionals might empower these parents to work toward developing a philosophy of the present. Developing a philosophy of the present might not, however, be a successful strategy for all of these parents; their ability to do so might be influenced by the position along their child’s illness trajectory. However, developing such a philosophy in which one enjoys the present, plans for the future without depending on it or colonizing it, and acknowledges uncertainty and finality might promote more positive ways of coping for some parents, as well as more meaningful ways of enjoying time with their child. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311421486">Melnyk et al. (2006)</xref>, early education and behavioral intervention work with parents in the immediate neonatal period might also facilitate parental empowerment and reduce child and parent morbidity through changing parental beliefs about their infant’s health and improving parent–child relationships. More pragmatically, the development of novel, less-time-consuming airway clearance activities—such as the vest system; that is, a medical device for CF patients that employs high-frequency chest-wall oscillation to stimulate mucous clearance—might also reduce the time-consuming nature of treatment and influence parents’ temporal stories.</p>
<p>Participants drew on a three-stage process to gain insight, meaning, and perspective into their child’s health condition, and this appears to be a novel contribution from this study. Moreover, parents of children with CF and those of children with CHD both appeared to employ the same, three-stage, perspective-taking process. Although this appears to be a novel finding that has not been reported previously, particular aspects of this process accord with some previous literature. For example, the fathers of children with ALL often reported frustration related to the minor health issues that parents with healthy children complained about. They tended to trivialize these experiences and, similar to the participants in my study, stated that others would never be able to understand their experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311421486">Hill et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, recognizing that “things could be so much worse” is one of the strategies that the parents of youth with illnesses drew on to normalize their situation. Additionally, Upward Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311421486">Festinger, 1954</xref>), in which people appraise their experiences by engaging in social comparison with others, also supports the results of my study. As well, other scholars might wish to apply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311421486">Said’s (1979)</xref> original and adapted theoretical work on Otherness to further analyze how one’s illness identity might come into existence in and through its Other. Further to this, the experience of those parents whose child is “Othered” within the context of treatment for childhood chronic illnesses, such as children with cancer, should be sensitively explored.</p>
<p>Described as forgotten parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311421486">Hill et al., 2009</xref>), dominant gender ideologies exclude fathers from caring for children with illnesses, incorrectly assuming their instrumental and less-emotional role. In contrast, my study adds a notable contribution to the growing body of literature on fathering children with chronic illnesses. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311421486">McNeill (2007)</xref>, my study rejects the problematic assumption that fathers are uninvolved in caregiving. My study, in fact, involved dialogues with fathers who wanted to occupy a central caregiving role in their child’s life in both emotional and instrumental ways. Researchers might wish to examine how gender influences caregiving among parents of children with CF and CHD.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Because the ability of parents to adapt to and cope with their child’s chronic illness is central to child health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311421486">Hill et al., 2009</xref>), it is important to explore the meaning of parenting a child with a chronic health condition. By illuminating the experiences of the parents of children with CF and CHD, in this theoretically informed study I sought to address critical research limitations. In doing so, I revealed novel and important similarities and differences in how the parents of youth with CF and CHD experience and narrate caregiving that underscores the importance of both comparative and noncategorical approaches for inquiry. Although stress was present for both groups, parents of children with CF narrated protracted future worries that, in some cases, illustrated an unresolved chaos narrative. Stolen time was a unique source of stress for these parents: they grieved the loss of life time and spontaneous uses of free time. By drawing on a three-way, “sick other–healthy child–self” process that allowed them to put things into perspective, parents of children with CF and CHD dealt with caregiver stress in similar ways. My findings add to the literature on caring for children with chronic illnesses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421486">Ingersky et al. (2010)</xref> suggested that comparative research is useful for identifying high-risk groups so that appropriate services are delivered. From this, it can tentatively be concluded that because psychosocial morbidity is greater among parents of children with CF than parents of children with CHD, more services are required. By opening up their private worlds, this study has not only illustrated the parenting dilemmas encountered by these caregivers, but also illuminated the subtleties, nuances, and differences between them.</p>
