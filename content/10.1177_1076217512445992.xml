<p>On a Saturday morning, I was enjoying a tall cup of coffee and the daily newspaper in a local donut shop adjacent to my university’s campus. Three young men from a nearby freshman dormitory entered the shop, ordered a dozen sugar-coated donuts, and proceeded to devour them at the table next to mine. Since it was 11:30 a.m., I turned to them, smiled, and asked, “Okay, guys, is this breakfast or lunch?” All three noticed that I was enjoying their choice of nutrition and explained that they were all “trying to bulk up.” I got a chuckle out of watching them eat, but I enjoyed their conversation even more. As I pretended to be engrossed in my newspaper, I couldn’t help but listen in to what they had to share with each other that morning.</p>
<p>Their conversation was filled with a variety of issues that all young men face in their adolescent development and gifted males in particular may find even more challenging. I heard a description of the off-campus party they had attended the night before that was filled with examples of negotiated masculinity. Later in the conversation, one young man highlighted how he was struggling to appreciate several of his large introductory level courses and the impact this would have on his grade point average. He commented that he couldn’t allow himself to “slack off” any longer if he was to maintain the merit-based university scholarship he had earned as a high school senior. The other two young men commiserated and referred to learning challenges they too were facing in courses that were not aligned with their learning styles and interests. As they continued to consume the large order of donuts, it became apparent to me from their conversation that they were attempting to gain weight to qualify for the wrestling team at the university. With a sheepish grin, one gentleman described how his father was expecting him to carry on the family tradition of involvement in athletics as well as pledging the same fraternity. From his discussion, it appeared that he was struggling with dad’s expectations as he did not see himself as “a big fraternity dude on this campus.”</p>
<p>As I finished my cup of coffee, I turned again to my neighbors and wished them good luck with their semester. They politely reciprocated. As I drove away from the donut shop, I reflected on how fortunate I am as a university professor living in a college town to encounter these types of experiences. Listening in on that morning conversation helped me to gain a glimpse of the contemporary culture of gifted males. Since that Saturday morning, I have reflected on the issues the three young men face and have been reinforced in my belief that growing up gifted and male involves complex challenges as well as advantages for success.</p>
<p>With those young men in mind, I am delighted to bring this special issue on gifted males to the readers of <italic>Gifted Children Today</italic> (<italic>GCT</italic>). As I have observed increasing challenges for gifted young men, I am pleased that other scholars and practitioners in the field are also recognizing them and working to support gifted boys in their adolescent development. The authors in this special issue provide us with a strong collection of articles that address several of the challenges facing gifted adolescent males.</p>
<p>The first article by Mary Cooper, a seasoned high school science teacher, shares important lessons she has learned about teaching gifted males and highlights four distinct subgroups: young men who lack confidence and express self-doubt, twice-exceptional males, culturally diverse young men, and gifted underachievers. Mary describes the pedagogy she implements in her classroom to effectively address the needs of her male students.</p>
<p>Next, Meredith Green Burton describes many different strategies for educators to effectively engage adolescent gifted males in counseling. Drawing from her 30 years in the secondary classroom and guidance office, she describes how teachers and counselors can expand their repertoire of male-friendly instructional and counseling approaches to support gifted males.</p>
<p>Masculine identity development and its relevance in supporting talented Black males is the focus of the third article by Malik Henfield. The author explores how Black males develop identities that either enhance or impede the likelihood that they will participate in academically challenging experiences. Henfield addresses the importance of gifted educators understanding the process of Black male masculine identity development and offers recommendations for improved recruitment and retention of Black males in advanced academic classes and programs.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that hip hop is a creative and male-dominated culture, J. Sean Callahan and Tarek Grantham share their insights as fathers and teachers of gifted males to explain the impact of hip hop on young gifted adolescent students. The authors present an intergenerational view in explaining negative images associated with hip hop as they relate to gifted males. They also provide recommendations and resources for teachers interested in using hip hop to academically engage gifted young men.</p>
<p>The final feature article in this issue of <italic>GCT</italic> addresses the experiences of gifted student athletes. Richard Kent, a former high school teacher and coach, introduces <italic>GCT</italic> readers to the use of athlete’s journals in supporting the academic and affective development of talented male athletes. He shares his work with Charlie, a gifted student-athlete training in an elite ski school and offers real insight into the athlete’s physical and psychosocial needs. Kent also highlights potential benefits of journals for student athletes and provides helpful suggestions for teachers and coaches interested in using this approach.</p>
<p>My hope is that <italic>GCT</italic> readers enjoy this special issue on educating gifted males and find the featured articles useful to them in their practice. Our featured authors remind educators, counselors, and coaches to work collaboratively in providing the best educational experiences possible for gifted boys to grow intellectually, athletically, and emotionally. The fine work of these authors has convinced me that growing up gifted and male involves more than devouring donuts!</p>
