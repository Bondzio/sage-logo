<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The 2010 census revealed the extent to which today’s metropolitan areas are growing increasingly diverse. Immigrant groups are skipping central cities for inner-ring suburbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0002831211430352">Katz, Creighton, Amsterdam, &amp; Chowkwanyun, 2010</xref>), some major central cities have an increasing White population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0002831211430352">Roberts, 2010</xref>), and formerly White inner-ring suburbs now hold more non-White residents than ever before. At the forefront of this change are schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0002831211430352">M. Orfield, 2002</xref>). Many of today’s schools have substantial shares of three or more racial/ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002831211430352">G. Orfield, 2009</xref>). However, at the same time as these changes are occurring, there are other schools that appear to be “diverse” but are actually in transition and will not remain diverse for long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002831211430352">Frankenberg, 2010</xref>). Yet, in research on school racial composition, many scholars continue to rely upon the traditional, one-point-in-time categorization of schools that classify together what are in fact very different types of racial school contexts with different racial groups, in different percentages, and/or for different lengths of time. In today’s changing context, we suspect that important distinctions exist within this broad category of “diverse schools,” and continuing to use the outdated binary—diverse or not—likely masks important differences that have implications for both policy and practice. For example, a multiracial school comprised of White, Black, Latino, and Asian students faces a very different set of issues related to racial climate than a school that is comprised of White and Black students. While technically both diverse, the students and teachers in these two diverse schools must confront different questions about race and identity that affect the nature of teaching and learning.</p>
<p>The traditional classification system, in fact, may be especially inaccurate when used to assess some educational outcomes, including, importantly, whether schools are cultivating effective citizenship for a diverse democracy. Developing citizens has long been a core goal of public schools, and recent public opinion data reveal that Americans still believe schools should teach citizenship and community responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0002831211430352">Rothstein, Jacobsen, &amp; Wilder, 2008</xref>), though this is certainly not the only goal the public has for its public schools. Moreover, in the desegregation era citizenship education played a prominent and often polarizing role, as it was understood that school desegregation was necessarily tied to notions of community and citizenship. Today’s rapidly changing demographic context again raises the question as to how schools promote engagement, with whom, and which notions of community are advanced.</p>
<p>There are many ways student racial context influences the ways schools educate future citizens. In some cases, particular types of diverse schools promote improved teaching and learning for active citizenship because of a specific school mission aimed at doing so. In schools where multiple racial groups exist, teachers acknowledge the complex context and feel obligated to make special efforts to address issues of diversity and promote intergroup discussions about participation in a diverse democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002831211430352">Banks et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, in diverse environments that have been stable for a long period of time, teachers likely have developed effective techniques that promote civic learning.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there may be ways that particular diverse environments actually hinder teaching and learning for citizenship. For example, teachers who are ill equipped for the changing demographics in their classrooms avoid deliberative discussions about civic and political issues because they are unsure about how to navigate the new complexion of their classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0002831211430352">Morris, 2005</xref>). By their own avoidance, they inadvertently discourage political discussions and collective action among their students. Because of changing demographics, it is important to investigate whether the traditional approach to classifying schools—diverse or not diverse—is too simplistic, especially as it relates to the development of citizenship in schools.</p>
<p>Outside of educational literature, we find evidence that the changing racial context of communities can have a significant impact on the level and types of citizen engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002831211430352">Campbell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002831211430352">Oliver, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0002831211430352">Putnam, 2007</xref>), further suggesting a need to rethink the way in which scholars in education classify schools. Therefore, this article considers whether a new framework for conceptualizing school racial composition, including the number and identity of specific racial groups and the stability of those groups, can determine more precisely the ways in which school diversity affects students’ citizenship learning.</p>
<p>We begin by examining previous literature on the connection between racial/ethnic context and citizenship. Drawing upon this literature, we propose a new classification system of school racial/ethnic context that considers both the number and combination of racial groups as well as the stability of those groups over time. Then, we test this new scheme using survey data from high school students enrolled in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS), which was collected by the Consortium on Chicago School Research (CCSR). These data on students’ civic and political learning were merged with information about school racial context over a 10-year span. By comparing the results obtained using a more traditional definition of diverse schools, we contribute to the growing body of literature that better reflects the changing demographics of the United States.</p>
<p>This work represents an important departure from existing scholarship in education. While we do find, like previous studies, that the racial composition of a student body affects learning opportunities, this work moves into new territory by being able to isolate important differences between schools with different racial combinations. These findings demonstrate that in an era of rapid demographic change, considering alternative classifications of diverse schools must be at the forefront of the research agenda on school racial context.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Much of the prior work exploring diversity and citizenship has been examined in communities, not schools. Thus, our review of relevant literature extends beyond educational literature alone. Given that schools are closely connected to their communities, considering prior work about community diversity is important in understanding why and how diversity shapes citizenship engagement.</p>
<sec id="section3-0002831211430352">
<title>How Racial/Ethnic Context Affects Citizenship</title>
<p>The changing population and political processes across metropolitan areas have been shown to have contrasting effects on civic participation. On one hand, the existence of smaller, homogeneous cities and districts are associated with less engaged citizens. As metropolitan fragmentation is associated with higher multiracial segregation between districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002831211430352">Bischoff, 2008</xref>) and enclaves of wealth, deliberative debate about diverse preferences in public resources might wane, limiting incentives for active civic engagement in homogeneous settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0002831211430352">Oliver, 2001</xref>). On the other hand, a growing body of research on the role of community context has shown that racially diverse environments can lead to diminished civic participation or withdrawal from public life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002831211430352">Alesina &amp; La Ferrara, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002831211430352">Campbell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0002831211430352">Putnam, 2007</xref>). To complicate matters further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0002831211430352">Oliver (2010)</xref> found that community homogeneity had a different impact on the engagement of Blacks as compared to Whites and Latinos.</p>

<title>The Literature’s Use of Imprecise Specifications for “Diverse”</title>
<p>Population shifts are transforming what have long been homogeneous White communities in many suburbs into diverse areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002831211430352">Frey, 2001</xref>). In addition, both city and suburban schools are experiencing more complex diversity amid minority suburbanization and urban gentrification. While diversity has historically been considered largely in a Black-White context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002831211430352">Clotfelter, 2004</xref>), today’s schools often have substantial shares of three or more racial/ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002831211430352">G. Orfield, 2009</xref>). Those schools that have only one or two groups differ from one another depending on the identity of the racial group(s) of students.</p>
<p>Desegregation literature typically assumes a Black-White school context because of the history of desegregation efforts that primarily focused on Black students. Historically, White percentage has been used to measure the extent of integration with, or segregation from, minority students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002831211430352">Clotfelter, 2004</xref>), although scholars have debated how best to measure the segregation between groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002831211430352">Alesina &amp; La Ferrara, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0002831211430352">Reardon &amp; Firebaugh, 2002</xref>). Earlier studies of segregation in the South used the percentage of Black students in a school for the same purpose—at that time, most non-White students in the region were Black. Such conceptualizations are less accurate now, as Latino students outnumber Black students nationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0002831211430352">G. Orfield, 2009</xref>). In addition, as court-ordered desegregation efforts wane and the non-White population grows larger and more diverse, this biracial context is less often found today. Some studies that focus on immigration find tension among minority groups, suggesting important differences within the large category of “minority” students and residents. For example, contemporary studies of immigrant assimilation find evidence of minority intergroup tensions in cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002831211430352">Bobo &amp; Hutchings, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0002831211430352">Kim, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0002831211430352">Morawska, 2001</xref>). Others find evidence that ethnic balkanization is “inevitable” because, as newer immigrant groups are assimilated, they assume many of the anti-Black policy preferences held by Whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0002831211430352">Sears, Citrin, Cheleden, &amp; Van Laar, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Another limitation of most analyses of segregation is that they examine student racial composition at one point-in-time or compare aggregate levels of school segregation at two distinct points (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0002831211430352">Mickelson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0002831211430352">Reardon &amp; Yun, 2005</xref>). In fact, some schools appear to be “diverse” for a few years but, due to White flight and other factors, are actually transitioning from White schools to segregated minority schools and will not remain diverse for long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0002831211430352">Frankenberg, 2010</xref>). In other places, the structures and policies of communities and school districts have created a great many stably diverse neighborhoods and schools over the past 10 years, where the White and non-White populations have remained relatively constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002831211430352">Ellen, 2000</xref>). This complexity makes using cross-sectional data misleading as such data group these “diverse” schools together even though the educational environments and outcomes are different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0002831211430352">G. Orfield, 1985</xref>). In his study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0002831211430352">Putnam (2007)</xref>, for example, used variability of census tract diversity to predict civic and political engagement and found that in areas of greater diversity, citizens had lower rates of voter registration and civic engagement but increased levels of other types of political participation. Putnam used a single point-in-time measure of racial composition to determine the effect on civic engagement, although conceptually, it is possible that changes in diversity (either racial/ethnic group identity or racial stability) might change the relationship he found between diversity and engagement. Other work demonstrates that the level of conflict differs in environments in which non-Whites are moving into a formerly homogenous White area compared to those in which non-Whites already had a significant presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002831211430352">Green, Strolovitch, &amp; Wong, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>The Role of Schools in Developing Citizens</title>
<p>Inequality in citizenship has been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002831211430352">APSA Task Force, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002831211430352">Bartels, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002831211430352">Gilens, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0002831211430352">Verba, Schlozman, &amp; Brady, 1995</xref>), and these trends begin early in a citizen’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0002831211430352">McFarland &amp; Thomas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0002831211430352">Spring, Dietz, &amp; Grimm, 2007</xref>). Moreover, important differences have been found to exist between types of engagement activities. Generally, two broad categories are examined when considering citizenship engagement activities—civic participation and political engagement. Political participation consists of activities that have a direct influence on government action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0002831211430352">Verba et al., 1995</xref>). Voting is the most commonly discussed activity, although contacting an elected official, donating time to a political campaign, and participating in a protest are also typically considered political activities. Civic engagement includes voluntary activities through nongovernmental organizations that focus on direct action to solve community problems rather than influencing the political process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0002831211430352">Zukin, Keeter, Andolina, Jenkins, &amp; Delli Carpini, 2006</xref>). Participating in a fund-raising walk/ride/run or a neighborhood clean-up project are examples of civic engagement. Additionally, because a citizen’s knowledge about civic and political processes and issues is often a key prerequisite for engagement in either civic or political activities, it is often considered when examining inequality in citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002831211430352">Delli Carpini &amp; Keeter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002831211430352">Galston, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0002831211430352">Torney-Purta, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>While more attention has been paid to the ways in which schools contribute to inequality in academic outcomes, schools also play a critical role in the citizenship outcomes of students. In particular, schools contribute to the development of knowledge that leads to greater participation in the aforementioned citizenship engagement activities. While the prevailing notion for several decades was that civic education in schools had no significant impact on civic knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0002831211430352">Langton &amp; Jennings, 1968</xref>), recent research reveals that specific types of learning opportunities in schools do increase the likelihood of participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002831211430352">Galston, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002831211430352">Kahne &amp; Middaugh, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831211430352">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0002831211430352">Kahne &amp; Westheimer, 2003</xref>). A study of National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) civics assessment scores found that the recentness of civics course work and the frequency of discussion about current events were significantly related to improved civic and political knowledge test score outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0002831211430352">Niemi &amp; Junn, 1998</xref>). These improved test scores can translate into improved participation outcomes when coupled with specific learning opportunities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0002831211430352">Kahne and Sporte (2008)</xref> concluded that students who were in classrooms that provided open dialogue around controversial issues and exposure to civic role models reported significantly higher levels of commitment to participation. Similarly, school programs that connected students to citizens who were working in their communities were likely to lead to positive participation outcomes in students’ futures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831211430352">Kahne &amp; Middaugh, 2008b</xref>). As these studies demonstrate, specific classroom practices have an impact on students’ political engagement.</p>
<p>Schools also influence students’ civic engagement through service learning programs that integrate course work with community service activities aimed at addressing a community-based problem. While these programs have become increasingly popular among schools, research has been mixed regarding their long-term effects on students’ civic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002831211430352">Billig, Root, &amp; Jesse, 2005</xref>). A key factor in determining the effectiveness of service learning is the degree to which students have opportunities to discuss and process their community-based experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002831211430352">Astin, Sax, &amp; Avalos, 1999</xref>). Additionally, the nature of the service—direct service (i.e., tutoring), indirect service (i.e., fundraising), or political action (i.e., organizing a community forum)—is influential; students who engaged in action-oriented projects reported higher levels of civic knowledge and scored higher on civic dispositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002831211430352">Billig et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the experiences named previously are missing from many classrooms. In a study of over 2,000 high school youth in California, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831211430352">Kahne and Middaugh (2008b)</xref> found that when asked about the frequency with which they were able to engage in these best practices, students most often answered only “a little” (p. 37). This is certainly a concern, but what’s even more troubling is that these opportunities are far from equitably distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002831211430352">Hart &amp; Atkins, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0002831211430352">Levinson, 2007</xref>). For example, schools that serve disadvantaged populations are less likely to provide opportunities to participate in service learning projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0002831211430352">Spring et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, the focus of No Child Left Behind on reading, math, and science test scores has often resulted in social studies courses being shortchanged or cut altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0002831211430352">McMurrer, 2008</xref>). Even when teachers want to incorporate lessons on citizenship and engagement, research has found that some teachers decide to focus solely on tested material out of concern for student test scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002831211430352">Journell, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to unequal access, limited research has documented unequal learning opportunities within ostensibly the same courses. When different environments influence the pedagogical choices teachers make, learning opportunities can vary significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0002831211430352">Pollock, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0002831211430352">Sleeter &amp; Grant, 2009</xref>). The race(s) of students, changes in schools’ racial composition, and teachers’ own race inform the ways in which teachers engage with students in their classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002831211430352">Dee, 2004</xref>). In a study of one school that underwent significant racial transition, White teachers (unlike their Black peers) perceived that the White students remaining in the school were poorer and more “difficult” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0002831211430352">Morris, 2005</xref>). For civic and political learning opportunities, research has found that African American students report less opportunity to discuss social problems and current events in their government courses than do White students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002831211430352">Kahne &amp; Middaugh, 2008a</xref>).</p>
<p>Until now, most research has only considered single point-in-time measures of diversity when considering the relative availability of learning opportunities, and little distinction has been made between different types of diverse environments. Thus, it is important to understand how context—especially in new and changing environments—shapes the development of citizenship in schools.</p>

<title>Why Student Racial/Ethnic Identity and Stability Affects Citizenship Development in Schools</title>
<p>Refining our conceptualization of diversity is important in order to be precise in understanding whether and how schools provide different opportunities for their students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0002831211430352">Pollock, 2008</xref>). Just as a variety of educational measures such as achievement gaps or exposure to other groups of students vary by race (e.g., Asians are the most integrated group), the histories and cultures of different racial groups have varying implications for educational needs and home-school relations. Given the differing perceptions about the desirability of proximity with certain racial groups (e.g., Whites as most desirable, Blacks as least) as neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002831211430352">Charles, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0002831211430352">Shapiro, 2004</xref>), the identity of groups in addition to the number of groups may also affect perceptions of schools, both by those inside and outside of the school environment.</p>
<p>Having a critical mass of students from a particular group (defined by race, gender, etc.) allows for non-token representation that is necessary for substantial intergroup contact to occur, which, when structured appropriately, results in benefits for students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0002831211430352">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2006</xref>). Students either find confirmation or disjuncture between civic ideals they learn about in school and what they experience in their own lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0002831211430352">Rubin, 2007</xref>). When structured appropriately with a diverse group of students, school environments result in greater understanding because there is often an increased number of ideas and perspectives being raised. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0002831211430352">Page (2007)</xref> has argued, in environments where a diversity of ideas is discussed during problem solving, participants build a stronger capacity for thinking and understanding that, ultimately, leads to better solutions. Other work has found such intergroup interactions are associated with more positive attitudes about civic engagement, although these findings also vary by student race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0002831211430352">Kurlaender &amp; Yun, 2007</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section7-0002831211430352">
<title>Composition and number of groups</title>
<p>As discussed previously, the lessons that teachers teach and the opportunities they provide vary based on the racial contexts of their schools, and there are reasons to hypothesize that additional and/or novel groups of students might both enhance or hinder teachers’ ability to teach effectively for citizenship engagement. A small group of students in a school population may not cause teachers to alter their teaching practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0002831211430352">Schofield &amp; Sagar, 1983</xref>), but the presence of a critical mass of additional or different groups might change teacher behavior. For example, one educator noted that she augmented discussion of civil rights heroes such as Dr. Martin Luther King by profiling everyday community heroes as examples for her students in a low-income, majority minority school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0002831211430352">Levinson, 2008</xref>). The presence of Latino students, likewise, in a bilingual school prompted a teacher to use students’ communities as “an intellectual resource” to create a module drawing on students’ parents to respond to students’ interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0002831211430352">Moll, 1992</xref>, p. 27). Further, the presence of multiple, newer immigrant groups often prompts faculties and administrators to prioritize professional development or hiring of faculty skilled in teaching techniques that engage diverse groups of students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002831211430352">Banks &amp; McGee Banks, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0002831211430352">Ruiz-de-Velasco, Fix, &amp; Chu Clewell, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, recent fears of parental reactions have led some schools to shy away from teaching controversial issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002831211430352">Galston, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002831211430352">Hess’s (2004)</xref> work with middle and high school teachers as they struggled to teach about controversial issues found that the four most common practices all fell short of the ideal. Indeed, many teachers avoid controversial topics altogether and others attempt to avoid conflict by treating them as noncontroversial and giving students the “right” answer. The choice to avoid or deny controversy is likely related to the broader school context. While we have limited evidence of this, an important study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002831211430352">Campbell (2007)</xref> found that there was a lower level of civic discussion in diverse classrooms. These findings were robust and large; the most diverse environments saw a decline by almost a half a standard deviation in the classroom climate variable. Changes in the composition and number of racial/ethnic groups could further push teachers to withdraw from civic discussions altogether, if this deepening diversity seems too complex or risky for teachers to tackle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0002831211430352">
<title>Racial stability/change</title>
<p>Just as the numbers and identity of racial groups might matter for citizenship learning and attitudes, it is reasonable to expect that, for several reasons, racial stability might enhance civic learning in diverse schools. In stably diverse schools, teachers may have already adopted practices and curriculum materials that encourage intergroup cooperation and interracial trust, providing very different learning opportunities to students than in schools where diversity is rapidly changing. Such practices have the potential to serve as important models for transitioning schools. For example, acknowledging difference in the classroom is important for the development of citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002831211430352">Junn, 2004</xref>), and yet many teachers continue to adopt a “color blind” approach in which they avoid acknowledging differences in rapidly changing environments out of fear or uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0002831211430352">Pollock, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Earlier work on racial stability found that stably diverse communities attracted residents with higher educational outcomes than similarly diverse neighborhoods experiencing transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0002831211430352">G. Orfield, 1985</xref>). Applications of this work in educational contexts have found that stably diverse schools also attract more qualified, experienced teachers on par with homogeneous White schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002831211430352">Frankenberg, 2008</xref>), whereas schools with a declining percentage of White students have higher flight from these schools, particularly among White teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002831211430352">Freeman, Scafidi, &amp; Sjoquist, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002831211430352">Jackson, 2009</xref>). Schools with higher teacher quality and less teacher turnover are able to provide civic learning opportunities that deepen students’ political and civic engagement.</p>
<p>As racially changing schools begin to serve greater percentages of traditionally underperforming students, they tend to focus attention on raising math and reading test scores and limit time spent on activities shown to be related to political engagement: discussions of current events, teaching topics students care about, and interaction with civic role models, among other things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002831211430352">Kahne &amp; Middaugh, 2008a</xref>). Additionally, teachers may shy away from offering service learning experiences that directly raise issues about inequality and poverty in their community due to fears of offending students of color or exacerbating existing racial tension. Instead, teachers may opt for “safe” activities, such as promoting the importance of voting or paying taxes, activities that are individually based and avoid intergroup tension.</p>
<p>Taken together, some diverse schools are diverse for a long time and others only temporarily, and moreover, diverse schools with different racial/ethnic groups are likely quite different from one another in how students learn about civic or political engagement. Because schools have long played a critical role in developing citizenship skills, attitudes, and behaviors in students, it is critical to understand how these environments impact learning and engagement. Based on the literature reviewed here, there are reasons to believe that classification systems should take these different types of diverse schools into account, especially regarding a subject so closely linked to diversity.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>As described earlier, school contexts are changing and sensitivity to these changes is critical for work in the area of citizenship. Therefore, to examine whether and how updated definitions of school context uncover important differences between school types and their influence on citizen development, we develop and test three classification systems: a traditional classification scheme, a classification scheme that considers the number and identity of racial groups, and a classification scheme that considers the stability of the school racial composition.</p>
<sec id="section10-0002831211430352">
<title>Community and District Context</title>
<p>Contemporary Chicago, because of its multiracial demographics, is an instructive model for moving beyond a simple White versus Black framing of “diversity.” Chicago is among the small, but growing, number of large metropolitan areas that have both a substantial Latino and Black population, having already experienced some of the demographic changes many other places are only beginning to grapple with.</p>
<p>The Chicago Public Schools (CPS) is the third largest school district in the country, educating more than 400,000 students in 2005–2006. Like most of the largest urban districts, only a small fraction of students were White. Chicago has been a place of Black and Latino migration and immigration, and each group comprised a large percentage of students, 49.8% and 38.5%, respectively. More recently, the percentage of White and Asian students in CPS has remained relatively constant, but there has been a decline in the percentage of Black students and an increase in Latino students. While the racial transition of CPS (as measured by White students) is approximately half the rate of the racial change among all public school students, the presence of three racial groups in the public schools for at least a decade makes CPS an important case, as it foreshadows the growing multiracial nature of public schools around the country.</p>
<p>Chicago is also emblematic of many urban school districts, as it was under a court desegregation order from 1980 until 2009 which includes the time period studied here. As part of the consent decree that governed the student assignment process for the district’s 300 magnet programs and selective schools, the district used a race-conscious lottery for admissions, which was designed to decouple school composition from neighborhood composition. Students who did not attend a selective or magnet school were assigned to a neighborhood school. Both the admissions lotteries for a subset of high schools and the lack of transportation limit the ability of some families to exercise choice in selecting schools. There are at least two forms of self-selection bias that could affect our results: self-selection into neighborhoods (which affects schools to the extent that schools are geographically based) and self-selection into schools. To address the former possible source of bias, we control for neighborhood social capital by including in each of our models a neighborhood factor formed from six survey questions focused on adult engagement in the neighborhood (see Appendix S3 available in the online version of this journal). The latter source of bias is mitigated, to some extent, due to the fact that CPS tried to disentangle neighborhood and school composition through its desegregation policies. Further, we control for several family characteristics (e.g., mother born in United States, parents discuss politics, student free/reduced lunch status) that could correlate with unmeasured characteristics that might also affect self-selection into schools. To the extent that a student’s race is motivating school choices, we also control for individual student race/ethnicity. While it is impossible to eliminate all sources of bias in observational data, controlling for these factors gives us greater confidence in the observed relationships in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002831211430352">Greenman, Bodovski, &amp; Reed, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0002831211430352">Sampson, Morenoff, &amp; Gannon-Rowley, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Data and Sampling</title>
<p>This article uses student survey data from the Consortium on Chicago School Research (CCSR). With the cooperation of CPS, CCSR asked all regular high schools to participate in a survey of 9th-, 10th, and 11th graders in 2005–2006. The survey included questions on civic participation and civic learning opportunities at school and beliefs about civic and political engagement. While there is not an established response rate threshold, the American Association for Public Opinion Research concluded after reviewing journals that publish survey research that a 60% response rate was an acceptable minimum standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002831211430352">Johnson &amp; Owens, 2003</xref>). Among high school juniors, 54.0% of all students completed surveys while 58.7% of 9th and 10th graders completed the survey. Additionally, not all schools participated. When we examine only schools that participated, we find that approximately two-thirds of students in participating schools completed surveys. While a higher response rate would, of course, be preferable, response rates have been declining across all surveys, especially in the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002831211430352">Groves et al., 2009</xref>). Nonetheless, our response rate comes very close to meeting the minimum standard commonly accepted by survey researchers.</p>
<p>To check for possible bias in our sample due to the response rates, we compared the sample of students who participated to the demographics of all CPS 9th-, 10th-, and 11th-grade students. There is a slight overrepresentation of Asian and White students in the sample and a small underrepresentation of African American students (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002831211430352">Table 1</xref>). These relatively small differences provide support for the representativeness of these data and diminish concerns about response rates for our key variable of interest. Likewise, our sample of schools also reflects the diversity of schools within the CPS system. The frequency and percentage of school and student characteristics in our sample are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002831211430352">Table 1</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002831211430352">1</xref></sup></p>

<p>We merged survey responses with a student-level administrative data set that contained demographic information on each student and a school-level administrative data set with racial composition and selected school characteristics for each school. Importantly, the data included the racial composition of all schools from 1995 (or the year the school opened, if later than that) through 2005. Combined, these data allow us to explore how different school racial contexts contribute to civic and political learning and attitudes. The final sample consisted of 45,044 students in 93 high schools in CPS.</p>

<title>Conceptualizing Political and Civic Engagement: Dependent Variables</title>
<p>As discussed previously, specific educational experiences are related to increased participation later in life. Generally, previous work has identified three interrelated components that develop citizenship: knowledge, skills, and attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0002831211430352">Lutkus &amp; Weiss, 2007</xref>). Using a similar construct of citizenship, we developed two measures to use as our dependent variables of students’ learning opportunities and civic and political engagement: (1) opportunities in school to develop civic and political knowledge and skills and (2) the development of students’ civic and political attitudes. Because previous research has documented the importance of knowledge and skills as prerequisites for engagement, our first variable combines four questions that asked students whether they felt they had learned both factual knowledge and skills to become engaged. The second outcome variable combines two questions that focus specifically on students’ attitudes toward engagement. Because school context may influence the choice of which aspect of engagement to foster—knowledge/skills versus attitude—we opted to keep these categories distinct.</p>
<p>Additionally, we also examined students’ perceptions of the citizenship teaching strategies they experience. We refer to this dependent variable as (3) pedagogical techniques used to engage students in civic and political learning opportunities. Three questions in the survey asked students to assess the frequency they experienced particular forms of learning. These three questions were combined to represent a measure of the pedagogical techniques used. For each of our dependent variables, students’ individual responses to questions were combined into a single measure using simple averages. See Appendix S2, available in the online version of this journal, for exact question wording and descriptive statistics of responses.</p>

<title>Stage 1 Analysis: Considering Traditional Understandings of School Diversity</title>
<p>There are varying ways in which residential and school segregation has been conceptualized, such as isolation from other groups or evenness with which the population is distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831211430352">Massey &amp; Denton, 1988</xref>). We define segregation in our analysis in terms of concentration of students. Although many studies and federal policies continue to use definitions for racial isolation as broad as 50% to 100% non-White students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0002831211430352">Steele &amp; Eaton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0002831211430352">Strizek, Pittsonberger, Riordan, Lyter, &amp; Orlofsky, 2006</xref>), as the country approaches a non-White majority of students, such a definition is substantively less meaningful. We define racial composition categories with the assumption that a certain percentage of students constitute a “critical mass.” Studies have used different conceptions of critical mass, from 5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002831211430352">Fry, 2007</xref>) to 15% or 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002831211430352">Cole, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002831211430352">Goldring &amp; Smrekar, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0002831211430352">Moss Kanter, 1977</xref>). Informed by defining a “critical mass” of students as 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002831211430352">Clotfelter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0002831211430352">Massey &amp; Denton, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0002831211430352">G. Orfield, 1983</xref>), we define racially isolated non-White schools as those with less than 10% White students.</p>
<p>Further, because studies increasingly indicate that White students also benefit from attending racially diverse schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0002831211430352">Linn &amp; Welner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0002831211430352">Perry, 2002</xref>), we construct a measure of White segregation, racially isolated White schools that are 90% to 100% White. Finally, we define diverse schools as those in which White students are between 10.1% and 89.9% of all students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0002831211430352">2</xref></sup> Similar to most large cities, there are no segregated White high schools in CPS. Three-fourths of CPS high schools are segregated non-White schools, which is a higher percentage than in other large cities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002831211430352">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Stage 2 Analysis: Considering School Racial/Ethnic Group Composition</title>
<p>To reflect the growth of immigrant groups in many urban areas, in this stage of our analysis, we seek to understand more clearly whether the <italic>identity</italic> and <italic>number</italic> of racial groups in schools relates to student outcomes in both segregated and diverse schools. First, we divide racially isolated schools into four categories, where each has 90% to 100% of students of that racial group: racially isolated White, racially isolated Latino, racially isolated Black, and racially isolated Asian.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0002831211430352">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Second, we divide schools into those with two groups, biracial schools, and those with three or more racial groups, multiracial schools. CPS is similar to districts nationwide in percentage of one-race schools, with a slightly higher percentage of multiracial schools and a slightly lower percentage of biracial schools. To comprise a “group” each must be 10% or greater of the student enrollment to constitute a critical mass. Among these schools, we divide biracial schools into six categories (e.g., Black/White, White/Asian, Black/Latino, etc.) and multiracial schools into five categories based on the identity of students that comprise at least one-tenth of the enrollment (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002831211430352">Table 2</xref>). While CPS is similar to the country in terms of the share of one-race, biracial, and multiracial schools, the combinations of different racial groups differ from the United States (e.g., most of CPS’s biracial schools are Black-Latino, while Black-White or Latino-White are more common nationally). Somewhat surprisingly for a district with so many Black students, there are no Black-White high schools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0002831211430352">
<title>Stage 3 Analysis: Considering Racial Composition and Stability</title>
<p>To reflect the varying rates of change schools experience, the third step of our analysis of school context develops a classification scheme based on the stability of the student population. Because this work represents an important first attempt in examining the role of stability, previous literature has not established a standard for the number of years needed to determine the stability of a student population. Thus, for this stage of our analysis, we included all schools that had been open at least 5 years (<italic>N</italic> = 66), believing that 5 years was enough time for teachers and students to begin to see changes and feel their effects if they exist. Due to sample size, we examined stability using the three categories described in Stage 1 of our analysis. If we had a larger set of schools, we would ideally examine the ways in which stable or unstable schools with differing numbers and identities of racial groups vary.</p>
<sec id="section16-0002831211430352">
<title>Stability of diverse schools</title>
<p>Because other researchers have traditionally looked at cross-sectional data to create their school context variables, there is little guidance in the segregation literature about appropriate cut points to define “stable” or “unstable” diverse schools. We decided that a change in the White student population of 5% or more would be visible to students and teachers, possibly influencing the behavior and instructional strategies used by teachers regarding civic and political learning opportunities. Additionally, 5 percentage points was nearly twice the overall White percentage change during the decade for CPS (2.57%). We conceptualized racially diverse schools as experiencing one of three types of stability of racial composition:</p>
<list id="list1-0002831211430352" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Stably diverse: School was 10.1% to 89.9% White in 2005 and within ±5 percentage points change in percentage White over time period (over at least 5 years and up to a decade).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Unstably diverse, increasing White: School was 10.1% to 89.9% White in 2005 and had an increase in White population of more than 5 percentage points over time period.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Unstably diverse, decreasing White: School was 10.1% to 89.9% White in 2005 and had a decrease in White population of more than 5 percentage points over time period.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0002831211430352">
<title>Stability of racially isolated schools</title>
<p>If schools are segregated non-White and were classified as such both at the initial observation point and in 2005, we label these schools as stably segregated non-White. If they are segregated in 2005 but were not when they opened (or in 1995), we classify them as unstably segregated. There were no segregated White schools in CPS in 2005.</p>
<p>CPS has higher percentages of stably segregated non-White schools and considerably lower percentages of stably diverse schools in comparison to the United States and large city high schools. There are also lower percentages of unstably diverse schools where the percentage of White students is declining. From these frequencies, it appears that many high schools in CPS transitioned to segregated schools earlier than high schools in the United States or large cities. Thus, the findings in these schools can inform districts in earlier stages of racial transition.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section18-0002831211430352">
<title>Analytic Plan</title>
<p>Three ordinary least squares (OLS) models were used to predict distinct dimensions of learning opportunities and student engagement. Because our data have multilevel features, wherein students are nested within schools, we tested to determine if multilevel modeling was necessary. The interclass correlation was low enough—below .05—to give us confidence that we were not violating the assumption of independence in our OLS regressions. We did, however, use clustered standard errors to account for any within-school clustering. The baseline model is displayed in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0002831211430352">Equation 1</xref>:</p>

The third model looks at whether teachers use pedagogical techniques known to increase students’ engagement in civic and political activities.</p>
<p>We present the findings from each stage of analysis in the following. Before running our final models, however, we present a model that examines only how individual characteristics, school characteristics, neighborhood engagement, and school learning opportunities affect beliefs and expected engagement levels. These characteristics were used through each subsequent stage of analysis to serve as control variables.</p>

<title>Controls</title>
<p>Before considering school racial/ethnic composition and stability, we examined the role that student characteristics, neighborhood context, and school size played in student-reported civic attitudes, opportunities to develop civic skills and knowledge, and pedagogical techniques related to citizenship development. As discussed earlier, these variables have been previously found to be important predictors of student beliefs and engagement levels, and therefore, we include them as controls in each model.</p>
<p>The strongest predictors across all three outcome variables are (1) whether students reported that their parents discussed politics at home on a regular basis, (2) whether students reported that the people in their neighborhood demonstrated good citizenship, and (3) the percentage of students in the individual’s school who receive free or reduced price lunch (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0002831211430352">Table 3</xref>). These results are in line with previous research on this topic, which found that “the degree to which parents discussed politics and current events and the civic qualities of [students’] neighborhood mattered” for students’ citizenship development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002831211430352">Kahne &amp; Middaugh, 2008a</xref>, p. 22). In addition, we found that gender is significant across all three dependent variables, as female students reported higher rates of learning opportunities and engagement. Students’ own racial/ethnic background is also an important predictor of civic learning opportunities. Perhaps surprisingly, Black students reported higher rates of civic attitude and learning opportunities for civic knowledge and skills as compared to White students. Latino students reported higher rates for knowledge and skills opportunities, and Asian students reported higher rates on all outcome measures when compared to White students. These results may be due to the small percentage of White students in CPS and the likelihood that they are different in marked ways from White students in other parts of the country. Finally, increased school size also generally predicts lower rates of learning opportunities as compared to schools with fewer than 400 students. Because of the important role that these individual and school characteristics play in predicting our outcomes, they were included at each of the following stages of analysis.</p>

<title>Stage 1: Results Using Traditional Conceptualization of School Racial Context</title>
<p>Stage 1 of our analysis uses the traditional conceptualization of diverse schools, which compares segregated schools to diverse schools. In doing so, it groups all schools in which the White student population accounts for between 10.1% and 89.9% of the total student population into the “diverse” school category. This conception of diverse schools includes 20 schools with 16,478 students in the CPS data file. The reference group is segregated non-White schools, a group that includes 73 schools with 30,095 students. Recall there were no segregated White schools in our sample.</p>
<p>Students enrolled in diverse schools did not report having more civic learning opportunities or stronger civic attitudes than students in segregated non-White schools (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0002831211430352">Table 4</xref>). Across all three outcomes—learning opportunities in knowledge and skills, civic attitudes, and pedagogical techniques used to teach engagement—students in diverse schools did not report significantly different learning opportunities than students in segregated schools.</p>

<title>Stage 2: Results Using Racial and Ethnic Group Composition for School Racial Context</title>
<p>Because of the changing nature of diversity, we hypothesize that the aforementioned results are not specific enough to meaningfully distinguish the experiences of students in different school contexts. When more specific school racial context variables are included in our analysis, we find that not all diverse schools behave in the same manner; the number and combination of racial and ethnic groups are important considerations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0002831211430352">Table 5</xref>). As compared to students in schools with four racial groups—Black, White, Latino, and Asian—students in other schools reported different rates of citizenship and civic learning opportunities.</p>

<p>Across all three outcomes, students in Black/White/Latino schools were significantly less likely than students in four-group schools to report positive citizenship, even after controlling for individual and school characteristics. This finding could imply that students in four-group schools are receiving different kinds of instruction and messaging around citizenship than are students in schools without at least 10% Asian students. Interestingly, students in Black/Latino/Asian schools were significantly more likely to report that their teachers encouraged civic behavior than students in four-group schools. In addition, although students in Latino/White schools did not have significantly different attitudes about civic responsibility than students in four-group schools, they were less likely to report positive civic learning opportunities for knowledge and skills and less likely to report that their teachers encouraged citizenship activities. Students in White/Latino/Asian schools were more likely to report that they believed it was their own and others’ responsibility to be concerned about political and civic issues than the four-group reference group. Finally, students in segregated Black and in segregated Latino schools were less likely to report learning opportunities for civic knowledge and skills than students in four-group schools. These findings suggest that even after controlling for a number of factors known to influence civic and political learning opportunities, important variations in school racial composition exist. In particular, most of our findings indicate that students in four-group schools are more likely to report civic learning opportunities and positive civic attitudes than students in schools with fewer than four groups. This could mean that schools with four racial groups have developed ways to support civic development in ways that other schools have not yet done.</p>

<title>Stage 3: Results Using Stability and Diversity Composition for School Racial Context</title>
<p>In addition to the growing number of racial and ethnic groups in our schools, there is also significant variation in the stability (or lack thereof) of those groups. Thus, we consider the role that stability in racial composition plays in influencing the opportunities to learn about and engage in issues of citizenship.</p>
<p>While we hypothesized that stability would be an important predictor, when we include variables that account for changing diversity in schools we do not find any statistically significant differences. While the signs of these coefficients are generally in the expected direction—students in all other schools were less likely to report civic learning opportunities or positive civic attitudes than students in stably diverse schools—none of the school context variables reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0002831211430352">Table 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The changing demographic trends and their implications are frequently discussed in other bodies of literature, such as sociology and political science. But researchers have been slower to incorporate these changes into the constructs used in educational research, and in doing so, we believe they are missing some important distinctions between different types of diverse schools. The traditional conception of school diversity, which lumps all diverse schools into one category, regardless of the number and identity of groups, can mask important differences. A simple categorization of diversity (either diverse or not) revealed no significant differences between students’ political and civic learning opportunities and attitudes. This finding is particularly striking in contrast to other studies that demonstrate a lack of advanced curricular opportunities in segregated minority schools more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0002831211430352">Oakes, Gamoran, &amp; Page, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0002831211430352">Yun &amp; Moreno, 2006</xref>) as well as for civics education more specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0002831211430352">Kahne &amp; Middaugh, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0002831211430352">2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>The new schemes we proposed and tested here represent an important first attempt at defining new ways of thinking about diversity that more accurately reflect today’s schools. While our results are far from definitive, what we ultimately believe is the most important finding is that not all diverse schools are the same, a takeaway that belies the oft-used constructs of diversity that no longer fit the complexion of our country. Moreover, as our analysis demonstrated, if we had stopped at the first stage, we would have concluded inaccurately that variation in school racial context has no impact on teaching and learning for citizenship.</p>
<p>Rather, we find that racial/ethnic group composition has a significant impact on students’ beliefs about their opportunities to gain knowledge and skills related to citizenship. We find, in general, that students who attend schools with more diverse environments (e.g., three or four groups) are more likely to report opportunities to learn civic and political knowledge and skills. Additionally, students in these schools were also more likely to report that their teachers used pedagogical techniques that have been found to more effectively promote citizenship. The exception to this appears to be Black-White-Latino schools.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that these results are based on exploratory research, our work suggests that previous research in this area may only be partially correct. Working from the “conflict hypothesis,” previous research found that teachers in racially diverse classrooms avoided discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002831211430352">Campbell, 2007</xref>). Yet it appears from our findings that in the <italic>most</italic> diverse environments, faculty do not shy away from discussions. In these schools, the presence of at least three racial groups may actually ease tension or competition that exists in schools with only two major groups. Further, the presence of multiple, newer immigrant groups—namely Latinos and Asians—can alter the racial climate in ways that promote conversation rather than conflict.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the causal mechanism that explains this finding might be that these highly diverse environments with multiple groups (including several historically disadvantaged groups) push faculties and administrators to prioritize professional development or hiring of faculty skilled in teaching techniques that engage diverse groups of students. It appears, however, that there exists a threshold of diversity (e.g., number of groups) that must be reached before faculty and school administrators seek out such action. Certainly, further investigation into whether and why some diverse schools—seemingly those with the most groups—foster more learning opportunities is a key point for further research.</p>
<p>Unlike the investigation pertaining to the composition of school diversity, our investigation into the role that racial stability plays yielded no statistically significant differences. There are several possible explanations for this “non-finding,” some practical and some conceptual. The practical issues are related to data. First, like many central cities, the lack of White students fundamentally alters the overall character of the data. We had no segregated White schools in our sample, which nationally comprise a shrinking but still substantial share of schools. Likewise, by 2005–2006, at the time of the CCSR data collection, nearly 2,500 schools nationally that were segregated White schools a decade earlier had lost White students at a rate twice or greater than the overall student enrollment. Thus, these data may not reflect key changes in other areas of the United States.</p>
<p>Further, while the CCSR data are rich, they are still limited to the city of Chicago. While the city of Chicago, like most central cities, is facing demographic shifts, it is the inner-ring suburbs that are experiencing some of the highest rates of change. It is possible that if metropolitan-wide data existed, we would find significant differences between schools that are stable and those that are undergoing rapid change. Having a larger set of schools might also allow for exploring stability along with the number/identity of racial groups (e.g., using categories from Stage 2 along with measures of stability or change). Unfortunately, due to the nature of school governance and metropolitan fragmentation, no such data exist.</p>
<p>Additionally, our data are limited because they do not include student achievement scores or student-level socioeconomic status (beyond free/reduced lunch status), which may prove to be important variables as well. The relationships we observe may also be related to these variables. However, just as school type was correlated with our variables of interest, we believe that student socioeconomic status and student achievement would also be highly correlated. Future work with different data sources should explore this possibility and further add to our understanding. Although we included a number of control variables to try to minimize self-selection bias, other work should investigate these relationships in different districts using a variety of student assignment policies to help confirm or modify these findings.</p>
<p>Lastly, the timing of this work may not yet be quite right to detect significant differences for stability. As the 2010 census reported, the changes taking place are relatively recent. Given this, examining data from 2005, the year of our data, may not capture the shifts in demographics that have happened since then. It is possible that should these CCSR data be collected now, stability would be an important factor. Therefore, although we were not able to find differences in schools with different rates of student racial change in the current analysis, we believe that racial stability should continue to be explored, as it is likely that it will become an increasingly important factor for the ways in which schools develop citizens, as we continue to see rapid demographic shifts sweep the country.</p>
<p>Moreover, this analysis could actually be understating the relationship of school racial context and civic and political learning and attitudes. By controlling for a number of school-related factors (e.g., percentage of students receiving subsidized lunch), we are likely accounting for some of the differences that affect the lived reality of school segregation. Segregated minority schools, for example, often are located in segregated neighborhoods with fewer educational assets.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results from this investigation of Chicago data give new direction to research on school context. The findings of this study shed light on previous research and suggest the need to conceptualize more fully the term <italic>diverse</italic> as it pertains to school racial and ethnic composition. This analysis contributes to the growing body of literature suggesting the benefits of diverse schools and communities.</p>
<p>While lacking definitive findings, this work represents a significant departure from previous conceptualizations of school diversity and provides generative potential for the field. Future research should continue to investigate new definitions of diversity to more accurately reflect the differences in contemporary student enrollment. Additionally, as large-scale survey work grows and expands our understanding of where significant differences between school types occur, future research can begin to investigate the day-to-day practices in specific school types in order to understand the exact mechanisms resulting in the different engagement levels reported by students.</p>
<p>In addition to being an important theoretical issue, this work also has important policy implications. As racial and ethnic gaps in citizenship remain, it is important to understand how public schools—one of the few public institutions in which almost everyone is a part—are contributing to or alleviating these gaps. Schools have long played a key role in the development of future generations of citizens, and a greater understanding of how different contexts contribute to students’ understandings of and engagement in civic and political activities is essential for the design of more effective curriculum and learning opportunities around citizenship.</p>

<p>Correlations between the variables were checked. It should be noted that unlike the other school types, magnet schools were moderately correlated with some of the school racial composition variables. See Appendix S1 available in the online version of this journal. This is not surprising given the mission of magnet schools; the implications of this correlation for our exploratory work are detailed in the discussion. Because of this correlation, school type variables are not included in our final models presented here. Future extensions of this study should explore this relationship of racial stability and identity of groups in districts without magnet schools.</p>
