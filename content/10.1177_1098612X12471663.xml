<abstract>
<p>A 4-month-old female kitten presented with chronic lower urinary tract signs and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cystitis, and was diagnosed with urinary bladder malakoplakia based upon histopathology. The kitten was treated with a prolonged antibiotic course and the malakoplakia resolved. Malakoplakia is a chronic granulomatous reaction characterized by the formation of Michaelis–Gutman bodies within von Hansemann macrophages. It is well described in humans, but has never been documented in a living veterinary patient. This case report describes the first successful treatment of malakoplakia in veterinary medicine.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 16-week-old female domestic shorthair kitten, weighing 2.28 kg was referred to Southpaws Specialty Surgery for Animals for evaluation of recurrent cystitis and a suspected bladder mass. The kitten had had clinical signs of hematuria and stranguria since being acquired at 5 weeks of age and was presented to the referring veterinarian for suspected constipation and pollakiuria. Physical examination identified a suspected bladder mass and in-house urinalysis showed pyuria and hematuria. The kitten was prescribed amoxicillin/clavulanic acid at 16 mg/kg q12h (Noroclav; Norbrook) and meloxicam (Metacam; Boehringer Ingelheim) for 10 days without improvement. A urine culture via cystocentesis revealed &gt;100,000 colony forming units (cfu) of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> susceptible to cephalexin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, trimethoprim-sulfa and enrofloxacin. Serum biochemistry results showed minor changes or were normal for the cat’s age. A complete blood count was, essentially, normal. Apart from these clinical signs, she had remained healthy.</p>
<p>Four weeks later the kitten presented to Southpaws Specialty Surgery for persistent cystitis despite appropriate antibiotics. Upon clinical examination, the kitten was bright and alert. She was small for her age, but appropriately proportioned. Vital signs were within normal ranges. Her bladder was firm and semi-distended upon palpation. No other abnormalities were present. Abdominal ultrasound revealed pronounced, diffuse thickening of the bladder wall (up to 0.52 cm), most prominent within the trigone region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098612X12471663">Figure 1</xref>). No discrete bladder masses or other abnormalities were identified on abdominal ultrasound. Urinalysis via cystocentesis revealed a urine specific gravity of 1.046 and a pH of 6, with 2+ protein and an active sediment of &gt;1000 ×10<sup>6</sup>/l red blood cells and &gt;1000 ×10<sup>6</sup>/l white blood cells, but no ketones, glucose, bilirubin or bacteria were seen microscopically. A urine culture was not performed at this time, and the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was continued. Feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were negative. As the kitten was too small for cystoscopy to acquire mucosal biopsies and examine the lower urinary tract, an exploratory celiotomy and ovariohysterectomy was performed. The goal of surgery was to acquire full thickness biopsies to further characterize the bladder wall thickening, with the intention to direct therapy to the underlying cause and allow more accurate prognostication. At surgery, the bladder mucosa was grossly thickened with soft plaque-like proliferations covering the entire mucosal surface. Full-thickness bladder wall samples were acquired for histopathology and aerobic bacterial culture with sensitivity. The ureteral insertions into the trigone region were normal, as was the remainder of the abdomen. The kitten was discharged the following day on amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and buprenorphine (Temgesic; Rickitt-Benkiser) sublingually for analgesia.</p>

<p>Culture of the bladder wall grew <italic>E coli</italic> with the same sensitivity panel as the previous isolate so amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was continued pending the histopathology results. Histopathologic evaluation of full thickness bladder biopsies stained with hematoxylin and eosin was performed. The bladder mucosa was covered by a hyperplastic transitional epithelium. The submucosa was markedly infiltrated and expanded or effaced by a diffuse sheet of large histiocytic cells consistent with von Hansemann cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1098612X12471663">Figure 2</xref>), which had round, relatively uniform, central nuclei with small or insignificant nucleoli, a low mitotic rate and abundant cytoplasm containing numerous fine periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1098612X12471663">Figure 3</xref>). Irregularly distributed between, or occasionally within the cytoplasm of, these cells there were numerous basophilic, mineralized, targetoid concretions (calcospherites) 5–10 µm in diameter, with morphology typical of Michaelis–Gutman bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1098612X12471663">Figure 4</xref>). These were strongly positive for calcium with Von Kossa stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1098612X12471663">Figure 5</xref>). No microorganisms, particularly bacteria, or any significant inflammatory cells were identified in the bladder mucosa. These findings were diagnostic for urinary bladder malakoplakia. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on paraffin sections and some superficial bacteria were visualized. No invasive bacteria were seen despite a large number of autofluorescent inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1098612X12471663">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Hematuria, stranguria and pollakiuria persisted postoperatively and urine culture obtained via cystocentesis 12 days postoperatively revealed persistent growth of <italic>E coli</italic> (220,000 cfu), with the same sensitivities as before. Based upon the histological diagnosis of malakoplakia, the kitten was started on sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (TMS) (Bactrim; Roche) in addition to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Over the next 12 weeks, the kitten’s clinical signs gradually reduced and improvement was seen with the bladder wall thickening, although the trigone region remained thickened. Urine culture remained positive for growth of <italic>E coli</italic> with the same sensitivities. By 22 weeks post surgery, the kitten’s clinical signs had completely resolved and there were 2 consecutive negative urine cultures, 1 month apart. Urinalysis revealed resolution of pyuria and hematuria, and the bladder was smooth with normal thickness ultrasonographically; antibiotics were discontinued after the second negative culture. Repeat urine cultures were performed at 2, 5 and 8 months post discontinuation of the antibiotics and the results revealed no bacterial growth. The patient remains asymptomatic 12 months after discontinuation of the medications.</p>
<p>Malakoplakia is an unusual chronic granulomatous inflammatory response most commonly affecting the genitourinary system, particularly the bladder. This condition has been well recognized in human patients since it was first identified in 1901 by von Hansemann and later described by Michaelis and Gutmann in 1902.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098612X12471663">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098612X12471663">2</xref></sup> The term malakoplakia was coined by von Hansemann in 1903 and derived from the Greek words meaning malakos (soft) and plakos (plaque) to describe the soft, yellow–brown mucosal plaques associated with the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098612X12471663">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098612X12471663">2</xref></sup> There have been numerous cases (&gt;400) in the human literature involving not only the bladder and kidneys, but the colon, prostate, lungs, tongue, skin and lymph nodes, with clinical signs varying according to the organ affected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098612X12471663">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098612X12471663"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098612X12471663"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098612X12471663"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098612X12471663">6</xref></sup> Age of onset varies from juveniles to the middle-aged, with bladder lesions appearing to be more common in females.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098612X12471663">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098612X12471663">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098612X12471663">6</xref></sup> Malakoplakia is confirmed by the presence of pathognonomic microscopic mineralized target or ‘owl-eye’ cytoplasmic basophilic inclusions (calcospherites), known as Michaelis–Gutmann bodies (MG bodies) within large von Hansemann macrophages, which have abundant finely granular eosinophilic PAS-positive cytoplasm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098612X12471663">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098612X12471663">7</xref></sup> The composition of MG bodies appears to be calcium, mucopolysaccharide and lipid, which probably represents calcification of undigested bacteria due to ineffective phagocytosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098612X12471663">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098612X12471663">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098612X12471663"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098612X12471663"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098612X12471663">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The veterinary literature contains only pathological descriptions of the disease: three describing naturally-occurring disease, of which two involve incidental post mortem findings in pigs describing malakoplakia of the lymph nodes, and one with systemic involvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098612X12471663">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098612X12471663">11</xref></sup> Most recently, Bayley et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098612X12471663">12</xref></sup> described a kitten with a similar presentation to the one described herein. The kitten presented initially for stranguria and tenesmus which failed to respond to antibiotic therapy; the kitten was euthanased 3 weeks later. Malakoplakia of the bladder was identified at post-mortem examination. The present report provides valuable information on the management of patients with such a condition as malakoplakia.</p>
<p>The exact pathogenesis of malakoplakia remains obscure, but most agree that bacteria play a significant role in the development of the disease, but whether they act as primary or secondary agents is still debatable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098612X12471663">13</xref></sup> The majority of cases involving the urinary tract occur with coliform cystitis with or without concurrent immune suppression, and successful treatment of the infection generally results in resolution of the malakoplakia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098612X12471663">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098612X12471663">5</xref></sup> A number of studies have identified <italic>E coli</italic> or <italic>E coli</italic> antigen within the MG bodies, from urine if the urinary system is involved, or from purulent material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098612X12471663">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098612X12471663">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098612X12471663">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098612X12471663"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098612X12471663">16</xref></sup> Similar to the present case report, other studies have not been able to identify bacteria by light microscopy, electron microscopy or polymerase chain reaction techniques, but prior antibiotic therapy may have influenced these results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098612X12471663">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098612X12471663"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098612X12471663"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098612X12471663">12</xref></sup> FISH performed on the bladder wall in the present study and failed to reveal any bacteria within macrophages. This may have been a result of sparse distribution of these intracellular organisms. Others postulate that malakoplakia is due to an inherent abnormal monocyte response or abnormal immunological state affecting intracellular killing of bacteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098612X12471663">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098612X12471663">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098612X12471663">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098612X12471663">17</xref></sup> One study demonstrated that von Hansemann macrophages contained less cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which is necessary for the normal function of microtubules and phagolysosomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098612X12471663">17</xref></sup> Another hypothesis is that the bacteria may contribute to the ineffective macrophage function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098612X12471663">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Malakoplakia bears some resemblance to granulomatous colitis in Boxers and leptomeninigitis in Beagles, which are also associated with <italic>E coli</italic> and PAS-positive macrophages. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> antigen has been identified within the characteristic macrophages in these diseases, but no MG bodies have been found.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098612X12471663">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098612X12471663">18</xref></sup> Successful treatment of Boxer colitis can be achieved in most cases with fluoroquinolone antibiotics, further supporting the causal involvement of <italic>E coli</italic> in the pathogenesis of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098612X12471663">19</xref></sup> It is unknown whether the individual bacterium promotes the granulomatous reaction or the individual exhibits an abnormal response to the bacteria; the pathogenesis is likely a combination of these factors.</p>
<p>Prolonged antimicrobial therapy is the mainstay of treatment for malakoplakia. Antibiotics with the ability to penetrate macrophages, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and fluoroquinolones, appear to have the most success, and treatment is less successful with beta-lactams, which do not penetrate the cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098612X12471663">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098612X12471663">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098612X12471663">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098612X12471663">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098612X12471663">20</xref></sup> Our kitten was treated initially for 4–6 weeks without improvement, with the most appropriate antibiotics based upon culture and sensitivity testing. Clinical improvement only occurred once treatment with TMS had started. Instillation of neosporin into the bladder and cholinergic agents, such as bethanechol, that increase the cyclic-GMP levels within macrophages have been used in humans with variable success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098612X12471663">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098612X12471663">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098612X12471663">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098612X12471663">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098612X12471663">21</xref></sup> As the disease has been associated with immune suppression, discontinuation of immune suppressant drugs is generally recommended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098612X12471663">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098612X12471663">6</xref></sup> Survival depends upon the organs affected and the extent of the lesion as there can be multiple organ involvement and subsequent organ failure (ie, hydronephrosis due to renal obstruction).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098612X12471663">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098612X12471663"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098612X12471663">5</xref></sup> Plaques within the bladder appear to be the most amenable to treatment, but other cases require a multimodal therapeutic approach, including systemic antibiotics and, potentially, surgery to remove large masses or re-routing of ureters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098612X12471663">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098612X12471663"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098612X12471663">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098612X12471663">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098612X12471663">14</xref></sup></p>
