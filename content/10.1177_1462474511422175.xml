<sec id="sec1-1462474511422175"><title>Katherine Beckett and Steve Herbert, <italic>Banished: The New Social Control in Urban America</italic>, Oxford University Press: New York, 2010; 216 pp. 13:9780195395174</title>
<p>In <italic>Banished: The New Social Control in Urban America</italic>, Katherine Beckett and Steve Herbert examine a number of legal tools used to exclude ‘disorderly’ people from public or quasi-public spaces. Their main argument is that banishment is a counterproductive, short sighted policy trend with serious consequences. The authors skilfully demonstrate that legal forms of exclusion, which have their roots in earlier vagrancy and pro-civility laws, are nothing more than attempts at moral regulation aimed at segregating and punishing those who are not considered citizens. More specifically, banishment targets people who are constructed as ‘visible disorder’: minorities; the mentally ill; and the homeless. Beckett and Herbert argue that several factors have contributed to an increase in visible disorder including deinstitutionalization, gentrification, and a general withdrawal in public housing and other social supports. According to the authors, visible disorder is undesirable and therefore subject to legal regulation because disorder compromises the moral order, hinders consumerism, and leads to increases in serious crime. The authors successfully show how the new tools of banishment are hybridized, innovative, and designed to circumvent court rulings that had previously nullified vagrancy laws.</p>
<p>As this book demonstrates, a typical form of banishment might involve a poor, racialized, mentally ill, and/or homeless person, who is apprehended by a law enforcement officer or a private security guard and then barred from a specific space (e.g. a park or business) through an exclusion order. Failing to respect trespassing admonishments can result in further arrest, court dates, and jail time. Another common form of banishment begins in court, when a drug user or sex worker, for example, is identified as needing to be kept away from temptation. In such cases, a judge can administer SODA (Stay Out of Drug Areas) or SOAP (Stay Out of Prostitution Areas) ordinances and defendants are offered lighter sentences in exchange for promising to stay out of selected high risk ‘zones’. Once again, failing to respect ordinances can (and often does) have serious legal consequences. By detailing exactly how the legal tools of banishment are used to limit the movement of targeted individuals in cases such as these, the authors make the compelling argument that old vagrancy laws have simply been redesigned.</p>
<p>Beckett and Herbert convincingly argue that although banishment tools are marketed as diversion tools, they are highly punitive. Banishment criminalizes poverty, attacks people’s citizenship status, increases their vulnerability to victimization, and limits their ability to move freely and access ‘stabilizing resources’ (p. 106). Targeted individuals often return to public parks or off-limit neighbourhoods to access services or see friends and family. Because it often generates arrests, the macro-level consequences of this exclusionary trend include net-widening and increased pressure on the criminal justice system. Banishment gives more power to police officers who are called upon to remove undesirable individuals from the public eye, but police officers are not equipped to ‘solve’ issues of poverty, addiction, and mental health; all they can do is promote public security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1462474511422175">Huey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1462474511422175">Kleinig, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1462474511422175">Plotkin and Narr, 1997</xref>). Thus, the succession of legal exclusion, failure to comply, and increasingly punitive interventions often leads individuals through the so-called revolving doors of the justice system.</p>
<p><italic>Banished</italic> calls attention to the fact that exclusionary tactics draw lines between the rich and the poor, and thus have serious negative consequences for targeted individuals. The fifth chapter, which includes narratives of people who have been banished, is especially important because it illustrates the micro-level effects of exclusionary policies. This qualitative depiction humanizes this issue and supports the argument that punitive tactics are not only counter-productive but also unjustly vindictive. Beckett and Herbert invoke Gresham <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1462474511422175">Sykes’ (1958)</xref> <italic>The Society of Captives</italic> and compare the pains of banishment to the pains of imprisonment in terms of practical, emotional, and symbolic harm. The authors painstakingly dissect banishment tools and argue that these types of policies are a terrible idea with multiple negative consequences. The power of this book comes in part from the authors’ unwavering insistence that this form of social exclusion needs to stop.</p>
<p>The type of spatial and geographical exclusion explored in <italic>Banished</italic> is just one of the many ways that ‘failed citizens’ are segregated and controlled. Other forms of contemporary banishment include urban design, security forces, privatization, and CCTV surveillance. In short, this book is a welcome addition to the growing literature on the regulation of the urban poor, both generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1462474511422175">Bourgois and Schonberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1462474511422175">Wacquant, 2009</xref>) and in relation to public space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1462474511422175">Bickford, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1462474511422175">Davis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1462474511422175">Feldman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1462474511422175">Hermer and Mosher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1462474511422175">Huey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1462474511422175">Smith, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1462474511422175">Valverde and Ranasinghe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1462474511422175">Wachholz, 2005</xref>). Readers interested in issues of marginality, homelessness, urban geography, citizenship, and social control will appreciate the detailed examination of legal banishment offered by Beckett and Herbert in this book, while those concerned more generally with issues of social inequality will also recognize its value.</p>
