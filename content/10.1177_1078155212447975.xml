<abstract>
<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Treatment with rituximab can be associated with hepatitis B reactivation leading to fulminant hepatitis and sometimes fatal hepatitis. The manufacturer has recommended screening the high-risk patients and monitoring hepatitis B virus carriers during and several months after the therapy. Prophylaxis with lamivudine has been recommended to prevent reactivation in hepatitis B virus carriers receiving rituximab. An institutional guideline was developed and implemented. This study evaluated the adherence to these clinical guidelines of hepatitis B screening in patients receiving rituximab-based treatment, the use of lamivudine prophylaxis, and the prevalence of positive hepatitis B virus surface antigen in this patient population in southeast Michigan.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective chart review of patients begun on rituximab therapy from January 2009 through June 2010 was conducted.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Two hundred and eighty patients who received rituximab were identified. Approximately 70% of patients had hepatitis B virus surface antigen screening test prior to rituximab therapy. Antibody to hepatitis B virus core antigen was detected in 11.1% of patients, although the hepatitis B virus surface antigen positive rate was only 0.6%. One patient had hepatitis B virus reactivation despite lamivudine prophylaxis, but fully recovered after antiviral therapy was changed to tenofovir.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The prevalence of hepatitis B virus surface antigen positivity is low in this study; however, antibody to hepatitis B virus core antigen positivity is high. Education to clinicians is warranted to increase awareness and further improve adherence to the clinical guidelines.</p>

<p>Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication with an increase in serum HBV DNA has been reported in 20–50% of hepatitis B carriers undergoing immunosuppressive or cancer chemotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212447975">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212447975">2</xref></sup> Among the hematologic malignancies, lymphoma patients who are HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) positive are noted to have a higher risk of HBV reactivation after chemotherapy than other cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212447975">3</xref></sup> This may be related to the relatively more immunosuppressive chemotherapeutic drugs used for lymphoma and also possibly the intrinsic immunosuppressive effect of lymphoma per se.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212447975">4</xref></sup> Rituximab is a chimeric murine human monoclonal antibody targeting the CD20+ antigen on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes. Circulating CD20+ B cells are depleted within the first three doses and the depletion can be sustained for up to 6–9 months post treatment in 83% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212447975">5</xref></sup> B-cell recovery begins at approximately 6 months and median B-cell levels return to normal by 12 months following completion of treatment. In October 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned healthcare professionals via letter, of postmarketing clinical safety reports of HBV reactivation, along with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, in some patients with hematologic malignancies receiving rituximab therapy. Several retrospective and prospective studies reported a reduced incidence of HBV reactivation using prophylactic lamivudine in cancer patients receiving rituximab- or fludarabine-based chemotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212447975">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212447975"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212447975"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212447975"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155212447975">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>At our institution, we observed a severe case of HBV reactivation in an Asian male patient with Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia, 12 months after completing rituximab in combination with fludarabine chemotherapy. This case, in conjunction with the literature reports had prompted an ad hoc group consisting of hematology, infectious diseases, and pharmacy to develop an institutional guideline in 2008 on urgent basis as there were no standard guidelines available at that time. Our institutional guideline intended to provide a standard to screen HBV serology (HBsAg, antibody to HBV core antigen (HBcAb), and antibody to HBsAg (HBsAb)) in patients receiving rituximab and to utilize lamivudine prophylaxis in patients with positive HBsAg. The aims of this retrospective study were to evaluate adherence to this clinical guideline of hepatitis B screening in patients receiving rituximab-based treatment, the use of lamivudine prophylaxis, and to estimate the prevalence of positive HBsAg in this patient population from the southeast Michigan area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1078155212447975" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>The guidelines were reviewed and approved by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee in November 2008 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078155212447975">Table 1</xref>) and implemented throughout the infusion center at our institution in January 2009. In order to remind prescribers this new guideline, a statement which recommended HBV screening tests with antiviral prophylaxis for positive HBsAg was added to the rituximab chemotherapy order form which is utilized for more than 95% of rituximab orders received in the infusion center. Our infusion center not only serves cancer patients, but also provides rituximab and cyclophosphamide to some non-cancer patients. A list of patients who received rituximab from January 2009 through June 2010 was generated from the pharmacy database. Patients with pregnancy or age &lt;18 years were excluded from the study. A retrospective medical record review was conducted. Data collection included age, gender, race, indication for rituximab therapy, screening test of hepatitis B serology, chemotherapy regimen, and antiviral prophylaxis use in HBsAg-positive patients. The study was approved by the Human Investigation Committee. SPSS v19.0 (SPSS Incorporated, Chicago, IL) statistical software was used to analyze the data and descriptive statistics.

<p>A total of 280 patients who received rituximab therapy from January 2009 through June 2010 were identified. The mean age was 54.5 years; 54.6% were male. A total of 235 patients receiving rituximab had cancer, with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) as the main indication. Non-malignancy indications include idiopathic/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and systemic lupus erythematous (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078155212447975">Table 2</xref>). HBV serologic screening testing was not performed in a uniform fashion, with HBsAg tested in 195 patients and HBsAg + HBcAb tested in 162 patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1078155212447975">Table 3</xref>). The HBV screening test was not performed in 20% of patients prior to the initiation of rituximab therapy and none of them developed hepatitis B reactivation during the study period. HBsAb was tested in 217 patients, and 67 patients were positive (30.9%) which indicates immunity due to vaccination or previous infection. Seventeen patients were HBsAg−/HBcAb+ and one cancer patient was HBsAg+/HBcAb+; nine of these 18 patients had a documented past history of HBV infection. Nine patients were on antiviral prophylaxis (either lamivudine or tenofovir) and followed closely by either gastroenterologists or infectious diseases specialists. None of the 17 HBsAg−/HBcAb−patients developed hepatitis reactivation during the study time frame. The only patient with positive HBsAg/HBcAb developed HBV reactivation while on antiviral prophylaxis. This was a Middle Eastern male patient with past medical history of chronic hepatitis B, herpes zoster reactivation, and postherpetic neuralgia prior to the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in 2009. The HBV screen test prior to chemotherapy (fludarabine + cyclophosphamide + rituximab) showed HBcAb+, HBsAg+, HBV polymerase chain reaction (PCR)−. Hepatitis C virus PCR was also negative. Lamivudine prophylaxis was initiated before and continued after the five cycles of chemotherapy which was completed in April 2010. The patient achieved a suboptimal response to chemotherapy and was lost to follow-up until October 2010 when he developed rapid progression of his CLL which manifested as cytopenia and tumor lysis syndrome. His condition was further complicated by congestive heart failure with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and hepatitis B reactivation which manifested as hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin: 28.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin: 21.8 mg/dL), elevated hepatic transaminase (alanine aminotransferase 777 units/L, AST 1121 units/L), and HBV DNA PCR (2180 IU/mL). The patient’s clinical status and liver function tests returned to normal 1 month after antiviral therapy was changed to tenofovir 300 mg daily.

<sec id="sec4-1078155212447975" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Rituximab is prescribed in a wide variety of both hematological and non-hematological disorders. FDA approved indications include NHL, CLL, rheumatoid arthritis in combination with methotrexate, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and microscopic polyangiitis in adult patients in combination with glucocorticoids. Common off-label uses include treatment of antibody mediated diseases such as acquired factor VIII deficiency disease, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, systemic lupus erythematous, and idiopathic/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Rituximab-associated hepatitis B reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, sometimes fatal, is listed under the warnings and precautions in the manufacturer’s package insert and thus it is recommended to screen high-risk patients and monitor HBV carriers during and several months after therapy. Discontinuation of rituximab is recommended if HBV reactivation occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212447975">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) issued a provisional clinical opinion in agreement with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention stating that physicians may consider screening those patients at heightened risk for chronic HBV infection, or if highly immunosuppressive therapy is planned.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155212447975">11</xref></sup> Highly immunosuppressive treatment includes, but is not limited to, hematopoietic cell transplantation and regimens including rituximab. Screening based on a high risk of prior HBV exposure or risk of reactivation due to planned therapeutic regimens should include testing for HBsAg as a serologic marker for HBV infection. In some populations, testing for HBcAb should also be considered. However, the 2009 American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) practice guidelines recommended routine HBsAg and HBcAb testing should be performed in patients who are at high risk of HBV infection, prior to initiation of chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212447975">2</xref></sup> The difference in recommend screening tests by these two organizations may explain the discrepancy of our study results–checking HBsAg or HBcAb solely, or checking both.</p>
<p>The adherence to our institutional guidelines was about 70%, based on HBsAg screening test prior to rituximab therapy. The rates of HBsAg and HBcAb positivity were 0.6% and 11.1%, respectively. These results are similar to data from several presentations at the recent ASCO meeting in 2010. A prospective quality assurance study was conducted at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155212447975">12</xref></sup> The screening consisted of serologies for HBsAg and HBcAb. If either test was positive, HBV PCR was measured. A total of 3343 patients were screened for HBV prior to the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy (chemotherapy, antibody therapy, and high-dose dexamethasone). They reported a prevalence of 1.3% for HBsAg and 9% for HBcAb. A retrospective analysis from the MD Anderson Cancer Center noted that 13% of 12,340 patients receiving chemotherapy had HBV screening with 1% patients positive for HBsAg and 8% positive for HBcAb.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078155212447975">13</xref></sup> Another study conducted in Australia reported 1% positivity for HBsAg and 14.9% positivity for HBcAb in 206 solid tumor patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155212447975">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several reports have shown that lamivudine prophylaxis reduces the incidence and severity of hepatitis B in HBV carriers undergoing chemotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212447975">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155212447975">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078155212447975">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078155212447975"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078155212447975"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078155212447975"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078155212447975">18</xref></sup> Loomba et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078155212447975">17</xref></sup> conducted a systematic review of 14 studies (275 patients in the preventive lamivudine group and 475 control participants) for the primary end point of HBV reactivation. They reported that lamivudine significantly reduced the risk for both HBV reactivation and HBV-related hepatitis by 79% or more. In addition, preventive lamivudine may reduce the risk for HBV-related hepatic failure and death in patients who test positive for HBsAg and receive chemotherapy. Lamivudine was well tolerated, and no adverse effects were noted. The AASLD practice guidelines recommend that lamivudine (grade I recommendation) or telbivudine (grade III recommendation) be used if the anticipated duration of immunosuppressive or cytotoxic therapy is ≤12 months and baseline serum HBV DNA is not detectable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212447975">2</xref></sup> Tenofovir or entecavir is preferred if longer duration of treatment (&gt;12 months) is anticipated due to a higher risk of resistance to lamivudine. The antiviral prophylaxis should be started before chemotherapy and continued for at least 6 months following completion of all treatment for patients who are at high risk because of HBsAg seropositivity and low HBV DNA &lt;2000 IU/mL. Our patient on lamivudine prophylaxis developed HBV reactivation 5 months after completion of chemotherapy which is close to the median time from last rituximab dose to HBV reactivation (3 months) from the FDA analysis report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078155212447975">19</xref></sup> Possible explanations for why our patient developed HBV reactivation while on antiviral therapy include medication non-compliance and/or potential development of resistance to lamivudine. Unfortunately, the testing to detect the lamivudine-selective mutant strain (the tyrosine–methionine–aspartate–aspartate, YMDD mutation) was not performed in this patient. Upon changing antiviral therapy to tenofovir, resolution of hepatitis B reactivation and normal liver function tests resulted.</p>
<p>Although the risk for HBV reactivation in patients with HBsAg−/HBcAb+ is low, several reports suggest that rituximab associated HBV reactivation can occur in up to 8.9% of such patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078155212447975">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078155212447975"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078155212447975">22</xref></sup> However, at present, there are no clear recommendations for this population from major organizations. In this retrospective study, we are unable to draw a conclusion about management of HBcAb+ patients since no HBV reactivation was observed and 50% of these 17 patients with HBsAg−/HBcAb+ received antiviral prophylaxis. A prospective study to investigate the role of antiviral prophylaxis is needed to address this issue. In the interim, close monitoring of liver function tests and HBV-related markers should be considered in this population receiving rituximab therapy.</p>
<p>The result of HBV screening prior to rituximab therapy in our hospital was suboptimal. The adherence to the institutional guidelines was higher in the cancer patient group which may indicate greater awareness among the hematologists. Physicians prescribing rituximab for non-cancer treatment (such as neurologist and rheumatologist) may not be fully aware of this serious complication and may use fewer doses of rituximab which may not prompt them to check HBV screening. In view of this result, better education (such as in-services, newsletters, etc.) for all health care professionals is urgently needed. With the recent implementation of computerized physician order entry at our hospital, the HBV screening test can be built as a part of standard of care for cancer patients prior to rituximab-based chemotherapy which may enhance the adherence to this guideline. In the interim, before accepting rituximab order, pharmacists are advised to check the status of HBV tests and inform physicians if such tests are not done. However, this will require adequate staffing and training to perform the task. Furthermore, in patients with negative HBsAb test (69.1% in this study), hepatitis B vaccination should be considered prior to immunosuppressive therapy if possible.</p>
<p>There are several limitations of this study. HBV reactivation cases may be under-reported due to the retrospective nature of this study design, and some such patients may have been admitted or followed at other hospitals. Patients who transferred their medical care from other hospitals/clinics may have had a HBV screening test performed but the results were not available in our electronic medical records. The information about total number of doses or duration of rituximab administered to each patient during this study time frame could not be collected completely due to several reasons: switching chemotherapy regimen, discontinuing chemotherapy upon remission and then restarting chemotherapy for recurrent malignancy, and initiating or finishing chemotherapy at other facilities.</p>

<p>The use of rituximab is increasing with expanding new indications, such as maintenance therapy for follicular lymphoma. HBV reactivation and clinical hepatitis associated with rituximab therapy can increase the morbidity and mortality. Screening for HBV prior to rituximab therapy and the use of antiviral prophylaxis are important to reduce the risk of HBV reactivation and its complications in patients who test positive for HBsAg. Although the prevalence of HBsAg was low in our study, this would likely vary in different geographic regions. However, patients with isolated positive HBcAb also are at high risk for HBV reactivation and should be monitored closely for serum hepatic transaminase levels and HBV DNA levels during and after rituximab therapy, especially in patients with hematological malignancies and in those undergoing stem cell transplantations. Patients with non-cancer disorders receiving rituximab therapy should also be under surveillance for hepatitis B. Furthermore, the screening test should consist of HBsAg, HBsAb, and HBcAb. HBV immunization is recommended for patients with negative results of HBsAg, HBsAb, and HBcAb prior to rituximab therapy.</p>
