<abstract>
<p>The purpose of the present study was twofold: (a) to examine the extent to which Chinese dyslexic children experience deficits in phonological and orthographic processing skills and (b) to examine if Chinese dyslexia is associated with deficits in Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, and Successive (PASS) processing. A total of 27 Grade 4 children with dyslexia (DYS), 27 Grade 4 chronological age (CA) controls, and 27 Grade 2 reading age (RA) controls were tested on measures of phonological awareness, rapid naming, phonological memory, PASS, reading accuracy, and reading fluency. The results indicated that the DYS group performed significantly poorer than the CA and RA groups on both measures of phonological awareness and on a measure of orthographic processing but comparably to the RA group on a measure of rapid naming and both measures of phonological memory. In regard to the PASS processing skills, the DYS group performed worse than the CA controls on Successive and Simultaneous processing but comparably to the RA group on all PASS processing skills. Implications of these findings for early identification and intervention of reading difficulties are discussed.</p>

<p>Phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming (RAN) speed have been known to be associated with reading for some years now, and this association has gained importance in understanding dyslexia across languages (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411402693">Ho &amp; Bryant, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219411402693">Ho, Chan, Chung, Lee, &amp; Tsang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022219411402693">Kirby, Parrila, &amp; Pfeiffer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022219411402693">Manis, Doi, &amp; Bhadha, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022219411402693">Wolf &amp; Bowers, 1999</xref>). Researchers, however, have also acknowledged that phonological awareness and RAN are not the only cognitive factors that define dyslexia and have suggested that a comprehensive examination of dyslexia requires the consideration of both proximal (e.g., phonological awareness, RAN) and distal cognitive factors (e.g., working memory, temporal processing; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022219411402693">Boets, Wouters, van Wieringen, &amp; Ghesquière, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219411402693">Chung, Ho, Chan, Tsang, &amp; Lee, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022219411402693">Share &amp; Stanovich, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022219411402693">Swanson, Saez, Gerber, &amp; Lefstead, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Low IQ had been considered for a long time to be an explanation of reading difficulties, but this view is much less favored now as poor readers are found at different IQ levels (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022219411402693">Jiménez, Siegel, O’Shanahan, &amp; Ford, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022219411402693">Siegel, 1989</xref>). Although IQ may be irrelevant to the definition of reading difficulties, cognitive processing skills, such as Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, and Successive (PASS) processing, have been found to be relevant in understanding reading disabilities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022219411402693">Das, Mensink, &amp; Mishra, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411402693">Das, Naglieri, &amp; Kirby, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022219411402693">Naglieri &amp; Reardon, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022219411402693">Naglieri and Reardon (1993)</xref>, for example, concluded that traditional IQ is irrelevant to reading disabilities—intelligence is not. Because cognitive processes are more useful than IQ in understanding normal reading acquisition and, especially, reading difficulties, we should look beyond phonological processing and consider the fundamental cognitive processing that may define dyslexia. Thus, the present study aimed to examine (a) the extent to which Chinese dyslexic children experience deficits in phonological and orthographic processing skills and (b) if Chinese dyslexia is associated with deficits in PASS processing skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411402693">Das, Naglieri, et al., 1994</xref>). In the rest of the Introduction we briefly review the literature on phonological processing, orthographic processing, and developmental dyslexia in Chinese, then we review the PASS processes and their possible connection to dyslexia in Chinese, and finally we present our study.</p>

<title>Phonological Processing and Developmental Dyslexia in Chinese</title>
<p>Three different aspects of phonological processing— phonological awareness, phonological memory, and RAN—have been shown to predict reading acquisition in both alphabetic (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022219411402693">de Jong &amp; van der Leij, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022219411402693">Georgiou, Parrila, &amp; Papadopoulos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022219411402693">Schatschneider, Carlson, Francis, Foorman, &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>) and nonalphabetic orthographies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411402693">Ho &amp; Bryant, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022219411402693">McBride-Chang &amp; Ho, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022219411402693">McBride-Chang &amp; Kail, 2002</xref>). The studies that have examined the role of phonological processing skills in dyslexia in Chinese have provided inconsistent findings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022219411402693">Chan, Ho, Tsang, Lee, &amp; Chung, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022219411402693">Chung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411402693">Ho, Chan, Tsang, &amp; Lee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022219411402693">Ho &amp; Lai, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411402693">Ho, Law, &amp; Ng, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022219411402693">Shu, McBride-Chang, Wu, &amp; Liu, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411402693">Ho, Law, et al. (2000)</xref>, for example, showed that dyslexic children (mean age = 105.7 months) performed significantly worse than the chronological age (CA) controls on onset detection and rhyme detection and also worse than a group of reading age (RA) controls (mean age = 91.0 months) on rhyme detection. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411402693">Ho et al. (2002)</xref> demonstrated that the group of children with dyslexia (DYS) performed equally well as the other two groups on rhyme detection and equally well as the CA group on sound categorization.</p>
<p>Similar controversial findings have been reported for rapid naming and phonological memory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022219411402693">Ho and Lai (1999)</xref> examined the performance of 20 DYS children (mean age = 105 months), 20 CA children (mean age = 105.5 months), and 20 RA children (mean age = 92.2 months) on Color and Digit Naming, Digit Span, and serial recall of word and nonwords. The results indicated that the DYS group performed significantly worse than the CA group, but equally well as the RA group, on color and digit naming speed. Moreover, the DYS group performed significantly worse than both the RA and the CA groups on all phonological memory tasks. In contrast to Ho and Lai’s findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411402693">Ho et al. (2002)</xref> found that there were no significant differences between the DYS and the RA groups on the phonological memory tasks.</p>
<p>For the purpose of the present study we have included both an alphanumeric (Digits) and a nonalphanumeric (Colors) RAN task. This was done to examine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022219411402693">Ding, Richman, Yang, and Guo’s (2010)</xref> argument that because of the nature of the Chinese orthography, nonalphanumeric RAN tasks are better predictors of reading than alphanumeric RAN tasks. If this is correct, we should find stronger differences between dyslexics and controls in RAN Colors than in RAN Digits. In addition, we have included two measures of phonological memory (Digit Span and Character Repetition) to examine if differences between dyslexics and controls are influenced by the type of stimuli involved in the memory tasks.</p>

<sec id="section2-0022219411402693">
<title>Orthographic Processing and Developmental Dyslexia in Chinese</title>
<p>Studies conducted by Ho and her colleagues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022219411402693">Ho, Chan, Lee, Tsang, &amp; Luan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411402693">Ho et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022219411402693">2007</xref>) have generally found that Chinese dyslexic children experience deficits in orthographic processing. In the context of Chinese, orthographic processing includes the knowledge of character structure and radical awareness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022219411402693">Chan &amp; Nunes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022219411402693">Ku &amp; Anderson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022219411402693">Yeh &amp; Li, 2002</xref>). A poor or not fully formed understanding of internal orthographic structure may impede and delay character recognition and make reading a laborious task. Despite the general agreement that dyslexic children experience orthographic processing difficulties, it is notable that none of the existing studies has found that the dyslexics performed poorer than their RA matched controls on orthographic processing. In addition, the percentage of dyslexic children who experience difficulties in orthographic processing appears to vary considerably from study to study. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411402693">Ho et al. (2002)</xref> estimated this number to be 38.9%. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022219411402693">Liu, Liu, and Zhang (2006)</xref> estimated this number to be 10%. Thus, more research is warranted to examine the prevalence of orthographic processing difficulties among Chinese dyslexic children.</p>
<p>An interesting question that has not been answered yet is whether the observed deficits in orthographic processing are a byproduct of deficits in rapid naming. In other words, it remains to be determined if deficits in orthographic processing would survive after controlling for the effects of rapid naming. Bowers and her colleagues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022219411402693">Bowers, Sunseth, &amp; Golden, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022219411402693">Bowers &amp; Wolf, 1993</xref>) proposed that rapid naming deficits are directly related to variation in orthographic skill, such that deficits in RAN may underlie deficits in orthographic processing. If letter identification proceeds too slowly, letter representations in words will not be activated quickly enough to induce sensitivity to commonly occurring orthographic patterns. Evidence from studies with unselected samples of Chinese children suggests that there is a close relationship between rapid naming and orthographic processing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022219411402693">Liao, Georgiou, &amp; Parrila, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022219411402693">McBride-Chang &amp; Zhong, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, it is not yet clear if rapid naming is tapping into processes involved in lexical orthographic processing or sublexical orthographic processing. In this study we measured orthographic processing both at a lexical (Lexical Decision) and a sublexical (Left–Right Reversal) level. Lexical orthographic processing is defined as knowledge of the unique array of letters that define printed words (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022219411402693">Olson, Forsberg, Wise, &amp; Rack, 1994</xref>). General orthographic knowledge, in turn, is defined as the awareness of such general attributes of the writing system as sequential dependencies and letter position frequencies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022219411402693">Vellutino, Scanlon, &amp; Tanzman, 1994</xref>). If rapid naming is involved in lexical orthographic processing, then a stronger effect of rapid naming should be observed when Lexical Decision is the dependent variable than when Left–Right Reversal is the dependent variable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0022219411402693">
<title>PASS Processing Skills and Dyslexia</title>
<p>Several researchers have argued that beyond the effects of phonological and orthographic processing, more fundamental, modality-unspecific cognitive processing skills could also play a role in reading disabilities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219411402693">Das, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022219411402693">Klein, 2002</xref>). The effect of these cognitive processing skills is assumed to be indirect through the effects of the linguistic skills, such as phonological awareness and orthographic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411402693">Das, Naglieri, et al., 1994</xref>). In the context of this study, the distal cognitive processes were operationalized in terms of the PASS processing skills (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022219411402693">Das, Naglieri, et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219411402693">Kirby &amp; Williams, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022219411402693">Naglieri &amp; Das, 1988</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411402693">Luria (1966)</xref>, the PASS theory proposes that cognition is organized in three systems. The first is the Planning system, which is the executive control system responsible for controlling and organizing behavior, selecting or constructing strategies, and monitoring performance. The second is the Attention system, which is responsible for maintaining arousal levels and alertness and for ensuring focus on appropriate stimuli. The final system is the information processing system, which employs Simultaneous and Successive processing to encode, transform, and retain information. In Simultaneous processing, the relationship between items and their integration into whole units of information is what is coded. In Successive processing, information is coded so that the only links between items are sequential in nature.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022219411402693">Kirby and Williams (1991)</xref> theorized that Simultaneous processing is associated with surveying all the elements of a word and acquiring the sound and letter patterns in a rather hierarchical manner. It is also obviously required for blending the sounds in word reading. Successive processing, on the other hand, is associated with a sequential decoding of sounds in words or making one-to-one correspondences between letters and sounds. One of the primary characteristics of children at risk for reading difficulties or with word decoding problems is poor Successive processing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411402693">Das, Janzen, &amp; Georgiou, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411402693">Das, Mishra, &amp; Kirby, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022219411402693">Hayward, Das, &amp; Janzen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411402693">Papadopoulos, Charalambous, Kanari, &amp; Loizou, 2004</xref>). In spite of the evidence linking PASS processes to reading disabilities in alphabetic languages (i.e., English, Greek, and Spanish), to our knowledge no similar studies have been conducted in nonalphabetic languages (i.e., Chinese).</p>
<p>The natural question would then be how Successive and Simultaneous processing skills may be associated with dyslexia in Chinese. Successive processing is essentially a measure of temporal sequences (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022219411402693">Das, Kirby, &amp; Jarman, 1975</xref>), broadly a function of the fronto-temporal region of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022219411402693">Luria, 1966</xref>). Given the fact that Chinese dyslexics experience difficulties in temporal processing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022219411402693">Chung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022219411402693">Meng et al., 2005</xref>), a weakness in Successive processing could be expected as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022219411402693">Meng et al. (2005)</xref>, for example, demonstrated that Chinese dyslexic children had deficits in temporal processing as well as in linguistic processing. Successive processing tasks include both (see below in the method section).</p>
<p>Much has also been written about the spatial-visual feature of Chinese characters. Visual tasks have been included in test batteries, and differences between dyslexics and average readers have been examined (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411402693">Ho et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022219411402693">Shu et al., 2006</xref>). The “visual tasks” contain several that engage Simultaneous processing and relate to it conceptually as we interpret the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411402693">Ho et al. (2002)</xref>. In that study, the visual tasks consisted of visual discrimination, visual memory, spatial relations, and so on; the core elements involved visual reasoning and memory for figures and forms. Conceptually, these are common to Simultaneous processing required in tasks such as Matrices and Figure Memory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022219411402693">Ho et al. (2002)</xref> showed that dyslexics were consistently inferior in their performance to CA matched controls in these tasks but did not differ from their RA matched group. However, in the absence of previous studies that use Simultaneous and Successive processing tests in predicting Chinese reading, our expectation of a relationship is necessarily tentative and remains to be determined.</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022219411402693">Liu, Chung, McBride-Chang, and Tong (2010)</xref> have shown in a series of experiments that, in word-level processing, Chinese children employ a holistic approach, but in character-level processing, the Chinese children employ an analytic approach. Consequently, to the extent that both serial processing and holistic processing are involved in learning Chinese characters and words, both Successive and Simultaneous processing should play a role.</p>

<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>Although the examination of developmental dyslexia and its manifestations in English has a relatively long history (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022219411402693">Snowling, 2000</xref>, for a review), the examination of dyslexia in Chinese is a relatively new field of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022219411402693">Yin &amp; Weekes, 2004</xref>). In the present study we examined the extent to which Chinese dyslexic children experience deficits in phonological processing, orthographic processing, and PASS processing skills. We were interested in the effects of PASS processing skills because of their successful history in identifying children with learning disabilities including dyslexia in English (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022219411402693">Das et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411402693">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411402693">Das, Mishra, et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022219411402693">Huang, Bardos, &amp; D’Amato, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022219411402693">Kirby, Booth, &amp; Das, 1995</xref>) above and beyond proximal reading-related factors, such as phonological processing and orthographic processing. In addition, we had the opportunity to test whether the premises of the PASS theory are language specific or universal. To date, the studies that have examined PASS in relation to dyslexia have been conducted in English (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411402693">Das et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022219411402693">Kirby et al., 1995</xref>). If the PASS cognitive processes are distal to reading and domain general, they should exert some influence on reading independent of the writing system.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 81 children who were native speakers of Mandarin Chinese from Fuding City, Fujian Province, China, participated in this study. The children were recruited from two public schools that serve approximately 1,100 students and are located in the town centre. 27 children attending Grade 4 (14 boys and 13 girls) had developmental dyslexia, and their mean age was 9.98 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.53). They were initially referred by their teachers, and most of them were not receiving any special education services. The dyslexic children had normal intelligence (IQ standard score higher than 85 as assessed by Raven’s Matrices), and their reading achievement was at least 2 years behind their corresponding age (assessed with Character Recognition and One-Minute Reading). Character Recognition is a widely used measure for screening Mandarin-speaking Chinese children for dyslexia (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022219411402693">Meng, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022219411402693">Shu et al., 2006</xref>; Shu &amp; Meng, 2000). In addition, the dyslexic children performed 1.5 standard deviations below their controls on at least one reading-related cognitive composite score (phonological awareness, phonological memory, RAN, or orthographic processing). Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022219411402693">Ho et al. (2004)</xref>, the inclusion of this additional criterion was necessary to exclude those who may read poorly because of poor motivation or environmental factors. The children were carefully screened to ensure that they had sufficient learning opportunities (e.g., second language learners were excluded) and that they did not have any brain damage, uncorrected sensory impairment, or serious emotional or behavioral problems.</p>
<p>Next, 27 Grade 4 children (15 boys and 12 girls; mean age = 10.12 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.53) with no known educational difficulties and no history of hearing or behavior problems were matched to the dyslexic group on CA and nonverbal IQ, and 27 normally developing Grade 2 children (14 boys and 13 girls; mean age = 8.02 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.02) were matched to the dyslexic group on reading ability and nonverbal IQ. Participant characteristics are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022219411402693">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Character Repetition</title>
<p>In this task the children were asked to repeat strings of characters presented orally by the experimenter with a time interval of about 1 second between each character. The task included a total of 14 strings of characters starting with two characters in a string to a maximum of eight characters in a string. There were two test items at each string length, and the list length was increasing by one. These character strings were presented verbally to participants who were instructed to repeat them back in the same order in which they were presented. All the characters used in the task were single syllables and highly frequent. The task was terminated after two consecutive failures at the same string length. The performance score was the number of character strings that the child could accurately provide (maximum = 14). Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient in our sample was .69.</p>

<title>Cognitive Assessment System</title>
<p>The <italic>Das–Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System</italic> (CAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219411402693">Naglieri &amp; Das, 1997</xref>) is an individually administered test of cognitive functioning for children and adolescents ranging from 5 through 17 years of age that was designed to assess the four PASS cognitive processes: (a) Planning, (b) Attention, (c) Simultaneous, and (d) Successive. The four PASS scales and the full scale standard scores are set at a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The CAS test battery consists of 12 tasks (3 tasks per PASS scale). For the purpose of this study we used the abbreviated version of CAS, which consists of 8 tasks (2 tasks per PASS scale). Descriptions of the subtests and scales as well as evidence for the reliability of the individual subtest scores and PASS scale scores are provided in the manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022219411402693">Naglieri &amp; Das, 1997</xref>). The CAS has good psychometric properties, with average internal consistency alpha values for the basic battery as follows: Planning = .85, Simultaneous = .90, Attention = .84, and Successive = .90. We obtained similar reliability coefficients with an unselected sample of Chinese readers (Cronbach’s α ranged from .80 to .92).</p>
<p>The Planning subtests of the basic battery of CAS include Matching Numbers and Planned Codes. In the Matching Numbers subtest, children are presented with four pages containing eight rows of numbers. For each row, the child is instructed to underline the two numbers that are the same. The time and number correct for each page are recorded, and the subtest score is calculated by combining both time and number correct. The Planned Codes subtest contains two pages, each with a distinct set of codes arranged in seven rows and eight columns. At the top of each page is a legend, which indicates how letters relate to simple codes (e.g., A = OX; B = XX; C = OO). The child is instructed to fill in the correct code beneath each corresponding letter in any manner he or she chooses. The subtest score is calculated by combining both the time and number correct for each page.</p>
<p>The Attention subtests of the basic battery of the CAS include Expressive Attention and Number Detection. For Expressive Attention, children 8 years and older are given three pages to complete. For the first page, the child reads color words (i.e., blue, yellow, green, and red). The words are presented in a quasi-random order. On the second page, the child is instructed to name the colors of a series of rectangles printed in aforementioned colors. On the third page, the color words are printed in a different ink color than the color the words name (e.g., the word <italic>red</italic> may appear in blue ink). The task on the third page is for the child to name the color of ink while not saying the color word. The subtest score is calculated using time and number correct. This test is a variation of the familiar Stroop Test. The Number Detection subtest asks children to find the target stimuli (e.g., the numbers 1, 2, and 3 printed in an open font) among many distracters (e.g., the same numbers printed in a different font). The subtest score is a ratio of accuracy (total number correct minus the number of false detections) to total time taken to complete all items.</p>
<p>The Simultaneous subtests of the basic battery of the CAS include Nonverbal Matrices and Verbal Spatial Relations. Nonverbal Matrices items present a variety of shapes and geometric designs that are interrelated through spatial or logical organization. For each item, the child is required to decode the relationships and choose the best of six possible answers to complete the grid. The subtest score is the total number correct. Verbal Spatial Relations measures the comprehension of logical grammatical descriptions of spatial relationships. In this subtest, the child is presented with six drawings, arranged in a specific spatial manner, and a printed question. Then, the child is instructed to choose one of the six drawings that best answers the question within the 30-second time limit. The subtest score is calculated by adding up the total number of items answered correctly.</p>
<p>The Successive subtests of the basic battery of the CAS include Word Series and Sentence Repetition. In Word Series, the examiner reads the child a series of words and then asks him or her to repeat the words in the same order. This subtest uses the following nine single-syllable, high-frequency Chinese characters: 鸭 (duck), 花 (flower), 人 (man), 鞋 (shoe), 书 (book), 羊 (sheep), 车 (car), 狗 (dog), and 笔 (pen). The subtest has 27 items, and each series ranges in length from two to nine words. For each item, the examiner first read these items at the rate of one word per second. The presentation was discontinued after four consecutive items were repeated incorrectly. The subtest score is the total number of words series correctly repeated. For Sentence Repetition, children are read 20 sentences aloud and are asked to repeat each sentence exactly as presented. The sentences are composed of color words (e.g., 蓝色正黄色着绿色; “the blue yellows the green”), which reduces the influence of simultaneous processing and removes semantic meaning for the sentences. The subtest score is the total number of sentences repeated correctly.</p>

<p>The above analyses have focused on the between-group differences. Because group comparisons may not reveal the true picture of the children’s cognitive profile difficulties if a group is heterogeneous, we created a performance profile for each one of the dyslexic children. In this study, we defined a deficit as a score on the cognitive task of at least 1.5 standard deviations below the mean score of a participant’s respective age group, in this case the CA’s mean performance. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022219411402693">Table 3</xref> summarizes the number of children in the dyslexic group exhibiting deficits on each cognitive task. It is evident from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022219411402693">Table 3</xref> that the dyslexic children have a deficit in phonological and orthographic processing. Specifically, on average, 56.79% of the dyslexics scored 1.5 standard deviations below the CA group mean on phonological awareness, 51.85% on phonological memory, and 44.45% on RAN. In addition, 59.26% of the dyslexic children had an orthographic processing deficit, which was the most dominant type of cognitive deficit. In contrast to the proximal cognitive processes, when PASS processing skills were examined, 11.11% of the dyslexics scored 1.5 standard deviations below the CA group mean on Successive, 14.81% on Simultaneous, 7.40% on Attention, and 7.40% on Planning.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Compared to typical reading development, there is still a paucity of research on the cognitive determinants of developmental dyslexia in Chinese. The present study attempted to address this gap by examining both phonological and orthographic processing along with more fundamental cognitive processes that may be related to developmental dyslexia in Chinese. The results of our study indicated that the Grade 4 dyslexic children performed significantly worse than the Grade 4 CA and the Grade 2 RA controls on both phonological awareness measures, thus supporting the view that difficulties in phonological awareness exist and persist even among Chinese dyslexic children. This argument appears to be in line with the findings of longitudinal studies with typically developing children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022219411402693">Chow, McBride-Chang, &amp; Burgess, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411402693">Ho &amp; Bryant, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022219411402693">McBride-Chang &amp; Ho, 2005</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411402693">Ho and Bryant (1997)</xref> established that Chinese children acquire and use phonetic skills even though they are not explicitly instructed to do so. In their longitudinal study, Ho and Bryant reported that phonological awareness among prereaders of Chinese could predict reading performance 2 to 3 years later.</p>
<p>The deficit in both measures of phonological awareness, despite the fact that onset and rhyming skills are mastered relatively early (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022219411402693">Ho &amp; Bryant, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022219411402693">Siok &amp; Fletcher, 2001</xref>), may be attributed to the severity of the dyslexic group in this study as a result of the screening procedure. In the past, to identify dyslexic children in Chinese, researchers either used a cutoff score of 1 standard deviation below the respective age means on Character Recognition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022219411402693">Cheung et al., 2009</xref>) or reading achievement 1.5 years below the corresponding age (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022219411402693">Ho et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022219411402693">Shu et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, the dyslexic children had to perform at least 1.5 standard deviations below the respective age means on both Character Recognition and One-Minute Reading and also 1.5 standard deviations below the age means on at least one reading-related cognitive processing skill (e.g., phonological awareness, RAN, etc.). The selection criteria may have resulted in a group of severely dyslexic children who have not yet mastered phonological awareness skills. Future studies should try to replicate this finding using a similar screening procedure and a larger sample.</p>
<p>Although significant differences were found between the dyslexics and their CA controls on both rapid naming and phonological memory tasks, the performance of the dyslexics was comparable to that of the RA group. In addition, the type of RAN or phonological memory task did not affect the results, as similar patterns were observed for both tasks of the same construct. These findings are in line with Ho et al.’s (2002) findings and suggest a developmental delay in both processing skills rather than a deficit. However, we cannot interpret the result unequivocally. Both rapid naming and phonological memory proficiencies may interact with Chinese reading as in a spiral; proficiency in reading accelerates rapid naming and phonological memory, and these variables in turn enhance reading. A cause–effect relationship cannot be established—delayed development in one set of variables may lead to delayed development in the other in a dialectical relationship.</p>
<p>The results also indicated that the dyslexic children performed worse than the RA controls on the Left–Right Reversal task. Developing orthographic knowledge in Chinese is a challenging task and takes a long time to achieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022219411402693">Ho, Yau, &amp; Au, 2003</xref>). The orthographic rules are rather complicated in Chinese (e.g., having different degrees of positional, semantic, and phonological regularities for radicals), and many of them are not even formally taught in school. For Chinese dyslexic children, learning these rules could be a continuous struggle. The dyslexic children in this study were at least 2 years behind their CA controls in orthographic knowledge.</p>
<p>However, the differences in orthographic processing appear to be partly attributed to differences in rapid naming. When we used rapid naming as a covariate, the differences between the groups on Lexical Decision disappeared. On one hand, this result verifies the connection between rapid naming and orthographic processing that was found in previous studies in Chinese (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022219411402693">Ho &amp; Lai, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022219411402693">Liao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022219411402693">McBride-Chang &amp; Ho, 2005</xref>). On the other hand, the result indicates that the connection is restricted to lexical orthographic processing. It stands to reason that, in the context of Chinese, rapid naming may be an index of the efficiency of accessing and retrieving orthographic representations at a lexical level (i.e., characters; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022219411402693">Georgiou, Parrila, &amp; Kirby, 2009</xref>, for a similar argument in English) rather than an index of intraindividual differences in the possession of character structure knowledge (how to arrange the strokes to form various characters in relation to the appropriate position and proportion within a fixed square unit).</p>
<p>Evidently, the difficulties of the Chinese dyslexic children in PASS processing skills were not as pronounced as the difficulties in orthographic and phonological processing. This finding came as a surprise given the evidence documenting their importance for reading in English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022219411402693">Das, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411402693">Das et al., 2007</xref>). There may be two explanations for not finding a stronger relationship between Simultaneous or Successive processing and dyslexia in Chinese. First, we matched the groups on Raven’s Matrices before performing any analyses. Apart from the fact that the PASS processing skills are highly correlated to measures of general intelligence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022219411402693">Naglieri &amp; Rojahn, 2004</xref>), the Simultaneous processing scale includes Raven-type matrices as one of its two tasks that we have used in this study. Thus, by using this test in initial screening for the groups, we have “stacked the cards” as it were and have reduced the likelihood of finding significant differences between the groups. The contribution of Simultaneous processing to reading was certainly attenuated by the matching procedure on the basis of Raven’s Matrices. Second, an explanation for the limited role of Successive processing may concern the type of Chinese reading tasks used in this study. Only one of the two tasks required articulation (One-Minute Reading); articulation is a strong component of Successive processing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022219411402693">Das et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022219411402693">Das, Mishra, et al., 1994</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022219411402693">Das et al. (1990)</xref> have shown that deficient speech-related processes may be the central problem of the majority of poor readers, especially those of above-average intelligence; our present article selected children of at least average or above-average intelligence.</p>
<p>Some limitations of the study are worth mentioning. First, the results of the study are restricted to the age range of the students and to the language under investigation. The participants in this study were Mandarin-speaking children. Previous studies examining developmental dyslexia in Chinese have been carried out primarily with Hong Kong children who speak Cantonese (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022219411402693">Ho &amp; Lai, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022219411402693">Ho, Law, et al., 2000</xref>). Hong Kong children differ from Fuding City children in the age at which literacy instruction begins, literacy instruction itself, and the language spoken. For example, the pinyin system is formally taught to Grade 1 children in schools of mainland China but not to students in Hong Kong. Thus, the extent to which our results should be similar to Hong Kong results and can be generalized across China remains unclear. Second, we did not use any measures of morphological awareness in this study despite the evidence from studies showing their relevance to dyslexia in Chinese (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022219411402693">Chung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022219411402693">Shu et al., 2006</xref>). Third, orthographic processing in this study was assessed by asking the children to recognize the legality of characters and their composition. Certainly, future studies should also include measures that assess the children’s ability to segment and integrate components of semantic and phonetic radicals. Finally, we have used the American norms for the PASS processing skills in the absence of a standardized CAS battery in Chinese. This, in turn, complicates the interpretation of the findings. Notice that the Chinese dyslexics appear to perform within average in Successive processing (based on the American norms) and clearly exceed norms in Simultaneous processing (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022219411402693">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Psychoeducational Implications</title>
<p>Some psychoeducational implications of the findings of this study are worth mentioning. First, given that the Grade 4 dyslexics were experiencing difficulties in phonological awareness and orthographic processing, measures of these two constructs could be used to identify those children at risk for reading difficulties even in a nonalphabetic orthography such as Chinese. Second, despite the successful history of PASS cognitive processes in identifying children at risk for reading difficulties in English and other alphabetic orthographies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022219411402693">Das et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022219411402693">Papadopoulos et al., 2004</xref>), this study did not provide strong evidence in support of their use for screening purposes. Certainly, futures studies should replicate this finding before we can draw any definite conclusions. Finally, given that phonological awareness emerged as a persistent difficulty, early intervention that boosts it should be effective in reducing the risk of poor reading. One such program (COGENT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022219411402693">Das, 2009</xref>), characterized by its heavy emphasis on phoneme discrimination and onset and rhyme, has already produced some promising findings (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022219411402693">Hayward et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section30-0022219411402693">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our findings add to a small but growing body of research examining developmental dyslexia in Chinese and suggest that phonological awareness, orthographic processing, and to a lesser extent rapid naming and phonological memory represent sources of difficulties in children with dyslexia in Chinese. The PASS cognitive processes were not strongly related to dyslexia in Chinese. Future research should expand the reading measures used in this study to accommodate word decoding and verbal comprehension in Chinese and examine the specific contribution vocabulary and morphological awareness makes to Chinese character recognition.</p>
