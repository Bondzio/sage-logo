<abstract>
<p>Using a toy construction set, we introduce to students the job characteristics model in a fun and engaging way. The activity not only describes the theoretical variables of the model but also allows students to (a) experience the dynamic interaction among these variables and (b) gain a better, hands-on understanding of the model. The exercise progresses through three stages where participants are gradually exposed to different manipulations of the variables in the job characteristics model. The exercise can be conducted in one quick-paced 75-minute class session.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the major challenges in business education is to deliver abstract and unfamiliar management concepts and models to students, assuring understanding, retention, and application of the concepts on the part of students. This delivery can be particularly difficult in large classes of 50 or more undergraduate students who have had little organizational experience. Large classes do not accommodate extensive discussion, nor do they lend themselves to intensive use of cases, which facilitate mastery of multidimensional theoretical models. Even in more favorable settings, instructors are always looking to didactic approaches that maintain student interest and motivation while successfully conveying sophisticated content.</p>
<p>This article describes an experiential exercise using a children’s toy construction set, the Tinkertoy® builder set, to illustrate and analyze <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912458093">Hackman and Oldham’s (1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562912458093">1980</xref>) job characteristics model (JCM). According to the JCM, managers should design the organization’s jobs and tasks to be interesting and motivating to employees. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912458093">Hackman and Oldham (1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562912458093">1980)</xref> propose that to motivate and intrigue, jobs should be designed with a consideration of five distinct job characteristics, namely, skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback. Furthermore, enriching these core characteristics should in turn allow employees to experience three motivating psychological states—experienced meaningfulness, responsibility, and knowledge of the work outcomes. According to the JCM, these enriched job characteristics and the resulting psychological states should ultimately produce high levels of motivation, quality of work performance, and employee satisfaction as well as low levels of absenteeism and turnover.</p>
<p>The activity was initially designed for a large class (50 or more students) to engage the audience in hands-on learning of JCM. Over the years, however, we have discovered that the exercise can be successfully executed in class sizes ranging anywhere from 10 to 100 students. In our experience, the ideal class size ranges between 15 and 30 students.</p>
<p>We have used this exercise more than a hundred times to facilitate learning about the JCM and related concepts with both homogenous and mixed culture groups. We have used our exercise at undergraduate, traditional MBA, and executive MBA levels. We have also executed the activity in executive training seminars at varied hierarchical levels in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Brazil, and the United States. Of the variety of experiential exercises we have seen in our combined 30 years of teaching organizational behavior, this exercise is our unqualified favorite. The exercise has at least three unique features that make it useful: (a) it demonstrates concretely and visually the different dimensions of the JCM, (b) it illustrates both unenriched and enriched jobs so that students can experience directly the difference, and (c) it explores both the cognitive and the socioemotional dimensions of the JCM. We are unaware of other experiential exercises that illustrate the JCM with this degree of completeness.</p>
<p>There is a long tradition of experiential exercises in management development and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1052562912458093">Coff &amp; Hatfield, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562912458093">Epstein, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1052562912458093">Pfeiffer &amp; Jones, 1980</xref>), many of which use building toys of some kind. Tinkertoy® builder set—which consists of different length and color dowels that can be connected by a variety of spools and other connectors—appears to be a popular option among management educators. We believe this popularity is because of the fact that Tinkertoy® builder sets provide a break from the abstractions of theoretical instruction yet can be used to link to important management concepts. Tinkertoy® builder sets have been used in exercises to demonstrate concepts and applications in areas such as management functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1052562912458093">McNeely, 1994</xref>); strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1052562912458093">Coff &amp; Hatfield, 2003</xref>); open-systems view of organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912458093">Trefry, 2002</xref>); linear programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562912458093">Apte, Downs, &amp; Grout, 1995</xref>); leadership, power, and ethics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562912458093">Lindsay &amp; Enz, 1991</xref>); communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562912458093">Guinn, 1982</xref>); trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912458093">Ramey, Leonard, &amp; Leonard, 1999</xref>); and system modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1052562912458093">Waguespack, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, as early as 1979, some OBTC participants were satiated with Tinkertoy® builder set exercises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1052562912458093">“The Sixth Annual Organizational Behavior Teaching Conference ‘A Memorable Feast,’” 1979</xref>). Some scholars also reasoned that experiential learning raises pedagogical and philosophical issues and controversies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1052562912458093">Bradford, 1983</xref>). Despite these concerns, however, exercises using building games appear to have some utility, judging from the breadth of concepts that they have addressed and from the fact that every few years a new exercise addressing a new theoretical development surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1052562912458093">Coff &amp; Hatfield, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912458093">Trefry, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1052562912458093">Waguespack, 2008</xref>, appear to be the most recent additions).</p>
<p>Our exercise does not presume to offer any radical advances over existing approaches—it shares many commonalities with other experiential activities—nor does it intend to take the place of other exercises. However, it does feature some attributes that set it apart from others and as such may merit instructors’ interest and experimentation. Furthermore, our exercise is not the only experiential exercise illustrating the JCM. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912458093">Fornaciari and Lund Dean (2005)</xref> developed a classroom exercise that deals with the organizational, emotional, and ethical issues of job design. Our activity is different from Fornaciari and Lund Dean’s approach in that they dedicate the entirety of their exercise to the effects of job simplification or “impoverishment,” while our activity attempts to contrast simplified or “impoverished” job contexts in the first two rounds with an “enriched” job setting simulated in the third round. In our experience, the contrast between the different rounds adds a nice touch.</p>
<p>With the exception of Fornaciari and Lund Dean’s exercise, building exercises we reviewed appear to address principally the cognitive or conceptual dimension of the management theories they illustrate. Because the JCM posits critical psychological states such as experienced meaningfulness and affective outcomes such as job satisfaction, we are able to explore students’ emotional response to the exercise in some detail while addressing the conceptual features of the formal theory. This focus maintains student interest, adds a different dimension to the classroom experience, and fits squarely within the purview and objectives of the experiential teaching tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1052562912458093">Bradford, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>Another unique attribute of our exercise that instructors may find interesting is our effort to arouse students’ critical faculties regarding the structure and process of the exercise throughout the course of the activity. The exercises we reviewed appear to focus the debriefing on the relation of the students’ performance to the theoretical categories advanced (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1052562912458093">Coff &amp; Hatfield, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562912458093">Sheehan, 2006</xref>). We, on the other hand, start our exercise by making some rather bold predictions about how student behavior will change from one round to the next. We also invite our audience to be attentive to the way we, the instructors, manipulate the context to generate certain outcomes. We hope that this practice promotes a bit of “reflection in action” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1052562912458093">Schon, 1983</xref>) on the part of the students by asking them to reflect on the structure of the exercise as they are participating in it.</p>
<p>The exercise consists of three rounds, during which students build a structure based on a set of instructions and building requirements. With each consecutive round, students are exposed to progressive manipulations of each of the five core dimensions in the JCM. During the debriefing session, we show students how the increased levels in each of the five dimensions through the rounds lead to increased levels of the three psychological states posited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912458093">Hackman and Oldham (1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562912458093">1980)</xref> as well as distinctively different behaviors. Students also discover how the experienced high levels of the psychological states translate into increased motivation, higher quality, higher productivity, and lower turnover. They are also led to think critically about the effects of job context on behavior and about the trade-offs involved in designing jobs. We find it important to register students’ feelings or reactions because the JCM assumes that internal cognitive processes, that is, critical psychological states, are the mechanism that mediates between job design features and work outcomes per se. It is therefore important to call students to reflect on what happens mentally during the exercise.</p>

<title>Exercise</title>
<sec id="section3-1052562912458093">
<title>Overview</title>
<p>The exercise is typically introduced as a way to learn how controlling the work context and the way that work is carried out affect a variety of behaviors, including productivity and quality (for the timeline and the corresponding stages of the activity, instructions, and scripts, see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1052562912458093">Appendixes A</xref>, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1052562912458093">B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3-1052562912458093">C</xref>, respectively). We like to begin by announcing that by changing a few “rules of the game” around how work is set up and organized, it is possible to influence student behaviors radically from one round to the next in this three-round activity. We ask students to take notes on two things during the exercise: (a) how the behaviors of participants change from one round to the next and (b) how the instructor subtly changes the “rules of the game” or the way the exercise is set up and organized from one round to the next.</p>
<p>Following this introduction, we choose two teams of three members each that are randomly assigned the roles of “managers” and “workers.” We ask the rest of the class to serve as observers. We announce that the managers will instruct the workers on how to assemble a Tinkertoy® builder set structure and that the workers will not be able to ask managers any questions. We also announce that both teams will face opposite directions and will not be able to see one another. At that point we give the structure to the management team. The structure is deliberately designed to have few pieces (8-10) and to be difficult to visualize, that is, pieces are placed randomly with no logical sequence and no resemblance to any clearly recognized article (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1052562912458093">Figure 1</xref> for a design suggestion).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1052562912458093-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>We informally keep track of how long it takes to complete the work. After the structure is built, we bring the management team over to the workers’ site to see how the project turned out. The workers’ structure is invariably different from the original design given to the managers. We have the class calculate the quality (in percentages) of execution by dividing the number of correctly assembled parts (including exact positioning and color) by the total number of parts that went into the structure’s assembly times 100.</p>
<p>In the second round, we reverse the roles, assigning the former managers to the worker function and vice versa.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1052562912458093">1</xref></sup> In this round, we permit the workers to ask questions. We also use a different structure that employs about double the number of pieces as those used in the first round (between 16 and 20). The new structure is also more recognizable and symmetrical. A windmill or radar tower work well as a structure for this round (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1052562912458093">Figure 2</xref> for a design suggestion).</p>

<p>Suggested design: Round 2.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1052562912458093-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>We keep time and at the end of the second round, the managers go to the workers’ table to see the result. Once again, the class assesses the quality of execution using the approach described above. In our experience, the second round consistently takes less time, and the resulting structure is always close, if not identical, to the original design shown to the managers. At the end of the second round, the participants are thanked and asked to return to their seats.</p>
<p>For the third round, two new teams are selected. In the team formation we ask for six students to volunteer, thus increasing the level of autonomy in the third round. The Tinkertoy® builder set is placed between the teams, and the participants are informed that their team will compete against the other to construct, in 5 minutes, the tallest tower to remain standing. At the suggestion of an anonymous reviewer, we have included instructions to assure the physical safety of students (despite the considerable motivation of students to win in the third round, we have never had injuries or aggressive behavior in this activity). When the time is up, we stop the building activities and declare the winning team. We thank our participants and transition to the debriefing stage.</p>
<p>We prefer not to allocate pieces to the separate teams in the third round but rather leave the pieces on the table and observe students’ efforts to secure pieces. There are five major reasons we let the competing groups allocate parts themselves. First, it highlights the disadvantages of introducing competition as a tactic for increasing task significance. Second, it requires assertiveness and quick reaction, which may be seen as adding skill variety that is not present in former rounds. Third, it provides a particularly strong example of how minor changes in the way the work context is set up can effect major changes in worker behaviors and the tone of the work setting. Fourth, we want to highlight the difference between process and outcome control and provoke students to think about the strengths and weaknesses of each type of control. One of the benefits of controlling process in the first two rounds is the reduction of ambiguity and conflict that comes when management controls everything. The free-for-all that results at the beginning of Round 3 illustrates the consequences of monitoring only one outcome and minimizing managerial intrusions. Last but not least, we like to provoke students to think about the consequences of intergroup competition and management’s role in encouraging or limiting it. We stress that setting up intergroup competition increases job significance but incurs costs. This causality is borne out very graphically in the initial struggle for parts and is one of the ways we try to help students to reflect critically about the way job design and organizational context, frequently taken for granted, set the tone for employee behaviors. These features are useful when we are teaching job design and are absolutely necessary when we use the exercise to teach students to think critically about authority and control in organizations (see variations below).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1052562912458093">
<title>Debriefing</title>
<p>The debriefing part of the exercise contains three distinct parts: (a) identifying behaviors and their change from one round to the next, (b) identifying manipulations or changes in work context and organization that influence behaviors, and (c) connecting the elements of JCM to the exercise. The first step, identifying behaviors across the three rounds, is the most difficult. Students will tend to identify manipulations in the exercise such as absence of communication and introduction of competition, as behaviors rather than as elements of the work context that we (the instructors) manipulated. After a few clarifications on the part of the instructor, students will begin to make comments about specific behaviors. For example, we have heard, “When the managers gave an instruction, they paused as if they were waiting for the workers to respond,” or “In the first round I saw the workers shrug their shoulders a lot.” Other frequent comments include, “One person did most of the talking in the management team, but the workers all talked about the same amount” or “The work was finished faster in the second round.” A point to make here is that several behaviors, such as passivity or playing around on the job that are attributed to workers’ attributes or traits, may actually be caused by the context imposed by the management or by the organizational practices themselves.</p>
<p>It is also useful to ask participants in the exercise what their thoughts and feelings were at certain moments in the exercise. Workers would frequently mention frustration at manager’s slow or unclear instructions, and managers would express anxiety about how their instructions were being received. Participants in the third round might mention excitement or an “adrenalin buzz” as they tried to build the tallest tower. This kind of probing primes the class to think about <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912458093">Hackman and Oldham’s (1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562912458093">1980)</xref> critical psychological states and to what degree these states become transformed into observable behaviors.</p>
<p>To guide the discussion about JCM’s output variables, such as quality and productivity, we post on the board the number of pieces, the time, and the quality of the structure produced in each round (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1052562912458093">Appendix D</xref> provides a summary of the variables in the Tinkertoy® builder set exercise addressed in the initial steps of the debriefing). We stress that these variables, too, are behaviors, in which managers and organizations have a vital interest.</p>
<p>Although identifying manipulations or changes in work context is key, an additional teaching benefit comes from identifying the significance of the manipulations. When students note, for instance, that the last round did not involve management, but rather two competing teams, we ask, “Why do you suppose I did that in the third round? How might this affect people’s behavior or mental state?”</p>
<p>We also discuss the less obvious differences in the set up between the rounds. Often, students do not remember or do not perceive the significance of the fact that the structures in the first two rounds were different not only in number of used construction pieces but also in overall design. Occasionally, workers from the first round will complain that they had a more difficult structure to build. This comment can be exploited by responding that there were double the pieces in the second round, so logically there was less work to do in the first round. Any discussion around differences in the design of the structures in relation to ease of assembly or satisfaction will help prepare the class for understanding the concept of task identity, which we believe is the most difficult component of the JCM to understand and remember.</p>
<p>Another point that tends to elude students is that the structure designs were predetermined and imposed in the first two rounds, whereas in the last round the design of the structure was delegated to the students. Every point of this kind that students miss and the instructor needs to introduce can be used to illustrate how people tend to be rather uncritical and insensitive to contextual factors in the work or organizational environment that can have considerable impact.</p>
<p>Next, the instructor introduces the JCM framework while tying it to the game. The instructor begins the discussion of the JCM by evaluating the three rounds of the exercise in terms of the core job characteristics—skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy, and feedback—while simultaneously providing definitions of the terms. Students will note that although the first round required encoding and speaking skills (for the managers) and listening and decoding skills (for the workers), the third round required a greater variety of skills for both teams including design, communication, speed, material optimization, and assertiveness. Similarly, students will note that task identity was minimal in the first round and high in the last two. They will note how the progressive delegation of communication, design, and quality control functions from the first to the last round increased autonomy. Finally, students will note that visual feedback was withheld until the end of the first two rounds, while it was constant during the last round, as one needed only to look at and compare the two groups’ structures to know how one was doing.</p>
<p>After the parallels between the exercise and the core job characteristics are established, we introduce and tie in the concept of the psychological states. After we describe the model’s psychological states we discuss whether the changes in core job characteristics that occurred from the first to the third rounds influenced “what went on in participants’ minds” (i.e., critical psychological states). We also lead our discussion on the job specific outcomes such as intrinsic motivation, reduced withdrawal, higher quality, and productivity. In other words, we use the experiences of the exercise to attempt to assess critically whether the JCM “works” as the textbooks would predict.</p>
<p>One point that we like to mention in our debriefing is the use of competition as means of inducing task significance in a work setting. It is clear to most students that by pitting two teams against each other in the last round and placing the construction pieces in a shared space, what was just playing with a child’s toy suddenly becomes an important task that needs to be accomplished. This realization leads to a discussion of the motivational, psychosocial, and ethical implications of fomenting competition in organizations and the degree to which it is compatible with the culture of job enrichment or high involvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1052562912458093">
<title>Variations</title>
<p>We have also used the exercise to orient a discussion on the nature and implications of process versus output control strategies in organizations. The overall structure of the exercise remains the same as well as the first two debriefing steps of identifying behaviors and manipulations across rounds. However, in the third step of the debriefing, we describe how the first two rounds involve rather complete control over the work process. We explain that we imposed a division of labor, isolated labor and management, controlled communication, and stipulated product design in the first two rounds, whereas in the last round we provided unambiguous output goals (maximum height and a 5-minute deadline) and delegated process details (such as division of labor, design, and parts acquisition) to the teams. We then lead a discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of each type of control including implications for the distribution of power in organizations (the discussion points using this variation are tabulated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1052562912458093">Appendix E</xref>).</p>
<p>For some audiences this discussion could also be used as a starting point for transaction cost theories of organization and culture such as those of Williamson and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1052562912458093">Ouchi, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1052562912458093">Wilkins &amp; Ouchi, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1052562912458093">Williamson, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1052562912458093">2005</xref>) or critical theories of labor relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562912458093">Braverman, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1052562912458093">Spencer, 2000</xref>). The exercise and discussion of process versus output control can be accomplished within an hour’s time.</p>
<p>Another variation of our Tinkertoy® builder set exercise involves expanding the debriefing section into a discussion on the relationship between the JCM and Quality of Working Life issues. After presenting the exercise as initially described, we ask how the changes we engineered across the three rounds could actually be implemented in real organizations. This question leads into a discussion of Hackman and Oldham’s implementing concepts such as forming natural work groups, opening feedback channels, vertical loading, horizontal loading, and establishing client contacts. We place these concepts on the board to the left of the core job characteristics and discuss how each implementing concept might affect one or more core job characteristics. We then relate accounts of each implementing concept applied in a real organizational setting and discuss the cultural, logistical, and political implications of each concept. Finally, we sum up the session with a detailed discussion on the pros and cons of job enrichment and high involvement techniques.</p>

<title>Student Reactions</title>
<p>Reactions to the exercise have been quite positive across a variety of educational and training settings and populations. As an example, on completing the exercise with the upper management of a large luxury hotel in Singapore, one management consultant who sold a variety of training and diagnostic products suggested, “Why don’t we stop selling this other stuff and just do Tinkertoy® exercises?” Another memorable example was from a U.S. undergraduate who had not made a single comment during the semester until the exercise. He stayed after class to discuss the finer implications of the exercise and said he wished “we could do exercises like this all the time.” Less dramatic indications are found in the ease with which we maintain student attention during the exercise, the frequency of comments, and the comparatively higher quality of questions arising during the debriefing.</p>
<p>Data that are somewhat more systematic are found in two brief surveys we performed with 21 U.S. undergraduate and 45 Brazilian executive MBA students. Responding to Likert-type questions about the teaching efficacy, generated interest, and enjoyability of the exercise, the undergraduate mean varied from 4.1 to 4.6 on a 5-point scale (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1052562912458093">Table 1</xref>). The development of the survey questions was influenced by the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562912458093">Anderson (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1052562912458093">Haytko (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1052562912458093">Patry (2009)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1052562912458093">Sheehan and Gamble (2010)</xref>.</p>

<p>The Brazilian students were asked two questions comparing the exercise with the second author’s all time favorite lecture presentation. The first question, “Of the two activities, which do you think you will remember best 2 years from now?” Forty-two of the 45 students indicated the JCM exercise. The second question asked, “Of the two activities, which is most immediately applicable to your current work setting?” Once again, 42 of the 45 noted the JCM exercise as more applicable.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As we stressed at the beginning of this article, this exercise is a favorite of ours. We have found it easy to present and debrief. Furthermore, the activity is received favorably by our students and is particularly reliable in terms of unfolding in a predictable manner that is consistent with the theory it attempts to illustrate. Assuming that our experience with the exercise is not anomalous, it may be worthwhile, in closing, to ponder why this exercise has worked so well in the hopes of developing criteria for predicting the success of other exercises under consideration or principles for developing future exercises.</p>
<p>We identified that at least four possible attributes of this exercise might contribute to its success: (a) the exercise creates fruitful suspense; (b) the exercise contains short, contrasting rounds that are easily analyzed; (c) the exercise creates convergence between emergent dynamics of the game and formal theory; and (d) the exercise combines concreteness and visibility with theoretical insight. We now comment on these attributes in turn.</p>
<sec id="section8-1052562912458093">
<title>The Exercise Creates Fruitful Suspense</title>
<p>Immediately when the student observers see one complete structure on one side of the room and a pile of unattached parts on the other side, they become anxious to see how the round will turn out. Because the first round never ends with a correctly assembled structure, and because the management and worker roles are reversed, this suspense carries into the second round. In addition, the third round is suspenseful because of the time limit and competition. We speculate that suspense combined with subsequent differing outcomes and behaviors contribute to students’ curiosity about why the game unfolds the way it does.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1052562912458093">
<title>The Exercise Contains Short, Contrasting Rounds That Are Easily Analyzed</title>
<p>Each round is comparatively short (about 5-8 minutes), so there is not enough time to get bored. Furthermore, the three rounds contain clear similarities and differences that have analytical implications, even if all of the implications are not immediately obvious.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1052562912458093">
<title>The Exercise Creates Convergence Between Emergent Dynamics of the Game and Formal Theory</title>
<p>As students observe the three rounds, it is clear to them that the instructor has “stacked the deck” to achieve certain outcomes. Moreover, some of the changes across rounds, such as the introduction of two-way communication and competition, are so obvious that few will miss their significance. Other changes, such as the change in designs from Round 1 to Round 2, are apparent but harder to interpret. By the end of the third round, students are aware that changes in the rules in each round change behavior significantly, but they do not have concepts or specialized vocabulary to explain all of these changes and their impacts. The JCM helps explain, interpret, and, perhaps more important, “name” or classify specific manipulations that the instructor carries out, and for this reason, students’ assimilation, recall, and application of the theory are enhanced.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1052562912458093">
<title>The Exercise Combines Concreteness and Visibility With Theoretical Insight</title>
<p>Because the exercise uses physical artifacts and spatially separated groups, it is both visual and concrete, which facilitates attention. Because the nature of these specifics—who speaks and who can ask questions, control of the design process, and so on—changes very clearly and affects behaviors from round to round, it is natural and easy for students to create mental categories for the different rounds, which they subsequently associate with the categories of the formal theory.</p>
<p>In closing, we hope that our fellow instructors will experiment with the activity described here and suggest amendments, variations, and principles that will improve our work.</p>

<title>Materials and Instructor’s Preparation</title>
<p>For the exercise, we use a 200-piece Tinkertoy® builder set, a timer, and a calculator. Scripts of the rules as well as the debriefing questions are optional, yet helpful. Furthermore, we construct, ahead of time, two structures to be used in Rounds 1 and 2, so the class is not kept waiting while the instructor designs structures.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1052562912458093">
<title>Outline of the Process</title>
<p>The exercise consists of three rounds. In each round, two teams of students participate directly and the rest of the class members serve as observers. Furthermore, each round consists of a distinct set of rules that are announced to the participants prior to the round itself. All three rounds and the debriefing can be executed in one 75-minute class session. The overall process of the exercise consists of setting up the activity (5 minutes), running the three stages (25 minutes), and debriefing (45 minutes).</p>

<title>Introduction Script</title>
<p>In today’s session, you will participate in a Tinkertoy® builder set exercise. The purpose of the exercise is to demonstrate how setting up the “rules of the game” or work environment in a certain way on the part of the manager could result in very different behaviors and consequences including higher levels of satisfaction, motivation, and quality performance on the part of the employees.</p>
<p>Our exercise will have three rounds with varying rules. Two teams of students will participate in each round. Each team will consist of three individuals. Those of you, who do not participate directly, will serve as observes and will record and later share the behaviors and the rules in each round.</p>
