<p>UEG Week has become the most international and, in my opinion, the best digestive diseases meeting of the year. It complements your national meeting; it keeps you right up to date with current advances from Europe and around the world; it helps you to hone your skills; and it showcases the most influential clinical and basic research in your field. It is the meeting to attend and the meeting at which to present your best research. Berlin 2013 will feature further improvements and innovations in all these areas.</p>
<p>UEG Week has always been strong on innovative, cutting-edge management and we have been building on this reputation year-on-year. We are the only major international meeting to feature live endoscopy, and we are continually improving that service. For this year we have also rejuvenated our IBD and liver programmes, continued to bring GI oncology into mainstream practice and increased pathology input to the meeting. Most of our invited symposia are management-based, we offer expert hands-on training in endoscopy and ultrasound, and we present all this in interactive and exciting formats. These include key-pad voting and text questioning; debates and tandem talks; widespread use of clinical cases to illustrate new management issues; and in 2013, increased use of panel discussions, opportunities to interact with speakers after symposia, and lively round-table discussions at lunchtime.</p>
<p>However, our biggest advance in recent years has been the standard and volume of new research presented at the meeting. With its international flavour, big attendance and the priority and exposure we give to research, UEG Week has become the place to present your best work. The importance of this original research is recognised by the large number of sessions we devote to it (with the best featured in our Plenary Session) and the prizes and prestige we confer upon it. We offer a 100 K Euro prize to the best researcher in Europe each year, we give five 10 K Euro prizes to the first authors of the best abstracts submitted each year, and we award many other prizes including one in every free paper session. The standard of original research presented at the meeting has improved markedly and measurably, as judged by our international reviewers and by our Faculty and attendees. Please visit http://www.ueg.eu/week/abstract-submission/ to submit your abstract now! You will get more exposure, discussion, interest and potentially reward than at any other meeting!</p>
<p>We feature clinical research very heavily at UEG Week, but our basic science has also improved in quality and quantity over recent years. As well as free papers we integrate basic science into clinical symposia and hold basic science workshops. However, perhaps our biggest innovation in this area is our two day “Today's science; tomorrow's medicine” initiative, which sees its 4th year in 2013. We invite leading world experts to concentrate on a particularly topical area, and for 2013 we will feature genetics, particularly as it relates to pathogenesis and clinical practice. There will be something there for everyone and we urge you to try it – it is free to all delegates.</p>
<p>UEG Week is large and comprehensive, and of course we feature many things not mentioned above. We have a great two-day Postgraduate Course which incorporates all of the values of UEG Week. It includes parallel Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Endoscopy and Surgery courses which delegates can move freely between to personalise their programme. We have particular themes for the whole meeting each year: this year we feature “guidelines, standards and pathways”, and, for the more scientific-minde d, “translating science into clinical practice”. For 2013 we have made it easier for you to find the sessions that really interest you. Our “Pathways” will enable you to see at a glance which sessions feature your area of interest in each time slot. We have also included “Pathway wrap-up” sessions on the final day, where you can hear about the most important advances in your area in the last year – including those featured at UEG Week 2013. Alternatively, you can see what has been happening in another area in a single summary session.</p>
<p>So what's in UEG Week for you? Interacting with, learning from and socialising with a truly international group of top clinicians and scientists. Keeping right up to date with your field. Getting high-level exposure, ideas and rewards for your research.</p>
<p>I hope to see you there!</p>
