<abstract>
<p>Fibronectin fragments are important for synovial inflammation and the progression of arthritis, and thus, identifying potential enzymatic pathways that generate these fragments is of vital importance. The objective of this study was to determine the cleavage efficiency of fibronectin by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, and MMP-14). Intact human plasma fibronectin was co-incubated with activated MMPs in neutral or acidic pH for up to 24 hours at 37 °C. The size and distribution of fibronectin fragments were determined by Western blot analysis using antibodies that recognized the N-terminals of fibronectin. All MMPs were able to cleave fibronectin at neutral pH. MMP-13 and -14 had the highest efficiency followed by MMP-3 and -1. MMP-3, -13, and -14 generated 70-kDa fragments, a known pro-inflammatory peptide. Further degradation of fibronectin fragments was only found for MMP-13 and -14, generating 52-kDa, 40-kDa, 32-kDa, and 29-kDa fragments. Fibronectin fragments of similar size were also found in the articular cartilage of femoral condyles of normal bovine knee joints. At acidic pH (5.5), the activities of MMP-1 and -14 were nearly abolished, while MMP-3 had a greater efficiency than MMP-13 even though the activities of both MMPs were significantly reduced. These findings suggest that MMP-13 and -14 may play a significant role in the cleavage of fibronectin and the production of fibronectin fragments in normal and arthritic joints.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fibronectin (FN) is a glycoprotein that binds to various physiological ligands and receptors, which are responsible for many cellular functions such as cell adhesion, growth, migration, and differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1947603511435273">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1947603511435273"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1947603511435273"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1947603511435273"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1947603511435273">5</xref></sup> FN commonly exists in the form of a dimer, which is composed of 2 identical or similar subunits bound together through C-terminal disulfide bonds with a total molecular weight of about 450 kDa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1947603511435273">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1947603511435273">7</xref></sup> In vertebrates, there are 2 types of FN dimers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1947603511435273">7</xref></sup> The soluble dimer, as a major protein in blood plasma, is actively produced by hepatocytes in the liver. Chondrocytes and fibroblasts in connective tissues, on the other hand, can produce an insoluble dimer consisting of FN isoforms similar to or slightly different from that in the plasma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1947603511435273">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1947603511435273">8</xref></sup> These insoluble dimers are then assembled and linked to other proteins in the extracellular matrix (ECM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1947603511435273">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1947603511435273"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1947603511435273"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1947603511435273"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1947603511435273">11</xref></sup> The timely expression and binding of FN are essential to numerous processes such as embryonic development, angiogenesis, and wound healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1947603511435273">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1947603511435273"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1947603511435273">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1947603511435273">5</xref></sup> An alteration of FN integrity due to alterative splicing or to protease degradation has also been shown to be closely related to the pathogenesis of a number of diseases including cancer, fibrosis, and arthritis.</p>
<p>FN is a minor component of the ECM in normal cartilage and can be degraded into FN fragments (FN-fs) by a number of proteases as a part of ECM turnover. Degradation of FN and the resulting FN-fs have an important role in the initiation and progression of arthritic diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1947603511435273">8</xref></sup> In a diseased joint such as osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the degradation of FN is accelerated due to the elevation of active proteases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1947603511435273">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1947603511435273"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1947603511435273"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1947603511435273">15</xref></sup> FN is increased as much as 3- to 4-fold in the synovial fluid of an arthritic joint (OA and RA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1947603511435273">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1947603511435273">15</xref></sup> with the percentage of FN-fs elevated as much as 50% of total FN, with the sizes of FN-fs ranging from 30 to 200 kDa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1947603511435273">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1947603511435273"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1947603511435273">18</xref></sup> Among them, the smaller FN-fs (29 kDa and 70 kDa) can induce pro-inflammatory responses. Several <italic>in vitro</italic> studies found that these FN-fs have the capability to induce the production of serine proteinases, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin-type motif), including MMP-3 (stromelysin 1), MMP-13 (collagenase 3), MMP-2 (gelatinase A), MMP-9 (gelatinase B), and aggrecanases (ADAMTS-4, -5, and -8).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1947603511435273">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1947603511435273">20</xref></sup> The activation of these proteases can result in the breakdown of major cartilage matrix components including type II collagen and aggrecan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1947603511435273">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1947603511435273"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1947603511435273"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1947603511435273"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1947603511435273">25</xref></sup> Furthermore, FN-fs can upregulate other pro-inflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1947603511435273">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1947603511435273">22</xref></sup> and suppress proteoglycan (PG) synthesis in chondrocytes as well as in cartilage explants,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1947603511435273">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1947603511435273">24</xref></sup> thus limiting the anabolic reparative response to cartilage damage.

<p>Despite the imperative biological functions of FN and the roles of its fragments on cartilage homeostasis, the ability of specific MMPs to cleave FN and to generate FN-fs is not well documented. MMPs are Zn<sup>2+</sup>- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent endopeptidases that function in the turnover of the ECM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1947603511435273">28</xref></sup> Main subfamilies of MMPs are collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, and membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1947603511435273">29</xref></sup> MMP-2, -3, -8, -9, -12, and -14 (MT1-MMP) and ADAMTS-5 have been shown to cleave intact FN at neutral pH (7.4),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1947603511435273">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1947603511435273"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1947603511435273"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1947603511435273"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1947603511435273">34</xref></sup> the pH found in the synovial fluid from normal and OA joints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1947603511435273">35</xref></sup> At neutral pH, the efficiency of MMP-3 to degrade FN was found to be greater than 3 times that of MMP-2, with distinct differences in the generated sizes of FN-fs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1947603511435273">34</xref></sup> On the other hand, MMP-3 was found to be 3.4 to 5 times more efficient in digesting FN at pH 5.3 as compared to pH 7.5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1947603511435273">31</xref></sup> However, the relative efficiency of the other MMPs to cleave FN is not known. It is also important to determine whether these MMPs can act efficiently at a lower pH, where acidic pH values have been reported within chondrocytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1947603511435273">36</xref></sup> the ECM of articular cartilage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1947603511435273">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1947603511435273">38</xref></sup> the synovial fluid from rheumatoid arthritic joints before and after corticosteroid intra-articular injection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1947603511435273">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1947603511435273">40</xref></sup> and in the ECM of articular cartilage when mechanically compressed as would occur during normal joint loading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1947603511435273">41</xref></sup> The objective of this study was therefore to compare the ability of MMP-1 (collagenase 1), -3, -13, and -14 to cleave human plasma FN at acidic and neutral pH. We hypothesized that these MMPs would cleave FN less effectively at lower (acid) pH when compared to FN cleavage at neutral pH. The sizes and time course of appearance of the FN-fs generated by these MMPs were also determined and compared to each other. Finally, limited information exists on the existence and sizes of FN-fs in normal articular cartilage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1947603511435273">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1947603511435273">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1947603511435273">17</xref></sup> Therefore, we determine the presence of FN-fs in articular cartilage from normal knee joints and compared these to the FN-fs generated by the MMPs.</p>

<title>Activation of Latent Human Pro-MMPs</title>
<p>Human recombinant pro-MMP-1, -3, and -13 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) were activated by incubation with 1.0 mM of aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) at 37 °C for 3, 24, and 0.75 hours, respectively. MMP-14 (human recombinant catalytic domain) (Calbiochem, Temecula, CA) was activated by overnight incubation with furin. The MMPs have similar molecular weights (47, 45, 48, and 58 kDa for MMP-1, -3, -13, and -14, respectively) and similar specific activity with synthetic substrates (150-250 mU/mg and purity &gt;95% as per data sheets from suppliers). Thus, the molar concentrations of the MMPs were kept identical in the assay systems, permitting direct comparison of their efficiencies to degrade FN.</p>

<title>Cleavage of Plasma FN by MMPs</title>
<p>Human plasma FN (~220 kDa) (Calbiochem) was diluted to 36 ηg/µL in either 0.05 M Tris ((hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) buffer, pH 7.5, or MES (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid)-HCl (hydrochloric acid), pH 5.5, containing 0.15 M NaCl, 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.05% Brij-35. FN (100 µL) was incubated together with 50 ηg of each MMP for up to 24 hours at 37 °C. Control human plasma FN (~220 kDa) and human plasma FN-fs (30 kDa and 70 kDa; purity &gt;90%) (Calbiochem) were incubated with buffer only for 24 hours. Samples (25 µL) were taken at 6 minutes (0.1 hours) and 2, 4, and 24 hours; quenched with an equal volume of Laemmli 2x concentrate sample buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO); and then heated at 96 °C for 3 minutes.

<title>SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting</title>
<p>FN digests were subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis using 4% to 15% acrylamide gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk (Bio-Rad) at room temperature for 1 hour and treated with a 2,000-fold dilution of mouse monoclonal antibody directed toward an epitope located within the fourth-type 3 repeat of human plasma FN (Sigma) in 0.1% Tween 20, 0.15 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4 (TBST) for 1 hour or a 1,000-fold dilution of rabbit polyclonal FN antibody (Sigma) in the same buffer. Membranes were then washed several times with TBST buffer and treated with either a 10,000-fold dilution of rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in TBST buffer for use with the mouse monoclonal anti-FN antibody or a 7,000-fold dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in TBST buffer for use with the rabbit polyclonal anti-FN antibody. To visualize the bands, the membranes were added to ECL Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), and autoradiography films (Denville, Metuchen, NJ) were developed.</p>

<title>FN and FN-fs in Bovine Knee Joints</title>
<p>FN (intact) and FN-fs were measured in the articular cartilage of the femoral condyles from 4 mature bovine knees, 2 paired knees (left and right) from a young animal (18-24 months) and 2 paired knees from an older animal (3-5 years). The bovine knees were obtained from a local abattoir within 24 hours after death. Seven-millimeter-diameter full-thickness (~1.5 mm) cartilage specimens from different locations on the load-bearing regions of the femoral condyles were removed from the underlying bone using a biopsy punch and scalpel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603511435273"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>). Two adjacent specimens were removed from 4 different regions on the femoral condyle: medial anterior (MA), medial posterior (MP), lateral anterior (LA), and lateral posterior (LP). The explants were washed in culture media (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, 10 mM HEPES buffer, 50 µg/mL ascorbic acid, and 10% fetal bovine serum) and separated into 24-well plates. One specimen from each location was immediately processed for Western blot analysis of FN and FN-fs, while the adjacent specimens were incubated in culture media at 37 °C for 24 hours and then processed for Western blot analysis.

<title>FN Degradation Rates at Neutral and Acidic pH</title>
<p>At neutral pH 7.5, all 4 MMPs were able to degrade the intact FN, although at different rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947603511435273"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>). From the time course response of FN degradation by MMP-1, little or no cleavage of the FN was found up to 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947603511435273"><bold>Fig. 2C</bold></xref>). MMP-1 only generated 150-kDa FN-fs at pH 7.5 and was the least effective MMP in terms of FN cleavage at either neutral or acidic pH. MMP-3 was more efficient than MMP-1 at all time intervals but less than MMP-13 and -14. MMP-13 and -14 were the most effective in cleaving FN, and both degraded most of the intact FN by 24 hours.</p>
<p>Results from the time course response of FN degradation at acidic pH 5.5 found that MMP-3 and -13 were more effective in the digestion of the intact FN than MMP-1 and -14, in which no cleavage of FN was found by MMP-1 and -14 for up to 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947603511435273"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>). MMP-13 was found to rapidly cleave intact FN with more than 50% of cleavage by 2 hours, while MMP-3 was slightly more effective in cleaving the FN by 24 hours (MMP-3 digested 74% and MMP-13 digested 62% of the intact FN).</p>
<p>Because MMP-3 and -13 were effective at both neutral and acidic pH, the relative effects of pH on FN cleavage by MMP-3 and -13 were investigated by densitometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947603511435273"><bold>Figs. 2A</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947603511435273"><bold>3A</bold></xref>). For MMP-3, the analysis found a 1.0- to 1.4-fold increase in the cleavage (disappearance) of the intact FN at acidic pH 5.5 compared to neutral pH 7.5, while for MMP-13, there was a 1.3- to 1.5-fold increase in cleavage of the intact FN at neutral pH 7.5 compared to that at acidic pH 5.5. These results confirm that MMP-3 is more effective in cleaving FN at an acidic pH, whereas MMP-13 is more effective at neutral pH.</p>

MMP-1 and -14 were effective in cleaving FN only at neutral pH.

The 150- and 120-kDa FN-fs were detectable by both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, whereas the 100-, 70-, 52-, 32-, and 29-kDa FN-fs could only be detected by the polyclonal antibody.

<p>Only MMP-13 and -14 generated the smallest FN-fs, a 40-kDa fragment for MMP-13 and 53-, 32-, and 29-kDa fragments, respectively, and these only at neutral pH 7.5. The 40-kDa MMP-13–generated FN-fs appeared at 2 hours and slightly increased thereafter. The MMP-14 FN-fs only appeared after 24 hours of degradation. MMP-3, -13, and -14 also generated 70- and 120-kDa FN-fs, while MMP-1 did not.

<title>FN and FN-fs in Bovine Knee Cartilage</title>
<p>To determine whether similar FN-fs were present in normal knees, Western blot analyses were performed on articular cartilage from mature bovine knees. The presence of FN (intact) and FN-fs was measured in 4 different regions of the femoral condyles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1947603511435273"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>) from paired knees of a young adult and older animal. No visible signs of cartilage degeneration were noted at the time of necropsy. Analyses performed on cartilage at the time of harvest and after 24 hours in culture media found no statistical difference in the FN-fs between these 2 ages, and therefore, the data were combined. In addition, within each region, there was no significant difference between the young and old bovine specimens except for the right knee of the older animal, in which a 57-kDa FN-f was present in all regions of this knee but not found in any of the other regions of the other 3 knees. Thus, for statistical analyses (means ± standard deviations), the young and old bovine data for each region were combined (<italic>n</italic> = 8 specimens), while the 57-kDa FN-f is presented only for the one older knee (<italic>n</italic> = 2 specimens).</p>
<p>In all regions, there was a significant amount of intact FN (~220-240 kDa) and much smaller amounts of several small FN-fs of sizes of 57 kDa (old knee only), 31 kDa, 21 kDa, and 10 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1947603511435273"><bold>Fig. 6</bold></xref>). Statistical analysis found no significant difference in the amounts of intact FN or each of the FN-fs between the anterior and posterior regions of the medial and lateral condyles. When the amounts of intact FN and FN-fs in the anterior and posterior regions of the medial and lateral condyles were summed, the total FN content in the medial condyle was significantly greater than in the lateral condyle (1.01 ± 0.29 µg v. 0.50 ± 0.28 µg, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). However, except for the 57-kDa FN-f in the one knee, there was no statistical difference in the amount of FN-fs between the medial and lateral condyles, nor when the FN-fs were summed (total FN-fs, 0.09 ± 0.07 µg v. 0.07 ± 0.07 µg, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.1).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cartilage degradation is an early and sustained feature of arthritic disease and can be ascribed to 2 major proteolytic enzymes, aggrecanases, which mediate aggrecan breakdown, and collagenases, which mediate collagen breakdown as well as aggrecan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1947603511435273">8</xref></sup> Several studies suggest that FN-fs function as a major stimulus responsible for the induction of these proteolytic enzymes and exhibit biological properties that are distinct from the intact molecule, suggesting that proteolysis leads to the release of cryptic activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1947603511435273">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1947603511435273">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1947603511435273">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1947603511435273">42</xref></sup> Thus, identifying FN degradation enzymes and the resulting FN-fs could lead to a better understanding of arthritic diseases.</p>
<p>In this study, we measured the cleavage of intact human plasma FN by MMP-1, -3, -13, and -14 at 2 different pH values, acidic pH 5.5 and neutral pH 7.5, similar to studies on MMP-3 degradation of FN performed by Wilhelm <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1947603511435273">31</xref></sup> The concentrations of the MMPs were the same, 0.5 µg/mL, which is in the range of levels found in the synovial fluid from knee joints of patients with OA and RA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1947603511435273">43</xref></sup> We found that MMP-1, -3, -13, and -14 can degrade intact FN but with different efficiencies at neutral and acidic pH. After 24 hours’ incubation at acidic pH 5.5, MMP-3 and -13 degraded intact FN into FN-fs, whereas MMP-1 and -14 did not cleave the intact FN. MMP-3 was more effective at degrading FN than MMP-13 by 24 hours. At pH 7.5, these 4 MMPs were all able to cleave FN but at different efficiencies. MMP-13 and -14 were more effective than MMP-1 and -3. MMP-1 was the least effective MMP in cleaving FN.</p>
<p>Because MMP-3 and -13 were effective at both acidic and neutral pH, the effects of pH on intact FN cleavage by MMP-3 and -13 were compared. We found that MMP-3 was more effective at acidic pH 5.5, consistent with Wilhelm <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1947603511435273">31</xref></sup> whereas MMP-13 was more effective at neutral pH 7.5. Wilhelm <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1947603511435273">31</xref></sup> also reported that N-terminal sequence analysis revealed no pH-dependent change in the major proteolytic site of FN cleavage at the Pro<sup>689</sup>-Leu<sup>690</sup> bond. The differential efficiency of these 2 MMPs suggests that MMP-3 may have a greater role in FN degradation in degenerative joint disease processes where a decrease in pH may occur, such as reported in the ECM of normal and arthritic joints, in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid joints, and in the ECM of compressed articular cartilage. Wilkins <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1947603511435273">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1947603511435273">38</xref></sup> reported extracellular pH as low as 6.6 in normal, free-swelling articular cartilage. However, Jebens and Monk-Jones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1947603511435273">35</xref></sup> found no difference in the pH of the synovial fluid from normal (7.77 ± 0.04), traumatic injury (7.56 ± 0.03), and osteoarthritic knee joints (7.55 ± 0.04), which was similar to the pH in the blood (7.38 ± 0.01). On the other hand, Goldie and Nachemson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1947603511435273">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1947603511435273">40</xref></sup> found a significantly lower pH in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid knee joints (pH 6.61 ± 0.46 v. pH 7.30 ± 0.18 for normal). Possibly more important is when articular cartilage is compressed, as it would be from the joint loads generated during activities of daily living. As the cartilage is compressed, the interstitial fluid pH decreases concomitantly with loss of fluid from the ECM and increases in the fixed charge density of the ECM’s PG component.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1947603511435273">37</xref></sup> Based on a predictive model for interstitial fluid pH relative to the pH of the synovial fluid,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1947603511435273">41</xref></sup> a 50% compression of the ECM can decrease the pH in the microenvironment of the chondrocyte to pH 6.3 in a normal joint and as low as pH 5.9 in an RA joint. Even though the pH of OA joint synovial fluid is neutral, it might be possible that the microenvironment of the chondrocytes experiences even lower acidic pH values under conditions of increased ECM compression, such as occurs in OA where ECM degradation results in increased matrix permeability and compression. Additional studies will be needed to determine whether microenvironment pH changes contribute to the catabolic cleavage of the FN within the chondrocyte’s pericellular matrix and whether the increased catalytic efficiency of MMP-3 in the digestion of FN at pH 5.5 is the result of improved binding of MMP-3 to FN.</p>
<p>We identified several different MMP-generated FN-fs using both mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies. At neutral pH 7.5, MMP-1 produced a 150-kDa FN-f, while MMP-14 produced 150-, 120-, 100-, 70-, 52-, 32-, and 29-kDa FN-fs (note that while we quantitatively measured a 32-kDa fragment, this may also be 29-kDa FN-fs). Neither MMP cleaved FN at acidic pH 5.5. MMP-3 and -13 were effective at neutral and acidic pH. MMP-3 generated 150-, 120-, 88-, and 70-kDa FN-fs, while MMP-13 generated 150-, 120-, 83-, and 70-kDa Fn-fs. However, MMP-13 also generated a small 40-kDa fragment at pH 7.5, which was detectable as early as 2 hours. MMP-3 further degraded the 150-kDa fragment into smaller fragments including 120-, 88-, and 70-kDa FN-fs, and MMP-13 degraded the 150-kDa fragment into 70- and 40-kDa FN-fs. MMP-2 has also been reported to degrade FN, although not as efficient as MMP-3 and into FN-fs of different and larger sizes (180, 170, 160, 155, 90, and 65 kDa).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1947603511435273">34</xref></sup> These results indicate that MMP-3, -13, and -14 can degrade intact FN and large FN-fs at multiple and slightly different cleavage sites.</p>

Purified FN-fs were generated by cathepsin D and thrombin digestion of intact plasma FN, including the 29-kDa amino-terminal heparin-binding domain (HBD), the 35-kDa C-terminal HBD, the 50-kDa gelatin-binding domain (GBD), and the 140-kDa central cell-binding domain (CBD), the latter a mixture of 110- to 150-kDa fragments. The 29-kDa and 50-kDa FN-fs were the most potent, causing a 23- and 41-fold increase in PG release, respectively, at a 1 uM concentration, well below the estimated 0.5 µM concentration in diseased synovial fluid. The 35-kDa and 140-kDa FN-fs were the least active (1.3- and 8.2-fold increases, respectively), whereas the intact FN had little or no effect on PG release (1.3-fold). Only the combined 29-kDa and 50-kDa FN-fs increased the PG release (66%) greater than the individual FN-fs, while the 140-kDa FN-fs decreased their potency and appeared to bind to the cartilage and block these 2 FN-fs.</p>

<p>While all these FN-fs have been observed to trigger degradation of PG in cartilage explants, the 29-kDa N-terminal HBD FN-fs have been studied most extensively.

<p>Finally, we found several small FN-fs (10, 21, and 31 kDa) in the articular cartilage from visually healthy, adult bovine knees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1947603511435273"><bold>Fig. 6</bold></xref>). These FN-fs are in the size range as FN-fs reported to be inflammatory mediators of OA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1947603511435273"><bold>Fig. 7</bold></xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1947603511435273">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1947603511435273">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1947603511435273">50</xref></sup> In addition, we found a larger 57-kDa FN-f in one knee from the older animal, a size also considered a potent inflammatory mediator of OA. While FN-fs of similar size have been found in the articular cartilage and synovial fluid of arthritic human joints,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1947603511435273">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1947603511435273">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1947603511435273"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1947603511435273"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1947603511435273"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1947603511435273"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1947603511435273"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1947603511435273">18</xref></sup> FN-fs have not been reported for cartilage from healthy joints. It is interesting to speculate on whether these FN-fs are typical within the cartilage of healthy joints or whether this is a pathological condition for the initiation of OA. Because only 2 animals were analyzed, further studies will be needed to confirm these findings.</p>
<p>As in any study, there are limitations that could confound the experimental results. We used both a monoclonal and polyclonal anti-human plasma FN antibody to detect the FN-fs on Western blot analysis and to determine the sizes of FN-fs based on the intact FN (220 kDa) and 70-kDa and 30-kDa FN-f standards, which were separately incubated for 24 hours concomitantly with the MMP digestions. On Western blot analysis, the polyclonal antibody indicated a single 220-kDa fragment, while 2 additional FN-f bands were indicated above each of the FN-f standards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947603511435273"><bold>Figs. 2A</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1947603511435273"><bold>3B</bold></xref>). These additional FN-fs were not present on the Western blots with the monoclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947603511435273"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1947603511435273"><bold>2B</bold></xref>). We performed separate 24-hour incubations with intact FN and 30- and 70-kDa FN-fs in the different buffer solutions without MMPs (MES-HCL buffer, pH 5.5, and Tris-HCL buffer, pH 7.5) and performed Western blot analyses (data not shown). There was no degradation of the intact FN with either antibody or the 2 FN-fs with the monoclonal antibody, but again, the polyclonal antibody indicated 2 additional bands. Because these 2 additional bands for the 30- and 70-kDa FN-fs were not present in any of the MMP-digested lanes with either antibody, we concluded these bands were from impurities in the FN-f standards and not from autolytic digestion of the intact FN or the FN-fs. Thus, these impurities did not enter into our calculations for FN-f size. Furthermore, the FN fragments generated by the MMPs may have some proteolytic activity themselves, which could have different effects on the efficacy of the 4 MMPs. This could in part contribute to the differences observed in the FN cleavage rates; however, because the FN-f sizes were relatively similar between the MMPs, we do not believe they had a significant effect on the relative differences between the MMPs.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings suggest that MMP-13 and -14 may be the major enzymes responsible for the production of FN fragments. Because MMP-13 and -14 are known to be important for the progression of arthritis, our findings of the efficacy of FN cleavage and the fragment sizes produced by both MMPs further support the novel role of MMP-13 and -14 in the arthritic process and highlight them as possible therapeutic targets to limit joint inflammation and the degradation of the articular cartilage.</p>
