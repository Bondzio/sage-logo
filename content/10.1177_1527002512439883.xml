<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527002512439883">Szymanski (2012)</xref> states the following regarding our article (Winfree &amp; Fort, 2011).<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>We “claimed to clear up some confusion about the implications of contest theory and the game theoretic approach to modeling contests.”</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>We “claimed to show that the invariance principle can still survive in the game theoretic interpretation.”</p>

<p>Our suggested approach “was already fully and explicitly adopted…”</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>“The invariance principle cannot hold for any plausible contest success function.”</p>
</list-item>
</list>We reply as follows.<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>This statement is not pursued in the body of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527002512439883">Szymanski’s (2012)</xref> comment so we only respond that we feel we did so. This should be clear in what follows.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The tone of the comment (survival of the invariance principle) suggests that the point of our article was to somehow to take sides in a debate over the existence of the invariance principle. This was explicitly <italic>not</italic> our point. Our article is an attempt at a more general model of a sports league, expanding dimensions to include Nash conjectures for both closed and open leagues and the explicit presence of investment in talent, without functional forms. With such a model, future researchers can simply use it and impose whatever assumptions they choose while being forced to recognize their impact. We wrote the article to reduce confusion by making the role of assumption clearer in the context of our more general model with Nash conjectures and talent investment—assumptions about whether a league is open or closed, assumptions about contest success functions, or assumptions about the underlying talent investment market (not explicitly modeled prior to our effort in that direction). Our brief observations on a set of assumptions that lead to the type of invariance outcome for the closed league found in previous literature (one sentence in p. 5) simply served to emphasize the restrictive conditions needed to produce that outcome. Nowhere do we argue for or against these assumptions.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>It is certainly true, <italic>as we acknowledge explicitly</italic>, that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527002512439883">Szymanski (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527002512439883">Szymanski and Kesenne (2004)</xref> addressed the issue of talent and talent investment. In fact, much of the impetus of our article came from trying to convince authors and editors (as reviewers) that some of the work in the area still exhibited confusion regarding the relationship between open/closed leagues and talent level/talent investment and that they should read both of these article. However, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527002512439883">Szymanski (2004)</xref> addressed this issue in footnotes, and a restricted functional form was used to derive a single first-order condition in a single case in Appendix 2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527002512439883">Szymanski and Kesenne (2004)</xref>, neither the full exploration of the implications of the added dimension of talent investment nor anything about its relationship to the invariance principle appear in either one.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527002512439883">Szymanski’s (2012)</xref> point that assumptions are needed for the invariance principle to hold shows the value of our model—his point is made in the expanded modeling context we provide, where both Nash conjectures in the closed market case and talent investment are explicitly included as dimensions of the model. And now, as was our intent, the following is abundantly clear: It is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527002512439883">Szymanski’s (2012)</xref> assumptions on the contest success function and/or the relationship between talent and talent investment that leads to the invariance principle not holding, rather than some violation of Nash conjectures (his original contention in the 2004 piece, and his 2004 piece with Kesenne). That Szymanski argues about the reasonableness of his assumptions versus the plausibility of others is his prerogative but not really germane to the point of our article.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527002512439883">Szymanski’s (2012)</xref> comment serves to emphasize the benefit of focusing on a model that explicitly includes enough dimensions to (1) compare assumptions in a Nash world and (2) differentiate between a team’s talent <italic>investment</italic> and a team’s talent <italic>level</italic>. That was the point of our article. Szymanski may view <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527002512439883">El Hodiri and Quirk (1971)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527002512439883">Fort and Quirk (1995)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527002512439883">Vrooman (1995</xref>), followed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527002512439883">Szymanski (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527002512439883">Szymanski and Kesenne (2004)</xref>, followed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527002512439883">Eckard (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527002512439883">Fort and Winfree (2009)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527002512439883">Winfree and Fort (2011)</xref> as a tennis volley over the invariance principle. We do not. Instead, we hope that the field has benefitted and evolved from these discussions in terms of generating models that help explain sports leagues.</p>
