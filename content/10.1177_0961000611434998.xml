<p>This paper argues that researchers involved in cultural heritage preservation need to adopt a more inclusive ethnographic research methodology that pays special attention to how power, class, and status shape the communities we study. Based on observations from field research in Ghimeş-Făget, Romania, we discuss why the Hungarian ethnic identity was chosen as the village’s most visible representation although residents had many other identities from which to choose. We show how local efforts to preserve culture, history and self ‘in one direction’ were shaped by the current socio-economic reality in the village. Our findings suggest that identity selection is influenced by shifting power relations between ethnic groups over time as much as it is by the dominant ethnic group in a community. In an effort to show how existing research falls short, we discuss why one recently proposed ‘culturally responsive research methodology’ could not support any kind of legitimate preservation agenda in Ghimeş or any other community.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>When library and information science (LIS) researchers focus on the problems of preserving cultural heritage and indigenous knowledge, these efforts tend to focus on how we can work collaboratively to more equitably represent the history and heritage of previously marginalized or under-represented cultural and ethnic groups. One solution to the problem of working cross-culturally on preservation efforts is to rely on some form of collaborative or dialogue theory. Collaborative or dialogue theory places the burden of identifying the authentic culture or heritage on the ‘native’ informant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961000611434998">Crapanzano,1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961000611434998">Dwyer, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0961000611434998">Tedlock, 1986</xref>) One recent example is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434998">Becvar and Srinivasan’s (2009)</xref> culturally sensitive model for collaborative LIS research. Collaborative theory assumes that all a researcher has to do is ask a member of a community or cultural group about their culture and tradition and then preserve that ‘native’s’ response. The analytic struggle, according to those who use versions of collaborative theory, lies in the degree to which the scholar is willing to ‘give over’ control of the process. What collaborative theory does not acknowledge is the fact that there is not one ‘authentic’ heritage or knowledge system to be identified. Neither does it account for the fact that communities are not homogenous, even when all members are of the same ethnicity or culture. In this way collaborative theory seems epistemologically naïve because ignores the fact that the ‘native’ informant is as immersed in contextual-bounded ideas about culture and is as much a product of socio-economic or class status within society as is the LIS researcher.</p>
<p>This paper argues that LIS researchers and others involved in cultural heritage and indigenous knowledge identification and preservation need to adopt an ethnographic research methodology that includes ‘studying up’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961000611434998">Closet-Crane et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961000611434998">Fisher, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961000611434998">Herzfeld 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0961000611434998">Nader, 1972</xref>). This means that one has to take seriously issues like power and class hierarchies in order to better understand the wide range of social and political forces that shape and drive any preservation effort. Focusing on the position of the elites as much as the underserved ensures that ethnographic study includes a focus on the divisions that exist within any community. Studying ‘up’ as well as ‘down’ also requires ethnographers to pay special attention to how internal and external forces of power, class, and status shape communities. This type of inclusive approach also acknowledge and is able to handle analytically problems of cross-community ‘elite exchanges’ – a sociological characteristic of almost all cultural heritage projects including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434998">Becvar and Srinivasan’s (2009)</xref> but one that has not yet received the critical attention it deserves. Research that includes the widest range of community voices and that also uncovers the potential for unequal representation in preservation efforts should remind us that any community is made up of a variety of stakeholders who will be involved in creating what will be canonized as history, culture, knowledge, and tradition.</p>
<p>In the town of Ghimeş-Făget (Ghimeş), located in the Transylvania region of Romania, residents had a number of cultural or ethnic identities with which they could identify. In this paper, we discuss some of the factors that influenced their choice of one identity over the others. We focus on why the Hungarian identity was chosen as the most visible public representation of the village as a whole when in fact there were a variety of ethnic identities available to residents and residents themselves admitted some confusion over the definition of these various identities. We will show how these local efforts to preserve culture, history, and self ‘in one direction’ were shaped by the current socio-economic reality in Ghimeş. We suggest that identity selection is informed by shifting power relations between ethnic groups over time. In addition, we will show how the members of one ethnic group with more power and status in the community had more influence over the production, cultivation, and preservation of knowledge and the presentation of local history. This was true regardless of the fact that these representations did not reflect the community as a whole. Finally, in an effort to show how LIS research falls short, we will discuss why one recently proposed research methodology, namely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434998">Becvar and Srinivasan’s (2009)</xref> ‘culturally responsive research methodology’ could not have supported any kind of legitimate preservation effort in Ghimeş.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we suggest potential directions for those involved with the preservation of cultural heritage and indigenous knowledge. However, we do not attempt to present here any definitive answers. Rather, we hope to deepen the dialogue within the LIS research and broader preservation communities that includes archives and museums as well as libraries about how to develop more principled ways of acknowledging and dealing with the existence of so many conflicting versions of what constitutes culture, heritage, or history within any one community.</p>

<title>Power and hierarchy in preservation: Context</title>
<p>Historically, reviews of the preservation literature, such as those by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961000611434998">Croft (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961000611434998">Jordan (2000)</xref>, show a strong focus on the technical problems of preservation, while the greater social, economic, and political challenges inherent in preservation have received little attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961000611434998">Cloonan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961000611434998">Lloyd, 2007</xref>). One reason for this omission might be the ‘sub-politics’ in which preservation is carried out as a profession, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961000611434998">Brown and Davis-Brown (1998</xref>: 30) in their article on the politics of the archive in late capitalist societies:<disp-quote>
<p>In modern technicist cultures, where rationality itself has a major legitimating function, relations of power and domination often are masked by or reduced to technically instrumental relations of efficiency; that is, moral and political questions are displaced to nonmoral and nonpolitical technical or professional discourse, thereby establishing a ‘sub-politics’ that is available only to the initiated – experts, their paymasters and, occasionally, critical inquirers. This ‘sub-politics’ is the normal professional practice of archivists, librarians and curators. When strongly challenged, however, this technical-rational practice is breached and its political character becomes more publically evident.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While this insight might explain the lack of attention in the literature to the greater socio-economic implications of preserving the past it ignores the impact preservation efforts can have beyond the realm of the professional discourse. In other words, while Brown and Davis-Brown may be quite right in their analysis, what is not mentioned here is the fact that the ‘sub-politics’ both mirrors and is informed by socio-cultural forces outside the profession.</p>
<p>In order to move beyond the ‘sub-politics,’ this section will discuss the role of power and hierarchy in preservation. It will also highlight some of the broader trends in the literature on cross-cultural preservation. In particular, we note that researchers have a tendency to place too heavy an emphasis on the role of preservation in ‘saving’ cultures at risk of extinction based on factors such as globalization. Also, western-based preservationists, be they librarians, archivists, or curators, do not necessarily consider their position as elites and the role this plays in preservation efforts. These tendencies are present as much in global preservation efforts such as the UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000611434998">Blake, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0961000611434998">UNESCO, 2003</xref>) as they are in smaller-scale projects. We will show how the omission of discussion of the role of power in preservation efforts leads researchers to rely on and work from a series of misconceptions and assumptions, which in turn leads them to propose inadequate solutions to the challenges of cross-cultural preservation efforts. We will situate these problems using a recent example from the literature in order to ground these issues in practice as opposed to theory.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961000611434998">Klimaszewski et al. (2010)</xref> have looked at the preservation efforts of one western non-governmental organization (NGO) in the village of Viscri, Romania. In Viscri, this NGO chose to preserve the history and heritage of the local minority Saxon community over that of the local majority Romanian and Roma communities. The NGO favored the Saxon heritage in the village because the ‘traditional rural life’ of the Saxon villager had a romantic attraction for western tourists visiting the region under the guise of ‘cultural’ or ‘eco-’ tourism. In addition, Viscri had a vocal and active Saxon town representative: a local property owner whose family had a long history in the village. This local leader was well educated and relatively well travelled; in the past, she had worked with some American and European academics and she understood how to network and advocate for assistance from western development groups. In addition she knew how to present an image of her village that made it a marketable as a ‘commodity’ attractive to westerners and to the western media. Not only did the Saxon town leader’s efforts and cooperation with the NGO have beneficial effects on the local economy, the NGO itself stood to gain from its success in the region because increased tourism would likely mean continued and possibly additional financial support for the NGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961000611434998">Klimaszewski et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Arguably the most important point Viscri illustrates is that the Saxon heritage was selected for preservation not because it was any more authentic, traditional, or otherwise worthy of saving than the history and heritage of other groups who lived in the village. Rather, the traditional Saxon way of life was preserved because it was perceived as being more valuable as a commodity: it provided opportunities for economic development and growth in the village where few others existed. The western-based NGO was interested because of the romantic appeal of the Saxon heritage as a commodity and the Saxon leader was in a privileged position as the head of the village to participate in preserving a heritage she also shared. Voices of the majority Roma and Romanian community members were not given as much weight as those of the Saxon members because members of those groups did not have as much power and influence to advocate for their own self-interest. Regardless of the discrimination the Roma face throughout the world, it is also important to note that their heritage would likely not hold such a romantic attraction for western tourists and thus would not be as marketable by a development partner.</p>
<p>Viscri shows us how the process of selecting which culture or heritage to preserve inevitably leads to the history and heritage of one group coming to be preserved over that of others. Lloyd would argue that this is because the very act of selecting something for preservation, thereby assigning it significance, is in itself an act of power:<disp-quote>
<p>Significance is a social construct. Its meaning will always be a product of temporal, spatial and social considerations that are underpinned by social, political, historical, and economic acts. As a social action the designation of significance marginalizes minorities and effectively silences voices that may contest the dominant remembering of a community. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961000611434998">Lloyd, 2007</xref>: 63)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For better or worse, memory institutions – libraries, archives, and museums alike – are not neutral because the act of remembering – that is to say, memory itself is not neutral (Brown and Davis-Brown, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961000611434998">Lloyd, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961000611434998">Manoff, 2004</xref>). As noted by Pymm (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961000611434998">Lloyd, 2007</xref>: 4) ‘History is written by the victors’. The history of libraries, museums, and archives is therefore a study in the history of power (Brown and Davis-Brown, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0961000611434998">Rylance, 2006</xref>). Memory institutions are in the business of privileging information because of what they choose to preserve. This is why those involved in preservation need to be more aware, more vocal, and more public about their discussions of the greater social and political implications of preservation outside of just the professional realm.</p>
<p>In the past, colonialism fueled this power imbalance as the imperial powers of the West imposed their cultures on ‘the other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000611434998">Cloonan, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961000611434998">Laszlo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961000611434998">Munjeri, 1998</xref>). This dichotomy continues, knowingly or unknowingly, as those who lead preservation efforts bring with them ‘Western sensibilities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961000611434998">Cloonan, 2007b</xref>: 142) that are out of step with, if not foreign to, those constituents whom they would like to assist. We must remember that the impetus to preserve is neither a cultural imperative nor is it universal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961000611434998">Cloonan, 2007b</xref>). In Viscri, preservation became something of a top-down mandate, where village residents, whether Saxon or not, were ‘educated’ by NGO representatives to ‘save (their) village’ according to the NGO’s mandate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961000611434998">Klimaszewski et al., 2010</xref>). The NGO could do this (with varying degrees of success) because it could provide limited economic opportunity for community members in the absence of any others. However, this led to good intentions appearing more like cultural hegemony – the elites dictating what the heritage representation should be. One recent IMLS (Institute of Museum and Library Services) publication shows some understanding of the problem of the elite voice in preservation by noting that: ‘A paradigm shift away from traditional perceptions of culture as “elitist” was emphasized throughout the [IMLS-sponsored Connecting to the World’s Collections] seminar’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0961000611434998">Stoner, 2011</xref>: 3) However, it is not enough for the elites to decide that culture is no longer elitist – such an ideological shift or acknowledgement may in itself be an act of mystification.</p>
<p>The effects of uneven power relations can be particularly acute when those in the ‘developed’ world assist those who are still ‘developing’. Another way this plays out is in how the need to preserve takes on a sense of urgency – that preservationists are <bold>saviors</bold> who must rescue cultural heritages on the brink of extinction by forces like globalization (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000611434998">Blake, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961000611434998">Greyling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0961000611434998">Ogden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0961000611434998">Stevens, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0961000611434998">Sukula, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0961000611434998">UNESCO, 2003</xref>). This urgency was also present in Viscri, where the overarching message was for the villagers to not make the same mistakes we in the West have made, but to save their Saxon heritage at all costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961000611434998">Klimaszewski et al., 2010</xref>). However, this sense of urgency in the face of loss is not a new phenomenon. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961000611434998">Laszlo (2006)</xref> notes that the goal of early anthropologists was to document what were perceived as dying cultures in danger of being subsumed or obliterated by colonial forces. Again, it is necessary to look at history to understand present trends – as the next section of this paper will discuss in more detail – it is a mistake to assume that other cultures are somehow static or bounded because cultural heritage is constructed, that is to say it is as much a product of the influences of the present as of the past. Or as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0961000611434998">Rayward and Jenkins (2007</xref>: 362) put it, one function of cultural heritage is to ‘appropriate the past for present purposes’.</p>
<p>This is not to imply that all preservationists are unaware of how power has affected and biased heritage preservation (or lack thereof) of the cultures of marginalized groups in the past. The more recent trend is to overcome prior exclusion by encouraging participation by local community members and members of indigenous groups in the preservation of their own histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434998">Becvar and Srinivasan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000611434998">Cloonan, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961000611434998">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961000611434998">Lloyd, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0961000611434998">Ogden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0961000611434998">Srinivasan, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0961000611434998">2007</xref>). The UNESCO Convention on Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage is but one example of a response on the global level to the problem of overcoming unequal cultural representation. One goal of this Convention is to encourage cultural diversity and to preserve the rights of people of all cultures to ‘maintain their own distinct cultural identities and develop their cultures even when they are different from those of the cultural majority’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000611434998">Blake, 2002</xref>: 5). This Convention in particular is notable for taking the step to preserve beyond the tangible products – the objects – normally considered for preservation and is representative of a movement to provide a ‘broader anthropological notion of cultural heritage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961000611434998">Blake, 2002</xref>: v).</p>
<p>While this broadening of our perspectives on culture and heritage is an important development in shaping what gets preserved, it is also important to note that the UNESCO documents have been criticized for being too general, for providing inadequate definitions of cultural heritage, and for not being disseminated widely enough – that is, outside the field of preservation professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961000611434998">Cloonan, 2007a</xref>). We would argue that the UNESCO documents are subject to such criticism precisely because of those problems we present here: namely, the lack of attention paid to the greater social and political dimensions of preservation by researchers, the constructed nature of cultural heritage, the lack of consideration given to the problem of preservationists, and their own role as cultural elites as well as their link to indigenous elites.</p>
<p>A lack of attention to these more difficult issues leads researchers to provide solutions that are too simplistic. One example comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0961000611434998">Ogden (2007</xref>: 285) where she says: ‘A general understanding of various cultural practices and points of view, and a respect for these on the part of everyone involved are key to the appropriate care of cultural heritage’ but other references to the importance of ‘mutual respect’ and ‘understanding’ can also be found, for instance in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961000611434998">Buchanan (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0961000611434998">Overall (2009)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0961000611434998">Rylance (2006)</xref>. However, it is naïve to think that respect and understanding will overcome the history of cultural imperialism that has formed the basis for many memory institutions in the West. Respect and understanding are a common-sense approach to any working relationship, but they are inadequate in informing a research methodology. This is why we take issue, later in this paper, with one methodology in particular – the culturally responsive research methodology offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434998">Becvar and Srinivasan (2009)</xref>. We have chosen to discuss this method in depth because our research indicates that this methodology, despite its authors’ good intentions, cannot identify and overcome the problems of power and hierarchy in cross-cultural preservation. Our research shows that this methodology more than anything will perpetuate a sort of western imperialism that masquerades as ‘collaboration’. But in actuality what we have here are elites from both sides of the collaboration mutually reinforcing and legitimatizing one another. That is to say, the culturally responsive research methodology does not represent a true, well-informed collaboration that includes the voices of community members at all levels – including those with dissenting voices or the voices of the marginalized.</p>
<p>In this brief introduction to the problems of power and hierarchy in preservation, we have shown the influence of power and other socio-cultural elements can have on preservation efforts. We have also presented some trends identified in the literature that we feel can negatively impact preservation efforts if they go unquestioned. Preservationists need to be more aware of their position as elites and of how much their assumptions reflect western biases and categories, such as characterizing cultures as ‘endangered species’ that needs saving. Though preservationists have taken steps to overcome these problems by encouraging more community involvement in preservation efforts, the literature has not gone far enough. As we have shown here, the problems of preservation are complex, but the lack of attention to bias and culture leads researchers to offer inadequate and incomplete solutions to research and to pragmatic problems.</p>

<title>Understanding culture, ethnicity, and indigenous knowledge as constructed, not bounded</title>
<p>While preservation researchers often acknowledge that different constituencies play different roles in information and knowledge transfer, few have looked at how this plays out in specific contexts or in particular preservation efforts. One consequence of this has been that researchers privilege one segment of a community without realizing that other versions of culture and history exist. The following sections investigate the problems that arise when different definitions of history, culture, and tradition are held by different groups within the same community. Understanding how each group wields different degrees of power to enact their definitions will add depth and rigor to cultural heritage preservation efforts. We will show how mainstream social science theory has begun to question whether these concepts can simply be understood as unchanging as cultural heritage and indigenous knowledge are no longer seen as fixed reflections of a static history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611434998">Handler and Linnekin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961000611434998">Herzfeld, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes in social science theory has been the acceptance of the idea that societies and groups cannot be characterized by shared beliefs but by different understandings and definitions of those shared beliefs. Implicit in this understanding is not just the acknowledgement that a variety of cultural beliefs exist but also that the beliefs themselves undergo constant modification. An important impetus for this change in theory began with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961000611434998">Fredrik Barth’s (1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961000611434998">1969)</xref> understanding of ethnicity. In his work on ethnic identity among Pathans of Afghanistan and Pakistan Barth was one of the first to redefine the notion of ethnicity (and culture) as a construct rather than as a set of elements and traits embedded in the heart and mind. Barth argued that ethnic identity was not the reflection of unchanging traits, values, and beliefs. Rather he viewed ethnic identity as a product created by individuals with an eye toward the situation to which an individual is responding. Ethnicity is thus something that can be manipulated and that reflects, according to Barth, the context and situation in which it is present. This is also the position taken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961000611434998">Michael Moerman (1965)</xref> who argued that the critical question when studying ethnicity is not the identification of the (presumed) array of traits that define ethnic identity but rather when and in what situation people choose to offer ethnicity as an aspect of their identity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961000611434998">Moerman (1965)</xref> suggests that ethnicity is a process of self-identification and, as such, is impermanent and that changes in identity reflect the variety of situations in which an individual finds himself or herself.</p>
<p>The definition of culture has undergone similar revisions. Anthropologists no longer think of ‘culture’ as a disembodied configuration of behaviors, traits, values, and practices. Today culture is primarily seen as a claim about an individual’s identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0961000611434998">Wright, 1998</xref>). We must question when, why, and how an individual chooses to claim one cultural identity from all the identities or roles available to him or her, which could just as easily include gender, class, education, age, kinship, or any number of other roles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961000611434998">Ulf Hannerz (1997)</xref> went on to argue that not only must we stop assuming that cultures are bounded units with sharp lines of demarcation between them, we must also shift our analytic attention from the notion of bounded cultures to that of cultural borderlands. Rather than seeing these borderlands as impenetrable boundaries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961000611434998">Hannerz (1997)</xref> sees them as sites of interaction and places where individuals experience different ways of being and acting in the world. Cultural borderlands can be sites of creativity and change as much (or more) than they are places of dislocation and anomie. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961000611434998">Hannerz (1997)</xref> then, culture is about the diasporas, exiles, cosmopolitanisation, hybridity, synergy, and creolization that emerge from border (culture) crossings. What Hannerz also suggests is that much of what constitutes culture and society has this impermanent quality, too, even that which is perceived as ‘timeless’, ‘stable’, or ‘traditional’.</p>
<p>The acceptance of constructed, negotiated cultural and ethnic identities makes it difficult to claim that one cultural or ethnic group has one history or heritage that reflects that group’s ‘authentic’ culture because culture or heritage varies not only from individual to individual, but also for the same individual over time. These ideas can and should also be extended to the concept of indigenous knowledge. The term indigenous itself is problematic, as it was used to replace terms like ‘primitive’ and ‘tribal’, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0961000611434998">Purcell (1998</xref>: 259) explains were ‘both loosely used to designate all seemingly culturally homogenous, non-Caucasian groups encountered as Europeans expanded into the so-called non-Western world’. Though indigenous may be a term with a ‘less hegemonic connotation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0961000611434998">Purcell, 1998</xref>: 259), the term indigenous continues to be inaccurately equated with people who have ‘a homogenous, pan-identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961000611434998">Bowery and Anderson, 2009</xref>: 488) or whose lifestyles have an ‘apparent static “boundedness’’’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961000611434998">Bowery and Anderson, 2009</xref>: 490). But most anthropologists would agree that what we characterize as indigenous knowledge is neither static nor bounded nor easily definable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961000611434998">Bowery and Anderson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0961000611434998">Purcell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0961000611434998">Sillitoe, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0961000611434998">Sillitoe (1998</xref>: 232–233) further adds that: ‘Indigenous knowledge is not locally homogenous. Differences will exist along gender, age, class, occupational, and other lines’.</p>
<p>What the terms indigenous knowledge, ethnicity, and cultural heritage share is that they are used to identify and codify ways of life or ways of thinking different than our own. This is one variant of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961000611434998">Hannerz’s (1997)</xref> cultural borderland where we observe how we think or act one way (the correct way) and how another thinks or acts another way – one that we do not completely understand. Of course this is an oversimplification of how we arrive at the characterization of the West and the ‘other.’ But understanding how we arrive at this dichotomy is critical if it is to be overcome in preservation efforts. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0961000611434998">Purcell (1998</xref>: 264) describes: ‘The set of increasingly encompassing geo-political power relations that we call colonialism was deeply rooted in the epistemological dyad of the knowing subject and the unknowing object [of study]’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961000611434998">Bowery and Anderson (2009</xref>: 490) further argue:<disp-quote>
<p>The denial of complex local and global historical processes that factor into the creation of Indigenous identities often results in a reliance on imperially informed dualism of indigenous/non-indigenous, developing/developed, or Western/non-Western that serves to create a sense of ‘otherness’ when referring to Indigenous communities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This colonial past is just as present in today’s processes of globalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0961000611434998">Purcell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0961000611434998">Sillitoe, 1998</xref>). It colors our preservation efforts and leads us to approach cultural heritage and indigenous knowledge as ‘endangered’ ways of life that we must ‘save’ before they are ‘lost’ forever. This stance overlooks the fact that indigenous knowledge and culture are constantly evolving, as are our own understandings about what culture, ethnicity, and knowledge systems are. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0961000611434998">Sillitoe (1998</xref>: 230) points out:<disp-quote>
<p>Indigenous knowledge systems are rarely if ever isolated from the rest of the world; people will incorporate and reinterpret aspects of Western knowledge and practice into their traditions as part of the ongoing process of globalisation . . . Indeed, while knowledge never stands still, development advocates contemplate accelerating its change – dramatically modifying indigenous knowledge systems in the long run a scientific perspective. The tenacity with which people hold onto their cultural traditions, even going to war to defend them, suggests that this is unlikely in the foreseeable future.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We have argued that the concepts of culture, ethnicity, and indigenous knowledge are problematic because they are not, as is often assumed, bounded units that can be easily identified and captured for preservation. Culture and knowledge that we may characterize as being on the verge of extinction have, in fact, been continually changing and developing over time. When we speak of culture and heritage in this way, it ignores or downplays the fact that members of these culture groups are social actors that have at least some control over their futures. While such attitudes can reflect the uneven power relations of the colonial past, members of indigenous or ethnic communities, like members of any community, are social actors who can form and advance their own cultural or indigenous identities and agendas. In the next section, we expand on this idea of the individual as a social actor in order to discuss how identity is constructed and re-constructed based on how an individual interprets his or her situation in the present.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0961000611434998">
<title>Identity, power, and preservation</title>
<p>To overcome the difficulties we face when dealing with the social phenomena like culture and ethnicity at least two very important factors must be considered when deciding which representations of cultural heritage or indigenous knowledge are to be preserved: (1) the context in which particular statements about culture are made; and (2) the social status of the person making the statements about culture. This analytic challenge poses serious problems for collecting and preserving cross-cultural knowledge, particularly when those trying to solve the problem assume that the indigenous or ‘native’ person by definition holds a privileged position vis-à-vis his/her own history and culture and can simply identify ‘authentic’ tradition.</p>
<p>When members of a cultural or ethnic group make statements about their cultural identity they refer to cultural heritage as they understand it in relation to a particular situation. These situations or contexts are typically not things of the past but things of the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961000611434998">Handler and Linnekin, 1984</xref>). Therefore, in order to understand social action in a cultural context, we must envision an actor who is capable of creating a variety of identities he or she can draw upon to position oneself in relation to specific ongoing social action. This construction of identity is not entirely free choice but is influenced by, among many other things, one’s socio-economic or class status. This positioning includes assumptions about how the actor wants to be treated, how he or she has been treated in the past and why that treatment did or did not occur. In other words, statements about identity are always suggestions for or explanations regarding ongoing behavior.</p>
<p>Therefore, understanding cultural heritage means both understanding how individuals believe they got to their current situation and learning what they would like to see happen to them now and in the future. Because this will vary not only between groups but also among individuals, we must understand that this can lead to the creation of a number of ‘authentic’ histories based on which elements of the past and present an individual selects to inform his current statements about identity and his world. But understanding history as an interpretative process that occurs in the present is only a part of the new analytic story. While individuals can present different versions of the past based on the events of the present, they will also have different resources available to them that will allow them to make their versions of the past seem more persuasive than others. This is why we must more closely consider the role power plays in social definition, socio-cultural action and the interpretation of both past and present.</p>
<p>Each individual who offers his or her view of cultural heritage does so from a specific class position. Among some Native American groups, for example, elders may have more power because of their age. Among matrilineal groups, women may have more power within the clan than the men who marry into the clan. Certainly in the industrial world, economic and political power is unequally distributed and those we define as ‘elites’ have not only more power but more different kinds of power than do those who lack, for instance, money or political influence. Those with economic and political power also have more resources and means to enact their visions of culture and history than do those who are poorer or less well connected. Because of the differential power ‘ratios’ individuals bring to the construction and definition of tradition, we must be careful to include the poor as well as the powerful when we attempt to preserve indigenous history, knowledge, and culture.</p>
<p>In anthropology, the study of the impact of social, political, and economic resources on an individual’s or group’s ability to make their version of history the accepted version leads us to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0961000611434998">Laura Nader’s (1972)</xref> idea of ‘studying up’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0961000611434998">Nader (1972)</xref> argues that cross-cultural studies are only partially complete if they do not take into account all those who make up a community ranging from the poor to the elite. Today in anthropology this is taken for granted: we attempt to study community members of all socio-economic levels in order to better understand that community. As researchers and preservationists, we must be more thorough in our identification of stakeholders and of the positions they bring to our preservation projects. As we engage in cross-cultural preservation efforts, we should try to uncover and analyze the power dynamics within the communities who have asked for our assistance. We must also include those powerful institutions and individuals which are outside the community but still influence the community we are assisting or studying. This includes recognizing (and factoring in) our own role as elites in preservation efforts. In short, we need to consider how our goals and intentions effect how we act as ‘stakeholders’ in the preservation efforts we carry out.</p>

<title>The research project</title>
<p>This section will discuss some aspects of the community-based research that we conducted in Ghimeş-Faget (Ghimeş), Romania, in which many of the issues already discussed become central to our work. Ghimeş is a community with a plethora of ethnic and cultural identities that inhabitants alternately claimed, rejected, and modified, often while contradicting themselves and others. Depending on the identity selected, very different narratives of history and tradition were offered. Conflicting historical narratives and often heartfelt declarations of ethnic identity made to researchers during interviews sometimes changed in light of the economic opportunities developing in this very poor community. Finally this was a community that pinned many of its hopes for economic improvement on a particular kind of tourism based on cultural heritage.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Fieldwork took place over three weeks in May–June 2008 in the village of Ghimeş, Romania. The research group was let by Gail Bader and James M Nyce, both from the Department of Anthropology at Ball State University. Nyce also taught for nine years in an ALA accredited LIS program and has a docent from Linköping University in Information Science. These professors brought 11 students to Ghimeş to introduce them to ethnographic field research. The student group included graduate and undergraduate students from Ball State and LIS graduate students from Drexel University and Florida State University. This was the fourth such trip led by Bader and Nyce, who began their survey of villages in Transylvania in 2003. These prior community studies focused on information and knowledge use in pre- and post-revolution Romania and continued research Bader and Nyce had carried out with previous students (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961000611434998">Beasley and Nyce, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961000611434998">Closet-Crane et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961000611434998">Klimaszewski and Nyce, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961000611434998">Klimaszewski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961000611434998">Littrell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0961000611434998">Whipple and Nyce, 2007</xref>). Two graduate students attending the 2008 fieldwork in Ghimeş also took part in the 2007 community study of Viscri (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961000611434998">Beasley and Nyce, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961000611434998">Klimaszewski and Nyce, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961000611434998">Klimaszewski et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Qualitative data was collected in a series of in-depth interviews, lasting at least one hour with each informant. Approximately 30 interviews were conducted, and some informants were interviewed multiple times. As with our previous ethnographic studies in Romania, informant selection took account of demographic, ethnic, social, and economic variables and care was taken to include community members of various ethnicities and economic statuses. Members of the team broke into small groups in order to interview community members. Whenever possible, interviews were recorded with the informant’s permission and transcripts were made of the interviews. Interviews were conducted using interpreters (one teacher and two students) proficient in English, Hungarian, and Romanian. When possible in this mainly Hungarian region, our guide, a native Romanian speaker who has studied English at university, acted as a translator as well. This guide has worked with Bader, Nyce, and their students before in community studies of the Romanian villages of Hoteni and Viscri. As in prior field research, field notes were taken by all members of the research team both during interviews and also to record impressions and observations while traveling around the village. While in the field, the group met regularly to discuss findings, review the literature, and to better refine research over the course of the study visit.</p>
<p>Fieldwork in Ghimeş was different from prior fieldwork experiences in Romania in a number of ways. First, the village was much larger than previous villages (5300 inhabitants, where other villages had fewer than 1000). As such, the village had a library, two small museums, two churches, multiple schools, and an established tourist infrastructure that catered mainly to Hungarians. We underestimated the challenges posed by being in this ethnically Hungarian village. For instance, the number of informants who spoke little or no Romanian often posed a challenge for our Romanian-speaking guide. Interestingly, fewer informants than before were comfortable having their discussions with us recorded. Also in general, it was more difficult to identify informants and arrange interviews. Although this changed after we had been in the village for some time, snowballing (of informants and interviews) was not as successful as it had been in previous research visits. The more use we made of Hungarian interpreters, the more successful both snowballing and conducting interviews became.</p>
<p>Two local events also made this a more difficult field research experience. First, mayoral elections were being held during our visit, so campaigning occurred while we were in the field. At least one informant, who we interviewed twice, both before and after the election, said that he felt more comfortable speaking with us after the elections were over. The other event was the anniversary of the 1920 Treaty of Trianon. This treaty redefined Hungary’s borders and gave Transylvania to Romania. The significance of this anniversary will be explained in more detail in the next section.</p>

<title>Transylvania as a borderland: History and background</title>
<p>Any discussion of the history of Transylvania is best prefaced by anthropologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0961000611434998">Katherine Verdery’s (1983</xref>: 19) observation that: ‘The more I have read of Transylvanian history, the more convinced I have become that an objective rendering of this history is almost impossible’. It is not possible to attempt to even identify, let alone understand and preserve, the cultural heritage and local knowledge of the people of Ghimeş without understanding the history of the ethnic groups that have inhabited Transylvania for centuries. This section outlines some of the main historical events that have affected relations between the region’s two largest and most powerful ethnic groups: the Hungarians and the Romanians. This will place the problems of cultural preservation in Ghimeş in an historical context. It will also help to illustrate the importance of class, ethnicity, and religion in determining social relations in Ghimeş.</p>
<p>Over the past several centuries, Transylvania has been ruled by the Hungarian kingdom, the Ottoman Empire, the Hapsburg Empire, and the Hungarian state. The region came under Romanian rule in 1920 when the Treaty of Trianon moved the border between Hungary and Romania to its current-day position. Transylvania’s shifts in borders and socio-political allegiances over centuries have led to a ‘fluid’ concept of nation-state. This is a concept which most Anglo-Saxons have difficulty with because of our tendency to assume that geographical and political boundaries tend to be fixed and are largely non-negotiable. This has seldom been the case in Europe, at least at the end of the 20th century. It is also important to understand that the concept of ethnicity at work in Transylvania is not the same as in the West. That is to say, ethnicity cannot be tied to or equated with a single place or nation-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0961000611434998">Verdery, 1983</xref>: 15).</p>
<p>Given this, it should not be surprising then that even historians believe that there are not one but many histories of Transylvania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611434998">Boia, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0961000611434998">Verdery, 1983</xref>). Again this becomes problematic for many LIS researchers and scholars whose views of history, nation, and ethnicity can be ‘out of step’ with those of the communities where they engage in preservation efforts. In Transylvania, different ethnic identities have been able to thrive not so much because there are ‘cultural walls’ that kept each group ‘intact’ through rules of segregation and exclusion but, on the contrary, they have managed to develop and survive precisely because of the cultural interaction, negotiation, and conflict that have taken place in Transylvania throughout most of its known history. In fact, one could argue that Transylvania exemplifies what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961000611434998">Hannerz’s (1997)</xref> meant by a ‘cultural borderland’.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961000611434998">Barth (1969)</xref>, one would argue that it was precisely this constant interaction between the different ethnic groups that has kept ethnic identity relevant and fostered identity creation and negotiation. One example of identity creation in Ghimeş is that of the Csango. The Csango are putatively a ‘blend’ of Hungarian and Romanian, descended from earlier groups of settlers from Moldavia. Because of its geography, Transylvania was often a destination point for groups of people, Romanians and Hungarians, running away from larger, more powerful groups especially during the times of war. Those who eventually became the Csango settled in an isolated area where they could avoid the authorities, hide from enemies and avoid the world. Because of their relative isolation, the Csango have become recognized as a bastion of traditional ways, untouched by modernization. Both ethnic Romanians and Hungarians agree that the Csango living in the Ghimeş area are the inheritors of traditional, ancient, and authentic culture, though we will show that ideas about what exactly constitutes this traditional Csango culture have remained open to interpretation even today.</p>
<p>Periods of oppression of one group by another could have kept Romanian, Hungarian, and Csango ethnicities strong because each group could define itself in opposition to a demonized other. For instance, between the Hungarians and Romanians, the group in power at any one time typically did not allow school instruction in the native language of the other. Furthermore, the group in power at any time might physically retaliate against the other for public displays of ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0961000611434998">Verdery, 1983</xref>: 264). Obviously, this type of oppression is one reason why an objective history of Transylvania is impossible – because it depends so strongly on the member of which ethnic group you ask (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611434998">Boia, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Several recent historical events have, once again, created shifts in power which have affected relations between ethnic groups. One was the 1848 Hungarian revolution that led to the creation of a Hungarian state-like entity in 1867 and provided new (and more) opportunities for ethnic Hungarians in Transylvania than Romanians. Another such event occurred in 1918, when the border between Hungary and Romania was moved so that Transylvania became part of Romania. As Transylvania came under Romanian control, ethnic Romanians in the region gained more power and access to higher positions of authority than was ever before possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961000611434998">Boia, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>From 1944–1989, the communist leadership in Romania exacerbated (and exploited) tensions in Romanian-Hungarian ethnic relations in Transylvania. One goal of the communist regime was to ‘purify’ the Romanian population. This meant that Hungarians (and others) were not allowed to speak Hungarian, Hungarians could no longer have their own schools where instruction was in Hungarian, nor were Hungarians able to practice Roman Catholicism, their religion. Since the 1989 revolution, Hungarians have been free to do all of these things but the effects of communist repression still linger.</p>

<sec id="section8-0961000611434998">
<title>Research findings</title>
<p>Today, Ghimeş is a large village located in central Romania. The primary ethnic groups living there include but are not limited to ethnic Hungarians, Romanians, Csango, and Roma. As was the case in other Romanian villages we studied, the Roma were marginalized but ubiquitous. We did have some prior knowledge of Ghimeş’ identity as a Hungarian, Romanian, and Csango village. We also looked carefully at how a variety of tourist guidebooks portrayed the village. One guidebook in particular emphasized that in Ghimeş, even the Roma were fully integrated in all aspects of village life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961000611434998">Buford et al., 2004</xref>). Nearly all of the tour books we surveyed emphasized the importance of Ghimeş as a Csango stronghold. Ghimeş, these books claimed with varying degrees of fervency, is the one place in Transylvania one might still find the ‘authentic’ Csango traditional culture. One Hungarian-American member of our group whose family was from a nearby village told us that Ghimeş was a Hungarian village, and the importance the Hungarian identity had in Ghimeş was repeated in the Romanian tourist information provided to us by our Romanian guide.</p>
<p>This was all in contrast to official census figures, which report that as of 2002, the ethnic breakdown of the 5300 residents of Ghimeş was: 51% Hungarian, 47% Romanian, less than 1% Roma, and just over 1% Csango (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961000611434998">Ethnocultural Diversity Resource Center, 2002</xref>). Given that people in the national census can identify as only one of four ethnicities (Hungarian, Romanian, Roma, Csango), it appears at least from these figures that the village is not so overwhelmingly Hungarian. Therefore, one of our central research questions was to learn who identified with what ethnic identity, why they did so, and when they did so. Because we had read that we were coming to a Csango region, we were also curious to learn more about Csango history and culture.</p>
<p>We were surprised to learn that while both ethnic Romanians and Hungarians agreed that the Csango living in the Ghimeş area are inheritors of a traditional, ancient, and authentic culture, they disagreed on what culture the Csango in fact represented. Some Romanians claimed the Csango were ethnic Romanians, others claimed they were ethnic Hungarians. Some Hungarians (and scholars) believe that the Csango were ethnic Hungarians. Others still said that Csango were a ‘blend’ of Romanian and Hungarian, but were largely Hungarian. Some Ghimeş residents claimed that they are Csango regardless of their ethnic heritage because ‘anyone born here (i.e. in the general region) is Csango.’ Some Ghimeş residents who identified as ethnic Hungarian also told us that they were always Hungarian but that they had started to say they were Csango after hearing a radio program about the Csango. The only thing everyone seemed to agree on is that the Csango today were and are holders of almost lost authentic traditions. Note, however, that informants were unable to provide any sort of consensus on exactly what constituted the ‘authentic’ Csango traditions and culture.</p>
<p>As we have mentioned, prior to 1918, the village was on the border between Hungary and Romania. Although the border shifted over 90 years ago, the event was still very fresh in the minds of the local Hungarian population. Nor had this event become part of just some institutional memory of the place. For instance, on the 90th anniversary of the border shift, we noticed an increased security presence (police and domestic/military undercover agents) in the village. Our Romanian guide told us that she had read stories in the Romanian media that Hungarian nationalists had threatened to set fires at the site of the old border. There was also rumor of weapons caches. But it was never clear which parties had put weapons aside or for what reason. Still, while Romanians certainly could (and did) provide detailed accounts of a history of oppression under Hungarian rule, what was memorialized in Ghimeş were stories of the oppression and loss experienced by the ethnic Hungarian community.</p>

<title>Cultural heritage, local institutions, and identity</title>
<p>From the outset, the Hungarian ethnicity was the one that appeared to be the most obviously represented in Ghimeş, while official representations of other cultures seemed to us to be muted. From the moment we arrived in the village, we observed local attempts to preserve Hungarian culture and history in Ghimeş. The owner of the guesthouse where we stayed also provided a cultural tourism program geared mainly towards Hungarian tourists who came by the busload from Hungary to visit Ghimeş. We witnessed these tour groups eating ‘traditional’ Hungarian meals while watching some local residents perform songs and dances in presumably traditional costume. Presiding over all this was a large, 10-foot-tall wooden sculpture of St Stephen, the first king of Hungary and the nation’s patron saint. After the meal, there was more song and dance in which the audience participated. The tourists could then walk to the nearby history/railroad museum (also owned by the guesthouse owner) that stands at the site of the old border and climb up to visit the ruins of the old border fortresses. The program culminated back at the guesthouse in a singing of the Hungarian national anthem, during which it was common to see any number of the audience members, young and old, be moved to tears. While we observed this program at least three to five nights a week during our three weeks in Ghimeş, we were never invited to participate.</p>
<p>As a part of our community-based ethnography we interviewed representatives from each of the educational and cultural institutions in the village. This included the woman who founded and ran the Hungarian ethnography museum, the librarian from the local public library, the principals from the Romanian and Hungarian schools, a former railroad employee who was the organizer of the history/railroad museum, a local researcher of the Csango, and our pension owner/cultural tourism operator. We also spoke to the priests at the village’s two churches, one Orthodox and the other Roman Catholic. Attendance at the two churches in the village generally breaks down along ethnic lines – Romanians are Orthodox while Hungarians are Roman Catholics. The main cultural and religious leaders in Ghimeş all self-identified as ethnic Hungarians or Csango except for the librarian, the Orthodox priest, and the Romanian school principal, who said they were Romanian.</p>
<p>The history of the region presented to us by our Hungarian guesthouse owner was the Hungarian version. What follows is the presentation he gave to us when we first arrived as translated by our guide:<disp-quote>
<p>Ghimeş was part of the Kingdom of Hungary for 1000 years. People lived in traditional ways in the valley, growing flax and hemp from which they made their traditional costumes, working in forestry and trading wood for other staples, like corn, that they could not grow because of the colder mountain climate. Ghimeş and the surrounding valley was the only place in the Carpathians where it was possible to build the railroad in 1896, so Ghimeş became a key passage between Transylvania and the neighboring province of Moldova. Today, the border is no longer there.</p>
<p>During communist times, Hungarians were more oppressed by the regime because they were forced to assimilate – to become Romanian. After the revolution, there was a change in attitude about this. Democracy and the European Union allow for fewer ethnic conflicts as individuals are free, more or less, to be what they want to be. During communism, Hungarian schools were closed – today in the village there are separate Romanian and Hungarian schools. The first is supported by the state, the second by the Roman Catholic Church and other private and public Hungarian institutions. For 36 years, Hungarians were not allowed to have their own schools.</p>
<p>The communist era ruined trust between ethnicities – so now there is not a push for Romanian/Hungarian combined schools. Individuals today have the ‘choice’ about where to attend school. Hungarians, generally, became separatists after the revolution. (Interview with guesthouse owner, 23 May 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The guesthouse owner ended his talk by stressing the importance of respect and acceptance of others and the need for ethnic Romanians and Hungarians to live together in peace. He also stressed the importance of people being allowed to keep their own language and said that by losing their language, people lose their identity. This sentiment – that there was not much strife or animosity today between Romanians and Hungarians in the village – was echoed by several other community members, including the Roman Catholic and Orthodox priests and the Chief of Police.</p>
<p>While our pension owner focused on the Hungarian history of the region, the woman who ran the local ethnographic museum explained to us that she preserved not just Hungarian but also Csango culture. She explained that Csango was a mixture of Hungarian and Romanian, but she stressed that it was ‘Hungarian first’ (interview with ethnographic museum owner/director 26 May 2008). She also mentioned that the term Csango sometimes carries a negative connotation, because of the historical circumstances that brought Hungarians to the region. They largely came to hide in a difficult-to-traverse, mountainous area where they often chose to wear Romanian clothing to further hide their identities. Still in the village, Csango is largely seen as a blend of Hungarian and Romanian. This was confirmed by our pension owner, the Roman Catholic priest, and the Csango scholar. However, only one of them, the Csango scholar, told us, like the museum director, that the term Csango might be considered derogatory. This helps explain why the railroad history museum operator when asked about his cultural identity replied: ‘I am Csango, and I am proud to be Csango’ (interview with history/railroad museum operator, 3 June 2008).</p>
<p>However, the one place where Hungarian culture or traditions were not represented was in the public library in Ghimeş. As we noted before, the librarian was an ethnic Romanian in a predominantly Hungarian village, where the local leadership today is Hungarian. She had been the librarian in Ghimeş since 1977. The library had no holdings in Hungarian, nor were there any books on the history or traditions of the Csango or Hungarians. The librarian told us that she did receive some support from the local administration for the upkeep of the library, but none to acquire new library materials. The library was located centrally, near the village’s city hall. However, it was on the second floor of a building, and at a side entrance that was not very easy to locate. Very few if any of the village informants we spoke to had ever visited the library, and one did not know there was even a library in town. The two museums in Ghimeş village resident knew more about since they were on the village’s main road and, unlike the library, were also well marked.</p>
<p>The Romanians’ claims we encountered about their ethnic identity were not involved so much with what defined Romanian culture and tradition as much as with illustrating how being Romanian in a predominantly Hungarian village put them at a disadvantage. For instance, in the Romanian school, the principal emphasized that the school did not have enough money for supplies or for computer technology because it was a Romanian school (in an ethnically Hungarian village). In the same way, the librarian explained that the differences in ethnicity led to her not getting adequate support from the local government (interviews with librarian, 26 May 2008 and 4 June 2008). An additional example was given by one of our interpreters, a Hungarian teacher, who told us that the Minister of Information Communication and Technology in Romania was Hungarian and that he was installing wireless access points in only the many ethnically Hungarian villages around the country. She emphasized that this was something many ethnic Romanians were unhappy about.</p>
<p>We encountered both Hungarian/Csango and Romanians who emphasized how well people generally got along in the village. Remarks included things like – the Romanian people were not bad, just the politicians. The Roman Catholic priest described ethnic tensions in the village as just ‘post-revolution political issues’ that made for problems where none truly existed. However, he also mentioned other nearby ethnic Hungarian villages along the old border which have more recently been described as only Romanian. The villagers, he said, did not protest this ethnic definition, and eventually assimilated. But the priest also described this process as one in which the Hungarian culture or identity was being ‘stolen’ (interviews with the Roman Catholic priest, 23 May 2008 and 5 June 2008).</p>

<title>Other claims to ethnic identity in Ghimeş</title>
<p>The majority of informants we spoke to in Ghimeş identified as Hungarian, Romanian, or Csango. In one case, a villager said that he was Csango, but later told a Hungarian member of our group (in Hungarian) that he was Hungarian. The reasons individuals gave for identifying as Hungarian or Csango included: one or both of their parents were Hungarian, they spoke the Hungarian language, and/or they lived in a Hungarian/Csango region. Most also indicated that they tried to follow or keep up with some of the ‘authentic’ traditions but told us that it was hard to pass these down from generation to generation because younger people did not care so much about traditions and also they usually had to move away from the region to find jobs, so they had fewer and fewer ties to the area.</p>
<p>We met a few old women who had or still made traditional crafts such as weaving and embroidery. On at least two occasions, we were invited into village homes to view the women’s ‘dowry rooms’. This is the one room of the house where the collection of handmade items is kept and displayed. In the past, women made crafts and then passed them down to their daughters or daughters-in-law when they got married, but at least one Ghimeş woman said that her daughter-in-law had no interest in having the traditional items she had made, and preferred new manufactured items instead.</p>
<p>Identity claims, we found, were varied in Ghimeş. Of the more interesting identity claims we encountered were from two Roma men (identified to us as Roma by another villager) who identified themselves to us as Csango because they spoke the Hungarian language and because they lived in the Csango region. It is not uncommon for Roma to self-identify as Romanian because of the negative connotations associated with being a Roma, but it was interesting to note that in this largely Hungarian/Romania/Csango community, they identified as Csango because of their ties to the region. However, these men were not identified to us as Hungarian or Csango by other Hungarian members of the community, but as ‘gypsies’.</p>
<p>Another kind of identity claim was made by the orphanage administrator, who made it clear that although his parents were Hungarian and Romanian, he was Szekler, another ‘blend’ of Hungarian and Romanian, but with a different history than the Csango. We later learned from a Csango scholar that the Szekley considered the Csango ‘[Hungarian] traitors’ who ‘ran away and changed costumes’.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Ghimeş is an example of Hannerz’s ‘cultural borderland’. In this village, we observed many different claims about ethnic identity and cultural heritage. We heard from residents many different stories of past injustices and oppression which led them to stress for us a particular identity. But in addition, we saw how the current socio-economic situation in the village helped bolster a Hungarian identity and led to the exploitation of certain key events in Hungarian history in marketing the village. The most visible ethnic claim in the village was that of ethnic Hungarian identity which was legitimatized and supported through a variety of Hungarian cultural institutions and through, of course, cultural tourism. Tourism again was important because it provided much-needed employment opportunities and boosted the local economy.</p>
<p>There was a consensus among village residents that job opportunities were limited or nonexistent in Ghimeş. Informants with children all regretted that it was not possible for their children to remain in Ghimeş and that they had to leave the village to find jobs, often having to go abroad to find the best opportunities. While residents were forced to leave for economic opportunities, what did bring money to the village were the ‘celebrations’ of Hungarian culture, history, and religious life. The Hungarian ethnographic museum owner told us that local festivals brought thousands of visitors and tourist dollars each year to Ghimeş. Tourists visiting Ghimeş could stay in guesthouses or rent rooms in the homes of locals. There was for example a newly built, large, and brightly colored pension in the center of town (one of the largest buildings in the town) that was owned by the Hungarian mayor, who also noted in his interview that tourism provided the most opportunities for economic growth in the village.</p>
<p>In Ghimeş, tourism played an important role in providing employment and this influenced ethnic claims. We must also consider the possibility that village residents who profited from the tourism sector may have helped mute, in one way or another, alternative views of Ghimeş’ history. It is also possible that some people might even have endorsed for us a view of history that they privately doubted. However, the residents of Ghimeş could have just as easily selected one of several other ethnic identities to emphasize, such as Csango, or could they have as easily chosen to celebrate Ghimeş’ newfound identity as a Romanian village. They also could have chosen to play up, as was mentioned in at least one travel guide (but not actually observed in the village), its existence as a village where all ethnic groups including Roma live together in peace and harmony. As we have seen elsewhere in Transylvania, there are a number of ways to open up villages to tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961000611434998">Closet-Crane et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961000611434998">Klimaszewski et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Though we did not arrive in Ghimeş to assist with cultural heritage preservation efforts, our attempts to unpack ethnic identity and its role in Ghimeş certainly raised more questions than it answered. We not only heard multiple versions of past history, we found it hard to even get a consensus on what it means to be of one ethnicity than another. This was true even from individuals who self-identified as Csango. Given all this, if we were to be involved in cultural preservation in Ghimeş, the question we found hard to answer was: how would we identify (and on what grounds) which cultural heritage, which history or which identity to preserve?</p>

<title>Culturally sensitive research methodology versus ethnography and ‘studying up’</title>
<p>Ghimeş is a community where <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434998">Becvar and Srinivasan’s (2009)</xref> ‘collaborative and culturally sensitive research method’ could not capture or account for the full range of ethnicities, histories, and cultures available for preservation or representation. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434998">Becvar and Srinivasan (2009)</xref>, the primary failure of most preservation efforts is the researcher’s inability to understand or the inability to be ‘sensitive’ to categories and meanings to which we are non-native. As they say in their article: ‘Simple grassroots ethnographic research is, by itself, insufficient for overcoming existing inadequacies in understanding cultural differences’ (p. 425). Let us not quibble with what they mean by ‘simple’ ethnographic research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0961000611434998">Nyce and Thomas, 1999</xref>). The real issue we have is with the solution these authors present to the LIS research community. Assuming that ‘the native’ (always) has the right answer actually reduces rather than increases the possibility of carrying out the kind of ethnography necessary to point any cultural preservation project in the right direction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0961000611434998">Sapir’s (1938)</xref> analysis of ‘Two Crows deny this’ has led to a large literature within anthropology on informant variability and how culture is produced and enacted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434998">Becvar and Srinivasan (2009)</xref> cite none of this literature and as result the position they take on this issue seems ill informed.</p>
<p>As all ethnography does, their method includes ‘collaborating’ with the local or indigenous community (i.e. careful, polite, and respectful listening). However, their method does not give any advice on how to identify exactly what constitutes ‘the community’ and its members. More to the point, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434998">Becvar and Srinivasan (2009)</xref> also downplay or ignore the role that power and conflict play in indigenous (or any other) communities. Their portrait of indigenous culture seems to have more in common with Rousseau and this kind of nostalgia belongs more to 19-century anthropology than that of today. Somewhat ironically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0961000611434998">Srinivasan (2006</xref>: 359) has noted that the problem of over-simplification of community has not been well investigated:<disp-quote>
<p>An issue … researchers face is the criticism of homogenizing the term community, without addressing the differences and dynamics within this construct (Gujit &amp; Shah, 1998). The mythical notion of community cohesion ignores how power is adopted and manifested within the community (Cooke &amp; Kothari, 2001), formulaically assumes the realities of ‘community life’ (Cleaver, 2001), and equates participation with salvation (Francis, 2001). Clearly the definition and approach toward community is a complex issue that warrants further research.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ethnography begins with the idea that within any community different constituencies hold different definitions of ‘how things are’ versus ‘how things should be’, and ethnographers today rarely make sweeping generalizations about what defines ‘the community’ or ‘an ethnicity’ or ‘a cultural group’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0961000611434998">Ortner, 1984</xref>). Today ethnographers are concerned with how local institutions, local agendas, and regional economic strategies can be redefined to avoid the scenario whereby one group, namely the local elite, wins and others, those with less power, (always) lose.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434998">Becvar and Srinivasan (2009)</xref> also seem to believe that legitimate cultural elements or traditions are easy to ‘discover’. But note again that their paper is based on information that privileges testimony from only one segment of Zuni society: the aged. Because the only social variable that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434998">Becvar and Srinivasan (2009)</xref> take seriously is age, the result is that they have not provided us with any information about the Zuni community that runs counter to their belief that age alone determines information value and access. Age may be an important factor in Zuni society (and identity). However, they provide no evidence (i.e. informant statements) that age is this important today in Zuni society or that it is more important than any number of other variables including gender, kinship, or reputation. It is not unusual for certain kinds of knowledge to be limited to one gender or the other. Moreover, age is not the only feature of identity that a Zuni individual can utilize to claim special access to knowledge. While historically age has played a central role in knowledge control in Zuni life, so have gender, clan membership, and religious role. In short, these authors’ failure to acknowledge the potential for alternative definitions/significance, competition, power, and the emergence of new platforms for accessing and controlling knowledge in the Zuni community today is a serious theoretical simplification of social life.</p>
<p>These authors’ neo-Romantic view of indigenous society may have also blinded them to the role that power, dissent, and authority can play in any human society. Whatever the reason, they have not taken into account how power and hierarchy ‘slant’ how community members present their communities, histories, and cultures to others, both within and outside the community. Furthermore, the authors seem unaware that their model is further biased in the direction of the elite. For example, the authors only provide testimony from program directors and researchers directly connected to their Zuni research project, and it is no surprise that those directly involved in the project would consider it successful and sing its praises. What Becvar and Srinivasan report is the result of two interlocked, mutually dependent, self-congratulatory elites: one from a Native American community and the other from a prestigious US university. A greater test of the project’s success would have been to solicit commentary from a wider variety of members of the Zuni community, especially those not directly involved in the project and those who had the least to gain from its success.</p>
<p>While the direction of any preservation project must be determined by empirical, theoretically informed research, we must assume that there will always be a variety of stakeholders in any community (for a discussion of what constitutes strong ethnography see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0961000611434998">Nyce and Thomas, 1999</xref>). Any theoretically and empirically strong ethnography takes as its starting point the exploration of the different demographic, ethnic, social (including factors like gender, division of labor, etc.), and economic groups within a community and attempts to uncover the widest range and variety of community stakeholders. Moreover, beginning with our own western categories allows native group members to help us identify the failure of these categories to correctly describe the native situation. One strength of an ethnographic approach is precisely that it allows for these kinds of operations. Because the ethnographer is not trying to ‘forget’ or ‘avoid’ his or her own cultural categories, it is possible to draw on these kinds of comparisons to guide data collection. This helps to not only identify community stakeholders but also to understand what their world looks like and what they stand to gain or lose based on the outcome of a particular project.</p>
<p>Still, tracing differentials in power includes more than mapping the <bold>socio-economic</bold> vectors of the community. It also means studying those we have not typically seen as stakeholders in preservation efforts because we see their impact as helpful and working toward the good (for instance, LIS researchers). It is essential that we acknowledge our own role in cultural heritage projects because this can deeply influence project outcomes. Becvar and Srinivasan, for example, support their claim that native involvement is essential to successful, culturally sensitive indigenous knowledge projects with statements from a number of the native researchers involved in the project. Overwhelmingly, these researchers praised the collaborative process of which they were a part. This is taken to be sufficient evidence that both their project and method were a success. As a result, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434998">Becvar and Srinivasan’s (2009)</xref> paper does not track ways in which the project might affect all project members and their (future) relationships within the Zuni community. What is also not addressed anywhere in their paper is why the Zuni were selected for this project and what the researchers’ institutions stood to gain from sponsoring this project over any others.</p>
<p>It is necessary to understand and acknowledge the full range of possible visions that a community has of success and failure, representations of tradition and culture, and desired project outcomes. Some stakeholders will have more power and influence than others. This means that community visions of the past and present, to say nothing of what the preservation project is all about, may be given more respect and credibility than others. In the face of such claims and counterclaims, it is not enough to be ‘collaborative’ or ‘culturally sensitive’; one must instead be able to perform the kind of archaeology Foucault asks of us. Without addressing issues of power and legitimacy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434998">Becvar and Srinivasan (2009)</xref> either personalize (individualize) or ignore these critical elements of social life. The problem is if these issues are not taken into account, it is not possible to understand the culture, tradition and histories from which today’s documentation and collection efforts both emerge and hope to preserve.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961000611434998">Becvar and Srinivasan’s (2009)</xref> collaborative and culturally sensitive methodology cannot account for what we found in Ghimeş: namely, that asking an ethnic Hungarian, an ethnic Romanian, or an ethnic Csango would result in any number of different versions of history and culture, more than could possibly be preserved. Furthermore, even asking just members of Ghimeş’ Hungarian community about their history and traditions would lead to very different representations of culture and history and therefore theoretically to quite different strategies for preservation and documentation. Do we preserve ‘Hungarian’ or do we preserve ‘Csango’? Or something else? In the end we are still left with the question: whose history and culture do we preserve?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0961000611434998">
<title>What this means for the LIS preservation agenda</title>
<p>When we talk about community involvement in the preservation of cultural heritage and indigenous knowledge, we initiate these efforts from a position of power – as cultural elites charged with the responsibility of identifying and preserving history and tradition. From this position, simply ‘involving the native’ is not enough – we must move towards a more expansive understanding of the constructed and negotiated nature of culture, ethnicity, and indigenous knowledge. As we have shown in Ghimeş, history and local knowledge are constantly changing and being redefined based on the events of the present. The same is true of the values and meanings attached to and attributed to past, present as well as future events. Therefore, we must become comfortable with the idea of preserving conflict as well as agreement. This would help identify what the important issues are and have been, who won and who lost, and it provides the ‘losers’ with a voice.</p>
<p>This means trying our best to identify the issues that divide a community as well as those that define or bind the community together – and to learn why these issues are so central to that community. It also means acknowledging that there are times when we may have to choose to preserve and privilege the history of one group over another. It also means that our interpretations are only that: interpretations. This means also acknowledging that the social arena is constantly changing and that this is an essential feature of the social world, one we have to take account of in our work as LIS researchers and preservationists.</p>
<p>As other social science disciplines have done before, we also need to question our assumptions about how we construct cultural heritage and indigenous knowledge. This includes looking beyond the LIS ‘silo’ and better collaborating within and outside memory institutions. We must acknowledge that preservation efforts reflects and are products of larger, even international socio-economic agendas, trends, and challenges. Therefore, we must approach preservation efforts as a problem from the perspective of ‘studying up’ as well as ‘down’ – and, as this paper has done, begin to place and analyze preservation efforts within a broader historical and intellectual context. There may be no absolute answers to the problems we have raised here but as the ‘elites’ charged with preserving the past, we need to think more carefully and critically than we have in the past about what we select to document and preserve. To continue to neglect power and hierarchy in our work does not mean that the difficulties inherent in confronting them will somehow make them ‘go away’ or lessen their impact on our efforts. This kind of analytic ‘neglect’ also can only lead to the reproduction and further legitimatization of existing inequalities in power because it allows only one sector of the community to favor and further its own interests.</p>
