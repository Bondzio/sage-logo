<p>In this original article, Jana Costas addresses the paradox of normative control: How is it that knowledge-based organizations that prioritize the ostensibly nonhierarchical nature of friendship ties between colleagues tend to promote the very control mechanism they appear keen to avoid? To foster a culture of friendship is to be modern. Out goes the tried-and-tired metaphor of organizational life as a family. In goes the recognition that people coordinate far better by means of mutually beneficial, relatively nonhierarchical ties of interdependence. What Kunda (2006) described as “one night stands” are here conceptualized as “friendship” ties: They are more open-ended and spontaneous while also less committal and less hierarchical than their familial counterparts. Even so, argues Costas, friendship cultures can foster a means of normative control.</p>
<p>Using an in-depth case study of a management consultancy, the article usefully explores four different ways in which normative control is exercised in the context of an organization that prioritizes informality and ties based on affect. For example, by emphasizing informality, people are vulnerable to revealing far more about themselves than they might otherwise have done and may feel compelled to join in extracurricular activities even as doing so encroaches on their private lives. Work-based friendships come to increasingly dominate, and occasionally replace, old friendship ties. Moreover, the absence of an explicit hierarchy can generate ambiguity as to who is responsible for what and who one might go to for help. At the same time, there is evidence too that traditional power relationships continue to exert a strong presence even in occasions (such as a social event) designed to equalize relationships.</p>
<p>Such consequences of the friendship culture, and indeed its paradoxes, are carefully examined by Costas. The result is refreshing insight into far more sinister aspects of an increasingly popular approach to organizing work.</p>
