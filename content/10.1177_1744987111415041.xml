<p>This qualitative research paper presents the findings of interviews with 17 purposively, self-selected gay men who attend ‘circuit parties’ in Montreal, Canada, use recreational drugs and engage in unprotected sex. In terms of addressing its intended aims, the study is successful, contributes to the evolving knowledge base and ongoing need to examine the ever-changing nature of gay men’s sexual behaviour, and concludes with implications for nurses involved in sexual assessments and interventions.</p>
<p>The concept of unprotected sex is multi-factorial, particularly in relation to the biodynamics of HIV transmission associated with different forms of sexual activity and also in an era whereby strategies other than exclusive condom use have emerged in communities of men who have sex with men (MSM) to reduce the risk of HIV transmission, including serosorting, negotiated safety and strategic positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111415041">Hart and Elford, 2010</xref>). Therefore, the focus on unprotected sex in the absence of the wider constructs of risk mitigation strategies present its own inherent challenges. However, given the clear objectives of the research, the approach is methodologically sound and appropriate for the enquiry and participants involved.</p>
<p>On my first review of the paper, the deconstruction of the interviews and resultant presentation of the findings appeared overly complex and difficult to relate to clinical practice. However, I acknowledge that this is merely the stylistic approach of the author and my own academic inadequacy in grasping the practical meaning of sentences such as ‘This category of forces thus encompasses, on one hand, the intangible constructs that surround the social interpretations of ontology, epistemology, history, and politics, while on the other hand, it relates to the physical attributes of the real world’. On my second review, many of the themes do actually reflect the emerging trends that I have seen in clinical practice with MSM in London, United Kingdom.</p>
<p>I strongly agree with the author’s concluding contention that unprotected sex is context specific and related to a combination of factors. Consequently, prevention efforts by nurses and other healthcare providers need to consider a much broader perspective than that of drug use alone. In my own professional experience, healthcare providers undertaking sexual assessment can often have a one-dimensional focus on eliciting drug and alcohol use when in fact there can be a multitude of other complex interactions at play, such as self-esteem, peer pressure/coercion, environmental circumstances and cultural norms that can vary between the differing sexual market scenes, including those of circuit parties. To simply elicit drug use during a sexual history is not enough; clinicians need to focus on identifying high-risk behaviours and then explore these experiences with a view to behaviour change using specific evidence-informed techniques suitable for the clinical setting, such as motivational interviewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111415041">Koblin and the EXPLORE Study Team, 2004</xref>) and/or onward referral for more in-depth intervention.</p>
