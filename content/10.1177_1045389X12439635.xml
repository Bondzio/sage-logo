<abstract>
<p>This study investigates a new generation of magnetorheological elastomers based on hard magnetic particles. Unlike traditional magnetorheological elastomers that use iron particles, a dispersion of hard magnetic materials aligned in an electromagnetic field will produce a magnetorheological elastomer with magnetic poles. When a magnetic field is applied, perpendicularly to these poles, the filler particles generate torque and cause rotational motion of the magnetorheological elastomer blend. The primary goal of this study is to fabricate and characterize the actuation properties of magnetorheological elastomers filled with various hard magnetic particles. To this end, samples of magnetorheological elastomers consisting of hard magnetic materials were fabricated using four different particle types, and a test setup (electromagnet) was constructed. After mounting the magnetically anisotropic samples in a fixed-free configuration, uniform magnetic fields are applied to the samples (perpendicular to the poled direction), which causes the sample to bend, similar to a cantilevered beam. The blocked force and tip displacement of the samples were measured to characterize actuation properties of the samples. The results show that the responses of the deflection and the blocked force at the tip show linear trends over a reasonable range, suggesting that magnetorheological elastomers consisting of hard magnetic materials can be used as bending-type actuators in small mechanical systems and devices.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Magnetorheological (MR) materials are a branch of smart materials with properties and responses dependent upon the magnitude of an applied magnetic field. Since its discovery, the MR effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045389X12439635">Rabinow, 1948</xref>) has been applied to several classes of materials, including fluids, foams, and elastomers. Solid analogous to MR fluids, MR elastomers (MREs), have emerged in recent years as new variable stiffness materials. The type and dispersion of the filler particles affect the response of the MREs to an applied magnetic field and subsequently the modes of application. Conventional MREs consist of a dispersion of soft magnetic particles, such as iron, aligned in an electromagnetic field. The elastic modulus of the resulting material is magnetic field dependent. The main focus of the traditional MRE research has been maximizing the MR effect (the amount of change in the mechanical properties of MREs, such as stiffness, with and without the presence of the magnetic field) by experimenting with various particle concentrations, shapes, sizes, orientations, as well as filler materials and bimodal particle mixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X12439635">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045389X12439635">Hu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045389X12439635">Lokander and Stenberg, 2003a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045389X12439635">2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1045389X12439635">Von Lockette et al., 2008</xref>). Characterization and modeling work of MRE materials further helped the enhancement of MRE materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045389X12439635">Gong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045389X12439635">Zhou, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045389X12439635">2004</xref>). Various engineering applications of MRE materials as variable stiffness elements have been investigated for vibration control of mechanical and structural systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045389X12439635">Deng and Gong, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045389X12439635">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045389X12439635">Koo et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike conventional MRE materials that use iron particles, a dispersion of hard magnetic materials aligned in an electromagnetic field produces an anisotropic, magnetically poled MRE, which is similar to a flexible permanent magnet. The nature of MREs consisting of hard magnetic materials (H-MRE), both the permanency of embedded particles as well as the flexibility of surrounding elastomer, creates a material with applications quite different from those of conventional MREs. Upon application of a magnetic field, the hard magnetic particles embedded in a semirigid median will cause rotational motion as the particles produce torque based on the cross product of the particles’ internal magnetization and the applied magnetic field strength. The resulting motion and force can be used as a magnetic field–controlled actuator.</p>
<p>Limited research has been performed on the new generation of H-MREs, thus the primary goal of this study is to fabricate and characterize H-MREs. In particular, this study will focus on experimental evaluation of H-MREs with different filler materials in an effort to determine the feasibility of utilizing these materials as bending-type actuators as well as the effect permanent magnetic characteristics have on the response of the actuator.</p>

<sec id="section2-1045389X12439635">
<title>H-MRE sample preparation</title>
<p>Volume percentages for optimal MR effect have been established for conventional MREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045389X12439635">Lokander and Stenberg, 2003a</xref>); thus H-MRE samples were fabricated with particle volume percentages of 30% cured with a two-component elastomer resin in a rectangular prism mold with dimensions of 63.5 mm (width) × 31.8 mm (length) × 2.5 mm (thickness). The silicone rubber acts as the binding agent, contributing to the stiffness and flexibility of the cured sample, and the embedded magnetic particles produce the MR effect. Samples were fabricated from high-strength silicon elastomer resin (Dow Corning Corp.).</p>
<p>In order to study the effect of particle types, four types of permanent magnetic particles were studied: barium hexaferrite (BaFe<sub>12</sub>O<sub>19</sub>), strontium ferrite (SrFe<sub>12</sub>O<sub>19</sub>), samarium cobalt (SmCo<sub>5</sub>), and neodymium magnet (Nd<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>14</sub>B). While complete magnetic properties of the particles used in this study are not available, typical magnetic properties of two classes of hard magnetic materials provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1045389X12439635">Table 1</xref>. Barium and strontium ferrites can be categorized as ceramic ferrites, and neodymium and samarium cobalt powders fall into the rare-earth alloys category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045389X12439635">Lagorce and Allen, 1997</xref>).</p>

<p>The particle sizes of the hard magnetic materials considered in this study are different because only limited particle sizes are available commercially for certain materials. Moreover, it appears that fine, uniform-particle-size powders of rare-earth magnetic materials are not available because they are prone to oxidation and corrosion, particularly in a small particle form. The size of barium ferrite and strontium particles used in the current study is −325 mesh or 44 µm, and the size of samarium cobalt particles is −30 mesh or 595 µm. While these three particles have uniform particle sizes, the size of the neodymium varied from 50 µm to 250 µm.</p>
<p>Samples were produced to resin specifications with the addition of the magnetic particles and aligned in a 2-T magnetic field for 1 h (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12439635">Figure 1</xref>). The total curing time was 24 h at room temperature. In order to obtain a clear test result, an MRE sample needs to have a uniform alignment of magnetic iron particles. Without a uniform alignment, the torque, from crossing magnetic field, is produced in various directions instead of the desired single direction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12439635">Figure 2</xref> shows scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of unaligned and aligned samples.</p>

<title>Experimental setup</title>
<p>In order to produce a varying magnetic field, a two-coil modified horseshoe electromagnet with an iron core (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X12439635">Figure 3</xref>) was used. The coils consisted of 750 turns of 18-AWG wire. Current was supplied to the coil via a Kepco Model ATE 36-15DM KEPCO INC. power supply. The electromagnet was able to produce a large enough magnetic field that uniformly passed through the gap where the MRE sample was placed. The relationship between the applied current, voltage, and resulting magnetic field can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1045389X12439635">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>The samples were positioned in a fixed-free cantilever configuration in the test region of the electromagnet via a square aluminum clamp. The samples were oriented such that the length of the sample was perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field and the width was parallel. When a magnetic field uniformly passes through the sample, perpendicular to the orientation of the embedded particle poles, the sample deforms, similar to a cantilever beam. A high-resolution load cell and a laser displacement sensor were used to measure the blocked force and the displacement of the deformed sample, respectively.</p>

<title>Experimental results and discussion</title>
<p>Using the electromagnet and the test frame, experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of filler material on the blocked force and the displacement of various H-MRE samples. Although the response of the different particle types is being investigated, it is important to note that the size of the particle differs (varying from 44 to 595 µm), and thus, the conclusions will focus on the trends, the responses, and the feasibility of utilizing H-MRE materials as bending-type actuators.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X12439635">Figure 4</xref> shows a series of pictures that show how an H-MRE sample responds under the magnetic field. As shown in the figure, the MRE material exhibits significant deformation as the magnetic field increases. This work will experimentally investigate the displacement and the blocked force at the tip of the H-MRE beam within the linear region.</p>

<title>Displacement response</title>
<p>For displacement response experiments, the magnetic field was varied linearly from 0 to 25 mT. This range was chosen due to the nonlinearity of the H-MRE motion at higher magnetic flux. In fact, it was challenging to measure the tip displacement accurately at higher magnetic fields because the tip of the H-MRE beam sample is being curled up significantly (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X12439635">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, linearity is an important characteristic for both the use and characterization of actuators.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12439635">Figure 5</xref> gives evidence that the particle type and magnetic properties affect displacement response. For each particle type studied, the displacement generated by the application of a magnetic field has a positive linear correlation over the range studied. Although the bending motion of H-MRE is only linear over a small range, considerable displacements, in excess of 10 mm for neodymium and barium hexaferrite, were able to be achieved at the tip of the H-MRE beam (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12439635">Figure 5</xref>). The nonlinearity of the H-MRE displacement response at high displacement is a consequence of the elastomer median in which the particles are embedded; as the material bends in response to the magnetic field, it appears to function as a nonlinear spring.</p>

</fig>
<p>Considering the high bending achieved, H-MREs may prove to be the magnetic analog to electroactive polymers. Moreover, comparing to other solid-type magnetic materials (such as magnetostrictive materials), the deformation of H-MREs is quite significant. Hence, the H-MREs can be considered as candidates for new type of flexible actuators.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the size of the particles used in this study is different. Therefore, the deflection plots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12439635">Figure 5</xref> cannot be directly used to compare the performance of the H-MREs, except the strontium and barium ferrite sample cases (which have the same particle sizes). Having said this, the slope of the barium ferrite sample is higher than that of the strontium sample, indicating that the tip deflection of the barium sample is larger as compared with that of the strontium sample for a given magnetic field as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12439635">Figure 5</xref>. The results seem to be attributed to the material’s magnetic properties. The higher the magnetization property produced, the larger is the torque at the particle level, generating a larger rotation motion of the H-MRE beam.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1045389X12439635">Figure 6</xref> shows a variation of the percent increase of the barium sample’s tip deflection over that of the strontium to compare how much more the barium sample deflects as compared with the strontium sample. As the figure shows, the deflection of the barium sample is more than 70% higher than that of the strontium within the magnetic field range considered in this study. As the magnetic field increases, the percent increase slightly decreases.</p>

<title>Force response</title>
<p>Similar to the displacement response, the blocked force response exhibits a linear trend; however, the blocked force maintains linearity at much higher magnetic field levels. For the blocked force experiments, therefore, the magnetic flux density varied from 0 to 152 mT.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1045389X12439635">Figure 7</xref> shows the blocked force variation of H-MREs with different particle types. For the neodymium sample, the blocked force reaches to nearly 1200 mN at the maximum magnetic flux density considered in the study (i.e. 150 mT). The magnitudes of these blocked forces are considered to be sufficient to actuate components or mechanisms in small-scale adaptive structures and mechanical systems, such as microelectromechanical system (MEMS) devices.</p>

<p>Although the neodymium-based H-MRE exhibits the greatest blocked force, the generated responses are consequences of different properties of the embedded particles or are affected by an interaction between the filler material and embedded particles. Similar to the displacement response, the force responses of the same particle-size samples (barium and strontium samples) can be compared. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1045389X12439635">Figure 7</xref>, the slope of the barium sample’s force response is higher than that of the strontium sample, indicating that the barium sample produced a larger blocked force at a given magnetic field. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1045389X12439635">Figure 8</xref> shows the variation of the percent increase of barium sample’s blocked force over that of the strontium sample.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The focus of this article has been the experimental investigation of the dynamic response, specifically blocked force and displacement, of H-MREs with different filler particle types under an applied magnetic field. Four H-MRE samples were fabricated using hard magnetic filler particles (barium ferrites, strontium, neodymium, and samarium cobalt powders). The H-MRE mixtures were cured under a strong magnetic field to create magnetically anisotropic samples. After constructing a C-clamp–shape electromagnet, each sample was attached in a fixed-free cantilever configuration. When a magnetic field uniformly passes through the sample, perpendicular to the embedded particle chains, the sample deforms, similar to a cantilever beam. As the sample deforms, its defection and blocked force at the tip are measured to characterize the actuation properties of each H-MRE beam sample. The responses of the deflection and the blocked force at the tip show linear trends over a reasonable range. The neodymium sample results show the largest responses among the samples considered in this study. With a small magnetic field of 25 mT, its tip deflected nearly 12.5 mm, and its blocked force reaches nearly 1200 mN at 150 mT. With respect to barium and strontium samples of same particle size, the barium sample shows larger tip defections and blocked forces as compared to those of the strontium sample. Overall, the results suggest that the dynamic behaviors of the H-MREs provide promising implications for their roles as magnetically controlled actuators. Future work will investigate the effect of filler percentage, base resin stiffness, and dimensionality on the dynamic response before effective actuators can be designed from H-MRE materials.</p>
