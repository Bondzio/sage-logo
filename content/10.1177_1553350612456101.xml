<p><bold>Purpose.</bold> The lack of high-fidelity instrumentation has impeded the development and implementation of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). A steerable flexible trocar (SFT), a rotary access needle (RAN), and an articulating needle knife were developed as components of a flexible instrument set to facilitate transgastric peritoneal access and transluminal abdominal procedures. This cohort study aimed to assess the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of these devices during transgastric peritoneoscopy. <bold>Methods.</bold> Ten morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass participated in the study. Following laparoscopic access, transgastric peritoneal access was established using the SFT and RAN, and transgastric peritoneoscopy performed. NOTES adhesiolysis was performed in 2 patients with significant intra-abdominal adhesions due to prior surgery. Outcome measures included time to enter the peritoneal cavity, ability to visualize each quadrant of the abdomen, ability to perform adhesiolysis, and complications. <bold>Results.</bold> Ten patients with a median body mass index as stated in table 1 of 47.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were enrolled. Successful transgastric access was achieved in 8 of the 10 patients. One procedure was aborted because of difficulty creating the gastrotomy. Another procedure was aborted because of the difficult passage of the device through the oropharynx. An upper esophageal laceration occurred in one patient. Transgastric peritoneal access required 17.4 ± 5.5 minutes, and peritoneoscopy averaged 24.7 ± 7.6 minutes. The 4 abdominal quadrants were visualized and were accessible with the endoscope in all patients. <bold>Conclusions.</bold> The SFT and RAN facilitate transgastric peritoneal access and visualization of difficult-to-reach areas of the peritoneum. These devices provide advanced instrumentation for transgastric NOTES procedures; however, care must be taken during the transoral insertion to avoid complications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although many consider natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) to be the next step in minimally invasive surgery, this enthusiasm is counterbalanced by safety concerns and limitations imposed by the lack of specialized instrumentation designed to facilitate transluminal procedures. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy/Society of American Gastrointestinal &amp; Endoscopic Surgeons Working Group on NOTES White Paper identified development of such specialized equipment as essential for the development and implementation of NOTES in clinical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612456101">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612456101">2</xref></sup> Transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy has been shown to be feasible and effective for examination of the abdominal cavity in human patients, but improved instrumentation may facilitate performance and decrease risk for these procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612456101">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612456101"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612456101"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612456101"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612456101"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612456101"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612456101"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612456101"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612456101"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350612456101"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612456101"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612456101"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350612456101"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612456101"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612456101">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>A rotary access needle (RAN), a steerable flexible trocar (SFT), and an articulating needle knife (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) were developed as components of a flexible instrument set for advanced transluminal procedures to facilitate peritoneal access and visualization. The multifunctional RAN contains a rotary needle, a guidewire, and a dilatation balloon to facilitate transluminal peritoneal access. The SFT provides proximal decompression and distal insufflation ports and an articulating overtube to increase stability and enhance intra-abdominal visualization by providing simultaneous gastric decompression and peritoneal insufflation.</p>
<p>The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the safety and utility of instruments specifically designed for NOTES procedures: SFT, RAN, and articulating needle knife during transgastric peritoneal access and diagnostic peritoneoscopy with or without adhesiolysis in adult patients.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1553350612456101">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>The patient population for this study included morbidly obese adults with a history of prior open abdominal surgery scheduled to undergo laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Patients with a history of acute cholecystitis or pancreatitis, peritonitis, or use of anticoagulant or immunosuppressive medications were excluded. Ten patients meeting these inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled under an institutional review board approval protocol.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1553350612456101">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>The SFT consists of a 70 cm flexible overtube with a proximal trocar head and specially designed distal aspect that fits tightly with a standard dual channel gastroscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612456101">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612456101">B</xref>). The trocar at the proximal end of the SFT contains an adjusting seal and a flapper door seal that serve to minimize gas leakage during endoscope insertion and instrument exchanges. The overtube contains a steerable articulating section designed to facilitate access to intra-abdominal structures. This flexible shaft can be articulated up to 180° in a single direction and then locked into position to provide a stable operating platform. Proximal and distal channels provide simultaneous gastric decompression and peritoneal insufflation to maximize intra-abdominal working space.</p>

</fig>
<p>The multifunctional RAN contains a rotary needle, a stiff guidewire with a flexible tip, and a dilatation balloon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612456101">Figure 2</xref>). This device can be inserted through the working channel of a standard therapeutic endoscope. The hollow, bevel-tipped rotary needle creates a gastrotomy to provide transluminal peritoneal access. The preloaded guidewire is advanced through the RAN and puncture site into the peritoneal cavity. The dilatation balloon is designed to engage the mobile gastric wall using a preformed taper. It is advanced over the guidewire and dilated to 20 mm, providing controlled access for the SFT and endoscope. The RAN is designed with retractable atraumatic features to minimize the risk of inadvertent puncture during gastrotomy creation and requires the application of both distal pressure and user supplied rotary motion.</p>

<p>The articulating needle knife is an endoscopic instrument intended for cutting, dissecting, and cauterizing tissue via high-frequency electrical current waveform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350612456101">Figure 3</xref>). The device consists of a flexible wire cable and needle knife electrode, which can be extended, rotated, articulated, and retracted from the flexible outer shaft using a 3-finger actuator. When connected to an electrosurgical generator and activated, the needle knife delivers a monopolar electrical current to the surgical site.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy is performed with the patient in the supine position under general anesthesia. The abdomen is prepped and draped in a sterile manner, and laparoscopic access is obtained using a standard open or closed approach. A single- or double-channel therapeutic endoscope is passed through the SFT. The SFT–endoscope complex is lubricated and passed transorally into the stomach. Following gastric insufflation, the intended exit site on the anterior surface of the stomach is identified using a combination of transillumination and laparoscopic palpation of the anterior gastric wall. The RAN is inserted through the working channel of the endoscope into the field of view with the needle exposed beyond the distal end of the RAN catheter. The RAN is advanced into the gastric mucosa, and the external RAN knob is used to rotate the needle while advancing the device forward through the working channel until a full thickness gastrotomy is created. Twenty to 30 cm of wire is advanced through the puncture site and the needle is retracted while advancing the balloon tip of the RAN device forward over the wire and through the gastrotomy. The balloon is positioned within the stomach wall such that the central balloon stripe is coincident with the stomach wall being pierced, and the SFT is positioned with the proximal end of the RAN balloon within its lumen. The balloon is inflated to 20 mm under a pressure of 3.0 atm and married to the SFT–endoscope complex. The SFT, endoscope, and balloon complex are advanced as a single unit through the dilated opening and into the peritoneal space far enough to ensure ability for SFT to articulate. The guidewire is withdrawn into the RAN, the balloon deflated, and the entire RAN complex is removed from the endoscope working channel.</p>
<p>Once the distal portion of the SFT is positioned in the peritoneal cavity, it simultaneously decompresses the stomach and insufflates the peritoneal cavity. The distal aspect can then be selectively articulated up to 180° in a single direction by rotating the knob on the handle. When placed in a retroflexed view and locked into position, the SFT guides the endoscope to visualize right and left upper quadrant abdominal structures. The flexure and rotation of the SFT device and scope are adjusted as necessary to achieve the desired view of each abdominal quadrant. Adhesions to the anterior abdominal wall are taken down as needed using the articulating needle knife. After exploring all quadrants, the SFT is straightened and the complex is easily removed from the peritoneal cavity and gastrotomy site.</p>
<p>Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is then completed using the gastrotomy made in the course of the transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy for insertion of the end-to-end anastomosis anvil for gastrojejunostomy creation. The gastric defect was then closed with a linear stapling device using 3.5-mm staples (Covidien, Mansfield, MA).</p>

<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>The outcomes of interest for this study included the time required for achieving transgastric peritoneal access, duration of transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy and adhesiolysis, adequacy of abdominal exploration, and procedural complications. An adequate transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy was defined by the successful visualization of all 4 quadrants. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data, and these are presented as median (range) or number as appropriate.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Patient characteristics are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350612456101">Table 1</xref>. Ten patients enrolled in the study, with successful transgastric access using the RAN and SFT achieved in 8 of 10 patients. Transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy was aborted in one patient because of difficulty in creating the gastrotomy with the RAN. In another patient, the procedure was aborted because of inability to pass the SFT through the oropharynx. An adequate peritoneoscopy, defined as visualization of the peritoneal surface in each quadrant, was achieved in the remaining 8 patients. One patient suffered a posterior cervical esophageal laceration, which was identified following completion of the procedure. This patient underwent an uneventful laparoscopic gastric bypass following transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy. Postoperatively, the patient received nothing by mouth for 8 days. An esophagram at that time showed no evidence of persistent leak, and enteral feeding was resumed without further complication.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The lack of specialized instrumentation represents a major impediment to the development and implementation of human NOTES procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612456101">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612456101">2</xref></sup> This pilot study endeavored to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of 3 device prototypes developed to facilitate NOTES procedures, prior to their introduction for widespread clinical use. We found that the RAN can achieve transgastric peritoneal access in most patients. Also, insertion of the SFT provides a stable operating platform and improves visualization of the upper abdomen; however, care must be exercised during the introduction of these devices to avoid esophageal injury.</p>
<p>Safe and reliable peritoneal access is of paramount importance for any minimally invasive surgical procedure. Transgastric NOTES approaches, including those performed in our center, have utilized needle knife electrocautery for gastrotomy creation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612456101">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612456101">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612456101">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612456101">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350612456101">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612456101"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612456101">17</xref></sup> The use of an energy source allows gastrotomy creation without the application of significant mechanical force, but it risks thermal injuries to adjacent abdominal organs while obtaining peritoneal access. The RAN device uses rotary mechanical force, rather than energy, to penetrate the gastric wall. This approach allows the surgeon to gain access to the peritoneal cavity without blind energy delivery as the tip passes through the gastric wall. In this series, successful peritoneal access was achieved in 8 of 10 patients without complication.</p>
<p>Although the RAN achieved safe peritoneal access in most cases, significant direct force is required in addition to the rotary force to penetrate gastric tissue. Also, in one patient, we experienced difficulty penetrating the gastric wall because of inability to generate sufficient force to allow the rotary needle to adequately engage the gastric mucosa. In this case, the rotary motion of the needle generated twisting of the gastric mucosa around the needle rather than penetration into the submucosa and muscularis. Using energy to penetrate the gastric tissue may increase risk of injury of intraperitoneal organs; therefore, a combination of these approaches may be required to produce the best results. Also, whether the use of rotary force rather than energy for gastrostomy creation produces a safer form of access remains an open question. Further device development should focus on the optimal application of rotary force to achieve penetration of the gastric wall without risking injury to adjacent structures.</p>
<p>A second major hurdle in the development of human NOTES has been the need for stable operating platforms that allow easy access to all abdominal quadrants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612456101">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612456101">2</xref></sup> During transgastric NOTES, access to the upper abdomen is difficult and requires the surgeon to perform the entirety of the procedure with the scope retroflexed. This produces difficulty in spatial orientation and limits the ability of the scope to changes its view within the upper abdomen. The SFT was designed to address these challenges. After the overtube is advanced into the abdomen, it is retroflexed toward the right or left upper quadrant and fixed in position. This allows the endoscope to be advanced through the overtube and achieve upper abdominal views without placing the endoscope in the retroflexion position, thus preventing looping of the endoscope within the abdomen. This allows greater mobility of the endoscope to achieve the desired views within the operative field. In this series, the SFT provided a stable platform to perform diagnostic peritoneoscopy and adhesiolysis. During adhesiolysis, the articulating needle knife allowed the operating endoscopist to precisely lyse adhesions and perform a safe dissection.</p>
<p>As with any over-the-scope device, care must be exercised during the insertion of the SFT. The cervical esophageal laceration that occurred in this series occurred during a difficult device insertion. Insertion of these large devices in patients with limited working space because of body habitus or limited neck mobility is particularly difficult, and care must be taken when selecting patients for these procedures. Along with careful patient selection and adequate lubrication of the device, predilation of the esophagus with a 56 to 60 French bougie may facilitate the delivery of this system and reduce complications. Future development of these devices should also prioritize reducing the size of the overtube to further reduce the incidence of complications during device passage.</p>
<p>Although limited by its small sample size, this preliminary study suggests that use of high-fidelity instrumentation designed for transluminal surgery can facilitate peritoneal access and visualization of difficult-to-reach areas of the peritoneum. However, care must be taken when selecting patients and passing the device through the hypopharynx and esophagus to avoid esophageal injuries. Larger comparative studies are required to further evaluate the efficacy of this instrumentation during transgastric procedures.</p>
