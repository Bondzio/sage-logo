<p>In this article, we link unique data on local social infrastructure expenditure with microlevel individual survey data of self-reported social capital measures of trust and participation in community activities. We use both probit and tobit models to estimate the impact of social infrastructure expenditure on social capital formation. Our results imply that the links between social capital, demographic characteristics, human capital, geography, and public social infrastructure investment are rather more subtle and complex than much of the literature implies. While we find evidence in support of many of the hypothesized relationships discussed in the social capital literature, our results also suggest that the impact of public social infrastructure investment is affected by both selection effects and free rider processes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There has been interest in the relationship between social capital and economic outcomes for several decades now but it remains a contentious and hotly debated topic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160017611400068">Glaeser and Redlick (2009)</xref> argue that expenditures on social infrastructure may be important for relatively distressed regions to discourage out-migration and thereby encourage residents to invest in social capital. Yet, although there have been many attempts to understand the economic determinants and the economic impacts of social capital, there remain many aspects of the concept which are still poorly understood. This lack of understanding stems primarily from the intangible nature of social capital, which means that measurement relies on observable proxy variables and investigator interpretation.</p>
<p>New Zealand provides a unique opportunity to examine the nature of social capital at a regional level. This opportunity stems from a combination of the characteristics of New Zealand, a small open society with clearly defined and universally applied regional regulations, coupled with a range of microeconomic datasets containing information on regional social capital. This article therefore contributes to the understanding of the determinants of social capital. There have been few studies on the determinants of social capital in small, open, socially cohesive, and institutionally homogenous countries. Despite the opportunities presented by the institutional framework, demography, and availability of microdata on social capital, there has been no previous economic analysis on this topic in New Zealand.</p>
<p>In this article, we estimate the determinants of social capital within New Zealand by means of the national results of two waves of the World Values Survey (WVS) combined with data from Statistics New Zealand and a specially constructed dataset containing detailed information on local government expenditure. The major innovation in this article is that we combine microsurvey data on self-reported indicators of social capital with local government data on the types of social infrastructure expenditure which the literature suggests are likely to enhance social capital. We then use both probit and tobit models to estimate the likelihood of participation in social capital-building activities, the range of activities people participate in, and also the impacts of social infrastructure expenditure on this participation. As far as we are aware, this is the first time that such an empirical analysis has been undertaken of the relationship between individual social capital and regional social infrastructure investment.</p>
<p>The article is organized as follows. The section Social Capital and Economic Development discusses briefly what is currently known about the links between social capital and economic growth and development and also highlights the gaps in our present understanding of these issues. The section The Determinants of Social Capital presents the theoretical framework for analyzing the determinants of individual social capital. Proxies for social capital (interpersonal trust and community participation) are outlined in detail, and these proxies for social capital are then related in a general framework to four areas that the literature suggests may determine individual social capital, namely: demographics, human capital, geography, and local social infrastructure investment.</p>
<p>The section Data and Methodology describes and summarizes the individual datasets compiled from a variety of sources, as well as the final combined dataset used for this analysis. The combined dataset enables the testing of a specification of four econometric models based on the theoretical framework discussed in the section The Determinants of Social Capital. The section Models and Results presents the results of the probit and tobit models of the likelihood and range of social participation. The models are examined to see if the factors which influence the overall level of participation differ from those that influence the extent to which people participate in a range of social activities. Discussion section provides a detailed discussion and interpretation of the results and the final section offers some conclusions.</p>

<title>Social Capital and Economic Development</title>
<p>Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160017611400068">Putnam’s (1993)</xref> seminal analysis of the role of social capital in the performance of Italian regions, there has been rapidly growing interest from multiple academic disciplines in the role of social capital as a form of infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160017611400068">Castiglione, van Deth, and Wolleb 2008</xref>), and its role in economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160017611400068">Francois 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0160017611400068">Semitel Garcia 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160017611400068">Westlund 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160017611400068">Baum (2000)</xref> tracks the popularity of social capital, finding that before 1981, twenty articles listed social capital as a key word, rising to 109 between 1991 and 1995, and 1003 between 1996 and 1999. Using “social capital” as a key word in Google Scholar now suggests 133,000 articles or documents contain the phrase, of which 21,000 are linked to economics.</p>
<p>The term social capital has appeared in a range of disciplines and publications. It first appeared in academic literature in an article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160017611400068">Hanifan (1916)</xref> examining the role of rural schools on community well-being. It was not until the 1980s that the concept was largely rediscovered by sociologists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160017611400068">Bourdieu (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160017611400068">Coleman (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160017611400068">1990</xref>). The theory began to cross disciplines with the popular publications of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0160017611400068">Putnam (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0160017611400068">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0160017611400068">2000</xref>) who used a combined economic, political, and sociological approach to apply social capital to the diversity of performance, firstly in the Italian states and later in the United States. Putnam’s work provided the first evidence that social capital was related to economic growth and other factors, and identified some precursors as well as outcomes of social capital.</p>
<p>“Social capital” has had varying meanings during the twentieth century, with the definition in earlier works remaining very fluid and different in meaning from its contemporary uses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160017611400068">Castiglione, van Deth, and Wolleb 2008</xref>). Throughout its development as a concept, social capital has been consistently related to human capital in the literature. However, as has been stated several times, most notably by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0160017611400068">Solow (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160017611400068">1999</xref>), even in its modern usage the concept of social capital has been notoriously difficult to define, with no commonly agreed upon definition of social capital appearing in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160017611400068">Claridge 2008</xref>). While the particular definition adopted by a study will often depend on the discipline and level of investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160017611400068">Adler and Kwon 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0160017611400068">Robison, Schmid, and Siles 2002</xref>), there has been a common theme amongst the usage, and that has been a focus on the productive benefits of social relations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160017611400068">Westlund (2006)</xref> states that “social capital” has now come to refer to social networks, relationships, norms, and values. These factors are all related to the social situation in which an actor is embedded. A problem with this definition is that it begins to fall short of what is commonly considered to be capital, which is a stock that provides a flow. Many economists have therefore changed their definition of social capital to include only interpersonal networks, which people can invest in, which can be held as a stock, provide a flow of returns, and can depreciate, however, with social capital depreciation occurring through underuse rather than use. Due to these factors, numerous definitions of social capital exist within the body of academic literature. They vary depending on whether their focus is primarily on (1) the relations an actor maintains with other actors, (2) the structure of relations among actors within a collectivity, or (3) both types of linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160017611400068">Adler and Kwon 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Once introduced to the mainstream, the links between social capital and economic growth began to be investigated by several authors, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160017611400068">La Porta et al. (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160017611400068">Knack and Keefer (1997)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0160017611400068">Zak and Knack (2001)</xref>. Yet, the current popularity of the concept has not been without controversy, as the intangible nature of the subject makes quantification, validation, and even defining social capital a potentially problematic exercise. This subjectivity of interpretation has drawn criticism from authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0160017611400068">Solow (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0160017611400068">1999</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160017611400068">Arrow (1999)</xref>, whose arguments are particularly critical of including social capital as a form of true capital, similar to human or physical capital. However, over time this debate has given way to a general acceptance of the theory.</p>
<p>There is also a body of literature which suggests that social capital may in some cases generate negative externalities for society and negative outcomes for individuals. Social “bads” may result when a strongly cohesive group acts in its own interest rather than in the interest of society. Examples are gang-related crime or ethnic discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0160017611400068">Portes, 1998</xref>). Negative outcomes for the individual are discussed in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160017611400068">Dasgupta (2005)</xref>. He suggests that these occur when social capital incentivizes individuals to remain in relationships which have negative outcomes, either because of the violation of the individual’s group norms and values (for instance, remaining in an abusive marriage) or because of the destruction of existing social capital (such as remaining in a poorly paid or unpleasant job to maintain work ties).</p>
<p>The role played by social capital in regional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0160017611400068">Westlund 2006</xref>) and national (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160017611400068">Castiglione, van Deth, and Wolleb 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0160017611400068">Tinggaard Svendsen and Haase Svendsen 2009</xref>) economic growth has now become largely accepted and widely used in the economics literature. Social capital can be examined at several levels, including political, community and individual, and there is now a wide range of literature regarding the applications, validity, and methodological considerations associated with using the concept of social capital in economic research. Even so, it is still the case that the exact mechanisms by which social capital contributes to growth and development remain the topic of much debate and investigation, and this also relates to the use of data. Without any overall consensus as yet on how to define or operationalize social capital, researchers often utilize a wide array of datasets such as the WVS and General Social Survey datasets in order to develop proxies for social capital from survey items that were not originally intended for such an analytical approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160017611400068">Baum and Ziersch 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160017611400068">Kawachi et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0160017611400068">Miller and Buys 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0160017611400068">Zak and Knack 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>New Zealand provides an ideal context for examining social capital for several reasons. Firstly, New Zealand consistently ranks as one of the world’s most open, cohesive, and institutionally sound societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160017611400068">McCann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0160017611400068">World Bank, 2008</xref>); secondly, very detailed individual level data are available for New Zealand; and thirdly, given its geographical isolation, New Zealand may be thought of as a self-contained societal case study. Given the data at our disposal, this article will focus on examining the levels of social capital held by an individual. At this individual level, there are two generally accepted dimensions of social capital which can be used to gauge personal stocks of social capital. These are, firstly, trust in people and secondly, personal involvement in other people’s activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160017611400068">Huang, van den Brink, and Groot 2009</xref>). These measures have been adopted by both the WVS and the General Social Survey, and as such have appeared frequently in social capital analyses making use of these data sources.</p>
<p>In the particular case of New Zealand, while concepts such as social infrastructure, participation, and community development were discussed prior to the 1990’s, the social capital concept itself had not been applied until relatively recently. In 1997, stimulated by both an interest from policy analysts and by a trip to New Zealand by Robert Putnam, the Victoria University of Wellington Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) began applying social capital concepts to New Zealand. This research, while largely social in nature, did provide insights into the economic relationships between social capital and development. More importantly, this research provided a framework and issues for the measurement and analysis of social capital in the New Zealand context. The results of the IPS study into social capital were published in three books (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0160017611400068">Robinson 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0160017611400068">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0160017611400068">2002</xref>), and also led to several other important publications, most notably, Statistics New Zealand’s “Framework for the Measurement of Social Capital in New Zealand” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160017611400068">Spellerberg 2001</xref>). In addition, New Zealand has also been included in two cross-country studies of the levels of trust, as reported in the WVS, and the relationships between trust and economic growth. The studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0160017611400068">Zak and Knack (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160017611400068">González (2001)</xref> were extensions on the original work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160017611400068">Knack and Keefer (1997)</xref>, in which trust (using WVS data) was found to be correlated with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth across several countries. The results showed that New Zealand had a level of GDP growth that was consistent with what would be expected given the level of trust reported.</p>

<title>The Determinants of Social Capital</title>
<p>As discussed above, the underlying stock of social capital is intangible and unobservable, and this has forced researchers to look for suitable alternative measures in order to estimate social capital stocks at various levels. The result has been the adoption of a wide range of proxy variables where a theoretical link exists between that variable and the underlying stock of social capital. In this analysis, we have settled on two commonly used proxies for social capital in developed democratic societies, namely interpersonal trust and community participation. Both interpersonal trust and community participation have become generally accepted in the international literature as valid indicators of the underlying stock of social capital. While their widespread adoption was initially due to their inclusion in the WVS and the General Social Survey, researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0160017611400068">Zak and Knack (2001)</xref> have provided robust theoretical links which validate their use.</p>
<p>Based on the literature, four significant groupings of determinants of social capital have been identified for inclusion in the theoretical model. They are: demographic variables, geography and location-specific variables, variables relating to human capital, and measures of social infrastructure investment. Because this analysis considers social capital at an individual level, demographic aspects of the individuals should be controlled for as these are consistently shown to be related to social capital, specifically age, gender, and ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160017611400068">Glaeser, Laibson, and Sacerdote 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0160017611400068">Putnam 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0160017611400068">Van Emmerick 2006</xref>). With respect to ethnicity, there is currently no existing economic study on social capital in New Zealand which incorporates ethnicity as a factor. However, there are strong grounds for believing that the ethnic composition of New Zealand’s population and in particular the cultural differences between the indigenous Maori, the population of European origin, the population of various Asian origins, as well as the Pacific Island communities, may lead to ethnic distinctions in social beliefs and attitudes which could influence social capital formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0160017611400068">Spellerberg 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0160017611400068">Williams and Robinson 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Geography and location have also been identified as important considerations for social capital formation. In particular, several European studies have shown social capital formation in rural settings to be significantly different from that in urban areas, with more “bonding” rather than “bridging” social capital in evidence in the former. In the case of New Zealand, there is a geographical break between the North Island and the South Island. While the land mass of the South Island is larger than that of the North Island, it is both more sparsely populated, with only 24 percent of the New Zealand population, and also much more ethnically homogeneous, with 90 percent of the population primarily identifying themselves as being European in the 2006 census, as compared with only 71 percent in the relatively more urbanized and densely populated North Island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0160017611400068">Statistics New Zealand 2006</xref>). These demographic and geographic differences may impact on social capital formation and will therefore need to be controlled for in the statistical analysis.</p>
<p>Human capital has been consistently found to be related to social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160017611400068">Glaeser, Laibson, and Sacerdote 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160017611400068">Helliwell and Putnam 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160017611400068">Huang, van den Brink, and Groot 2009</xref>), although the exact relationship is still the subject of much debate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160017611400068">Bowles and Gintis (2002)</xref> argue that social skills are a product of education and as such, social capital could be considered to be a subcomponent of human capital. This is in contrast to the standard approach which treats social capital as being related to, but also separate from, human capital. As the connection between social capital and human capital is one of the most robust and consistent findings in the social capital literature, controls for individual human capital are included in our analysis.</p>
<p>While the role of geographic, demographic, and human capital variables have been widely studied in the context of social capital formation, there are few publications examining the role of social infrastructure, with even fewer still examining the role that social infrastructure investment plays in the formation of social capital. Social infrastructure refers to the provision, both by the public and private sectors, of areas for actors to connect to others and develop the interpersonal linkages which are regarded as the essence of social capital. While private investment in social capital is difficult to measure, public investment can be inferred from regional and national accounts. Examples of social infrastructure in New Zealand include community facilities, leisure facilities, parks and other landscaped areas, and regional networks such as the Auckland Chamber of Commerce<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160017611400068">1</xref></sup> or the Christchurch City Community Boards.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0160017611400068">2</xref></sup> By including public expenditure on social infrastructure in our analysis, we can identify the role that spending by local government has on social capital.</p>
<p>On the basis of the current social capital literature, we can therefore assume that the self-reported indicators of social capital (<italic>K<sub>Si</sub>
</italic>) are determined by an individual <italic>i</italic>’s personal characteristics (<italic>C<sub>i</sub>
</italic>), geographic variables (<italic>G<sub>i</sub>
</italic>), human capital (<italic>K<sub>Hi</sub>
</italic>), and by the social infrastructure investment in individual <italic>i</italic>’s region (<italic>I<sub>ri</sub>
</italic>). As such, in very general terms, we can specify the structure of the social capital model as: <italic>K<sub>Si</sub>
</italic> = <italic>K</italic>(<italic>C<sub>i</sub>
</italic>, <italic>G<sub>i</sub>
</italic>, <italic>K<sub>Hi</sub>
</italic>, <italic>I<sub>ri</sub>
</italic>) + ϵ<sub>
<italic>i</italic>
</sub>, with the functional form and the error term properties determined by the nature of the social capital proxies employed. This general model specification provides the framework for our selection of the variables from the micro datasets available to us.</p>

<title>Data and Methodology</title>
<p>In order to test the theoretical linkage of social infrastructure investment, demographic characteristics, geography, and human capital in determining levels of social capital in New Zealand, we use pooled individual cross-sectional data obtained from the WVS. The WVS organization is a not-for-profit international sociological organization, which has conducted worldwide surveys since 1981 in five separate waves via a network of social scientists, with over eighty countries having now participated in at least one wave. These surveys focus on sociological and political variables, and the results for each country are made freely available via their website. The data are available at the individual level and include all items asked in the standardized survey, including individual values, attitudes, political opinions, trust, participation, and demography. We use the WVS data collected for New Zealand by Massey University, as part of the 1994–1999 waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0160017611400068">World Values Survey 2006</xref>) and the 2005 List B data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0160017611400068">World Values Survey 2008</xref>). Observations pertaining to countries other than New Zealand were removed.</p>
<p>New Zealand has participated in two separate waves of the WVS, in 1998 and 2004. Both data collections were conducted by Massey University via postal surveys, with the sample drawn at random from New Zealand citizens aged between eighteen and ninety registered on the New Zealand Electoral Roll. A summary of the sampling can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0160017611400068">Table 1</xref>
. For both surveys there was an oversampling of citizens who identified as Maori, in both cases around double the proportion identified on the electoral roll. This was to correct for the often observed lower response rates in New Zealand of Maori compared to the general population.</p>

<p>The pooled dataset consisted of 2,155 observations. However, 128 observations were dropped when we restricted the sample to those people for whom we could identify a region or residence, resulting in a final pooled dataset of 2,027 individual observations, of which 1,129 were from the 1998 survey and 898 were from the 2004 survey.</p>
<p>In addition to the data made available through the WVS, data was also included from the 2001 New Zealand Census of Populations and Dwellings, as well as two independent data series created by Motu Economic and Public Policy Research, a Wellington-based research institute, namely the Local Authorities Finance Data series and the Regional and Unitary Authorities Finance Data series. These latter two series provide detailed breakdowns of annual local government spending at two regional levels within New Zealand, namely Regional Councils (RC’s) and Territorial Authorities (TA’s), from 1991 to 2008. The WVS data are coded to RC level, the largest level of local governance in New Zealand. Local government in New Zealand comprises sixteen RC’s and sixty-nine separate TA’s. As both RC’s and TA’s fund social infrastructure development over the same areas, we use the Statistics New Zealand 2001 Census of Populations and Dwellings to allocate TA expenditures to RC’s by population, creating total expenditure within the RC by all constituent local authorities. We aggregate two of the smaller RC’s to create fifteen regions.</p>
<p>Prior to 2001, local governments in New Zealand were not required to provide standardized accounts of their expenditure. Hence, the Motu datasets have had to be constructed independently, principally from local authority annual reports and via requests directly to the authorities concerned. Both the RC and TA data contain series which show the levels of expenditure on “Parks and Community Facilities and Services.” This reported spending is primarily in areas which encourage or facilitate community or social interaction, such as community halls, libraries, parks, and reserves. It also includes spending on activities which encourage volunteerism and community interaction, such as supporting volunteer civil defense or rural fire services. There is, however, a small amount of noise in the data, where spending is directed at servicing the community in ways which do not directly encourage community interaction, such as support in promoting local businesses, hazard mitigation, and some noncommercial maritime safety expenses. Given the minor nature of these latter expenses, we do not expect this to impact on the results. The data vary significantly year on year within councils, primarily due to variability of funding one-off large investments. In order to smooth the series, we took the average annual expenditure by each RC over the six year period leading up to the survey, so 1993–1998 for the 1998 WVS observations and 1999–2004 for the 2004 observations. Further details on the measurement of social infrastructure expenditure are given in the Annex. As by far the majority of the spending by councils in this series is related to either encouraging or facilitating community interaction or volunteerism, we hypothesize that this spending will directly encourage social capital accumulation within the region.</p>
<p>One way to test the robustness of the results is to compare the results for the combined relevant expenditures of RC’s and local authorities with the results of relevant expenditures by local authorities only. The latter form the bulk of the combined expenditures but are more homogeneous than those of RC’s. Both sets of data yield very similar results and we present only the former to limit the required space.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0160017611400068">3</xref></sup>

<p>The dependent variables “Trust” and “Participation” are both drawn from the WVS. The Trust variable is binary and equal to one where the respondent answered affirmatively the question “In general, can most people be trusted?” The WVS also asked participants to indicate whether they considered themselves to be active, inactive, or nonmembers of community organizations. The participation index used in this analysis was created using a series of nine questions asking participants if they were an active member, an inactive member, or not a member of nine separate types of community organization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0160017611400068">4</xref></sup> This measure used only participants who indicated that they were “active” members as inactive membership is unlikely to indicate social networking. We summed the number of times a participant indicated they were an active member of an organization, resulting in a variable which ranged from zero where an individual indicated they did not participate in any community organizations to nine where a participant was actively involved in all organizational types polled in the survey.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0160017611400068">5</xref></sup> The truncation of this data makes a tobit regression appropriate.</p>
<p>The combined and cleaned dataset was largely representative of the underlying general New Zealand population; however males and people between eighteen and thirty-four were slightly under represented. Measuring ethnicity is problematic in New Zealand following the introduction of a new ethnic category, “New Zealander” in surveys, in addition to the traditional European and Maori ethnic groups. In our sample, 49 percent of participants indicated that their ethnicity was “New Zealander,” providing very little information on the actual ethnicity of the individual and being more likely an indicator of an individual’s sense of nationhood or beliefs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0160017611400068">6</xref></sup> There was also an undersampling of both Maori and Pacific Island participants. Geographically, our survey participants are generally distributed in-line with the general population, but Auckland—New Zealand’s primate city containing over one quarter of the country’s population—was slightly underrepresented.</p>
<p>Participants who indicated they were foreign-born comprised 17.6 percent of the sample. This is slightly lower than the total percentage foreign-born in New Zealand which was approximately 21 percent at the time of the second survey. In comparing the proxy variables for social capital for foreign- and New Zealand-born participants, we find very little difference: 49 percent of foreign-born participants indicated that most people could be trusted, which is almost identical to the 50 percent of New Zealand-born participants who indicated that most people could be trusted. Foreign-born participants were slightly less likely to participate in community activities, with foreign-born participants being on average active in 1.44 organizations compared to a mean of 1.54 for New Zealand-born. Foreign-born participants were more likely to be an active member in a religious organization (29 percent compared to 16 percent of New Zealand-born), while they were less likely to be active in sports or recreational organizations (27 percent compared with 40 percent New Zealand-Born) or actively involved in a labor union (3.4 percent compared with 6.8 percent New Zealand-born).</p>
<p>Our analysis is broken into three separate stages. The first is a probit regression on levels of interpersonal trust; the second is a tobit regression on our index of participation in community groups. Thirdly, we deconstruct the participation variable into the decision to participate, and the range of social activities that individuals engage in among those individuals who do participate in such activities. These variables are then tested using the full model specification with probit and tobit regressions, respectively.</p>
<p>With the probit regression using “Trust” as the dependent variable, and the tobit regression using “Participation” as a dependent variable, we use a standardized model with a fixed set of explanatory variables chosen based on our discussion in the section The Determinants of Social Capital, with consideration of the available data introduced in the section Data and Methodology. The variables are all described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0160017611400068">Table 2</xref>, and are all related to one of the four categories specified in our framework: geographical, demographic, human capital, or social infrastructure.</p>

<p>Of the demographic variables related to trust, there is no evidence of a gender effect in the levels of trust, or an effect of marital status or the presence of children. However, log age is found to be positive and significant. This reconfirms a common finding in the international literature that reported levels of trust are higher among older people. In terms of the three dummy variables for ethnicity which represent nondominant groups in New Zealand (the omitted variable being the dominant European or New Zealander ethnicities), the results show that identifying as Maori or Pacific Islander has a negative impact on reported trust, while there is no significant difference between the European and the Asian populations. Moreover, the dummy variable representing migrants (foreign-born) is also statistically insignificant.</p>
<p>Among the human capital variables, postsecondary education and higher level occupations are both significantly and positively related to trust at the 1 percent level, as is the log of household income. These findings are consistent with international findings such as those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160017611400068">Helliwell and Putnam (2007)</xref> and in the meta-analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160017611400068">Huang, van den Brink, and Groot (2009)</xref>. With respect to geography, there is evidence that both the South Island and rural areas in general experience greater levels of trust. Finally, our regression shows that the coefficient on the social infrastructure expenditure variable is positive but is not statistically significant at the 10 percent level.</p>
<p>Model 2 presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0160017611400068">Table 3</xref> reports the results for determinants of the participation index. The participation index is truncated both at zero, where the individual participates in no community activities, and at nine, where the individual participates in all nine activities listed in the WVS questionnaire. Due to this double truncation, the data were analyzed by means of a tobit regression. In this model, gender is again insignificant, but being a couple (rather than a single person) is found to be negatively related to social participation at the 1 percent level. In other words, single persons are more likely to participate in community activities than couples. However, when couples have children, participation increases again as parents become more actively involved in community activities connected to their children; the number of dependent children in the household is significant at the 1 percent level. The significance of age in the participation model is consistent with the results for the trust equation.</p>
<p>With respect to ethnicity there is a contrast between its impact on trust and participation: the Maori and Pacific communities reported lower levels of trust but higher levels of participation in community activities. The coefficient of the Asian ethnic group is once again not statistically significant at conventional levels. Being foreign-born has a significantly negative impact on participation in community activities, which are of course likely to be often culturally aligned with the host European and Maori communities. In terms of the human capital variables, again postsecondary education and a high-level occupation are positive and significant, while having a low-level occupation is now also significant, with a negative coefficient. Hence, besides a positive effect of a high level of education on participation in community activities, the results show that people with high autonomy and responsibility in their jobs are more likely to participate (and perhaps provide leadership roles) in community activities. Interestingly, participation does not have statistically significant income elasticity. Geographic factors have only a minor impact on participation (via a positive rural effect) while per capita public spending on social infrastructure has no apparent influence on participation in community activities.</p>
<p>However, the equation may hide a selection mechanism in which there is a two-stage process operating: there are factors which influence the decision to participate in community activities or not (a binary variable) and then, conditional on positive participation, there are factors that influence the diversity of participation, that is, the numbers of different types of community activities a person engages in. Hence, the social participation index was reexamined to see whether the decision to participate is different from the diversity of participation for those who do participate. In order to investigate this, we split the index into two dependent variables. The first variable, a binary variable “yespart,” indicates whether an individual is a participant in a community activity, while the second variable is the number of different community activities for those individuals who actually do participate in at least one activity. The variable “yespart” was analyzed using a probit regression, while the truncated “participation” variable was estimated using a tobit regression with a lower bound of 1 and an upper bound of 9. For comparison, and to avoid omitted variable bias, in each case, the model is the same as that specified for the two earlier regressions. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0160017611400068">Table 4</xref>

<p>Model 3 presents the results of the probit regression model which tests for the influencing factors on the decision to participate in social activities and networks. For the demographic, human capital, and geography variables, the results are very similar to those of column 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0160017611400068">Table 3</xref>, in terms of sign, magnitude, and statistical significance of the coefficients. The most interesting result is an inverse relationship between participation in community activities and the <italic>per capita</italic> spending on social infrastructure. In principle, there is no joint endogeneity problem as we explain <italic>current</italic> participation in community activities by <italic>past</italic> social infrastructure spending. However, if there is temporal persistence in the spatial distribution of social capital, it is likely that local and regional governments have increased social infrastructure expenditure in those communities where the participation in community activities was low. If so, this would be consistent with the negative coefficient in our pooled microdata.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0160017611400068">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Model 4 presents the results of the tobit regression model which tests for the factors influencing the diversity of participation in community activities among those who participate in such activities. These results now show a significant gender effect, with males having a lower diversity of participation. While marital status is insignificant, the diversity of participation in community activities increases with the number of children, as one would expect. However, age is not significant. All of the minority ethnicities included in the model show a significantly greater diversity of participation than European-origin New Zealanders, but this is only the case for those who are New Zealand-born, because the foreign-born not only have a lower prevalence of participation in community activities but also engage in a lower range of activities. The human capital variables show that increasing human capital is related to increased diversity of participation and income is again insignificant. With respect to the geographical variables, regional population size has a significantly negative effect on diversity of participation at the 10 percent level. This is highly plausible because in regions with smaller populations the range of social activities may be limited, since the setup costs of particular types of social infrastructure may be high and regions with small populations may not have reached the thresholds at which setup costs for such activities can be recovered through private or public contributions. This interpretation is reinforced by the observation that the regional per capita expenditure on social infrastructure is now positively and significantly related (at the 1 percent level) to an individual’s range of participation in community activities. The greater social infrastructure expenditure per capita may facilitate a larger range of activities being available.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0160017611400068">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Taken together these four models suggest that demographic, human capital, and geographical factors all have subtle relationships with social capital formation. For example, in terms of household composition, there appears to be little evidence of a gender effect, a surprising result given much of the literature, whereas an additional child increases the likelihood of both participating and the range of social activities to participate in, as expected. However, women participate in a wider range of social activities than men. These results suggest that the gender effect widely discussed in the literature is more subtle than is often implied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160017611400068">BTRE 2005</xref>), and point to something of a selection process operating. Similarly, the effect of belonging to an ethnic minority such as Maori or Pacific Island groups is not straightforward, in that this increases the likelihood of participation and the variety of social activities, while at the same time lowering trust. Being of foreign-birth is significantly negative in both measures and may reflect difficulties in assimilation among immigrants or participation in informal migrant networks, rather than clubs, and so on. Finally, as expected from the findings of other research, higher levels of human capital are found to be consistently and positively related to both trust and participation. As a whole, therefore, while our results for the relationships between demographic and human capital characteristics and social capital are consistent with much of the literature, they suggest that these relationships are more subtle and complex than much of the literature implies.</p>
<p>Similarly, in terms of spatial aspects, living in the sparsely populated South Island and also in rural areas in general increases levels of trust. Social participation appears less directly related to geography, although participation in social capital forming activities is somewhat more prevalent in a rural environment. Moreover, the range of social activities people participate in is inversely related with the scale of population. As such, our findings are broadly consistent with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160017611400068">BTRE 2005</xref>), but again imply more subtle roles of the commonly suggested determinants.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of public policy, we see that expenditure on regional social infrastructure itself plays no significant role in predicting trust at the broadest level or in predicting an individual’s participation in community activities in general. However, when the participation index is deconstructed this reveals more complex interactions. We now find that expenditure on social infrastructure increases the range of social activities among those who do participate, whereas the decision to participate is itself negatively correlated with the level of social infrastructure expenditure.</p>
<p>There are two possible explanations for these observations. One possibility is that the direction of causality is reversed, as alluded to in the previous section. Under this scenario, local governments in areas with low community participation may attempt to increase participation by raising social infrastructure levels, generating the negative association between participation and infrastructure expenditure in the first stage regression. However, in doing so, these councils raise the opportunities for participation in additional forms of community organization, and this is reflected in the significant positive relationship in the second stage regressions.</p>
<p>The second possible explanation is that as social capital is in part a public good, there is the potential for free riding or social loafing. Under this scenario, increasing social infrastructure expenditure increases the range and intensity of participation for those already participating, suggesting that increasing spending on social infrastructure increases the benefits of participation in activities leading to social capital accumulation. If, however, social capital is a public good, then individuals who were already barely participating now have even less incentive to participate, as they can free-ride off those in their social networks who have higher social capital as a result of the improved returns to their individual participation. This then may result in marginal individuals substituting their time away from participation toward alternate uses for their time. Therefore by increasing public funding of social infrastructure, the incentive to privately invest time in social capital forming activities may actually fall. These types of perverse outcomes are not uncommon where the provision of public goods is concerned. With the data at hand, it is not possible to distinguish between these two explanations. Nevertheless, this observational equivalence problem again underlines the fact that the relationships between social capital formation and social infrastructure investment are very subtle and complex, as is also the case with the relationships between social capital, demographic, human capital, and geographic characteristics. The implications of these findings for public policy in general, and the promotion of “third sector” institutions in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160017611400068">Kendall 2009</xref>), therefore needs further careful consideration.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The analysis in this article has two major novel features to it. Firstly, it is undertaken in a country with very high levels of social capital, a high quality institutional context, which can also be considered as one of the most self-contained national case studies possible, given its geography and isolation. This allows us to rule out the effects of many external influences which will complicate the analyses in other cases. The second novelty of the article lies in the unique combination of individual-level social capital data allied with local public expenditure on social infrastructure. These data allow us to uncover some of the complex and subtle interactions which exist between social capital, demographic, human capital, geographical, and public policy features. Our results imply that there is clearly something of a positive relationship between social capital and local public expenditure on infrastructure related to social capital formation. However, as with all relationships between individual behavior, social behavior, and the provision and formation of intangible public goods, the actual mechanisms are likely to involve complex free rider and selection issues, which are rather more subtle than much of the social capital literature currently suggests.</p>

<title>Data on Regional Social Infrastructure Expenditure in New Zealand</title>
<p>The utilized measure of social infrastructure expenditure covers expenditure on parks, community facilities, social services, and public property. As noted in the article, local governments in New Zealand were not required to provide standardized accounts of their expenditure prior to 2001. A consistent dataset therefore had to be constructed from scratch, principally from local authority annual reports and via requests directly to the authorities concerned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0160017611400068">8</xref></sup>
</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0160017611400068">Table A1</xref> shows the items included in the expenditure measure. There is no finer breakdown available. However, major components of the available expenditure group consist of regional and local public property, reserves, libraries, housing, and social services which may all be expected to contribute to social infrastructure investment. “Rural fires” belong to this category too, given that such fires in New Zealand are handled by volunteer fire brigades. Similarly, civil defense has a voluntary component. Furthermore, the items of expenditure on economic development, tourism, promotions, public conveniences, and (voluntary involvement in) civil defense contribute to some extent to the development of social capital.</p>

<p>Only three items listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0160017611400068">Table A1</xref> do not contribute to social infrastructure expenditure. However, in the New Zealand context these items are a very minor component of the aggregate expenditure measure. Harbors, ports, and airports are mainly run by companies with expenditure predominantly excluded from the public accounts. Public funding for polytechnics (and schools and universities) is close to 100 percent from central government, so that this would be a very minor expenditure item at the regional level. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0160017611400068">Table A2</xref> shows the average annual expenditure on social infrastructure over the two six-yearly periods in 2004 New Zealand dollars. This is broken down by RC, TA, and combined. The largest expenditure is clearly observed in the largest cities of Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0160017611400068">Table A3</xref> shows per capita expenditure. RC per capita expenditure on social infrastructure expenditure is relatively minor. Per capita TA expenditure is consistently the highest in the capital region Wellington, but also quite high in the metropolitan region with the largest population (Auckland). Per capita expenditure is consistently low in Northland and Marlborough.</p>
