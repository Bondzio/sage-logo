<p>The <italic>Self-Assessment Color Review</italic> series is comprised of books in various areas of veterinary medicine that use a case-based approach. This volume presents an overview of feline infectious diseases written as 199 short illustrated cases. The description of each case is given in a paragraph or two and is followed by a few questions. Cases are illustrated with one or two images that may show clinical lesions, radiographs, photomicrographs, histology sections, etc. The detailed answer for each set of questions is found by turning the page, making it convenient to read through the cases and test one’s knowledge. For example, a case of <italic>Otodectes cynotis</italic> infection is presented with a signalment and history, as well as photographs of the skin lesions and the mites. The reader is then asked questions, such as how the infection is transmitted and what treatment options are available. The cases include a variety of feline infectious diseases — viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic. The editors and their 13 international contributors use a practice-oriented approach to presenting the cases, closely approximating the way such diseases would appear in clinical practice, thus reinforcing clinical skills. The front of the book shows the cases classified by organ system or type of infection, making it easy to find cases in particular subject areas. Finally, the book also contains a table of normal reference intervals for physical examination findings, complete blood count, coagulation and biochemistry panels, and urinalysis. The book would be most useful to veterinary students in clinical rotations, but also valuable for clinicians who wish to review and improve their knowledge of feline infectious diseases. The book would also be useful for clinicians studying for further qualifications. The short case format and accessible style make it easy to pick up the book, browse a few cases and learn some new facts in the space of a few minutes of free time.</p>
