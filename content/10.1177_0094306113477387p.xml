<p>In <italic>Queens of Academe</italic>, Karen Tice delves into the complex and understudied world of collegiate beauty pageantry. Her interest, sparked by her mother’s involvement in pageants as a young woman, is in tracking the history of college beauty pageants and how they have transformed over the years, as well as unraveling the issues of objectification and feminism in a changing world. Beauty pageants have remained popular on college campuses but in recent years their emphasis has shifted from <italic>beauty</italic> to <italic>intellect</italic>. Tice compiles interviews from contestants, judges, coordinators, and others involved in collegiate pageantry from various universities to understand the balance they create between the value of a woman’s beauty and the value of her mind.</p>
<p>Tice introduces this issue by painting a picture from a pageant she attended ten years ago at Georgetown College in Kentucky. A pageant contestant dressed as a cowgirl lassoed a pig onstage as part of her talent portion, protesting the expectation that a woman must be ladylike and poised to be considered of value. Changing norms and expectations for women have brought about questions for the actors in pageantry. Throughout the book the questions arise: Should beauty pageants be wiped out completely or just the swimsuit portion? Even with focus shifting from physical beauty to inner beauty, are pageants still damaging to a woman’s self worth? Are pageantry values and feminist ideas on opposite ends of the spectrum, or is there some middle ground?</p>
<p>Tice also brings attention to matters of discrimination based on gender, class, race, and sexuality, and how different student groups are creating their own pageants in an attempt to eliminate this discrimination. These alternative pageants are centered around creating equality and empowering students rather than displaying beauty and talent. Pageants in historically black colleges and universities are highlighted in Chapter Five. The contestant winners are expected to be involved in campus organizations and politics and, most importantly, promote African heritage and culture in the community.</p>
<p>From topics of gender, sexuality, race, class, religion, media, and tradition, the ground of the beauty pageant culture is well covered. Tice concludes by posing a challenge to uncover the cultural practices that are disempowering women and minorities, whether it be the beauty pageant culture or something else. This book is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the pageantry phenomenon and issues of feminism and gender norms.</p>
