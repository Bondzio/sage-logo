<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>According to the UK Faculty of Public Health’s position statement on “Alcohol and Public Health”,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913912457307">1</xref></sup> alcohol is a potentially addictive psychoactive substance. Acute harm can result from alcohol-related accidents, injuries and suicide. Alcohol is a major contributory factor to violent crime, including domestic violence. Chronic harm related to alcohol misuse includes liver cirrhosis, high blood pressure, coronary heart disease, pancreatitis and mental health problems; it can also increase the risk of developing liver, mouth, oesophageal, pharyngeal, breast and colorectal cancer.</p>
<p>Alcohol use and misuse is widespread in the UK. In 2007, it was estimated that 72% of men and 57% of women in England had an alcoholic drink on at least one day during the previous week.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913912457307">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, 41% of men and 35% of women exceeded the daily recommended health limits on at least one day in the previous week. The UK Department of Health currently recommend that men should not regularly drink more than 3–4 units of alcohol and women more than 2–3 units on a daily basis;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913912457307">1</xref></sup> this includes at least two alcohol free days per week. The recommended maximum weekly totals are 21 units for men and 14 for women.</p>
<p>Alcoholic strength varies widely. A pint of strong lager contains three units whereas a small measure of spirit (25ml) contains one unit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913912457307">1</xref></sup> A standard glass of wine (175ml) at 12.5% alcohol represents 2.2 units, whereas “alcopops” are about 1.5 units. With so many different drinks and glass sizes, from shots, pints, to bottles, it is very easy for the public to get confused about how many units are in their drink.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913912457307">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>A simple and practical solution to this is that we move from ordering and serving alcoholic drinks in pubs, bars and restaurants in measures such as “pints”, “bottles”, “glasses”, “shots” etc to simply ordering and serving in alcoholic “units”. Hence, I would be required to ask for one unit of beer or two units of red wine, for example. The onus would then be on the licensed establishment to know the alcoholic content of their beverages and serve me the appropriate volume. I could then keep a close eye on the number of units that I was imbibing and ensure that I do not exceed the health limits. This change in social etiquette could have significant health benefits.</p>
<p>This intervention would, of course, not directly address those individuals who buy their alcohol in shops and drink at home. However, it is hoped that the requirement to order alcoholic beverages in units when drinking “out” might gradually improve individual’s knowledge of units and thus influence their behaviour when drinking “in”.</p>

<title>Health screening training for complimentary therapists</title>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I refer to the article ‘Hairdressers should be trained to check for skin cancer’ published in the May 2012 issue. As a Swedish masseuse working at East Sussex Osteopaths Clinic, in Dallington, East Sussex, I can confirm that the training given to many complimentary therapists already contains a large element of health screening.</p>
<p>Our initial interview with clients/patients contains many searching health questions. When treating our clients/patients we often see areas of bodies that may not be minutely scrutinized by the person themselves, family members or friends. We are therefore in an ideal position to spot such issues as skin cancers, verucas, fungal infections etc. Add to this the fact, that often in the relaxed atmosphere of the treatment rooms, people will confide health worries that they are not confident about ‘troubling’ their doctor with.</p>
<p>We therefore will recommend that the person seeks medical guidance for any issues that are of concern. In cases of extreme concern, we will refuse to treat the person until they have received medical guidance. This position/action is insisted upon by our insurance companies.</p>
