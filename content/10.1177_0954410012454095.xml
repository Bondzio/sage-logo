<abstract>
<p>Changing aircraft operational procedures is one way of mitigating the environmental impacts of aviation in relatively short timeframes with existing aircraft types. However, to date these mitigations have not been evaluated or compared in a systematic manner that considers both their environmental impact reduction potential and their ability to be successfully implemented. This article presents a comprehensive identification and systematic evaluation of potential near-term operational changes to determine their relative environmental mitigation benefits. The research also evaluated the potential for successful implementation by identifying possible barriers to implementation for each mitigation. The analysis identifies the most promising mitigations offering a combination of environmental impact reduction and ease of implementation.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954410012454095" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is increasing pressure on the aviation community to mitigate the environmental impacts of aviation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410012454095">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410012454095">2</xref></sup> Various mitigation strategies are being pursued, including developing advanced aircraft technologies and sustainable alternative jet fuels, creating new policies and standards, and modifying operational procedures. New technologies can reduce environmental impacts significantly but require long timeframes due to the slow turnover of aircraft fleets. Sustainable jet fuels can also reduce environmental impacts significantly but drop-in fuels will not be commercially available in large quantities in the near-term, and other potential fuels will require aircraft adaptations. In contrast, while operational changes have smaller overall mitigation potential, they can be implemented in much shorter timeframes with existing aircraft types. Such changes offer an important near-term complement to the longer term approaches. For the purposes of this study, near-term is defined as having potential to be implemented within the next 5–10 years.</p>
<p>Operational mitigations specific to given flight phases have been suggested and investigated at various depths. For example, continuous descent approaches (CDA, now evolving into optimized profile descents (OPD)) have been investigated extensively through field trials and are now fully operational at some airports, showing notable environmental impact reduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410012454095">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410012454095">4</xref></sup> Work on advanced surface congestion management is in the research and field prototype stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954410012454095">5</xref></sup> and more widespread application is expected soon, while other possible changes have yet to be fully defined, let alone studied in any significant depth. There is also growing interest from the air navigation service providers to understand the role that operational strategies available in each flight phase have on total mission fuel burn (and hence emissions), as illustrated by the Atlantic Interoperability Initiative to Reduce Emissions (AIRE) and Asia and South Pacific Initiative to Reduce Emissions (ASPIRE) programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954410012454095">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410012454095">7</xref></sup> The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) and EUROCONTROL Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) have also identified some near-term operational strategies that will be needed to achieve the desired system evolution, such as the NextGen Operational Improvements (OIs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410012454095">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The study presented here complements these activities by identifying and systematically evaluating a comprehensive set of potential near-term operational mitigations across all flight phases against a common set of environmental impact and feasibility criteria to help identify promising areas for further work. This article is an extension of the work described in Reynolds et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954410012454095">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section ‘Operational mitigations identification’ discusses the identification of mitigations. Section ‘Operational mitigations assessment’ presents the analysis approach and the ‘Results’ section presents the results. The section following these discusses the topics selected for further study. The final section gives conclusions and next steps from this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954410012454095"><title>Operational mitigations identification</title>
<p>The first objective of this research was to identify a comprehensive list of near-term operational mitigations to include in the study. While many mitigations have been proposed and several are in use, relatively few are formally documented, and knowledge of them is fragmented and distributed across a wide range of stakeholders in industry, academia, and the government. A combination of literature review, domain expertise and extensive stakeholder interviews was used to identify appropriate operational mitigations for this study.</p>
<p>To ensure a diversity of viewpoints, 23 interview subjects from 11 stakeholder groups across the civil aviation industry were targeted, including the regulators and policymakers, Air Traffic Control (ATC), airlines, airports and research organizations, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954410012454095">Table 1</xref>. To ensure consistency across the stakeholders, a formal interview protocol using a semi-structured questionnaire was established.

<p>On completion of the interviews and literature review, the team distilled a comprehensive list of over 75 possible near-term mitigation options, barriers and other key comments. While the full set of mitigations was primarily operational in nature, it also included factors raised by the stakeholders such as airline strategy (e.g. non-revenue flying, load factors) and non-operational policy (e.g. land use planning). This article focuses on the set of 61 purely operational mitigations identified from the process described above.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0954410012454095"><title>Operational mitigations assessment</title>
<p>The team developed a rating system to perform an iterative evaluation of the mitigation options. First, the mitigations were classified according to the phase of flight to which they applied.
<list id="list1-0954410012454095" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Surface, covering all gate and taxiing operations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Departure, covering all take-off and climb operations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cruise, covering operations from top of climb to top of descent.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Approach, covering top of descent to landing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Miscellaneous, for elements impacting multiple flight phases.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410012454095">Figure 1</xref> shows the distribution of these mitigations amongst the flight phases.
<fig id="fig1-0954410012454095" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Operational mitigations by flight phase.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410012454095-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The extent of the mitigation’s impact was evaluated in each of four environmental impact categories (Fuel burn reduction, Climate impact reduction, Air quality impact reduction, and Noise reduction) as follows.
<list id="list2-0954410012454095" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Primary (P): Primary goal is to reduce environmental impact in that category. For example, noise-minimizing trajectories have a primary goal of reducing noise.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Secondary (S): Primary goal/impact is reduction in another category, but the mitigation also yields benefits in that category. For example, surface taxi route optimization is focused on reducing fuel burn, but also yields reduced emissions, benefiting climate and air quality.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Neutral (0): No impact in that category. For example, changing cruise operations has no impact on noise around airports.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Adverse (A): Increases the adverse environmental impact in that category. For example, noise-minimizing trajectories which require longer flight paths may increase fuel use and emissions, adversely impacting fuel, climate, and air quality.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>In addition, the ease of implementation of each mitigation was rated as follows.
<list id="list3-0954410012454095" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Easy: Mitigations such as ground power and air conditioning that have already been successfully implemented, or mitigations such as reduced-engine taxiing that do not require significant stakeholder change or technical development.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Medium: Mitigations requiring relatively limited infrastructure additions such as end-around taxi ways or increased use of <italic>existing</italic> technology, such as area navigation/required navigation performance (RNAV/RNP) precision procedures.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hard: Mitigations such as automation development facing significant <italic>new</italic> technical development, stakeholder opposition and/or lengthy procedural review (such as major airspace changes).</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Finally, the potential system-wide impact of each mitigation was rated as Strong, Moderate, or Weak depending on their estimated relative impacts at a system-wide level. So, for example, a mitigation that had potential to significantly reduce fuel burn in a given flight phase, but that phase is a small proportion of overall fuel burn would have a ‘moderate’ or ‘weak’ system-wide impact categorization depending on expected magnitudes. By contrast, a mitigation that has a bigger impact on total system fuel burn would be ranked as ‘strong.’</p>
<p>This process allowed us to systematically evaluate and compare the mitigations. Classification according to the assessment criteria was subjective, but the process was refined and consensus built through several iterations within the research team, with the FAA and through further interaction with key stakeholders from the interview process. As exploration of specific mitigations continues, these estimates are likely to evolve.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954410012454095" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>The results of the operational mitigations assessment are shown in the following tables. For each, the qualitative assessment ranking consistent with the criteria discussed in the previous section is provided, along with a brief description of the characteristics of the mitigation and the rationale for the rankings shown.</p>
<p>From this process it is possible to compare mitigations and identify those most promising for further study and possible implementation. These generally have high system-wide impact potential coupled with relatively easy implementation in near-term timeframes.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0954410012454095"><title>Surface (S)</title>
<p>Nominal surface operations account for a relatively small proportion of total system fuel burn, but a significant proportion of delay is incurred in this phase and hence there are opportunities for meaningful environmental impact reductions. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954410012454095">Table 2</xref> shows the results of the surface mitigations evaluation.

<p>Surface congestion management systems hold potential to significantly reduce fuel burn and emissions through better surface management, for example by absorbing as much delay as possible at the gate or other appropriate location with the engines off.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954410012454095">10</xref></sup> Although technology-based surface congestion management systems (S-1.2) may offer the highest system-wide impact, they have non-trivial implementation barriers in terms of automation development and deployment that are likely to make near-term implementation a challenge at a large enough number of airports to realize a large fraction of this potential in the near-term. By contrast, simpler procedure-based systems (S-1.1) are likely to deliver moderate system-wide impact but with less challenging implementation issues and hence they are considered good candidates for near-term mitigation. Airport Surface Detection Equipment – Model X (ASDE-X) surveillance data (S-2.4) can be a major contributor to the development of effective surface congestion management systems and hence priority should be placed on expanding the collection and availability of this data to researchers.</p>
<p>Reduced-engine taxi (S-2.2), where aircraft taxi with some of their engines off, has the potential for moderate system-wide impact and easy implementation in theory, but in practice there can be reluctance from pilots to use it for operational reasons (e.g. starting engines near the departure runway instead of the gate). Exploring these issues in more detail to encourage greater use of this mitigation is warranted. Operational tow-outs (S-2.3) have similar potential taxi fuel burn reduction benefits, but the medium-level implementation challenges are associated with the likely need for airports to acquire greater numbers of clean tugs and an efficient way to return them to the ramp areas. In addition, prior studies have suggested there are some aircraft nose-wheel structural limitations associated with extended towing operations, and these too should be explored in more detail.</p>
<p>Holding or passing areas near runway ends (S-4.3) have moderate system-wide impact potential but pose a medium implementation challenge due to the requirement for additional infrastructure at airports which may not be possible in the near-term. End-around taxiways to minimize runway and queue crossings (S-4.1) have low system-wide impact but slightly easier implementation in the near-term.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410012454095">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Improved coordination tools (S-5) that enhance information sharing between ATC and operators have significant system-wide impact potential but are difficult to implement due to technical and stakeholder barriers that will probably prevent new mitigations in these areas from being viable near-term opportunities.</p>
<p>The other surface mitigations have relatively weak system-wide impact potential. The taxi fuel minimization mitigations (S-2) are generally easy to implement in the near-term and, like ground power (S-6), are already in use at many airports.</p>
<p>Finally, the runway assignment mitigations (S-3) generally require some form of controller decision support to have any major impact, which makes them hard to implement in short timeframes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0954410012454095"><title>Departure (D)</title>
<p>Engines typically operate at high thrust settings during take-off and departure operations, and hence mitigations in this phase can have significant fuel burn, emissions and noise impacts. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954410012454095">Table 3</xref> shows the results of the departure mitigations evaluation.</p>
<p>Continuous climb (D-1.3) and maximum climb (D-1.6) departures offer moderate system-wide impact with medium or easy implementability and hence may be appropriate for further examination.</p>
<p>Trajectories to minimize population noise exposure (D-1.5) offer strong system-wide impact reduction for noise with medium implementability issues, but there are interesting adverse trade-offs with the other environmental metrics. Operating in the best noise configuration (D-1.10) has also been assessed to have strong system-wide potential for noise together with interesting trade-offs between noise benefits and possible adverse impacts such as increased fuel use and emissions. Both of these mitigations therefore warrant further study. There are similar adverse impacts with optimal thrust cut-back (D-1.2), but this mitigation has a weak system-wide impact.</p>
<p>RNAV/RNP enabled Standard Instrument Departure (SIDs) procedures (D-2.1) offer moderate system-wide impact for fuel and noise with medium ease of implementation. These types of procedure are being explored at several airports, and hence a systematic assessment of their potential across the system would be highly valuable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954410012454095">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The other departure mitigations were ranked as having a weak system-wide impact and therefore are considered lower priorities for further study than the ones highlighted above.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0954410012454095"><title>Cruise (C)</title>
<p>The cruise phase of flight accounts for the largest proportion of total fuel burn, and hence mitigations here can have significant system-wide impacts. As a result, many of the mitigations in this phase are worthy of careful consideration for further study for near-term implementation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954410012454095">Table 4</xref> shows the results of the cruise mitigations evaluation.</p>
<p>Of the horizontal routing efficiency measures, Reduced Horizontal Separation Minima (C-1.1) and minimizing lateral route inefficiency (C-1.2) are considered to have strong system-wide benefit potential, but neither are easy to implement in the near-term (the former being ranked as hard and the latter as medium). In terms of vertical routing efficiency, Reduced Vertical Separation Minima (C-2.1) has good potential for environmental impact mitigation and has already been implemented in the U.S. Variants of cruise altitude optimization (cruise climb (C-2.3) and domestic step climb (C-2.4)) have significant mitigation potential with easy or medium implementation. Several speed efficiency measures such as cruise Mach reductions (C-3.2) and more efficient passing options (C-3.3) also have strong or moderate system-wide impact potential with medium or easy implementation. These issues are explored in much more detail in Lovegren and Hansman.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410012454095">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many of the other mitigations such as optimal individual speed allocation in the cruise phase (C-3.1) hold promise, but are hard to implement because they require major additional equipage, changes to existing procedures or ATC coordination.</p>

<p>The approach flight phase accounts for a relatively small amount of overall mission fuel burn because the engines are in low power settings for most of the descent, but there are non-negligible fuel and noise savings to be gained during holding and final approach conditions. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0954410012454095">Table 5</xref> shows the results of the approach mitigations evaluation.</p>

<p>The improved airline/ATC coordination mitigations (M-2) all have moderate system- wide impact with most having medium ease of near-term implementation (a few are ranked as easy) and this is an area where further assessment is clearly warranted. Policy measures (M-3) have potential to have strong system-wide impact, but any mitigation involving policy change are unlikely to be realistic for near-term implementation. But given their impact potential, further study would clearly be useful for implementation in somewhat longer time timeframes. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0954410012454095">Table 6</xref> shows the results of the miscellaneous mitigations evaluation.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0954410012454095"><title>Topics selected for further study</title>
<p>The systematic identification and qualitative assessment against common performance metrics described in the previous section provides important insights into the potential environmental mitigation options in the near-term. In the second phase of this work, several mitigation areas were selected for more detailed study based on a number of selection criteria, including the desire to have at least one study from each flight phase, mitigation potential, gaps in the current research literature and complementarity to other on-going mitigation study areas. This section summarizes the key findings from the more detailed studies in four areas: End-around Taxiways (S-4.1); RNAV/RNP Departure and Approach Procedures (D-2.1/A-1.4); Vertical and Speed Cruise Efficiency Improvement (C-2/C-3); and Delayed Deceleration Approaches (A-1.3). These brief descriptions of the follow-on studies illustrate how the qualitative information can be validated and built upon to gain further insights into mitigation options.</p>
<sec id="sec11-0954410012454095"><title>End-around taxiways</title>
<p>End-around taxiways (EATs) eliminate runway crossings and can increase runway throughput, and reduce taxi time and fuel use. This section describes a case study of EAT use at Dallas/Fort-Worth International Airport (DFW) where arrivals on runways 17L and 17C have the option of either taking a conventional taxiway across runway 17R to get to the terminal buildings, or alternatively taking an EAT around the end of 17R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410012454095">Figure 2</xref>). The conventional taxiway results in a shorter taxi distance, but crossing 17R causes interactions with 17R departures which can increase taxi time compared to the EAT route which is effectively de-coupled from 17R operations. ASDE-X data was analysed for operations between 15 September 2010 and 13 December 2010 to quantify to first order the impact of an EAT on fuel burn and emissions reduction and to determine the factors, issues and conditions under which these reductions are observed. For more detailed results please see Uday et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410012454095">11</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig2-0954410012454095" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Simplified representation of EAT layout at DFW.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410012454095-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The use of the end-around taxiway was found to be highly dependent on factors such as runway configuration, traffic conditions, and controller and pilot preference. As a result, the number of aircraft using the EAT was varied from being used by all aircraft to not being used at all. Overall, 54% of the 17L arrivals used the perimeter taxiway. The maximum time taken to taxi via the conventional (non-EAT) taxiway was higher by more than 2 minutes compared to the maximum time taken to taxi via the EAT. Consistent with previously published results,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954410012454095">15</xref></sup> taxi times on the end-around taxiway showed less variability (with standard deviation values approximately 30 seconds lower) than those found for the conventional taxiway. This could potentially lead to improved gate and runway scheduling for the airport. Further, the maximum fuel burned by an aircraft using the conventional taxiway was significantly higher than the maximum fuel burned by an aircraft while using the EAT, while the average fuel burned on the EAT was less than on the conventional taxiway. The standard deviation of the total fuel burned was less in the case of the EAT.</p>
<p>These observations indicate that EATs have the potential to provide benefits consistent with the evaluations presented in the previous section, especially in high-traffic situations when frequent stops and starts on the conventional route are likely. EATs are fairly easy to implement, provided an airport has the necessary space. Concerns about aircraft on the EAT appearing to be crossing active runways have been addressed by placing a screen between the end of the runway and the EAT, or by depressing the EAT below the level of the runway. In continuing work, decision models to minimize fuel burn by appropriately selecting the conventional or end-around taxiway at different airports are being developed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0954410012454095"><title>RNAV/RNP Procedures</title>
<p>RNAV/RNP is a combination of avionics and procedures that allows precision approaches. It was originally developed to improve safety and increase access to high terrain airports. Since RNAV/RNP procedures can result in more efficient and precise arrival and departure trajectories and shorter path lengths, a reduction in total fuel burn and congestion is possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954410012454095">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954410012454095"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954410012454095">18</xref></sup> Noise mitigation can be achieved by limiting the populations that are flown over by ensuring repeatability of flight tracks (though this must be traded against the increased exposure of populations under the precision flight track), or by ensuring flight tracks are over unpopulated areas, such as rivers. This section describes a case study of an arrival procedure at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEATAC) to quantify to first order the impact of an RNAV procedure on fuel burn and emissions reduction and to determine the factors, issues and conditions under which these reductions are observed. For more detailed results see Muller et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954410012454095">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The results indicate that properly designed RNAV/RNP procedures can yield fuel and emissions savings during approach of up to approximately 40% (the potential savings per operation for the approach segment, not the potential savings per flight). However, these maximum benefits are only realized when procedures are optimized. The majority of existing RNAV procedures are overlays, which are merely higher precision, satellite-based designed versions of existing ground-based procedures. These procedures are easier to develop and pass through environmental review, but they do not yield as much fuel benefit; in fact, the accompanying noise concentration may result in increased noise complaints. Airlines are also reluctant to retrofit with the more advanced RNP equipment because the benefits of overlays are too small. In contrast, new, optimized, procedures do require significant effort and can be blocked by impacts identified during the environmental review process or community resistance, due to displacement and concentration of the noise footprint. In the short term, we can therefore expect that penetration of optimized procedures will remain limited. Future work will focus on identifying the best target airports and procedures for the development and uptake of optimized RNAV/RNP procedures.</p>
<p>These observations indicate that while RNAV/RNP procedures do have the potential to provide benefits consistent with the evaluations presented in the previous section, these benefits will only be realized if procedures are optimized and if they are implemented in a manner that addresses environmental and community concerns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0954410012454095"><title>Cruise efficiency</title>
<p>The cruise phase represents the largest fraction of total fuel burn and correspondingly the largest opportunity for fuel burn and emissions reduction. A study was conducted which focused on the potential efficiency benefits that can be achieved by improving the cruise speed and altitude profiles operated by flights today and findings are reported in full in Lovegren and Hansman.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410012454095">13</xref></sup> Flight data was collected for 257 flights during one day of domestic US operations. A process was developed to calculate the cruise fuel burn of each selected flight, based on aircraft performance and atmospheric data. Improved speed and altitude profiles were then generated for each flight, representing various levels of optimization. Optimal cruise climbs and step climbs of 1000 and 2000 ft were analyzed, along with optimal and Long Range Cruise speed profiles. Results showed that a maximum fuel burn reduction of 3.5% is possible in cruise given complete altitude and speed optimization; this represents 2.6% block fuel reduction system-wide (i.e. accounting for all the other flight phases which are not directly impacted by these cruise mitigations), corresponding to 300 million US gallons of jet fuel and 3.2 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> saved annually. These are significant savings potential which reinforce the ‘Strong’ system-wide benefits potential identified in the initial assessment. Flights showed a larger potential from improved cruise speed performance, with nearly 2.4% savings possible from speed optimization compared to 1.5% for altitude optimization. The barriers identified in the first phase of the work were largely confirmed, but the more detailed follow-on study allows mitigating these barriers to be viewed in perspective of how much saving might be possible if they were to be overcome. Few barriers were found to exist to some of the strategies such as step climbs and lower speeds, making them potentially attractive in the near term to realize a portion of this estimated benefit. As barriers are better understood and hence potentially mitigated, more of this significant system-wide benefit could be realized.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0954410012454095"><title>Delayed deceleration approaches</title>
<p>Delayed deceleration approaches (DDAs) primarily hold potential for reduced fuel burn and emissions by allowing aircraft to stay in clean aerodynamic configuration and low thrust for longer during approach operations compared to conventional approaches. There may also be noise benefits resulting from lower engine thrust levels and cleaner aerodynamic configuration for more of the approach path, but these effects need further study. Such approaches are often not conducted today due to air traffic and flight crew procedures which slow aircraft early in the approach, and overcoming this tendency is likely to be a major barrier to implementation. In order to assess the benefits potential of DDAs, operational data from flight data recorder (FDR) archives were used to study variations of fuel burns with key parameters of interest, e.g. airspeed, flap, power, etc. profiles. A full description of the methodology and full results are presented in Lovegren and Hansman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410012454095">13</xref></sup> and Dumont,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954410012454095">14</xref></sup> but they can be summarized as 30%–40% fuel saving potential below 10,000 ft for flights using DDAs compared to the average approach procedure. This equates to up to a 2% block fuel burn saving on typical commercial aircraft flights. Based on these results, estimates of US system-wide impacts were made: if <italic>all</italic> US flights conducted DDAs, fuel savings of 290 million US gallons per year (US$0.58–1.2 billion across all operators at US$2–4/US gallon price) and reductions of 2.8 million metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year could be possible. However, due to barriers to implementation, only a fraction of this ‘benefits pool’ is likely to be realizable, but if only 1% of US flights were to fly DDAs, fuel savings of 2.9 million US gallons per year (US$5.8–11.6 million worth at US$2–4/US gallon price), and reductions of 28,000 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year would be possible. These potential benefits are somewhat smaller in magnitude compared to the cruise efficiency findings, confirming the ‘moderate’ fuel reduction potential system-wide, but the savings are still significant. They justify a more detailed assessment of the barriers to implementation that need to be overcome to realise these benefits, which is now underway, including focused stakeholder engagement.</p>

<sec id="sec15-0954410012454095" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This article has discussed a research study to undertake a comprehensive identification and systematic evaluation of near-term operational changes to determine the relative environmental mitigation potential, as well as other factors such as barriers to implementation. Over 75 mitigations with the potential to reduce environmental impacts were identified based on a combination of literature review, aviation stakeholder interviews and industry knowledge between the research team and the FAA project sponsors. In this article, the 61 purely operational mitigations were discussed. The mitigations were qualitatively assessed in terms of their potential environmental benefit, ease of implementation and overall system-wide impact potential. Results for the operational mitigations identified have been presented in terms of their assessment rankings and what they mean in terms of which ones may be appropriate for further study and implementation.</p>
<p>One final point to note is that although the mitigations have been presented as independent, in reality there are important interdependencies. For example, absorbing delay en route instead of in the terminal area (A-4) relates to mitigations which change cruise speeds (C-3.1 and C-3.2), which are in turn related to enablers to making speed changes viable, such as more efficient passing options (C-3.3) and multi-laning (D-2.2). Such interdependencies affect the overall potential of each mitigation and this research can help identify these connections.</p>
