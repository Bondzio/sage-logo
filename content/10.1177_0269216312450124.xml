<body>
<p>Paediatric palliative care is an emerging subspecialty of paediatrics that has developed over the last decade, relatively distinctly from adult palliative care. In recent years, there have been multiple calls in the paediatric literature for the subspecialty to learn from and emulate its well-established adult counterpart.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312450124">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our experience, however, is that the converse is also true. The few adult-trained palliative care specialists working in paediatric services are becoming increasingly aware of useful lessons that can be learned from their paediatric colleagues.</p>
<p>Although adult and paediatric palliative care share the same fundamental principles – active, patient-centred care striving to enhance quality of life, there are significant differences in needs and practice. Whereas adult palliative care has traditionally focused on patients with cancer, paediatric services look after children with a diverse range of life-limiting conditions, most commonly genetic/congenital diseases (41%) and neuromuscular conditions (39%). Disease trajectories tend to be long and particularly unpredictable. Emergencies, often respiratory crises, occur relatively frequently and usually respond to active intervention. Prescribing for children is influenced by many factors, including body weight and low acceptability of the subcutaneous route of drug administration.</p>
<p>Families carry a particularly heavy burden, as long-term primary care givers. Related psychosocial morbidity, such as depression, divorce and unemployment, is prevalent. Children, unlike adults, tend to continue to develop physically and cognitively throughout their illness, and families expect flexible, responsive support at the location of the child, whether at home, school or hospital. Paediatric hospice admission usually occurs for planned respite care or for symptom management, at any time from diagnosis to death. The dual approach, combining palliation with disease modification, cuts across the conventional transition from active treatment to palliative care.</p>
<p>It is clear then that paediatric palliative care differs considerably from its adult counterpart, and can be clinically challenging. We argue that it is the development of the subspecialty in the face of such challenges that has lead to the innovative practice from which adult palliative medicine can learn. Necessity is, indeed, ‘the mother of invention’.</p>
<p>As children need home-based care, a close relationship with key professionals, and concurrent disease modification with palliation, this has led to the development of specialist nurses, who can provide care across all healthcare settings at any stage from diagnosis to death. For example, paediatric oncology outreach nurses, POONs, act as key workers providing active treatment, such as chemotherapy, within hospital and at home, as well as home-based palliative care at the end of life. There is evidence that, with such support, 80% of children can die in their preferred place, usually home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216312450124">2</xref></sup> By contrast, adult specialist nursing care is relatively fragmented. Cancer site-specific nurses and respiratory nurse specialists, for example, have traditionally tended to work in one setting, focusing on early-stage disease and then handing over to palliative care colleagues. Adult specialist nursing teams could emulate the POON model with, for example, cancer site-specific specialist nurses working between hospital, hospice and home from diagnosis to death.</p>
<p>Although advance care planning is increasingly promoted for adults, the speed with which medical crises develop, coupled with the role of parents in decision-making, has meant that, in the paediatric field, future care planning is particularly well developed and frequently integrated with emergency treatment planning. In the UK for example, the South Central Strategic Health Authority has developed a unified Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (DNACPR) policy, which includes a detailed future care plan for children and young people. Decisions about CPR are more easily discussed within the context of a wider future care planning discussion.</p>
<p>In addition, formal symptom management plans (SMPs) are an increasingly established part of paediatric and young adult palliative care practice. A SMP summarises the clinical context and anticipated future problems, and then, for each symptom in turn, gives a detailed plan of current and potential treatment options. The plans are shared, usually electronically, with patients, families and the wider healthcare team, and are updated regularly with careful version control. Our experience is that SMPs enhance communication significantly, including identifying misconceptions of families or other carers, and increasing both a sense of control and confidence in staying at home. Adult patients, particularly those with complex palliative care needs, could benefit considerably from increased use of SMPs.</p>
<p>A number of paediatric prescribing practices are of relevance to adult palliative care. Firstly, body weight is considered before any drug prescription. Children receive a paracetamol dose of 15 mg/kg four times daily. Underweight adults are often automatically prescribed 4 g daily with little appreciation of the risk of hepatotoxicity. Deaths in malnourished, underweight adults are increasingly reported, and it has been recommended that the paracetamol dose should be reduced to 2 g/day in adults under 50 kg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216312450124">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>As children tend to experience significant physical side effects and behavioural changes with steroids, they are prescribed for the shortest period possible. For children with persistent symptoms, pulsed steroid prescription is common practice, with evidence for fewer adverse effects with courses of five or less days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312450124">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312450124">5</xref></sup> Although the dangers of steroids in adults are also well understood, dexamethasone prescribed for raised intracranial pressure, appetite or well-being is often never stopped. Pulsed steroid prescription, with short-term use repeated after an interval if needed, may be worth considering instead.</p>
<p>Melatonin is widely used in paediatric practice to manage sleep disturbance due to disruption of circadian rhythm. Immediate and modified release formulations are combined according to the relative difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep. In adults, melatonin is little used, despite the prevalence of insomnia in advanced disease and evidence for benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312450124">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312450124">7</xref></sup> It is a safe drug with antioxidant and possible oncostatic effects, and it could be of value in adults with many conditions, such as dementia.</p>
<p>The understandable reluctance to use the subcutaneous route in children has led to the development of the buccal route of drug administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312450124">5</xref></sup> There is rapid absorption from the buccal route and avoidance of hepatic first-pass metabolism. Buccal midazolam is widely used for control of distress in those receiving terminal care at home; buccal injectable morphine and diamorphine are similarly prescribed for control of pain and breathlessness. Family members can respond immediately to symptoms, without having to wait for the arrival of nursing staff. This approach could be of considerable value in adult community palliative care practice.</p>
<p>Finally, the ‘stop-and-go’ method of rotation to methadone recommended in adults tends not be used in children, probably because of difficulties in judging when to give ‘as needed’ doses. Instead, a ‘cross-titration’ approach is often used. A small dose of methadone, such as 0.5–1 mg once daily, is added to the existing opioid, and a twice daily dose is titrated up over days to short weeks while the original opioid dose is reduced. The first trial comparing different methods of conversion to methadone has been recently published, and favours cross-titration over the ‘stop-and-go’ approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216312450124">8</xref></sup> Although this approach, as with all methods of rotation, requires close monitoring to avoid opioid toxicity, our experience is that cross-titration can lead to lower final methadone doses. For example, a child requiring more morphine 1.5 g/24 h at referral to our service became well symptom controlled on methadone 15 mg/24 h. The initial methadone dose (30 mg p.r.n.) advocated by the ‘stop-and-go’ method would have been excessive. Anecdotally, we have noted that a degree of pain control is sometimes lost when the residual small dose of original opioid is stopped at the end of the cross-titration process. Could this be indirect evidence of the benefit of opioid combinations?</p>
<p>Adult palliative medicine specialists could learn even more from their paediatric colleagues by actually working within a paediatric palliative care inpatient setting. Direct paediatric palliative care experience is limited in current adult palliative care training programmes. We strongly support increasing this exposure, as our experience has shown it provides an excellent opportunity for professional development.</p>
<p>Despite a 20-year head start, adult palliative care would do well to take note of the interesting and innovative practice of our paediatric colleagues. It is said that ‘every challenge represents an opportunity’. Paediatric palliative care is certainly converting the many challenges inherent to the care of life-limited children into an opportunity for us all to learn.</p>
