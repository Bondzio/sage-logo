<p>Reduction of various antinutritional factors in cereal brans by different treatments (microwave heating, dry heating and wet heating) were studied. There was significant difference (<italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) in reduction of antinutritional factors of treated cereal brans except for dry heating at low temperature. Microwave heating at 2450 MHz for 2.5 min resulted in 53.85%, 57.21%, 65.00% and 100% reduction in phytic acid, polyphenols, oxalates and saponins, respectively. Wet heating resulted in maximum reduction in trypsin inhibitor activity (83.07%) at 110 °C for 25 min. Processing treatment resulted in increase in bulk density and slight darkening of the brans. The most effective method of detoxifying most of the toxicants was microwave heating for 2.5 min, and therefore it could be exploited for making treated brans an ideal source for potential food application.</p>

<p>Although cereal brans are rich in dietary fiber, omega-3 fatty acids and contain modest amounts of starch, proteins, certain minerals and vitamins, but their use in food and feed is still limited because of the presence of several antinutritional factors (ANFs) like phytic acids, trypsin inhibitors, polyphenols, oxalates, saponins, lipases and hemagglutinin. These toxic factors present in cereal brans must be eliminated or minimized in order to utilize its entire nutritional potential. Many efforts have been made in the past but all were focused on removing one or more of the toxic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1082013211428236">Rehman and Mahmood, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1082013211428236">Sayre et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1082013211428236">Shivaji and Jagrahan, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>The most effective methods for reduction of antinutritional factors of cereal brans include dry heat and wet heat stabilization. Other methods include use of chemical products, such as hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, calcium hydroxide and stabilization by microwave and extrusion. Wheat bran, a by-product of flour milling is composed of the pericarp and the outermost tissues of the seed including the aleurone layer. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1082013211428236">Ranum (2000)</xref> found that bran is mainly cellulose with very little gluten, contain higher vitamin and mineral contents, so can be used for other than being a source of fiber as nutrient. However, bran also contains higher level of phytic acid, which makes the minerals less available to the body, particularly when used in a non-fermented food product. A major obstacle in using rice bran is that it rapidly deteriorates, thus it is necessary to find a good method for preventing the rapid deterioration of rice bran and to ensure the quality material for further processing. Rice bran must be stabilized immediately after milling, by minimizing its FFA content to extend the shelf-life. It can be done by inactivating of lipase and peroxidase enzymes using different heat treatment. The best stabilization method of rice bran in commercial level is giving heat treatment at 60 °C for 15 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1082013211428236">Malekian et al., 2000</xref>). In order to achieve this, stabilization of rice bran by microwave heating is popular and effective method. The use of microwave energy is an important new means of heating and is forecast to be used to a greater extent in the future. Microwave heating is efficient, economically superior, and shorter in processing time and has little effect on the original color of the brans. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1082013211428236">Lehtinen et al. (2003)</xref> reported that high amount of unsaturated fatty acids in oats makes them nutritionally beneficial, but at the same time renders oats particularly susceptible towards formation of rancidity. Despite actions taken to improve the storage stability of oat products, such as heat treatment, the shelf-life of oat products is typically shorter than that of equivalent products from other cereals with lower lipid content.</p>
<p>Heat treatments were effective in stabilizing the cereal brans by reducing the rancidity and heat-labile antinutritional factors in brans. Wet heat has been proved to produce higher detoxification of antinutritional factors than dry heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1082013211428236">Nelson et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1082013211428236">Ukachukwu and Obioha, 1997</xref>). Dry heat apart from aiding flavor development, improves minerals and protein content of foods and removes heat labile antinutrients. As these antinutritive factors are heat labile, the adequate wet heating study was undertaken to understand the optimal wet heating conditions and heating operations to make the brans a useful nutritional ingredients for food applications. Several type of heat stabilization procedures have been studied, which involve application of dry or wet heating treatment for a sufficient time to arrest the activity of antinutritional factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1082013211428236">Randall et al., 1985</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1082013211428236">Mujahid et al. (2005)</xref> reported that using of rice bran reduced feed cost per kg weight gain, but raw rice bran was observed to induce pancreatic hypertrophy and reduce intestinal amylase activity.</p></sec>

<p>Wheat bran was obtained from Ludhiana Flour Mill, Ludhiana, India. Rice bran was purchased from Ricela Health Foods Ltd., Dhuri, and Punjab, India. Barley grains were purchased from local market. Barley bran was prepared by milling of barley in grain pearler (Central Institute of Agricultural Engineering (CIAE), Bhopal, India). Oat bran (Baggry’s India Ltd., New Delhi, India) was purchased from local market. The dried cereal brans were ground to a uniform particle size using Cemotec mill (Foss, Hoganas, Sweden) having setting at No. 1. The fine fractions of brans were used for analysis and initial moisture content of brans were in the range of 9–10%.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec5-1082013211428236"><title>Heating</title>
<p>Microwave heating: To stabilize the bran samples microwave heat was given at 2450 MHz for 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 min using a microwave oven (LG MS2347BS Microwave Oven, Cavity type) followed by cooling at room temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013211428236">Abdul-Hamid et al<italic>.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Wet heating: Steaming of the bran was done at selected temperatures and time (100 °C, 110 °C and 115 °C) for 15, 20 and 25 min) followed by drying at 45 °C for 1 h.</p>
<p>Dry heating: Stabilization of bran samples was done by dry heating the bran in hot air oven (GHF brand Hot Air Oven, Memmert type) at 100 °C for 15, 20 and 25 min and 110 °C for 15, 20 and 25 min.</p>
<p>Analysis of antinutritional compounds: Standard methods were used for quantification of antinutritional compounds such as phytic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1082013211428236">Davies and Reid, 1979</xref>), trypsin inhibitor activity by the enzyme assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1082013211428236">Hajela et al., 1999</xref>), total polyphenol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1082013211428236">Swain and Hills, 1959</xref>), oxalates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1082013211428236">Abaza et al., 1968</xref>), and saponins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1082013211428236">Baccou et al., 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1082013211428236">Fenwick and Oakenfull, 1983</xref>).</p></sec>

<p>Stabilization treatment by microwave heating significantly reduced the phytic acid content of cereal brans (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1082013211428236">Table 1</xref>). Phytic acid decreased from 38.14 to 17.60 mg/g at 2450 MHz for 2.5 min of microwave heating. At 2450 MHz for 2.0 and 1.5 min, a reduction of 52.54% and 50.00% was observed, respectively. The reduction of phytic acid highlighted the importance of microwave heating for inactivation. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013211428236">Khan et al. (2009)</xref> reduction was observed in microwave stabilized rice bran due to heat labile nature of phytic acid.

<p>Mean trypsin inhibitor content of cereal brans was significantly decreased from 52.05 TIU/g (trypsin inhibitor unit/g) for untreated brans to 11.89 TIU/g when exposed to microwave intensity at 2450 MHz for 1.5 min. Microwave heating at 2450 MHz for 2.0 min brought down the trypsin inhibitors to 11.82 TIU/g (77.29% reduction). On extending heating time to 2.5 min, the trypsin inhibitor content was reduced to 11.32 TIU/g (78.25% reduction). Similar reduction was depicted in barley and oat bran with respect to TI (trypsin inhibitors). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013211428236">Khan et al. (2009)</xref> showed no detectable activity of trypsin inhibitor in rice bran after microwave heating. Microwave treatment, dry and wet heat treatment was capable of marked reduction in trypsin inhibitors because of its heat labile nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1082013211428236">Deolankar and Singh 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1082013211428236">Friedman and Brandon 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1082013211428236">Hernandez-Infante et al.<italic>,</italic> 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Pronounced effect of microwave heating (2450 MHz for 2.5 min) on the reduction of polyphenol (57.21%) was noticed. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1082013211428236">Abdul-Hamid et al<italic>.</italic> (2007)</xref> first fraction of rice bran after stabilization by microwave heating contained significantly higher total phenolic compounds (TPCs) compared to that of 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> rice bran milling fractions, respectively.</p>
<p>Mean oxalate concentration in untreated brans was 0.380% which reduced to 0.133% on microwaving at 2450 MHz for 2.5 min. Time variability showed effectiveness in microwave treatment for oxalate content of cereal bran. The percent reduction in oxalate content of cereal brans was 44.21%, 57.29% and 65.00%, respectively for 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 min at 2450 MHz. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1082013211428236">Quinteros et al<italic>.</italic> (2003)</xref> reported that all heating procedures reduce the soluble oxalate content, but microwave and industrial procedures are more effective than traditional domestic heating.</p>
<p>Microwave heating significantly eliminated the saponin content from 2.78 to 0.50 mg/g (82.01% reduction) at 2450 MHz for 2.0 min.

<p>Wet heating has pronounced effect on reduction of trypsin inhibitors. Trypsin inhibitor content of untreated bran was 52.05 TIU/g which significantly reduced to19.96, 8.81 and 11.54 mg/g at 100 °C, 110 °C and 115 °C for 25 min, respectively. Maximum inhibition (83.07%) in trypsin inhibitor was detected at 110 °C with 25 min in all cereal brans. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013211428236">Khan et al. (2009)</xref> reported that the trypsin inhibitors were completely eliminated in rice bran after parboiling. The reduction in TI on wet heating might be because of its heat-labile nature. Moist heat proved most effective than dry heat in destroying trypsin inhibitor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1082013211428236">Carlini and Udedibie, 1997</xref>). Similar results were reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1082013211428236">Rahman and Mahmood (1996)</xref> while studying trypsin inhibitors in rice bran by moist heat treatment.</p>
<p>Among the different temperature of steaming for variable time 115 °C for 25 min was found effective in inhibiting the activity of polyphenolic compounds. The mean percentage reduction in polyphenolic content was 47.26%, 51.24% and 56.47% at 100 °C, 110 °C and 115 °C for 25 min, respectively. However, higher temperature for larger time exposure affected the color of the brans. Time variability was significantly effective in reducing the polyphenolic content of cereal brans. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1082013211428236">Negi et al<italic>.</italic> (2008)</xref> reported that pressure-heating of seeds resulted in significant reduction in polyphenol content of moth bean. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1082013211428236">Zeb et al<italic>.</italic> (2006)</xref> observed that wet heating of rapeseed significantly lowered some of the phenolics, such as sinapine, catechin, lecuoanthocynidin contents, etc.</p>
<p>Mean oxalate content in raw (unprocessed) bran was 0.380%, maximum reduction in oxalate content (58.42%) was observed when samples were treated at 100 °C for 25 min. Higher temperatures did not show ay significant reduction in amount of oxalate content. This may be due to concentration of oxalate in the bran due to faster rate of moisture loss from the brans. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013211428236">Adekanmi et al. (2009)</xref> values of oxalates were 13.12% and 5.46–8.28% for raw and soaked tigernut and soaking reduced the oxalate by 37–58%. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1082013211428236">Obasi and Wogu (2008)</xref> observed a significant reduction in the oxalate content of yellow maize soaked in water for 12 h. Soaking at higher temperature had a significant effect on oxalate reduction. The loss of oxalate content may be due to leaching loss during soaking and boiling.</p>
<p>Steaming of cereal brans at different temperatures and time variables reduce the saponins. Wet heating at100 °C for 25 min resulted in decrease of saponins from 2.78 to 0.33 mg/g (88.13% reduction). At 110 °C and 115 °C for 25 min a reduction 87.05% and 72.82% was observed, respectively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013211428236">Duhan et al. (2001)</xref> reported that the loss of saponin from the pigeon pea during soaking may possibly be due to leaching out of saponin into the water through diffusion. Similar results have been reported by previous workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1082013211428236">Bishnoi and khetarpaul, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1082013211428236">Jood et al<italic>.,</italic> 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1082013211428236">Khokhar and Chauhan, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1082013211428236">Kataria et al.<italic>,</italic> 1989</xref>). They observed that soaking for different periods reduce the saponin content of chick pea, black gram, moth bean and green gram and peas. Pressure heating seems to have a more beneficial effect than ordinary heating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1082013211428236">Duhan et al<italic>.</italic>, 2001</xref>).

<p>Mean values showed that phytic acid content of cereal brans decreased with the increasing of temperature during dry heating (roasting) and with different time variation of the bran (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1082013211428236">Table 3</xref>). Mean phytic acid in untreated bran was 38.14 mg/g which reduced to 18.83 and 18.28 mg/g at 100 °C and 115 °C for 25 min, respectively. At 100 °C for 15, 20 and 25 min, the mean values for phytic acid content were 20.13, 19.58 and 18.83 mg/g respectively. As the temperature during dry heating increased to 110 °C over the same time intervals for dry heating, similar trend of reduction was achieved. Maximum degradation (52.07%) in phytic acid content was found at 110 °C for 25 min. Phytic acid was reduced but not eliminated during heat treatments may be partially due heat labile nature of phytic acid and the formation of insoluble complexes between phytate and other components. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1082013211428236">Sharma et al.

<p>Mean TI content varied significantly with dry heating in cereal brans. Roasting has significant impact on trypsin inhibition. It was observed that with progressive increase in temperature and time for dry heating, TI content decreased significantly and the effect was more pronounced when treatment carried for longer duration. Mean values revealed that, among the dry heating temperature 100 °C and 110 °C had maximum inhibition of trypsin inhibitors (63.14% and 80.54% reduction). Percent reduction in TI content at 100 °C and 110 °C was 63.14% and 80.54% for 25 min. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1082013211428236">Khan et al<italic>.</italic> (2009)</xref> observed highest activity in unstabilized rice bran (8.44 activity/mg), whereas dry heat stabilized bran showed no detectable activity of trypsin inhibitors. Heat treatment readily inactivates trypsin inhibitor in rice bran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1082013211428236">Tashiro and Ikegami, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Roasting at 100 °C for 15–20 min brought down the polyphenol content from 3.37 to 2.28 mg/g, and to 1.75 mg/g when dry heating temperature extended to 110 °C for 25 min. Maximum reduction (56.47%) in polyphenols was noted at 110 °C for 25 min and minimum reduction (15.42%) at 100 °C for 15 min. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1082013211428236">Reddy et al. (1985)</xref> reported that the observed decrease during heating may be due to binding of polyphenols with other organic substances and proteins, or from alterations in the chemicals structure of polyphenols, that cannot be determined by available chemical method. Decrease in polyphenol content due to heating has been noticed earlier by different workers in different legumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1082013211428236">Adewusi and Falade, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013211428236">Adekanmi et al<italic>.</italic> (2009)</xref> found that reduction of polyphenols was highest (65%) in tigernut when toasted in open pan for different time period. This indicates that polyphenols are heat labile. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1082013211428236">Iyayi et al. (2008)</xref> reported a higher percent reduction (67–70%) in polyphenols of <italic>Mucuna pruriens</italic> and <italic>Centrosema pubescens</italic> toasted at 100 °C for 1 h.</p>
<p>Statistically significant effect of dry heating at variable temperature and time was noticed on mean oxalate content of cereal brans. Mean oxalate content of untreated brans was 0.380%, which significantly reduced to 0.275% and 0.140% on heating at 100 °C and 110 °C for 25 min. Lower temperature (100 °C) did not show much destruction in the oxalate content of cereal brans. However, 110 °C was effective in reducing the oxalate up to 42.63% and 63.16% for 15 and 25 min, respectively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1082013211428236">Adekanni et al. (2009)</xref> reported that toasting reduced oxalate content significantly especially when toasted in open pan for 30 min. The higher loss of oxalate content in toasted tigernut might be attributed to the destruction of the oxalate at higher temperature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1082013211428236">Umoren et al. (2008)</xref> reported that thermal processing results in low levels of methionine, cystine, lysine and antinutritional factors (HCN, oxalate, phytate and tannins).</p>
<p>Dry heating at lower temperature did not cause much degradation in saponin content. The percent reduction in saponin content at 100 °C for 15, 20 and 25 min was 16.19%, 21.94% and 33.09%, respectively. About 56.12% and 82.17% reduction in saponin was recorded at 110 °C for 15 and 25 min, respectively. Therefore complete elimination of saponin was achieved when brans were dry heated at 110 °C for 25 min. So dry heating at 110 °C for 25 min proved to be most effective in elimination of saponin content in cereal brans.

<p>Microwave heated bran had higher bulk density than untreated brans (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1082013211428236">Table 4</xref>). Mean value for bulk density was 0.39 g/mL, which increased to 0.43 g/mL on 2450 MHz microwave heating of bran samples for 2.5 min. The bulk density of microwave heated brans at 2450 MHz for 2.5 min were 0.41, 0.38, 0.29 and 0.62 g/mL in wheat, rice, barley and oat bran, respectively; whereas untreated brans have 0.37, 0.36, 0.25 and 0.59 g/mL of bulk density. The color of brans is one of the important attribute for the acceptability of the product. During thermal processing the material may be exposed to temperature which have an adverse effect on quality and which make these products susceptible to color deterioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013211428236">Aliva and Silva, 1999</xref>).

<p>Temperature and time of exposure increase the bulkiness of cereal brans (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1082013211428236">Table 6</xref>). Much impact was observed at 25 min of heating. Mean value of raw bran was 0.39 g/mL which increased to 0.42 at both temperature of 100 °C and 110 °C for 25 min. The bulk density of individual cereal bran was 0.37, 0.36, 0.25 and 0.60 g/mL for wheat, rice, barley, and oat bran, respectively. Dry heating enhanced the bulk density of all cereal bran. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1082013211428236">Sharma et al. (2004)</xref> showed that bulk density of dry, stabilized rice bran increased significantly from 0.50 to 0.55 g/mL. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1082013211428236">Onimawo and Akpojovwo (2006)</xref> toasting increased bulk density in this study from 0.27 g/mL in raw pigeon pea flour sample to 0.45 g/mL in 100 °C toasted sample. This may be attributed shrinkage and re-orientation of molecules which leads to decrease in volume. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1082013211428236">Khan et al. (2005)</xref> found that the bulk density in rice bran was increased by more than 100% resulting in a structure from fluffy powder to crumble after treatment. Time and temperature had a significant effect on the <italic>L</italic>*, <italic>a</italic>* and <italic>b</italic>* values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1082013211428236">Table 6</xref>). Brans brightness (<italic>L</italic>*) after treatment decreased gradually, and redness (<italic>a</italic>*) increased with increasing temperature and time of treatment. Yellowness (<italic>b</italic>*) of the cereal brans processed at different temperature and time was lower than that of unprocessed cereal brans. Δ<italic>E</italic> value increased with increase in treatment temperature and time of treatment. Maximum Δ<italic>E</italic> (2.83) value was observed at 115 °C for 25 min. However, significant variation was observed at all temperatures and time of treatment. Similar results were found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1082013211428236">Aliva and Silva (1999)</xref> who stated that increase in <italic>a</italic>-value was observed after drying, heat concentration and heating processes. It was explained as the formation of some reaction products. Increase in the <italic>a*</italic>-value during processing was correlated with the decreasing the <italic>L</italic>-value.

<p>Regardless of bran type, different heating treatments applied in this work have drastically reduced the antinutritional load of the brans with microwave heating being the most effective. Wet-heated and dry-heated cereal brans were also low in antinutritional factors. Since brans are proposed as ingredient in human diet, any of these conducted treatments are strongly advocated to be applied to brans prior to their consumption to ensure their safety and quality in the food and feed. Cereal brans, by product of milling process could be a potential commodity in food industry as the cereal based communities at local and abroad are gearing up to make brans a new and welcome addition to the world’s food supply.</p></sec>
