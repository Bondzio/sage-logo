      <abstract>
        <p>Some scholars argue that every proverb should be interpreted on its own, while others
          search for clusters of sayings and posit that such clusters should determine how one
          understands a proverb. The first half of this study argues that the solution lies
          somewhere in between: clusters are important for interpreting individual proverbs, but
          they do not completely fix the meaning of a saying. Instead, they allow for several
          possible meanings, and they invite the reader to construct creatively his/her own reading.
          The second half of this article seeks to demonstrate how this theory works in practice, by
          using the example of the first three verses of Proverbs 16. In accordance with the reading
          strategy advocated in this study, several possible readings of the section are
          proposed.</p>

      <title>1. Does Context Matter?</title>
      <p>Some scholars argue that each saying in Proverbs 10–29 stands on its own and that a
        proverb's context should not influence its interpretation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309089213492817">1</xref></sup> McKane, for example, insists,</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>[T]here is, for the most part, no context in the sentence literature … the individual
          wisdom sentence is a complete entity… I admit that there are editorial principles of
          different kinds according to which sentences are grouped. I shall call attention to some
          of these, while maintaining that they have a secondary character and do not contradict the
          statement that there is, for the most part, no context in the sentence
              literature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309089213492817">2</xref></sup></p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>Westermann expresses a similar opinion in writing about the first few verses of Proverbs
        16, the section I will investigate shortly:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>Also possible is the intention of the compiler to place a group of Yahweh sayings in the
          middle of the larger collection of 10:1-22:16. Such compiling, at any rate, is a redactive
          procedure; it mirrors the compiler's intention. It has nothing to do with the original
          development of individual proverbs; nothing alters the fact that, to begin with, each
          saying is an independent unit in and of itself. This is confirmed when we consider each
          individual Yahweh saying on its own merit. All of these are extremely diverse and, within
          the general grouping of Yahweh sayings, belong to different categories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309089213492817">3</xref></sup></p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>McKane and Westermann, among others, are certainly right when they argue that most, if not
        all, proverbs were probably born as individual sayings. However, many questions can be
        raised concerning this approach. Not denying the fascinating contribution of approaches that
        search for the oldest textual layers, an important question concerns why the reader should
        downplay the ‘secondary’ (McKane) or ‘redactive’ (Westermann) editorial activity of a
        compiler in his/her interpretation. After all, if someone finds in a book a sentence which
        was previously used in a different context, he/she would still like to understand that
        sentence in the book which is in his/her hands. In other words, the reader may have a
        legitimate, essential interest in the ‘secondary’ re-use of the sentence, and not its
        ‘original’ meaning. Undoubtedly, many sayings in Proverbs 10–29 had a long history during
        which they were used in diverse contexts, perhaps even with different meanings. However, we
        can only imagine in what other literary contexts and life situations they might have been
        used, while we do have certain knowledge about <italic>this</italic> particular context of
        Proverbs’ present form. Why should we ignore <italic>this</italic> known context if it
        colours the interpretation of a particular sentence in an interesting way? Furthermore, as
        the whole is often more than the sum of the parts, perhaps it is worth investigating whole
        sections of proverbs to see if the results of editorial activities enable us to construe a
        richer interpretation of some sayings than if we took them only on their own.</p>
      <p>Such concerns would be welcomed by many scholars at the other end of the spectrum of
        scholarly opinions who contend that there are many carefully construed clusters of sayings
        in Proverbs 10–29, and that these chains of proverbs unambiguously drive home one single
        point. They argue that these clusters control the meaning of individual sayings and,
        consequently, that a saying, if it is a member of such a cluster, cannot properly be
        understood without considering its context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309089213492817">4</xref></sup> However, just as neglecting a proverb's
        literary context seems to be a problematic approach, this kind of emphasis on clusters is
        not without its own problems either. If it was the aim of the editors of Proverbs to present
        well-construed thematic sections—sections which convey a well described, clear message—then
        those editors did not choose the best medium for delivering it. The meaning of individual
        proverbs is often ambiguous, and it seems to be a rather challenging task to present a
        single point unambiguously through putting such ambiguous sayings next to each
            other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309089213492817">5</xref></sup> Furthermore, in
        order to reach the ‘right’ interpretation of a cluster, interpreters often have to create a
        very broad definition of that cluster's ‘theme’, along with having to skip over some verses,
        amend others, suggest unusual meanings to otherwise well attested words, establish logical
        connections between verses which are far from obvious for most readers, and so on. These
        gymnastic interpretative techniques undermine the credibility of the theory that clusters
        convey clearly defined teachings, and that understanding a cluster is a prerequisite for
        understanding a proverb.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0309089213492817">6</xref></sup></p>
      <p>However, to say that there are no strict thematic units with detailed, unambiguous messages
        does not mean that we cannot find clusters of sayings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0309089213492817">7</xref></sup> Weeks found 58 per cent of the verses in Prov.
        10.1–22.16 and in Proverbs 25–29 to be linked to their neighbour (Weeks did not investigate
        Prov. 22.17–24.34 in this respect). This high number makes it likely that there are clusters
        of sayings in the collection. Yet, as Weeks explains, most of the connections between the
        verses are not thematic, but rather literary. Verses alliterate, for instance, or they use
        the same expressions. Even when they are about the same subject, that subject is usually
        quite broad (e.g. the ‘righteous people’ and all the different issues in connection with
        them), and only occasionally do consecutive verses discuss the same narrow topic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0309089213492817">8</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Weeks argues that the varied nature of the linkage between verses suggests that the method
        the compilers used was usually associative and that they did not try to construct a logical,
        unambiguous discussion of certain topics in these clusters. Considering this ‘weak’ nature
        of connection between the sayings, Weeks concludes that ‘the collections are, broadly,
        atomistic: an understanding of the individual sayings is neither dependent on, nor
        necessarily enhanced by, a consideration of their place in a collection'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0309089213492817">9</xref></sup> Thus, we see in Weeks a similar
        position to that of Westermann and McKane.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0309089213492817">10</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Knut M. Heim, however, challenges this conclusion, arguing that 58 per cent is surely a
        high enough number, and that the interpreter should not neglect the fact that the compilers,
        one way or the other, connected the sayings to each other. Even as most clusters are
        incapable of providing a precise ‘thematic development’, it is legitimate to try to find the
        main point that they drive home.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0309089213492817">11</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Heim's argument is persuasive until we learn the results of Michael V. Fox when he checked
        Weeks's data. In his recent Anchor Bible commentary on Proverbs 10–31 he states,</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>Experimenting with Weeks's methods on several batches of verses taken from different
          parts of the book and randomly scrambled, I found nearest-neighbor linkages in 36–60
          percent of the verses in each batch. A more liberal use of ‘theme’ would have yielded much
          higher percentages, while an elimination of ‘literal’ links would have reduced them. Weeks
          also concludes that thematic considerations were not of major importance to the editors
          (p. 37). This is probably true overall, but when thematic clusters do occur, they are
          relevant to interpretation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0309089213492817">12</xref></sup></p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>Fox's investigation shows that 58 per cent might not be as high a number as Heim thought.
        Thus, based on Weeks's and Fox's investigations, we probably should not expect as many
        highly developed clusters with a strong connection between the proverbs, as Heim does,
        especially seeing that the links between verses are predominantly literary or delineate only
        broad themes. Nevertheless, 58 per cent is high enough to suggest <italic>some kind</italic>
        of organization. One should not forget that it is only an average for the whole of
        10.1–22.16 and 25.1–29.27, and many sub-sections of the book reach a percentage which goes
        well beyond the range of 36–60 per cent that Fox got by randomly scrambling the
            verses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0309089213492817">13</xref></sup></p>
      <p>At this point it is time to position the approach that I am going to advocate in this wide
        spectrum of scholarly views. We have seen the range of opinions from ‘every saying stands on
        its own’ (McKane, Westermann), through ‘there are clusters but their significance is
        limited’ (Weeks, Fox), to ‘there are a lot of clusters and in most cases an individual
        saying should be understood according to the clues provided by the cluster in which it
        occurs’ (Heim, Waltke). The associative approach I will argue for has similarities to the
        last two options. It accepts the results of Weeks's and Fox's research, yet it seeks to
        utilize those ‘weak’ clusters for the interpretation of individual proverbs.</p>
      <p>On the one hand, I agree with the conclusions of Fox and Weeks that some kind of
        ‘associative thinking’ explains the existing links between proverbial sayings in our
            collections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0309089213492817">14</xref></sup> As Fox
        explains the procedure, when ‘an “editor” (or “compiler”) writes down one proverb he knows…
        [it] makes him think of another one'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0309089213492817">15</xref></sup></p>
      <p>On the other hand, this conclusion leads me to a method of interpretation which is
        different from that of either Fox or Weeks. Fox says that ‘thematic clusters’ are relevant
        for interpretation, which implicitly suggests that non-thematic links are not
            relevant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0309089213492817">16</xref></sup> But even
        in the case of thematic clusters he is reluctant to go beyond recognizing the overarching
        broad themes of saying sequences. He does not try to find a detailed, logical message the
        author/editor/compiler may have wanted to convey through the catchwords, alliterations, and
        topical similarities in the consecutive verses, as he thinks (probably rightly) that the
        compiler did not hide such a message there waiting to be discovered. Weeks, as we have seen,
        also asserts that the understanding of individual sayings is not ‘necessarily enhanced by…a
        consideration of their place in a collection’, and he even uses the word ‘atomistic’ for
        describing the nature of the sayings of Proverbs 10–22 and 25–29.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0309089213492817">17</xref></sup></p>
      <p>My conclusion, however, is that the presence of ‘weak connections’ should not lead one to
        an ‘atomistic’ reading. Quite the contrary, the word ‘association’ suggests that the
        compilers pondered their proverbs, and sometimes pondered them in sequence. Maybe they
        reflected on a proverb in light of other proverbs with which they associated it. We cannot
        know for sure, but this is certainly the effect these clusters have on many readers—an
        effect exemplified by the many studies trying to construct coherent readings of clusters.
        Apparently, many who read several sayings about roughly the same topic and/or connected by
        literary devices almost automatically try to ponder the sayings in the light of each other.
        Such pondering inevitably leads to attempts to construct a coherent reading of a possible
        cluster and create logical connections between the ‘originally’ disconnected sayings. It is
        rather natural to suspect that stimulating such ‘meditation’ on a cluster of sayings was the
        intention of the compilers in their organization of the sayings—but whatever their intention
        was, this is one of the strongest effects of the literary compilation, and I do not see why
        we should resist it.</p>
      <p>This approach, of course, leaves much space for the imagination of the reader. The logical
        connections between different verses and their effects on the interpretation of other verses
        often can be construed in more than one way. As readers come from different backgrounds with
        different questions to the text, their contemplations on it will be different.</p>
      <p>In other words, my approach is somewhere between that of those who say that the reader has
        to find the meaning that was envisaged by the author/compiler through the links between the
        sayings, and that of those who say that each proverb carries its own meaning. Instead of
        finding the meaning or not searching for such a meaning at all, I suggest the reader
          <italic>constructs</italic> such meaning(s). The choice of words is important: there is a
        difference between ‘finding’ (or <italic>re</italic>constructing) and ‘constructing’ a
        meaning. Furthermore, there is a difference between speaking about ‘the meaning’ and ‘a
        meaning'. I fully accept that the links between verses in a cluster are often vague enough
        to leave space for constructing several possible meanings, and I also accept that the reader
        plays a significant role in constructing meaning. Thus, in most of the cases, one cannot
        claim that he/she has found <italic>the</italic> authoritative meaning of the text. Yet I do
        claim that constructing such readings is not only allowed by the text but is even encouraged
        by it, and as such it represents an appropriate reading method for Proverbs 10–29.</p>
      <p>The fact that such an associative reading does not produce the one and only authoritative
        reading, but can produce several different readings of the same text, does not mean that it
        is arbitrary and without control. Differentiating between better and worse readings is still
        important. Obviously, the reader always has to pay close attention to the exact words of a
        text (i.e. they cannot read ‘black’ where ‘white’ is written), and the framework of the book
        (Prov. 1–9 and 30–31) provides a context that restricts the range of possible readings of a
        cluster of verses. Furthermore, the harmony between the many sayings of Proverbs 10–29 also
        acts as a control on imaginative readings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0309089213492817">18</xref></sup></p>
      <p>To conclude, my approach can be summarized in three points:</p>
      <list id="list1-0309089213492817" list-type="order">
        <list-item>
          <p>Clusters enrich our readings of individual sayings because they encourage us to reflect
            upon sayings in the light of their neighbours. Even if a cluster does not provide a
            fixed, detailed message, the reader is prompted to construe one on the basis of the
            cluster.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>This does not mean that a cluster has one, single, authoritative meaning in itself,
            since the logical connections between verses are not defined. An ‘associative approach’
            that fills in the logical gaps between the verses can produce many different
                readings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0309089213492817">19</xref></sup></p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>The book as a whole, and especially its framework, provides a context which constrains
            (to some extent) how the reader can fill in the gaps between the verses in a
            cluster.</p>

      <title>2. An Example: Proverbs 16.1–3</title>
      <p>As the ‘associative reading’ recommended here requires a close reading of the text, space
        permits me to discuss only a few verses. I have chosen to investigate the first three verses
        of a well-known cluster: Prov. 16.1–9.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0309089213492817">20</xref></sup> Scholarly interpretation of this cluster has deployed all the
        above-mentioned approaches. Some deny the importance of this cluster for the interpretation
        of its individual verses (Westermann, McKane).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0309089213492817">21</xref></sup> Others provide a coherent reading of the
        whole cluster, thereby suggesting that these verses have one right interpretation (Heim,
            Waltke).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0309089213492817">22</xref></sup> Others
        recognize the overarching theme of the cluster but refuse to go too much into reconstructing
        logical relationships between the verses (Fox).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0309089213492817">23</xref></sup> My approach emphasizes the importance of the
        cluster (<italic>contra</italic> the first opinion), explicitly recognizes that there are
        more than one possible reading of it (<italic>contra</italic> the second opinion), and
        considers that pondering the possible connections between the verses is important
          (<italic>contra</italic> the third opinion).</p>
      <p>I will focus on the first three verses in ch. 16, and not only because of the pragmatic
        reason of limited space. Verses 1–3 can be perceived as an introduction to the cluster
        16.1–9 that defines the questions the whole cluster is addressing. This understanding is
        strengthened by 16.9 (the last verse before the king-sayings), which not only corresponds to
        16.1, but also contains allusions to all of the first three verses in ch. 16. This suggests
        that the compiler saw those three verses as one unit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0309089213492817">24</xref></sup> Consequently, it is defendable to enquire
        only about the meaning of this particular subsection of the whole cluster.</p>
      <p>I begin with some verse-by-verse comments. Although there will be an emphasis on the
        possible connections between the verses already in these investigations, readings of Prov.
        16.1–3 as a whole will be provided only after these initial observations.</p>

          <p>One possible understanding of the verse is that although human beings prepare
            themselves to reply to certain situations/questions, the actual words are provided by
                God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0309089213492817">25</xref></sup> In other

          <title>The L<sc>ord</sc> Provides the Right Words</title>
          <p>Another possible interpretation is that the ‘answer’ does not refer to
              <italic>any</italic> answer, including potentially inappropriate words, but to the
              <italic>right</italic> answer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0309089213492817">26</xref></sup> That is, the emphasis is not on divine determination of speech as
            such, but on the limitations of human efforts in guaranteeing success.</p>
          <p>The ambiguity of interpretation does not affect the verse's core meaning. Both versions
            express the contrast between human and divine agency, and both emphasize the decisive
            role of God. Nonetheless, the second version, which teaches that human preparation
            without divine inspiration cannot guarantee success, might have a slightly less
            deterministic flavour, as it leaves open the possibility that however powerless human
            planning is, it is still needed.</p>
          <p>It is hard to decide between these interpretations. If one takes Prov. 16.1 on its own,
            then the balance is towards the former interpretation, as the verse does not mention
            explicitly that it refers to ‘right’ words. However, taking the context into
            consideration, the balance shifts to the latter interpretation, as the parallel verse of
            16.9 seems to refer to the theme of success, and not much earlier, 15.23 also speaks
            about finding the right words for the right moment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0309089213492817">27</xref></sup></p>

          <title>The L<sc>ord</sc> Replies to Human Plans/Preparation</title>
          <p>A third possible interpretation also deserves our attention. Augustine understood 16.1b
            as referring not to human speech but to divine answer: ‘… man prepares his heart… But in
            the answer of the tongue—that is, in that which the divine tongue answers to the
            prepared heart—man has no part, but the whole is from the Lord God'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0309089213492817">28</xref></sup> Thus the meaning would be:
            humans prepare their hearts, but—and this is the really decisive action—God reacts
            (answers) to this preparation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0309089213492817">29</xref></sup></p>
          <p>Examining only the exegetical grounds of these three possible interpretations, the
            first two options might seem preferable to this third one:</p>
          <list id="list2-0309089213492817" list-type="bullet">
            <list-item>
              <p>‭הנעמ‬ is used twice in the previous chapter for human and not for divine answer
                (15.1, 23).</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>If ‘answer of the tongue’ is about human speech, then the verse not only contrasts
                human beings with God, but it also contains a nice contrast between inner
                preparation (heart) and outer expression (tongue). Such an elegant symmetry would
                also speak for the first two readings.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>The word ‭ןושל‬ (‘tongue’) in itself suggests human speech. Despite all of its
                anthropomorphism, the Bible rarely mentions the tongue of Yahweh, so it is a moot
                point why the author would have chosen this particular word to refer to Yahweh's
                utterance when it is customarily connected to human speech.</p>
            </list-item>
          </list>
          <p>However, although these exegetical objections are not entirely without weight, they are
            not decisive either. There is no reason why ‭הנעמ‬ could not have a different subject in
            16.1 than in 15.1 and 15.23. It is true that the ‘God answers to human preparation’
            interpretation loses the ‘inner preparation/outer expression’ contrast, but it makes the
            human/divine contrast even stronger. Finally, even if the tongue of the L<sc>ord</sc> is
            very rarely mentioned, it is spoken of at least once outside Prov. 16.1, namely in Isa.
                30.27.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0309089213492817">30</xref></sup></p>
          <p>Moreover, some of these objections can be disarmed if Augustine's understanding is
            slightly modified. If one takes ‘answer of tongue’ in v. 1b not as a subjective genitive
            but as an objective genitive, then it would not refer to an answer uttered by God's
            tongue but to God's answer to the human tongue. Thus 16.1 would mean: humans
            plan/prepare to speak, then they speak, and then God replies to their speech.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0309089213492817">31</xref></sup></p>
          <p>Consequently, although this third interpretation might seem a bit eccentric at first
            sight, it cannot be ruled out either. What is more, it also has a possible advantage: it
            fits the context of the following verse especially smoothly.</p>

        </disp-quote>
        <p>Just like the previous verse, 16.2 depicts the contrast between human limitations and
          divine power. Because of this continuity of thought the reader is tempted to construct a
          precise logical connection between the verses. Various such logical connections can be
          imagined.</p>
        <p>16.2 would be an especially coherent continuation of 16.1 if one understood v. 1b
          according to the (revised) Augustinian interpretation. A possible reading would then be:
          ‘Humans prepare their hearts and speak accordingly, but it is God's response to this human
          speech that matters (16.1), since it is God and not the humans themselves who can truly
          judge how successful their self-preparation was (16.2)'. But other readings with slightly
          different emphases are also possible. For example: ‘One can be certain of the correctness
          of God's response (mentioned in 16.1b) because God is able to judge humans better than
          they can judge themselves (16.2)'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0309089213492817">32</xref></sup></p>
        <p>If 16.1 is understood to be about God providing the (right) human response to
          questions/problems, then the logical connection with 16.2 might seem less obvious.
          Nevertheless, it is still possible to construct such connections. For example, if the
          reader takes into account the unspecified nature of the expression ‘preparation of heart’
          in 16.1a, then this allows the possibility that the self-preparation in v. 1 goes beyond
          simple planning, and includes some sort of self-assessment. If this is so, then the theme
          of this self-preparation aligns well with 16.2, which speaks about human self-evaluation.
          So the reader could, for example, understand these verses together as saying that ‘no
          matter how hard one prepares oneself, it is only God who can control human reactions
          (16.1), as humans cannot even judge themselves properly (16.2)'.</p>

          <p>In v. 3 the interpreter faces many decisions that lead to different understandings of
            the text. Let us begin at the middle of the verse because much depends on how one
            understands the word ‭זוכ‬. ‭זוכ‬ in <italic>niphal</italic> means ‘to be
                established'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0309089213492817">33</xref></sup>
            This expression can mean ‘to be realized’ or ‘to come true’, especially when it is
            applied to words like ‘plan’, ‘scheme’, and ‘desire'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0309089213492817">34</xref></sup> Another possibility is that it means ‘to
            be made long-lasting’, as explained by Clifford: ‘one may finish a task but must entrust
            it to Yahweh in order for it to endure'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0309089213492817">35</xref></sup> It is not necessary, however, to choose
            between these two understandings of ‘establish'. When the Bible promises a (would-be)
            king that his throne will be established, then it can mean both that his rulership will
            be realized, and also that it will be long-lasting (1 Sam. 20.31; 1 Kgs 2.45–46; 1
            Chron. 17.14, 24; Prov. 29.14; etc.). To include both of these possible connotations we
            could simply say that ‭ןוכ‬, in relation to plans, means ‘to succeed'. So according to
            this reading, the verse answers the question, ‘How can one be successful?’</p>

          <title>How to Be Ready?</title>
          <p>However, ‘to succeed’ is not the only possible meaning of ‭ןוכ‬
            <italic>niphal</italic>. In other places it often means ‘to be ready’ or ‘to be
            prepared’ for something. For example, Moses had to prepare the people of Israel for
            meeting God: ‘“Be prepared (‭םינכנ ויהו‬) for the third day because on the third day the
              L<sc>ord</sc> will come down”…and he said to the people, “Be prepared (‭םינכנ ויה‬)
            for the third day, do not approach a woman”’ (Exod. 19.11a, 15). God also commanded
            Moses himself to get prepared for meeting him: ‘be ready (‭ןוכנ היהו‬) by morning, and
            come up in the morning to Mount Sinai’ (Exod. 34.2a).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0309089213492817">36</xref></sup></p>
          <p>Since ‭ןוכ‬ in <italic>niphal</italic> also often means ‘to be steadfast’ or ‘to be
            loyal’, as describing one's relationship to God (Pss 51.12 [<sc>et</sc> 10]; 57.8 [7];
            78.37; 108.2 [1]; 112.7; 119.5), many ancient and medieval interpreters understood
            ‘readiness’ not only in the sense of physical readiness but also in the sense of
            spiritual readiness. The idea of this ready, prepared heart has been one of the key
            concepts of Jewish spiritual teaching, Fishbane explains:</p>
          <disp-quote>
            <p>Who would suppose that Moses's charge to the people to ‘be ready’ and ‘prepared'… for
              the divine advent on Sinai… was only a physical separation from ordinary acts, and did
              not also include a spiritual sanctification as well…? Similarly, Moses himself was
              told to ‘be ready’ and ‘prepared’ (<italic>nakhon</italic>) for the moment of his
              personal ascent up the mountain… This certainly does not refer to the physical
              preparations themselves, which precede this command, but is an exhortation to
              spiritual exercises and alertness to the moment to come, as the medieval masters
              rightly perceived.</p>
            <p>The cultivation of readiness begins in the heart, as the locus of inner balance … It
              longs for a healing beyond oneself; it longs for God to heal the fractured self and
              help guide it…</p>
            <p>To live in this way is to cultivate <italic>naḥhat ruaḥh</italic>, a settled and
              balanced comportment of one's spirit and breath. With respect to God… this involves a
              ‘quietude of spirit'… and with respect to humankind…this involves a ‘pleasantness of
                  being'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0309089213492817">37</xref></sup></p>
          </disp-quote>
          <p>Thus, once again, the interpreter is faced with a choice. Besides understanding 16.3 as
            speaking about the success of plans, grammatically and semantically it is also possible
            to understand it as about ‘one's thoughts being made ready/prepared'. Although this
            latter interpretation apparently has not occurred to modern interpreters, Matthew Henry
            (1662–1714) delineated this verse according to these lines:</p>
          <disp-quote>
            <p>It is a very desirable thing to have <italic>our thoughts established</italic>, and
              not tossed, and put into a hurry, by disquieting cares and fears,—to go on in an even
              steady course of honesty and piety, not disturbed, or put out of frame, by any event
              or change,—to be satisfied that all shall work for good and issue well at last, and
              therefore to be always easy and sedate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0309089213492817">38</xref></sup></p>
          </disp-quote>
          <p>Jerome also seems to understand the verse this way: ‘And so it is written, “Make my way
            right before Thy face”, so that what is right to Thee may seem also right to me. Solomon
            says the same—“Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be
                established”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0309089213492817">39</xref></sup></p>
          <p>Although I am not aware of any recent commentaries that have picked up this ‘spiritual
            readiness’ interpretation, and as such it can appear rather unconventional to
            contemporary scholars, in my view it is not easy to decide between this and the
            above-explained ‘success’ interpretation. It is true that in the few other cases when
            ‭הבשחמ‬ occurs together with ‭ןוכ‬ in <italic>niphal</italic> (Prov. 20.18; 1QH 12.13),
            ‘success’ seems to be the meaning. However, these few cases do not provide enough
            material to rule out with certainty that the verse promises spiritual readiness. This
            latter option is especially tempting because it would fit the context of the previous
            verses that speak about preparing the heart (16.1) and the difficulty of judging one's
            own cleanness (16.2).</p>

          <title>Telling Our Deeds/Plans to the L<sc>ord</sc></title>
          <p>Regardless of whether it is success or spiritual readiness that 16.3b promises, the
            same question might arise in the reader: What is the prerequisite of this desirable
            promise? The first word of the verse answers this question when it encourages the reader
            to ‭לג‬ his/her deeds to the L<sc>ord</sc>. However, once again, ‭לג‬ can mean two
            different things. It either means ‘entrust’ (literally ‘roll onto’) or ‘reveal'. The
              <sc>mt</sc> has ‭לג‬, meaning ‘roll onto'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0309089213492817">40</xref></sup> The Syriac, Targum, and Vulgate read
            ‭לג‬, meaning ‘reveal'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0309089213492817">41</xref></sup></p>
          <p>The majority of scholars consider ‘entrust’ the better reading,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0309089213492817">42</xref></sup> but the issue is more ambiguous than it
            might seem at first sight. Waltke, summarizing the arguments for ‘entrust’, argues that
            Ps. 37.5a has the unmistakable <italic>plene</italic> ‭לוג‬ (‘entrust’) in an almost
            identical half-verse; furthermore, ‭הלג‬, from which ‭לג‬ (‘reveal’) is derived, never
            occurs with ‭לא‬ in <italic>qal</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0309089213492817">43</xref></sup> However, neither of these arguments is
            decisive. In Ps. 37.5 we have the same ambiguity, since the <sc>lxx</sc>, Vulgate, and
            Syriac read ‭לג‬.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0309089213492817">44</xref></sup>
            Furthermore, ‭הלג‬ <italic>qal</italic> does occur with ‭לא‬ at least once (Amos 3.7),
            not to mention the many non-<italic>qal</italic> occurrences with ‭לא‬ (Gen. 35.7; 1
            Sam. 3.7; 14.8, 11; etc.).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0309089213492817">45</xref></sup></p>
          <p>If the interpreter opts for ‘reveal’, then 16.3a can refer to telling God one's plans
            or confessing one's deeds to God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0309089213492817">46</xref></sup> This understanding of v. 3a could create an interesting resonance
            with the previous verses. 16.1 and 16.3 could be connected by paraphrasing them as
            ‘Instead of trying to prepare yourself for successful speech (16.1), you should speak
            openly to God and then he will provide you success (16.3)'. Or, pressing the theme of
            spiritual preparation instead of success: ‘Instead of trying to prepare yourself for
            speech (16.1)—which is impossible as you cannot even know whether you are spiritually
            clean or not (16.2)—you should confess everything to God honestly and then he will
            prepare your thoughts (16.3)'.</p>

          <p>However, let us turn back to the majority view: what exactly would ‘entrust your deeds
            to the L<sc>ord</sc>’ mean? Waltke helpfully explains it as describing a peaceful,
            contented mentality that is the opposite of anxious attempts to control
                everything.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0309089213492817">47</xref></sup> We
            should probably also add that ‘entrusting deeds to the L<sc>ord</sc>’ does not describe
            a fatalistic passivity that teaches that ‘everything is in God's hands, so it is better
            to give up all plans and actions and just accept bluntly whatever comes'. A look at
            those verses that are often compared to Prov. 16.3 (i.e. Pss. 22.9; 37.5; 55.23; 90.17;
            Prov. 3.5–6; Sir. 7.17 [Hebrew text of MS A]; 1 Pet. 5.7)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0309089213492817">48</xref></sup> reveals that the intended effect of this
            terminology is that the reader should continue his ethical/law-obeying behaviour and
            trust that God will provide success at the end—even if such ethical behaviour seems
            ineffective, and unethical means seem to have higher potential to achieve the desired
            results. This understanding is supported by the fact that the contexts of almost all of
            the parallel texts imply a contrast between the evil person and the humble/ethical
                person.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0309089213492817">49</xref></sup> They
            encourage the reader not to be proud, not to envy the evil, and not to be angry because
            of the success of the evil, but instead to wait for the L<sc>ord</sc>'s rescue. Thus,
            the idea of ‘entrusting to the L<sc>ord</sc>’ is not as much an encouragement for
            passivity as it is an encouragement for a certain type of activity: act ethically, and
            wait and see that the L<sc>ord</sc> will respond to such actions by providing success.
            As Fox writes, ‘<italic>Entrust</italic>…does not mean merely planning and then hoping
            for the best. It means to make one's plans congruent with God's will.'<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0309089213492817">50</xref></sup></p>
          <p>To summarize my observations of 16.3, the analysis of the two verbs in it has led to
            four possible readings. Besides the most common ‘Entrust [i.e. be ethical, do not be
            anxious] your deeds to the L<sc>ord</sc> and your plans will be successful', it is
            possible to understand the verse as referring to spiritual preparation: ‘Entrust your
            deeds to the L<sc>ord</sc> and your thoughts will be prepared'. In both cases it is
            possible that the prerequisite of success/spiritual readiness is not entrusting the
            deeds to God, but openly revealing the (planned or committed) deeds to him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0309089213492817">51</xref></sup></p>

      <title>3. Variations on One Text</title>
      <p>It is time to take one step back from these remarks on the individual verses and to
        consider how these variant readings affect a coherent interpretation of the whole section of
        Prov. 16.1–3. The following table summarizes the alternative translations of the text
        mentioned so far:</p>

      </fig>
      <p>If a reader wishes to read the verses together, then it is almost inevitable that some
        additional themes besides the broad topic of divine power and human limitations will emerge.
        Whether that is the topic of ‘success’ or ‘spiritual cleanness’ or something else depends on
        how one understands the individual verses and connects them to each other. I offer here
        three possible readings. Each time I provide a paraphrase which is hopefully
        self-explanatory enough, and a translation that could support the given paraphrase.</p>

      <p>It could be argued that these paraphrases go well beyond what the text actually says. They
        presuppose logical relationships between the verses that are not mentioned explicitly by the
        text, and they equate expressions of the text that do not necessarily speak about the same
        subject. However, I argued above that this kind of ‘gap-filling’ matches the writing-method
        of the authors and it is also encouraged by the many obvious gaps in the text. Consequently,
        I would contend that all three of these interpretations (and many others) can be taken as
        feasible explanations of the text.</p>
      <p>The fact that the gaps in a text can be filled in many ways does not mean that the
        interpretation is without control. There are important ‘checks’ on a reading. First, even
        though I presented different readings with different emphases, I still tried to produce
        readings that are allowed by the grammar of the text and that remain within the semantic
        range of its words. Furthermore, I also tried to produce interpretations that do not
        contradict the thought-world of the ‘framework’ of Proverbs (chs. 1–9 and 30–31) and that
        fit smoothly the harmonious net of propositions in Proverbs 10–29.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0309089213492817">52</xref></sup></p>
      <p>It not only follows from this latter ‘contextual check’ that some readings might be ruled
        out by it. Another consequence is that most of the possible readings do not contradict each
        other, since all of them fit the same context harmoniously. In other words, they are
        complementary and not contradictory. To highlight this phenomenon we can take the example of
        the two readings that concentrate on success and on spiritual readiness. Proverbs as a book
        often writes about God's retribution and suggests that he provides success to those who walk
        his way, that is, to those who are attuned to him and his way of action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0309089213492817">53</xref></sup> Consequently, according to
        Proverbs, the way to success is a God-fearing, ethical, clean life. Although the
        above-constructed <italic>Reading 1</italic> (spiritual readiness) and <italic>Reading
          3</italic> (success) seem to be quite different, both of them grasp a part of the broader
        context of Proverbs and consequently they can be understood as complementing each other.</p>

    <sec id="sec14-0309089213492817" sec-type="conclusions">
      <title>4. Conclusion</title>
      <p>I have argued that the diverse links between the verses of sayings-clusters in Proverbs
        10–29 encourage the reader to construe unified teachings for the clusters. In other words,
        the reader is invited to interpret individual verses in their literary context. I
        tentatively suggested that this reading method might be in accordance with the writing
        method of the authors/editors: the sequence of proverbs probably mirrors the associative
        processes of the author/editor, as their choice of a proverb was likely influenced by their
        pondering on the previous proverbs in the same cluster. Similarly, the reader is invited
        into an associative reading.</p>
      <p>However, I have also argued that it is not the task of the reader to ‘reconstruct’ what
        went on in the mind of the author/editor when they were compiling a cluster. The weak nature
        of the links between the verses suggests that there is no secret message hidden in their
        sequence. The task of the reader is not discovering an encoded message, but exploiting the
        surplus of meaning inherent in the ambiguous connections between the verses and the logical
        gaps between them. Such a reading can result in a richer reading experience than just
        concentrating on the individual verses in isolation.</p>
      <p>I have tried to show the above on the example of Prov. 16.1–3. I have argued that if these
        verses are read together, certain themes can emerge in a more multifaceted way than if the
        individual verses were read only on their own. However, I have also insisted that more than
        one reading is possible: in my three examples the section is either on spiritual
        preparation, on the importance of confessing to the Lord in order to be (spiritually)
        prepared for right speech, or on success. Nevertheless, the diversity of possible readings
        does not mean that they are arbitrary. Good readings pay close attention to the text and
        they are in harmony with the framework of the book and with the network of the sayings in
        Proverbs 10–29.</p>
      <p>Thus, in the particular case of Proverbs 10–29, the biblical text invites even the academic
        reader to a pondering, careful, but at the same time explicitly playful, reading. Scholars
        should not shy away from using their imagination, and should exploit the ambiguities of the
        text in order to offer creative constructions of the meaning of sayings-clusters in
        Proverbs.</p>

        <p>The word ‘cluster’ is ill-defined, and as such it requires some clarification. Michael V.
          Fox, speaking about ‘thematic clusters’, defines them as ‘groups of at least two sayings
          that speak on the same topic or share catchwords’ (Fox, <italic>Proverbs 10–31</italic>,
          p. 478). The main interest of my investigation is more general than what this ‘narrow’
          definition would allow: if one finds a group of at least two sayings, the vast majority of
          which are connected to each other either thematically or by literary devices, how should
          this influence the reader's interpretation of the text?</p>
        <p>Thus, my definition of ‘cluster’ is broader than Fox's in two significant ways: first, I
          consider not only thematic but also literary connections (alliteration between key
          expressions in neighbouring verses, linkage by an ordered sequence of initial letters,
          etc.); second, I accept a group of sayings as a cluster even if not all but only a clear
          majority of the verses are connected. (See the similar usage of the word in Heim,
            <italic>Like Grapes</italic>.)</p>

        <p>The word ‘gap’ can bring to mind the theory of the literary critic Wolfgang Iser (for a
          brief introduction to Iser's theory of textual gaps, see Zoltán Schwáb, ‘Mind the Gap: The
          Impact of Wolfgang Iser's Reader-Response Criticism on Biblical Studies—A Critical
          Assessment',’, <italic>Literature &amp; Theology</italic> 17 [2003], pp. 170–81). Iser
          argued that all texts contain gaps that are filled by the reader more or less unawares. My
          argument is that gaps are more obvious in the case of sentence literature than in many
          other texts and that these ‘explicit gaps’ encourage the reader to work more consciously
          on gap-filling.</p>

        <p>Augustine, of course, was probably not working from the Hebrew text. Nevertheless, his

        <p>These possible connections between the verses are further strengthened if ‘spirit’ in
          16.2b refers to the same human faculty to which the ‘heart’ in 16.1a referred—a plausible
          suggestion in the light of 21.2, which is almost identical with 16.2 but uses ‘hearts’
          instead of ‘spirits'. For the similarity of 16.2 and 21.2, see Richard J. Clifford,

        <p>The reading which understands the beginning of 16.3 as confessing one's deeds to the
            L<sc>ord</sc> does not fit easily the thought-world of Prov. 1–29 as we hardly read
          about prayer in it. Nonetheless, even if it stands on its own in these parts of Proverbs,
          it is not contradicted by them; and we do read about prayer in Agur's speech in 30.1–9.
          That speech is undoubtedly a later addition to the book; nevertheless, if one reads Prov.
          16.3 in its canonical context, then Prov. 30.7–9 is a neat parallel for it with many
          conceptual similarities. Though the interpretation of Agur's speech is highly debated, it
          can be read as an expression of the attitude recommended in Prov. 16.3: confessing one's
          deeds/ thoughts to God, leaving everything onto him, and waiting for him to establish
          one's steps.</p>
