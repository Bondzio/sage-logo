Editorial
Introduction

Eastern University's graduate International Development
Programs
It
is a great privilege and blessing to have been asked to guest edit this number
of Transformation, in particular because both the Oxford Centre for Mission
Studies and Eastern University's MBA in Economic Development program are celebrat-
ing their 25th anniversaries this year. It was, in fact, the occasion of this
joint anniversary that sparked the articles in this issue. We asked faculty
and researchers affiliated with Eastern University's program to identify and
analyze current and emerging issues and actors in evan- gelical development
efforts that they thought would be important for the future. These authors
were selected based on their extensive experience and/or primary research
in transformational development. The result, we hope, is a set of articles,
in some cases co-written with graduate students of the program, that will
spur discussion, reflection, prayer and action by evangelical development
academics and practitioners combined. Lindy Backues's article, based on almost
two decades of work in Indonesia, kicks off this issue by posing a challenge
to the nature and structure of evangelical development organizations and to
those who are deeply suspicious of interfaith dialogue. His argument that
a `Christian' organizational structure itself can inhibit effective transformational
development, and his suggestion and example of an alternative, requires careful
consideration. The articles by Bronkema and Brown, Davis, and Ostwald, continue
in this vein of casting challenges. They urge Business as Mission and evangelical
development practitioners to take seri- ously the political aspects of development,
advocacy, and social change, and to take another, and deeper look at understandings
of poverty. These three articles also offer insights and guidelines into what
this kind of reflection and rethinking might mean in actual practice. The
first four articles also point to the importance of the `reawakening' of the
evangelical movement to its social responsibilities, a theme that frames the
next two articles by Hoiland and Gramby-Sobukwe, and LeQuire and Van Gilder,
respectively. Each of these articles identifies a new set of evangelical actors
in development (mega-churches and ecotourism non-governmental organizations
[NGOs]), and the promises and challenges that await them even as they enrich
the conceptualization and practice of transformational development as a whole.
Finally, the last article of the issue, by Tom Ridington and Chris Kapp, focuses
on
66
a topic
that in some ways underpins all the others: insights into the importance of
education and training in managing development programs. Ridington and Kapp
use an evaluation of Eastern's MBA program as the basis from which to make
recommendations in this area. These articles in many ways pay tribute and
homage to Transformation's his- tory of tackling the thorny, yet exciting
questions of holistic and transformational development. These include human
rights (1984, 1[3]); power (1986, 3[4]); 1989, 6[4]); Christian faith and
economics (1987, 4[3]; 1990, 7[2]; 2000, 17[2,4]; 2001, 18[3]); charismatic/social
activist dialogue (1988, 5[4]); social concerns and evan- gelism (1990, 7[1]); work, employment, and economics (1992, 9[1]), `wholistic' mission (1993, 10[3]); poverty, justice, and the kingdom (1993, 19[11]); Christian relief and development
agencies (1996, 13[4]); evidence-based strategies in devel- opment (2002,
19[2]); approaches to reducing poverty (2003, 20[2]); mission and transformational
development (2005, 22[2]); and research priorities in develop- ment (2006,
23[3]). We look forward to feedback from and mutual learning with the readers
on these and other issues, and invite you to continue this conversation at
a major conference on Transformational Development that Eastern University
will be co- hosting with Food for the Hungry at St Davids, Pennsylvania, USA,
August 7-9 2009.</meta-value>
