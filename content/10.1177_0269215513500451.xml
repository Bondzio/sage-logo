<p>Stroke is a vascular disease and patients often have or are at risk of cardiovascular disorders. Cardiac rehabilitation programmes reduce vascular risk and might be appropriate for patients who have relatively minor strokes or transient ischaemic attacks. But do patients appreciate cardiac rehabilitation? A <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra1-0269215513500451" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215513478956"><italic>study</italic></related-article> within a randomised evaluative study suggests that patients are in favour. Returning home more quickly after hip arthroplasty is sometimes justified as being better for patients. They might not agree, but a comparative <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra2-0269215513500451" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215513481686"><italic>study</italic></related-article> here suggests that rates of satisfaction are not lower in units where patients stay three rather than six days. This study on patient evaluation of care and recovery also reports on a measure, and two other measures feature in this issue. <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra3-0269215513500451" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215513481227"><italic>One</italic></related-article> concerns clumsy children, where the properties of the ‘DCDDaily’ (Developmental Coordination Disorder; possibly a posh name for marked clumsiness) is evaluated. The <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra4-0269215513500451" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215513479388"><italic>other</italic></related-article> tackles a very difficult subject, measuring a person’s social networks. The measure – the Stroke Social Network Scale – could easily be used in any disorder because social networks are not unique to people with stroke! Hip arthroplasty is the subject of another interesting <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra5-0269215513500451" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215513478437"><italic>study</italic></related-article> that contrasted standard physiotherapy, which most people receive, with therapy tailored to the patients needs. It demonstrated quite significant benefits, as perhaps we should expect, but which is rarely investigated let alone shown to be the case. However group therapy is also advocated for several reasons (e.g cost, social support, peer advice) and an equally large <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra6-0269215513500451" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215513481047"><italic>study</italic></related-article> (n = 99) in people with multiple sclerosis showed significant benefits in comparison with no treatment. Another large (n = 60) <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra7-0269215513500451" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215513478228"><italic>study</italic></related-article> has investigated a space-age technology as treatment for people after stroke. Wearing a supportive elastic suit (the Regent Suit) seems to benefit recovery of mobility and other activities. Presumably increased sensory stimulation might be one mechanism. This theory underlies studies of using Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) after stroke, and this journal has published several studies. This issue has another early phase <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra8-0269215513500451" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215513478227"><italic>study</italic></related-article> suggesting benefit in people late after stroke. Finally vibration therapy – another sensory stimulation – is <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra9-0269215513500451" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215513480956"><italic>studied</italic></related-article> as an adjunction to the use of botulinum toxin in treating spasticity, and it seems that using both leads to additional benefit.</p>
