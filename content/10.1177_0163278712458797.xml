<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptual market orientation gaps between physician and patients and its impact on relationship quality and patient loyalty, and to verify the critical role of internal marketing on developing market orientation. Self-administered questionnaires were then employed to collect the data. We used a convenience sample of physicians and patients at a medical center in central Taiwan, and 90 usable questionnaires from physicians and 450 usable questionnaires from patients were returned. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to validate the research hypotheses. Physicians’ perceptual market orientation had a positive influence on physician–patient relationship quality, hospital–patient relationship quality, and patient loyalty, but the perceptual market orientation gap between physicians and their patients had a direct negative impact on these constructs. Finally, internal marketing was found to have an influence on relationship quality and patient loyalty through the mediation of market orientation. In order to enhance relationship quality and patient loyalty, hospital managers should focus their efforts on improving employees’ market orientation and reducing patients’ perceptual market orientation gap. In addition, internal marketing was found to be a useful pathway in developing market orientation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Market orientation is the organizational climate, which consists of three components: customer orientation, competitor orientation, and interfunctional coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0163278712458797">Narver &amp; Slater, 1990</xref>). With an increase in market orientation, hospitals could provide patients with necessary and timely health care. In addition, market orientation has positive effects on hospital profitability, product development, sales growth, customer retention, and cost control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0163278712458797">Lonial &amp; Raju, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0163278712458797">Raju, Lonial, Gupta, &amp; Ziegler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0163278712458797">Wrenn, 2002</xref>). For health care professionals, market orientation can be a useful tool for improving patient satisfaction and patient trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0163278712458797">Weng, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0163278712458797">Huang, Hu, Lai, and Weng (2011)</xref> found that market orientation can indeed improve the relationship quality between health care providers and patients, health care quality, and patient loyalty in hospital environments. With the improvement of relationship quality and patient loyalty, patients' adherence behavior and patients' intention to revisit would be enhanced, and thus, the continuum of health care would be ensured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0163278712458797">Kaufman &amp; Birks, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0163278712458797">Weng, Huang, Huang, &amp; Huang, 2010</xref>). Finally, this will be beneficial for promoting patients’ health.</p>
<p>If organizations want to develop market orientation, it is hard to judge whether the degree of an organization’s market orientation is adequate. Whether the degree of market orientation is adequate is decided by the customers rather than the organization or its managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0163278712458797">Webb, Webster, &amp; Krepapa, 2000</xref>). Under these circumstances, there probably exists a perceptual market orientation gap between organizations and customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0163278712458797">Steinman, Deshpande, &amp; Farley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0163278712458797">Webb et al., 2000</xref>), and this gap will influence the satisfaction and perception of service quality for customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163278712458797">Krepapa, Berthon, Webb, &amp; Pitt, 2003</xref>). Therefore, we have tried to explore whether there is a perceptual market orientation gap and to assess the effects of this gap on organizations.</p>
<p>For health care organizations, a good relationship with their patients and enhancing patient loyalty are critical to build enduring competitive advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0163278712458797">Rowe &amp; Calnan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0163278712458797">Steiger &amp; Balog, 2010</xref>). As a result, this study has investigated relationship quality with patients and patient loyalty as the main constructs to determine the effects of the market orientation gap on organizations. However, if a perceptual market orientation gap does exist in organizations, how should organizations react to fill this gap to enhance their market orientation? Using internal marketing, senior managers can strengthen the support from employees for market orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163278712458797">Conduit &amp; Mavondo, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, they can enhance the employees’ belief in, understanding of, and commitment to market orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0163278712458797">Harris, 1999</xref>). Therefore, this study also tried to explore the roles played by internal marketing in enhancing market orientation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0163278712458797">
<title>Literature Review and Hypotheses</title>
<p>Market orientation consists of three dimensions: customer orientation, competitor orientation, and interfunctional coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0163278712458797">Narver &amp; Slater, 1990</xref>). Customer orientation and competitor orientation require organizations to attract customers from their target market, collect information on their competitors, and diffuse this information inside the organization. Interfunctional coordination coordinates the efforts of different departments to produce excellent value for customers based on the information on customers and competitors. Relationship quality refers to “an overall assessment of the strength of a relationship and the extent to which it meets the needs and expectations of the parties based on a history of successful or unsuccessful encounters or events” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0163278712458797">Crosby, Evans, &amp; Cowles, 1990</xref>). A good relationship quality implies high patient satisfaction with and trust in a hospital or its medical staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0163278712458797">Weng, Huang, &amp; Huang, 2006</xref>). In addition, physicians and nurses as internal customers have to be satisfied with their job first before they can satisfy the patients of the hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0163278712458797">Iliopoulos &amp; Priporas, 2011</xref>). Internal marketing could provide a set of friendly hospital staff management activities, including employees' understanding of the hospital's vision, human resource development and the reward system, and hospital culture that enhances service quality for patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0163278712458797">Tsai &amp; Wu, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0163278712458797">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>The perception of market orientation of sponsors toward the people or organizations that are sponsored would be influenced by the degree of market orientation claimed by the sponsors themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0163278712458797">Farrelly &amp; Quester, 2003</xref>). Medical services usually require a high degree of interaction between health professionals and patients, and the delivery of these services takes place at the interface between them. Therefore, the perceptual market orientation of patients is mainly influenced by the perceptual market orientation of the medical staff with whom they interact.</p>
<p>Market orientation, through the creation of excellent customer value, could increase the level of customer satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163278712458797">Brady &amp; Cronin, 2001</xref>). In addition, trust consists of reliability and kindness. Health service providers with market orientation collect and utilize the necessary market knowledge to enhance their reliability and ensure that the patients are satisfied with the level of kindness shown to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0163278712458797">Mechanic &amp; Meyer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0163278712458797">Rowe &amp; Calnan, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the promotion of the degree of market orientation also could increase customer loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0163278712458797">Maydeu-Olivares &amp; Lado, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>There has been a perceptual market orientation gap between service providers and their customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0163278712458797">Steinman et al., 2000</xref>). The perceptual market orientation gap has negative effects on customer satisfaction and the perception of service quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163278712458797">Krepapa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0163278712458797">Webb et al., 2000</xref>). In nursing cares, a perceptual gap between nurses and patients also would limit nursing quality improvement and have negative impact on patient satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0163278712458797">Young, Minnick, &amp; Marcantonio, 1996</xref>). A decrease in customer satisfaction and service quality is obviously detrimental to the goal of strengthening customer loyalty. Similarly, this perceptual market orientation gap also has a negative influence on the relationship between health service providers and patients.</p>
<p>An organizational climate should be established in which employees are encouraged and rewarded for their behavior toward market orientation to enhance the level of market orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0163278712458797">Pulendran, Speed, &amp; Widing, 2000</xref>). Senior managers could make use of internal marketing to solidify the support for market orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163278712458797">Conduit &amp; Mavondo, 2001</xref>) and to enhance the staff’s belief in, understanding of, and commitment to market orientation. The belief, understanding, and commitment of the hospital staff is highly related to the development of market orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0163278712458797">Lings &amp; Greenley, 2010</xref>), and the degree of internal marketing in a hospital is determined by the frontline medical staff (e.g., physicians).</p>
<p>Satisfied employees not only offer good core services but also bring relationship benefits to the customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163278712458797">Heskett, Jones, Loveman, Sasser, &amp; Schlesinger, 1994</xref>). Good core service and relationship benefits generate the satisfaction and commitment of customers. Their commitment can enhance the degree of customer loyalty. Internal marketing is the managerial practice of satisfying health professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0163278712458797">Peltier, Pointer, &amp; Schibrowsky, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, to win patient loyalty, hospitals should make efforts to satisfy patients with the value of health services that are directly affected by the quality of internal services provided by the staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0163278712458797">Iliopoulos &amp; Priporas, 2011</xref>). However, without the willingness of all employees to provide a good service to internal customers, a hospital will not be capable of offering an excellent health service to patients. Good internal service quality can enhance the satisfaction of health professionals and eventually raise the value of patient care, thereby winning patients’ satisfaction and loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0163278712458797">Peltier et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, because physicians' perceptual internal marketing may have a positive effect on their perceptual market orientation, market orientation may, in turn, have positive effects on the relationship quality between health care providers and patients and on patient loyalty.</p>
<p>We stated five hypotheses. First, physicians' perceptual market orientation can have positive effects on the relationship quality between health care providers and patients and on patient loyalty. Second, the perceptual market orientation gap between patients and physicians can have a negative effect on relationship quality between health care providers and patients and on patient loyalty. Third, physicians' perceptual internal marketing can positively affect their perceptual market orientation. Fourth, physicians' perceptual internal marketing can have a positive effect on relationship quality between health care providers and patients and on patient loyalty. Finally, physicians' perceptual internal marketing can have a mediating effect on the relationship quality between health care providers and patients and on patient loyalty through their perceptual market orientation. The conceptual framework of this study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0163278712458797">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Study Sample and Data Collection</title>
<p>This study was conducted at a medical center in central Taiwan using convenience sampling and self-reporting questionnaires from January to April 2007. The questionnaire surveys were administered to frontline physicians and their patients to gain insights into the research constructs. The service processes of dental medicine and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are different from that of general medicine. Therefore, this study excluded the dental and TCM departments. Furthermore, patients from psychiatric and pediatric departments were excluded from the study because of the problematic issue of the reliability of questionnaires obtained from patients with a mental disorder and from the parents of pediatric patients, who are not capable of completing the questionnaire themselves.</p>
<p>The study was approved by the appropriate ethics committees of this hospital (IRB No.: TCVGH C06263). There are 141 attending physicians in the medical center. Therefore, this study administered 141 questionnaires to attending physicians in 22 clinical departments, and 99 of them were returned. Because the study design involved analysis using paired sampling from patients and their attending physicians, questionnaires were also distributed to the patients of the 99 attending physicians who completed the physician questionnaire. In total, 1,000 questionnaires were sent out, and 588 of them were returned. In total, the study sample comprised 90 attending physicians paired with 450 patients. </p>

<sec id="section6-0163278712458797">
<title>Measurement</title>
<p>The measurement method in this study was the 5-point Likert-type scale, where 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> and 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. This study defined “market orientation” as the sum of consumer orientation, competitor orientation, and crossfunctional coordination. At the same time, the levels of perceptual market orientation of physicians and their patients toward hospitals were measured. The perceptual market orientation gap was calculated by subtracting the physician’s perceptual market orientation from the patients’ perceptual market orientation. This study adopted the measurement chart of market orientation proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0163278712458797">Webb et al. (2000)</xref>. The measurement items referenced the characteristics of medical services and a total of 10 items including five customer orientation items (e.g., the hospital is well aware of patients’ needs), two competitor orientation items (e.g., the hospital responds rapidly to the implementation of new medical services and actions of other hospitals), and three interfunctional coordination items (e.g., departments of the hospital could effectively coordinate to satisfy patients’ needs).</p>
<p>The relationship quality comprised two constructs: relationship quality between patient and physician and relationship quality between patient and hospital. Based on studies conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0163278712458797">Crosby et al. (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0163278712458797">Dwyer, Schurr, and Oh (1987)</xref>, this study defined relationship quality as the composite construct of patient satisfaction and trust in physicians and hospitals, respectively. The measurement of relationship quality was carried out on the level of patient satisfaction and trust. Based on a concept described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163278712458797">Donabedian (1980)</xref>, the degree of patient satisfaction with physicians and hospitals was measured from the aspects of structure and process (e.g., In general, I am satisfied with the medical care provided by this hospital or this physician). Four items were created for each construct. In addition, this study incorporated concepts outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163278712458797">Garbarino and Johnson (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0163278712458797">Mechanic and Meyer (2000)</xref> by considering characteristics of medical services in the measurement of the levels of patient trust in physicians and hospitals (e.g., I trust the quality of medical care provided by this hospital or this physician). In total, 8 items were used to measure the relationship quality between patient and physician and the relationship quality between patient and hospital. All instruments will be made available on request.</p>
<p>Patient loyalty also comprised two constructs: loyalty to physicians and loyalty to hospitals. The present study was informed by concepts described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0163278712458797">Weng et al. (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0163278712458797">Jennings and Loan (1999)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0163278712458797">Dick and Basu (1994)</xref>. Finally, 2 items were created to measure the loyalty of patients to physicians, and 3 items were created to measure patient loyalty to hospitals (e.g., If I get the same disease again, I will still choose this hospital or the same physician). With regard to internal marketing, the definition proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0163278712458797">Foreman and Money (1995)</xref> was adopted. For the measurement of perceptual internal marketing by attending physicians, this study adopted the original scale used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0163278712458797">Foreman and Money (1995)</xref>, which consists of 8 items of human resource development, 4 items of reward, and 3 items of vision (e.g., The hospital communicates the importance of health roles to health professionals). Finally, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was carried out to test the reliability and construct validity of all constructs.</p>

<sec id="section7-0163278712458797">
<title>Analysis Methods</title>
<p>This study adopted descriptive statistics to analyze the characteristics of the sample. In addition, validity analysis in the measuring scale was performed using LISREL 8.72. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was then applied to test the proposed hypotheses in this study. A number of relative variables that may have affected the utilization of medical services, trust, and the degree of satisfaction were adjusted for in the analyses, including patient gender, age, marital status, education level, employment status, distance to hospital, chronic disease condition, subjective health status, and monthly household income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0163278712458797">Anderson &amp; Aday, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0163278712458797">Huang, Tsai, Chen, Hu, &amp; Yang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0163278712458797">Mechanic &amp; Meyer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0163278712458797">Weng et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis of Reliability and Validity</title>
<p>The partial disaggregation method was used to integrate several measurement indicators in the same construct according to the factor loading as composite indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163278712458797">Bagozzi &amp; Foxall, 1996</xref>). The CFA results of market orientation showed that χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 2.74, Normed Fit Index (NFI) = .92, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = .95, Goodness-of-Fit statistic (GFI) = .91, and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = .14. Regarding composite reliability (CR), consumer orientation, competitor orientation, and crossfunctional coordination were .83, .78, and .79, respectively. With regard to the average variance extracted (AVE), the three dimensions were .63, .65, and .65, respectively. In addition, the AVEs of all the three dimensions exceeded .5, and the factor loading of the measurement items showed a strong significant correlation. Moreover, the AVE of all the three dimensions exceeded their square of the correlation coefficient. With regard to the internal marketing, the CFA yielded the following results: χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 2.43, NFI = .95, CFI = .97, GFI = .87, and RMSEA = .12. Regarding CR, the value of human resources development, reward, and vision were .92, .90, and .87, respectively, and their AVEs were .73, .81, and .70, respectively. The AVEs of the three constructs were all above .5, and the factor loadings of all measurement items were also significant. Furthermore, the AVEs of three of the dimensions exceeded the square of the correlation coefficient.</p>
<p>In the overall measurement model, the CFA showed the following results: χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 4.02, NFI = .98, CFI = .98, GFI = .94, and RMSEA = .08. Regarding the results of CR, perceptual market orientation, physician–patient relationship quality, hospital–patient relationship quality, loyalty of patients to physicians, and loyalty of patients to hospitals were .81, .86, .87, 094, and .90, respectively. Their AVEs were .60, .76, .85, .86, and .85, respectively. The AVEs of the five constructs exceeded .5, and the factor loadings of the measurement items reached significant levels. Furthermore, the AVEs of the five constructs were greater than the square of the correlation coefficient among the constructs. Therefore, all measurement models had good reliability and construct validity.  </p>

<title>Results of Regression Analysis</title>
<p>The total of the variance inflation factors of the independent variables in all regression models was less than 10. The result of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test indicated that the normal distribution of residuals of all models was acceptable. Of the models concerning the physician–patient relationship quality, the Model 2 indicated that the physicians’ perceptual market orientation had a significantly positive influence on the physician–patient relationship quality (β = .297). In Model 3, by adding the perceptual market orientation gap, the physicians’ perceptual market orientation had a significantly positive influence on the physician–patient relationship quality (β = .671), but the perceptual market orientation gap had a strong, negative influence on it (β = −.554). Of the models concerning the hospital–patient relationship quality, Model 2 indicated that the physicians’ perceptual market orientation had a significantly positive influence on the hospital–patient relationship quality (β = .308). In Model 3, by adding the perceptual market orientation gap, the physicians’ perceptual market orientation had a significantly positive influence on the hospital–patient relationship quality (β = .771). However, the perceptual market orientation gap had a significantly negative influence on it (β = −.685; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0163278712458797">Table 3</xref>).</p>

Of the models concerning the patients’ loyalty to the hospitals, Model 2 indicated that the physicians’ perceptual market orientation had a significantly positive influence on the patients’ loyalty to the hospital (β = .349). In Model 3, the physicians’ perceptual market orientation also had a significant positive influence on the patients’ loyalty to the hospitals (β = .734). However, the perceptual market orientation gap had a negative influence on it (β = −.570; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0163278712458797">Table 3</xref>).

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0163278712458797">Table 4</xref> shows that the physicians’ perceptual internal marketing had a significant positive influence on their perceptual market orientation (β = .563). The results of the Model 2-2 showed that the physicians’ perceptual internal marketing had a positive influence on the physician–patient relationship quality (β = .207). Model 2-3 showed that the physicians’ perceptual market orientation also had a significantly positive influence on the physician–patient relationship quality (β = .297). However, Model 2-4 showed that, after adding the physicians’ perceptual market orientation, the coefficient of physicians’ perceptual internal marketing did not reach a significant level. Nevertheless, the physicians’ perceptual market orientation had a significantly positive influence on the physician–patient relationship quality (β = .265). In Model 3-2, the results showed that the physicians’ perceptual internal marketing had a significant positive influence on the hospital–patient relationship quality (β = .240). Model 3-3 showed that the physicians’ perceptual market orientation had a significant influence on the hospital–patient relationship quality (β = .308). However, Model 3-4 indicated that, after adding the physicians’ perceptual market orientation, the coefficient of perceptual internal marketing did not reach a significant level.

<p>Model 4-2 showed that the physicians’ perceptual internal marketing had a significant positive influence on the loyalty of patients to physicians (β = .208). Model 4-3 showed that the physicians’ perceptual market orientation also had a significant positive influence on the loyalty of patients to physicians (β = .319). However, Model 4-4 showed that, after adding the physicians’ perceptual market orientation, the coefficient of perceptual internal marketing of physicians was nonsignificant. Nevertheless, the physicians’ perceptual market orientation had a significant positive influence on the loyalty of patients to physicians (β = .296). In terms of the loyalty of patients to hospitals, Model 5-2 revealed that the physicians’ perceptual internal marketing had a significant positive influence on the loyalty of patients to hospitals (β = .226). Model 5-3 showed that the physicians’ perceptual market orientation also had a significant positive influence on the loyalty of patients to hospitals (β = .349). However, Model 5-4 showed that the coefficient of perceptual internal marketing of physicians did not achieve a significant level, but the physicians’ perceptual market orientation did have a significant positive influence on the loyalty of patients to hospitals (β = .325; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0163278712458797">Table 4</xref>). In sum, we found that internal marketing has a positive effect on market orientation. In addition, we found that the market orientation would fully mediate the relationship between internal marketing and relationship quality and the relationship between internal marketing and patient loyalty. Therefore, the third and fifth hypotheses were supported, but the fourth hypothesis was not supported.</p>

Health services usually require a high level of interaction between physicians and patients (customers), and the delivery of services is often made through an interface between physicians and patients. Consequently, in the process of providing health services, the level of customer satisfaction, trust, and loyalty are mainly affected by the perceptual market orientation of the frontline medical staff. This study also found that the physicians’ perceptual market orientation has a significant positive influence on relationship quality (between physicians and patients and between hospitals and patients) and patient loyalty. These findings are similar with the arguments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0163278712458797">Raju, Lonial, Gupta, and Ziegler (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163278712458797">Hallums (1994)</xref>.</p>
<p>In a dyadic relationship, evaluating the effects produced by actual and perceptual behaviors of both parties is of great significance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0163278712458797">Deshpande, Farley, and Webster (1993)</xref> indicated that an organization can only be said to have achieved market orientation when its market orientation is perceived by customers. In the professional services area (e.g., health care), the perception gaps of service characteristics between service providers and customers often leads to many problems with service quality and customer satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0163278712458797">Brown &amp; Swartz, 1989</xref>). Previous studies have found that the perceptual market orientation gap negatively affected customer satisfaction and loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163278712458797">Krepapa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0163278712458797">Webb et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0163278712458797">Young et al. (1996)</xref> also indicated that a perceptual gap between nurses and patients can impede nursing care improvement and further have a negative impact on patient satisfaction and the relationship between nurses and patients. This study found that the perceptual market orientation gaps between physicians and patients actually exist. In addition, in the medical services that require frequent interaction between physicians and patients, the perceptual market orientation gap will have a negative effect on physician–patient relationship quality, hospital–patient relationship quality, and patient loyalty.</p>

<title>The Roles of Internal Marketing</title>
<p>In the service-profit chain model, satisfied employees not only create good core services but also offer relationship benefits to customers. The good quality of core services and attractive relationship benefits can lead to satisfaction and commitment from customers. In the health care context, through improving the relational commitment of patients to health care providers, the degree of patient loyalty and the continuum of health care can be enhanced, and word-of-mouth marketing can be improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0163278712458797">Weng et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, internal marketing can improve the quality of internal services to health professionals and enhance the degree of satisfaction among health professionals and, thus, raise the value of health services to satisfy patients, thereby winning their relational commitment and loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163278712458797">Chang &amp; Chang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0163278712458797">Peltier &amp; Scovotti, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0163278712458797">Tsai &amp; Wu, 2011</xref>). However, this study found that internal marketing did not have a direct impact on relationship quality and patient loyalty in the physician–patient interaction context. Physicians' perceptual internal marketing had a mediating effect on the relationship quality between health care providers and patients and on patient loyalty through physicians' perceptual market orientation.</p>
<p>Internal marketing affects the health professions’ commitment to and understanding of market orientation. Thus, commitment to and understanding of market orientation are the antecedents to developing market orientation in an organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163278712458797">Hallums, 1994</xref>). Therefore, internal marketing is one of the most important driving factors in the development of market orientation. That is to say, developing internal customer orientation is conducive to developing market orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0163278712458797">Ballantyne, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163278712458797">Conduit &amp; Mavondo, 2001</xref>). There is no doubt that the success of marketing strategies is determined by the effect of interfunctional coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0163278712458797">Narver &amp; Slater, 1990</xref>). It is particularly important that the process of internal marketing is the antecedent of not only internal marketing orientation but also market orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163278712458797">Conduit &amp; Mavondo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0163278712458797">Pulendran et al., 2000</xref>). This study also found that physicians’ perceptual internal marketing has a significant positive influence on their perceptual market orientation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0163278712458797">Lings and Greenley (2010)</xref> also indicated that internal marketing orientation can significantly strengthen market-oriented behaviors of service providers.</p>
<p>In addition, the triangular relationship of service marketing strategies is composed of the following: (1) external marketing: the relations between customers and organizations; (2) interactive marketing: the relations between customers and employees; and (3) internal marketing: the relations between organizations and employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0163278712458797">Kotler, 2003</xref>). External marketing is the focus of hospital market orientation, and the internal relationship between medical staff and hospitals is the focus of internal marketing. Internal marketing can improve external marketing and further enhance the interactive outcome by improving the interactions between patients and hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0163278712458797">Bansal, Mendelson, &amp; Sharma, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0163278712458797">Iliopoulos &amp; Priporas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0163278712458797">Peltier &amp; Scovotti, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0163278712458797">Tsai and Wu (2011)</xref> found that hospital internal marketing had an impact on service quality. However, this study showed that perceptual internal marketing did not have a direct impact but, instead, an indirect influence on patients' satisfaction, trust, and loyalty through the mediating effects of physicians’ perceptual market orientation.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Suggestions</title>
<p>Market orientation is a useful tool that can strengthen the physician–patient relationship quality, hospital–patient relationship quality, and patient loyalty. However, the perceptual market orientation gap between physicians and their patients has a negative influence on these constructs. With regard to internal marketing, it can strengthen market-oriented behaviors of physicians and has a positive influence on relationship quality and patient loyalty through the improvement of physicians’ perceptual market orientation.</p>
<sec id="section15-0163278712458797">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>This study found that the perceptual market orientation of frontline medical staff has a significant positive influence on relationship quality and patient loyalty. The reason is that market orientation offers hospitals and their staff the ability to connect with their customers and markets to realize the expectation of patients in advance and, thus, to provide adequate medical services to satisfy their needs. Therefore, market orientation should be enhanced to strengthen the physician–patient and hospital–patient relationships.</p>
<p>The physicians' perceptual internal marketing has a significant influence on their perceptual market orientation. Therefore, staff at the management level can make use of internal marketing to reduce the perceptual market orientation gap inside hospitals. In practice, the two-way communication of internal marketing not only strengthens the support of employees for market orientation strategies but is also conducive to the collection of important information about external customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163278712458797">Conduit &amp; Mavondo, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, the reward system of internal marketing can encourage employees to take action and adjust their attitudes in accordance with market orientation. Human resources development and training of internal marketing can also improve employees' sensitivity to customer needs, which is beneficial for organizations when developing market orientation strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0163278712458797">Pulendran et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>This study also found that physicians’ perceptual internal marketing has a positive influence on relationship quality and patient loyalty through the mediating effects of the physicians’ perceptual market orientation. That is to say, if hospitals want to strengthen hospital–patient (or physician–patient) relationship quality and enhance patient loyalty, the strategies of internal marketing and market orientation must be adopted together. Thus, internal marketing offers a good service for internal customers, and market orientation enhances the service value for external customers. Because it is so challenging to retain customers in the services field, hospital managers should develop a deep understanding of the impact of market orientation and internal marketing on the relationship between hospitals and patients.</p>
<p>In the past, nearly all studies on market orientation were aimed at the management level, ignoring the perception of employees. Because the delivery of medical services requires a high level of interaction between the frontline medical staff and patients, the market orientation perception of the frontline medical staff is critical to hospitals to determine the success of market orientation strategies. Therefore, the staff’s commitment and understanding toward market orientation in organizations are important in the development of market orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0163278712458797">Harris, 1999</xref>). The results of this study thus provide an important contribution to our understanding of market orientation from the perspective of medical employees.</p>

<title>Research Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research</title>
<p>The sample of this study was only limited to staff in the medical industry. Consequently, future studies can make use of the conceptual framework of this study and carry out empirical studies on other industries to extend the applicability of this investigation.  In addition, future research could examine in detail the impact of physician specialty or characteristics on the market orientation gap. Hypotheses in this study were proposed based on findings and theories described in related literature, and they were tested by regression analysis. However, a cross-sectional study design was adopted in this study, and thus, there were certain empirical limitations. Longitudinal data would be more convincing to infer a causal process of direct and mediating effects, it is suggested that future researchers could employ a longitudinal study design to clarify the influence of market orientation on relationship quality and customer loyalty over a longer period. Finally, convenience sampling rather than random sampling was adopted to acquire data in this study, and therefore, there may be some limitations regarding its applicability. Random sampling and different kinds of hospitals should be included in future studies to extend the applicability of the findings to the whole hospital industry.</p>
