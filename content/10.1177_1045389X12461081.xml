<p>Self-healing structures mimic the ability of biological structures (e.g. bone) to redistribute their structural mass in response to dynamic service loads and damaging effects. The self-healing features yield enhanced levels of structural efficiency and safety in dynamic service environments. In this study, the piezoelectric effect was used to convert the dynamic mechanical energy applied to the structure into electrical energy that, in turn, was used to drive electrochemical self-healing phenomena within a solid electrolyte. A theoretical framework was developed for self-healing materials, and experiments were conducted to verify the fundamental principles of the approach. The theoretical models confirmed that: (1) the piezoelectric effect can, within the geometric and mechanical constraints of actual structural systems, generate sufficient electric potential and charge (through harvesting the available mechanical energy) to enable electrochemical mass transport within a solid electrolyte; and (2) the redistribution of structural mass in dynamic service environments can occur within viable time frames. The fundamental principles of the new self-healing materials were validated through the demonstration of piezo-induced electrolytic phenomena in solid electrolytes and by verifying the gains in mechanical performance associated with such phenomena.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polymers and structural composites have found growing use in broad fields of application, including transport vehicles (cars, ships, and aircraft), civil engineering structures, and sporting goods. These materials, however, are susceptible to damage induced by mechanical, chemical, and thermal effects or combinations thereof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1045389X12461081">Osswald and Menges, 2003</xref>). Many damage phenomena introduce microcracks in the body of the structure, which are difficult to detect and even more difficult to repair manually. Consequently, such defects undermine the performance and reliability of polymer and composite materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045389X12461081">Blassiau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045389X12461081">Kessler et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>With increasing use of polymers and composites in various structural applications, several techniques have been developed and adopted for repairing them. Conventional repair methods such as welding and patching, however, are not effective for healing microcracks within the structure during its service life. The idea of self-healing polymers and composites was inspired by biological systems that continuously adapt and remodel in response to load and environmental effects. The concept of self-healing materials is based on the in-built capability to substantially recover their load-transferring ability after damage. Such recovery can either be autonomous or stimulus activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1045389X12461081">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). Originally proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1045389X12461081">Jud et al. (1981)</xref>, self-healing is viewed as a means of healing invisible cracks in polymeric components. The more recent work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1045389X12461081">White et al. (2001)</xref>, who reported the concept of material’s ability to autonomically heal cracks, and that of other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045389X12461081">Kessler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1045389X12461081">Pang and Bond, 2005</xref>) has increased the interest in this technique. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1045389X12461081">Kersey et al. (2007)</xref> have reported two general categories of the self-healing techniques available for recovery of mechanical properties. Self-healing is noted to occur either through the creation of new chemical bonds within the material, for example, by in situ polymerization of monomers in cracks or by re-creation of the ruptured chemical bonds as demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045389X12461081">Chen and Chu (2005)</xref> in their work on thermally remendable polymers based on cycloaddition (Diels–Alder). Contrary to what has been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1045389X12461081">Kersey et al. (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1045389X12461081">Hayes et al. (2007b)</xref> identified four types of self-healing systems. The first system uses glass capillaries to contain liquid resin system that bleed into damage sites upon fracture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045389X12461081">Bleay et al. (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1045389X12461081">Pang and Bond (2005)</xref> used hollow glass fibers. Healing would occur in this case upon fiber rupture under load. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1045389X12461081">Trask et al. (2007)</xref> have used hollow glass fibers in carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) and glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) to impart a self-healing functionality to the laminate. This mechanism proved to be problematic in some cases. This was mainly due to the fact that the curing rate of the resin employed for self-healing was faster than its diffusion rate, which led to blockage of fiber ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1045389X12461081">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). The second system comprised a liquid resin microencapsulated in a polymeric shell. A hardener or curing catalyst was also dispersed throughout the matrix. The resin would be released into the matrix upon fracture of the shell; it would then follow the path of a propagating crack. A similar approach is followed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1045389X12461081">White et al. (2001)</xref>. A third approach proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045389X12461081">Chen and Chu (2005)</xref> uses a reverse Diels–Alder polymer, which is based on polymerization–depolymerization equilibrium that enables re-formation of broken bonds upon heating. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045389X12461081">Hayes and Hou (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045389X12461081">Hayes et al. (2007a)</xref> used self-healing resins toward the development of smart composites with inherent health monitoring and self-healing capabilities.</p>
<p>The self-healing kinetics have been described to play crucial roles in determining the degree of repair achieved. In addition to avoiding unwanted side reactions, the chemistry of the self-healing process must be kinetically accessible on the time scale of crack propagation, and it must be thermodynamically viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1045389X12461081">Kersey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045389X12461081">Kessler et al., 2003</xref>). In some self-healing systems, the rate of healing is a function of the viscosity of the healing agent and the capillary driving forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1045389X12461081">Trask et al., 2007</xref>). An effective self-healing material should be capable of sensing and responding to damage over the lifetime of the structural system, and incorporation of the self-healing features should not compromise the initial material properties. Self-healing constitutes recovery of material properties that are critical to an application, including tensile strength, fracture toughness, and barrier attributes. A <italic>healing efficiency coefficient</italic> can be used to define the extent of recovery of a particular property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1045389X12461081">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). In the case of composites subjected to fatigue crack growth under high stress intensity, improvements in chemical kinetics of healing are required to prevent the crack growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045389X12461081">Jones et al., 2007</xref>). The healing of polymeric materials refers to the recovery of properties such as tensile strength, fracture toughness, surface smoothness, and barrier properties. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1045389X12461081">Wool and O’Connor (1981)</xref> have described the healing extent for various properties as the ratio of the healed to the original level of the property.</p>
<p>The self-healing and adaptive qualities of biological materials make key contributions to their survivability, damage tolerance, and structural efficiency. Bone, for example, employs a simple but powerful control mechanism to reconfigure its structure in order to remove the stress gradients for optimum structural performance. A new mechanism, inspired by the adaptive features of bone, is introduced here. This mechanism provides for redistribution of structural mass in response to stress gradients in a dynamic loading environment. The self-healing/adaptive mechanism involves the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy using the piezoelectric effect. Redistribution of mass occurs electrochemically in the context of a solid electrolyte; it is guided and driven by piezo-induced electric potential and charge, respectively. The self-healing features yield enhanced levels of structural efficiency and safety in dynamic service environments.</p>
<p>Under load and environmental effects, damage initiates and accumulates in composites in the form of matrix, interface, interlaminar, and fiber cracks. Through the introduction of piezoelectric and solid electrolyte constituents, composites assume the inherent capability to transport structural substance toward and deposit it at critically stressed areas in order to mitigate catastrophic damage propagation. This self-healing/adaptive mechanism makes constructive use of the otherwise destructive energy concentrated at such critical zones to effectively mobilize the material resources available elsewhere against catastrophic failure.</p>
<p>Self-healing/adaptive composite materials promise significant benefits in terms of the reliability, survivability, life-cycle economy, and weight of future structural systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1045389X12461081">Noor, 2000</xref>). The self-healing/adaptive mechanism effectively mobilizes material resources to optimize structural performance in light of altered service environments or damaging effects; mitigates catastrophic damage growth; and benefits the reliability, efficiency, longevity, and maintenance requirements of structural materials.</p>
<p>Fracture of composites is a complex phenomenon. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1045389X12461081">Wu (2000)</xref> derived expressions for stress distribution around the crack tip in an anisotropic material. The background experiments in this investigation on the critical load and crack length at incipient rapid crack extension indicated that cracks propagate collinear with the original crack. The cohesive zone model (CZM) originally pioneered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045389X12461081">Hillerborg (1991)</xref> for concrete under the name of <italic>fictitious crack model</italic> has been widely applied to composite materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045389X12461081">Blackman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045389X12461081">Li and Siegmund, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1045389X12461081">Tijssens et al., 2000</xref>). The CZM is a general model applicable to the process zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045389X12461081">Elices et al., 2001</xref>); however, it has been criticized because it needs the assumption of a crack path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045389X12461081">Kennedy and Nahan, 1996</xref>). The models for brittle-matrix composites are based on the fracture mechanics notion that sharp cracks propagate in the matrix with fibers bridging the crack behind the tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1045389X12461081">Marshall et al., 1985</xref>). Numerous other models have been proposed to analyze the damage zone and crack propagation in composite materials. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045389X12461081">Homma and Mitsubayashi (1989)</xref> considered stable crack growth to evaluate the fracture toughness of fiber-reinforced polymer composites. They stated that there is always a damage zone in the vicinity of crack tip where debonding of fibers from the matrix occurs. In their work, they analyzed the magnitude of the stress applied to fibers in the damage zone. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045389X12461081">Kennedy and Nahan (1996)</xref> proposed a nonlocal damage model to assess the progressive damage growth around the notch and to predict the failure load of composite laminate. Again, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045389X12461081">Kennedy and Nahan (1997)</xref> extended their earlier model to make it applicable to laminated shell structures containing a crack. A model to characterize the failure of unidirectional fiber-reinforced composites was postulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1045389X12461081">Oguni and Ravichandran (2000)</xref>. The distinct feature of their model was the analysis of crack branches initiating from the tip of the initial crack. They concluded that the critical stress state was largely dependent on the size of the dominant crack under given loading conditions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045389X12461081">Ju and Ko (2008)</xref> presented their micromechanical elastoplastic model to elaborate the process of partial interfacial debonding of fibers from the matrix. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1045389X12461081">Tzadka and Schulgasser (2009)</xref> put forward their model to examine the propagation process based on the energy approach. In their work, they replaced the crack system by an inclusion to facilitate the computational process. They also considered the damage zone to be of rectangular shape, arguing that this shape better illustrates the nature of damage evolution. It is generally agreed that in spite of the much work done to investigate the failure mechanics of composites, a robust model to capture the complicated physics associated with damage and failure of composites needs to be presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1045389X12461081">Pineda et al., 2009</xref>). In most damage models, emphasis is placed on the development of a damage zone ahead of the crack tip, which has a considerable influence on crack propagation. In the case of fiber-reinforced brittle-matrix composites, microcracks initiate by strain localization and develop ahead of the crack tip in the region referred to as the <italic>fracture processing zone</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1045389X12461081">Mehta and Parsania, 2006</xref>). In summary, characterization of the damage/processing zone is of fundamental importance in the fracture mechanics of composite materials.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045389X12461081">Li and Siegmund (2004)</xref> highlighted that an effective brittle-matrix composite reinforced with strong brittle fibers relies on a weak bond between fibers and matrix. In the event of crack propagation through matrix, some intact fibers are left behind the crack tip. These fibers exert closing tractions on the crack surface and work against the frictional forces at the fiber–matrix interface during the pull-out process. The energy dissipation associated with this phenomenon enhances the toughness of composites. The work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1045389X12461081">Oguni and Ravichandran (2001)</xref> identifies the presence of crack branches that initiate from the initial crack tip. They predicted that the failure envelopes for a range of stress states are dependent, beside dominant initial flaw, on the growth and orientation of the crack branches.</p>

<title>Theoretical modeling and analytical verification of self-healing composites</title>
<p>Matrix cracking, fiber rupture, delamination, and debonding at fiber–matrix interfaces are the key failure modes in composite materials. Although thermal, chemical, and other environmental factors can cause damage in composites, failures caused by impact and cyclic fatigue have received the most attention for structural applications of composites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045389X12461081">Baker et al., 1985</xref>). Crack propagation is the basic failure mode involved in both mechanisms. Consequently, crack propagation in composites has been researched extensively. Cracking and fiber rupture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12461081">Figure 1</xref>) are some key manifestations of damage in composites. They bring about local stress concentration and thus cause further growth of the damage zone.</p>

<p>Considering the case of carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy laminate [0/90]<sub>4s</sub>, a typical critical stress intensity factor (<italic>K<sub>c</sub></italic>) is equal to 13 MPa m<sup>1/2</sup> and a typical tensile strength is 6.38 MPa. For a damage threshold stress that is 75% of the ultimate tensile strength, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1045389X12461081">equation (2)</xref> yields a damage zone size (<italic>r<sub>D</sub></italic>) of 0.12 mm. The damage zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12461081">Figure 2(b)</xref>) responsible for damage growth leading to catastrophic failure is thus relatively small. In other words, the failure of a damaged composite is decided by a very small fraction of its volume. The self-healing phenomenon renders strengthening effects to the damage zone, which mitigates the damage growth. The composites embodying self-healing principles may incorporate carbon fibers that have received a hybrid coating comprising piezoelectric and solid electrolyte layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X12461081">Figure 3</xref>). The solid electrolyte layer would incorporate close to 15% by weight of metal cations (associated with a dissolved salt); electrostripping of this metal from outside the damage zone and its transport into and electrodeposition within the damage zone constitute the self-healing effect, which mitigates damage propagation and catastrophic failure of damaged composite. For the purpose of this theoretical evaluation, we assume that the metal to be transported to the damage zone is nickel (which is amenable to electrolysis). Nickel offers yield strength and elastic modulus of about 350 MPa and 207 GPa, respectively. The tensile strength and elastic modulus of carbon fibers are about 2700 MPa and 380 GPa respectively; they rupture at a strain of about 0.00711. These values fall in the range reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1045389X12461081">Tagawa and Miyata, 1997</xref>) for high-modulus carbon fibers. The self-healing phenomenon electrodeposits a layer of nickel onto the carbon fiber coating.</p>

<p>The electrodeposited nickel would yield as fiber approaches its rupture strain; thus, it develops a stress of 350 MPa. In order to add 20% to the rupture strength of a carbon fiber, 1.08 × 10<sup>−7</sup> g of nickel should be deposited within the 0.12-mm fiber length segment within the damage zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X12461081">Figure 4</xref>). With 15% weight fraction of nickel in the solid electrolyte layer of 1 µm thickness, one would need nickel from the solid electrolyte coating within a 17-mm length segment of the fiber to effectively strengthen the fiber length occurring within the damage zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X12461081">Figure 4</xref>). The charge generated with each application of stress to the piezoelectric layer (over the 17-mm length segment of fiber) is 10<sup>−6</sup> C. This charge can transport 3 × 10<sup>−11</sup> g of nickel for electrodeposition within the damage zone. Hence, in order to transport a total of 1.08 × 10<sup>−7</sup> g of nickel to damage zone (to render the targeted fiber strengthening effect), one needs 1080 applications of stress. Assuming that stress is applied at a frequency of 10 Hz, the targeted strengthening (self-healing) effect would be completed over a period of 108 s (1.8 min). The kinetics of the self-healing mechanism thus provides for efficient fiber strengthening effects on the time scale of damage through crack propagation. This mechanism will equally apply to the healing of matrix in case cracks develop parallel or transverse to the fiber direction, as observed in other investigations of self-healing materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045389X12461081">Hayes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1045389X12461081">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). The piezoelectric-based self-healing has also been reported as a means of repairing delaminated beams that would otherwise fail in a sliding fracture mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1045389X12461081">Wang and Quek, 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>The above calculations provide a key analytical support for the hypothesis that piezo-driven electrolysis within solid electrolyte can provide a viable basis for development of self-healing composite materials. The introduction of a hybrid coating onto carbon fibers yields, with a relatively small weight penalty, the desired self-healing effect that can be completed within a relatively short time period.</p>

<p>Electrochemical phenomena have been traditionally realized in the context of liquid electrolytes. The growing demands for solid-state batteries and fuel cells, however, have prompted major development efforts in the field of solid electrolytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1045389X12461081">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>).

<title>Selection and processing of solid electrolytes</title>
<p>The ability to dissolve salts is not limited to liquid solvents. The existence of polar groups in polymers is a common feature; it may thus be expected that some polymers will have the potential to dissolve salts and form stable ion–polymer complexes. A salt dissolves in a solid polymer only if the associated energy and entropy changes produce an overall reduction in the free energy of the system. This arises when the interaction between ionic species and the coordinating groups on polymer chain compensates for the loss of salt lattice energy. The transfer of electric current through solid electrolytes incorporating dissolved salts can then occur through ionic transport. The ions are transported in a polymer electrolyte by a combination of ionic motion coupled with the local motion of polymer segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12461081">Figure 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045389X12461081">Gray, 1991</xref>). The ion-conducting polymers exhibit three key characteristics: (a) atoms or groups of atoms with sufficient electron donor power to form coordinate bonds with cations, (b) low barriers to bond rotation so that segmental motion of polymer chains occurs readily, and (c) a suitable distance between coordinating centers facilitating the formation of multiple intrapolymer ion bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045389X12461081">Gray, 1991</xref>).</p>

<p>Solid-state batteries and fuel cells employ solid electrolytes simply as fast ion conductors. The self-healing phenomenon, which is the subject of this research, however, requires simultaneous occurrence of electrostripping, ionic transport, and electrodeposition within solid electrolytes. Furthermore, the mechanical performance of solid electrolytes is of utmost importance in their incorporation into high-performance composites. The selection of a mechanically viable class of solid electrolytes and validation of complete electrolysis phenomena (electrostripping, ionic transport, and electrodeposition) within this solid electrolyte thus constitute critical steps in the development of self-healing composites.</p>

<title>Selection of a solid polymer electrolyte: poly(vinylidine fluoride-co-hexafluropropylene)</title>
<p>The approach adopted was to select solid electrolytes with high inherent mechanical characteristics, which also offer high levels of conductivity. Based on a comprehensive literature review, poly(vinylidine fluoride-<italic>co</italic>-hexafluropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) was selected to provide a desirable balance of ionic conductivity and mechanical attributes. Because of the high density of fluorine groups, PVDF-HFP has a high coordinating ability with many metal ions; this leads to relatively high levels of ionic conductivity. Fluorine can further form H-bonds, which provide the system with pseudo cross-linking and thus enhanced mechanical attributes.</p>
<p>The materials used for the preparation of PVDF-HFP solid electrolyte included PVDF-HFP (pellets, crystalline thermoplastic copolymer, 15% HFP average molecular weight (M<sub>w</sub>) 400,000), ethylene carbonate (EC, 98%), propylene carbonate (PC, 99%), copper(II) trifluoromethanesulfonate (CuTf, 98%), and tetrahydrofuran (THF, 99.9+% high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade, inhibitor free). All materials were used without any further purification. The electrodes were made of stainless steel shims (0.05 mm). The three different solid electrolytes were prepared by varying the composition of copper salt, EC, and PC while keeping the PVDF percentage constant.</p>

<title>Visual assessment of the electrolysis phenomena within solid electrolyte</title>
<p>The primary goal of the experimental effort reported herein was to prove the feasibility of electrolysis (electrostripping, ionic transport, and electrodeposition) occurring in the context of a mechanically viable solid electrolyte. Prior to application of voltage, copper ions are complexed to the fluorine atoms in PVDF-HFP. When voltage is applied, due to polarity differences, two ends of the positively charged copper ions will be attracted to the negatively charged cathode. Copper ions migrate from one site to the other and get reduced at the cathode where they deposit as copper. Since the most common coordination number of copper is 4, each copper ion will bind with four fluorine atoms as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1045389X12461081">Figure 7</xref>. The maximum molar ratio between copper ion and polymer should thus be 2:1. This ratio guides our efforts to increase the concentration of copper ions in PVDF-HFP.</p>

<title>Assessment of the mechanical consequences of electrolysis within solid electrolyte</title>
<p>Mechanical (hardness) tests were performed following the ASTM D 2240 procedures on PVDF-HFP solid electrolytes before and after electrolysis. The polymer sample was detached from electrodes after electrolysis, and hardness of the cathode and anode interfaces were measured separately. The hardness tests were performed at three different locations on each surface. The hardness test data are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1045389X12461081">Figure 9</xref>. Hardness, as a measure of mechanical attributes, is observed to increase markedly at cathode after electrolysis. This finding provides further evidence for the viability of our approach, which relies on electrolysis phenomena within solid electrolytes to transport mass toward (and deposit it at) sites of stress rise (cathode) to render self-healing effects. The gains in mechanical properties associated with electrolytic mass transport (through the solid electrolyte) to cathode confirm that the process can actually render self-healing effects. Mechanical testing was not on the test program as this was a proof-of-concept study. Hardness measurements were made to assess local mechanical properties before and after electrolysis. Furthermore, the gain in hardness at the cathode was significant (87%), indicating an increase in the mechanical properties. Since tension test is an important measurement, it has been added to the future work section.</p>

<title>Evaluation of ionic versus electronic transport phenomena in PVDF-HFP solid electrolyte</title>
<p>Solid electrolytes generally transfer electric current by a combination of ionic and electronic transport phenomena. While electronic transport is sustainable, ionic transport could be limited by the finite quantity of metals available to be ionized (and transported). Without metallic electrodes, solid electrolyte would rely only on the dissolved metal salt as the source of metal for ionic transport. Long-term polarization experiments allowed us to distinguish between ionic and electronic transport phenomena.</p>
<p>Polarization tests were conducted by connecting the ammeter between the power supply and the solid electrolyte cell. A bias voltage of 15 V was applied between the electrodes of the cell, with current measured versus time. The time history of electric current was measured under a constant bias voltage over a period of 6 h. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1045389X12461081">Figure 10</xref> presents the current time history for the PVDF-HFP system with 3% copper ion concentration. A substantial drop in the current flow is evident over time. This suggests that the solid electrolyte with dissolved copper salt relies largely on ionic (in lieu of electronic) transport of electric current, which favors the use of PVDF-HFP in self-healing composites. The predominance of ionic (vs electronic) conductivity ensures that the electrical energy (resulting from transformation of mechanical energy by piezoelectric effect) will be used efficiently to transport mass (in lieu of electrons) to render self-healing effects. It should also be noted that the relatively small fraction of electronic transport has a role to play in the system. Eventual reduction of metal cations for deposition of metal requires electrons; the electronic fraction of current transfer ensures greater availability of electrons not only at but also near the cathode interface, thereby broadening the volume within damage zone where electrodeposition (and thus self-healing) occurs.</p>

<title>Experimental validation of piezo-driven electrolysis within solid electrolyte</title>
<p>The experimental program presented in the previous section verified the electrochemical mass transport and deposition phenomena within the solid electrolyte using direct input of electricity and evaluated the mechanical implications of these phenomena.

<p>The piezo-induced potential guides the self-healing effect in the sense that it turns zones of stress concentration into cathode, toward which electrolytic mass transport would occur. The piezo-induced charge drives the self-healing effect in the sense that it governs the rate of mass transport toward cathode. The piezoelectric coefficients governing generation of electric potential and charge under stress are briefly introduced below.</p>
<p>Piezoelectric materials possess anisotropic properties. Consequently, the electrical response of the material is dependent on the direction of external mechanical loads. In order to define the electromechanical properties relative to prescribed body-fixed axis frames, conventions have been developed for piezoelectric plate-like geometries (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1045389X12461081">Figure 13(a)</xref>). Piezoelectric coefficients are defined with two subscripts: the first one identifies the axis of electric field, while the second one corresponds to mechanical stress. Expressions for piezo-induced electric charge (D) and potential (E), and for a stress system that is relevant to our application are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1045389X12461081">Figure 13(b)</xref>, where d<sub>31</sub> and g<sub>31</sub> are the relevant piezoelectric coefficients. Some ceramics (e.g. lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and BaTiO<sub>3</sub>) and polymers (e.g. PVDF) exhibit pronounced piezoelectricity. The d<sub>31</sub> piezoelectric coefficients of PZT, BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, and PVDF are 110, 78, and 23 pC/N, respectively, and the corresponding g<sub>31</sub> coefficients are 10, 5, and 216 mV m/N, respectively.</p>

<p>For piezo-driven electrolysis to actually take place in solid electrolyte, it is essential that (1) the piezo-induced potential (E) is sufficient to overcome the activation and polarization overpotentials at anode and cathode and also the i–R drop within the solid electrolyte (where i is electric current and R is resistance); and (2) piezo-induced charge is sufficient for electrochemical mass transport at viable rates.</p>
<p>In order to validate piezo-induced electrolysis within solid electrolyte, PVDF-HFP solid electrolyte specimens with dissolved copper salt were prepared as discussed earlier. The solid electrolyte specimens were sandwiched between two stainless steel electrodes. Piezoelectric (PZT fiber-reinforced composite) sheets were then subjected to repeated stress application, and the piezo-induced voltage was applied to the electrodes. Current was measured at picoampere precision (between the piezoelectric setup and electrodes). The basic elements of the test setup are schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1045389X12461081">Figure 14</xref>.

<p>Material transport occurs within the solid electrolyte matrix, with copper ions migrating from low-stress to highly stressed regions. Many highly stressed regions incorporate fractured fibers. Migration and deposition of copper in highly stressed regions thus involve some strengthening of stressed fiber–matrix interfacial areas. It should be noted that the dissolutions at anode is insignificant when compared with the depositions occurring at cathode. This is confirmed by the insignificant loss of mechanical performance (hardness) experienced at anode, which suggests that fiber debonding due to dissolutions is not a major concern.</p>
