<p>This text consists of 20 chapters that bring together current approaches and recent research about working with young people who sexually abuse. It is made up of contributions by authors from various countries including both academics and practitioners. The book is principally intended as a reference resource and consistent messages throughout highlight the importance of holistic approaches to working with young people who sexually abuse, while also appreciating some of the challenges and difficulties this presents.</p>
<p>A number of contributors examine the use of typologies and address current ‘risk factor’ research. Several authors also suggest a range of assessment tools that can be practically used to assess young people who display sexually harmful behaviours, including the IAIM tool for the assessment and treatment of young people who use new technologies to engage in sexually harmful behaviour. Whilst many of the tools appear relatively easy to apply to assessment, the contributors are keen to emphasize that they should not be used in isolation; rather they should form part of holistic assessments and approaches. The research- and practice-based suggestions presented within the text are not solely limited in application to ‘high risk’ offenders, but might also apply to young people at the onset of displaying sexually harmful behaviours and some of complexities in working with young people who have complex trauma histories, attachment disorders and learning disabilities. Moreover, the issue of young people within the care system is explored by a number of contributors and recommendations are made in relation to ‘after care’ and continuing support.</p>
<p>Whilst no single ‘model’ is promoted or championed throughout the book, a clear message is sent to the reader that multi-agency approaches should be adopted and that the inclusion of young people at various stages of assessment, intervention and planning should be encouraged. Equally, a number of contributors have chosen to explore the role of the practitioner within the assessment, therapeutic intervention and risk management framework. Suggestions are made as to how elements of best practice and more positive and effective interventions might be achieved through the examination of the ‘therapeutic alliance’ and training programmes for social workers and other practitioners.</p>
<p>Given the wide array of subject matter, this is a rich text that offers the reader a comprehensive insight into past and present developments in the field appealing to both academic and professional spheres. Practitioners should consider carefully how to incorporate elements of the material in their own work and be encouraged to discuss with their respective service the most appropriate and effective way to use a number of the assessment tools to promote consistent collaborative practice.</p>
