<p>Nowadays, ultra-thick 3D woven composites have great potential applications in aerospace, maritime and infrastructure fields. Static and dynamic mechanical data for 3D ultra-thick composites are on a high demand by industry. In this study, a 15 mm ultra-thick 3D composite reinforced with woven glass fabric was fabricated, and the static and bending fatigue properties were analyzed. For comparison, the 2D composite with almost the same thickness and fiber volume fraction with the 3D composite was also fabricated. The results showed that the 3D-warp and 3D-weft samples have 21% and 5% higher normalized tensile strengths, 28% and 9% higher normalized tensile moduli, 29% and 25% higher normalized compression strengths, 18% higher and a similar normalized compression moduli compared with those of the 2D laminated sample, respectively. The superior in-plane properties of the 3D composite to the 2D laminates were due to crimp-free states of the warp and weft yarns in the 3D orthogonal structure. In the bending test, the 3D-warp and 3D-weft samples both have 42% higher normalized flexure strengths, 32% and 28% higher normalized flexure moduli than those of the 2D sample, respectively. Meanwhile, the failure mechanisms and fracture modes are also analyzed for the different mechanical tests of the two types of composites. In bending fatigue test of 3D composite, a linear regression model is used to predict the residual stiffness of the composite. The experimental results of fatigue residual stiffness reduction of both directions agree reasonably well with the predictions of the model.</p>

<p>For many years, conventional laminate composites have been used in structural applications varying from naval ships to aerospace components. Among them, glass fiber polymer (GFP) composites are often used due to their lightweight and good fatigue performance. However, GFP composites generally have low stiffness which means that thick composite hulls must be applied for large structures such as ships. In addition, with the increasing need for producing more integrated designs, applying thick composites for large primary load bearing structures is inevitable.</p>
<p>Much attention has been paid to the mechanical properties of thick laminated composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312443141">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312443141"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312443141"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312443141"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312443141">5</xref></sup> Akhras and Li<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312443141">1</xref></sup> analyzed the progressive failure of thick composite plates using the spline finite strip method and the yields resulted in reasonable agreement with the 3D finite element solutions. Lee and Soutis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312443141">3</xref></sup> investigated the compressive strength of 2–10 mm thick carbon fiber epoxy laminates and found that the test operator and compression jig had a great impact on their mechanical properties. Olivier and Cavarero<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312443141">4</xref></sup> performed longitudinal tensile tests on thick (252 plies, 31.5 mm) and thin (28 plies) laminates and found that long-time curing influenced homogeneity of mechanical properties of thick laminates through the thickness due to the cure gradients in thick section laminates.</p>
<p>Three-dimensional woven fiber composites have emerged as a new class of lightweight material in many important applications. The advantages of 3D woven preform include near net-shape, conformable and free of lamination process. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312443141">Figure 1</xref>, a 3D woven preform consists of in-plane warp and weft yarn layers interlaced with through-the-thickness z yarns which prevent delamination, dramatically improve impact damage tolerance, and provide the easy path for the resin flowing in consolidation processes.

<p>The fatigue performances of 3D textile composites have been extensively studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998312443141">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998312443141"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312443141"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312443141">21</xref></sup> Gowayed and Fan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998312443141">19</xref></sup> constructed a model to evaluate the fatigue behavior of textile composite materials under tension–tension loads. Rudov-Clark and Mouritz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312443141">20</xref></sup> investigated the tensile fatigue properties of a specific type of 3D orthogonal woven composite with 3.8 mm thickness and found that the fatigue life and strength of the 3D woven composite decreased with increasing z-binder content. Tsai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312443141">21</xref></sup> investigated the fatigue behavior of 3D angle interlock woven composite plates and showed that the three-layer specimen (1.5 mm in thickness) exhibited higher static ultimate tensile strength (UTS), but lower fatigue limit strength than the five-layer specimen (2 mm in thickness) for both the unnotched and notched plates. They also studied the microscopic fatigue damage process and found five stages were involved: transverse cracks in the warp yarns, deboning between the warp and weft yarns, debonding extension and detection into the matrix, and weft fiber breakage. The papers above were only limited to the tensile fatigue of the 3D composite. Up to now, little has been reported on bending fatigue of the 3D ultra-thick composite.</p>

For comparison, the mechanical properties of the 2D laminated composite with almost the same thickness and fiber volume fraction were also investigated. In addition, bending fatigue test of the 3D composite was also performed and the results were analyzed.</p>

<p>The configuration of 5 warp and 6 weft layers was adopted in making the composites. Both the warp and the weft yarns are E-glass fibers and the aramid was used as z yarns. The fabric counts in warp and weft directions were 5 end/cm and 5 pick/cm. Consolidation of the preforms was achieved by the vacuum-assisted resin infusion method with a 24 h curing at ambient temperature. For comparison, the 2D woven glass fiber reinforced composite of nearly the same fiber volume fraction and thickness with the 3D composites was used.

<p>In the tensile test, the dog-bone shaped composite specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312443141">Figure 2</xref>) were prepared for the two types of composite samples. For the 3D composite samples, the specimens were cut with the length along the warp and the weft yarns, while those for the 2D composites were cut only in one direction along one set of the yarns due to the same properties in the two directions. Therefore three groups of composites, 3D-warp, 3D-weft and 2D, named for convenience, were tested. At least five specimens in each group were successfully tested.
<fig id="fig2-0021998312443141" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Configuration of the tensile test specimen (mm).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998312443141-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Tensile tests of the above specimens were conducted on an SANS HG100 testing machine with a crosshead speed of 3 mm/min. Strain gauges were mounted at the center of each specimen on either side along the 0° and 90° directions and strain was measured throughout the test by a multi-channel strain recorder. Tensile strength was calculated using the peak load and the cross-sectional areas of the specimen. Tensile modulus was calculated from the stress–strain curves.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312443141">Figure 3</xref> presents the stress–strain curves for tensile test of the two types of composites. The tensile loading responses of 3D-warp and 3D-weft samples were similar with three regions observed in each stress–strain curve. A linear behavior occurred initially, followed by a little continue softening caused by matrix cracking. After that another linear increase was observed until failed with a sudden load drop. The three regions were first identified by Guess and Reedy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312443141">9</xref></sup> and also observed in the tensile stress–strain curves of 3D woven GRP composites by Callus et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312443141">7</xref></sup> The 2D composite specimens experienced a similar response with 3D composite except for a sudden rupture at a strain of 1.0% mainly caused by resin crack growth and delamination.

<p>The tensile strengths and moduli of the 2D and 3D composites were listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998312443141">Table 3</xref>. It can be seen that the tensile strength and modulus of the 3D composite in the weft direction are the highest and the 2D composite has a little higher tensile strength than that of the 3D composite in the warp direction. If we look at the normalized tensile strength and modulus, which is the tensile strength and modulus divided by the fiber volume fraction, the 3D composite performed better than their 2D counterparts. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998312443141">Table 3</xref>, the normalized tensile strengths of 3D-warp and 3D-weft samples are 21% and 5% higher than that of the 2D sample, respectively.

<p>The results were not consistent with the literature, in which the in-plane properties of the 3D composite were generally reduced by the crimping, waviness and damage to fibers caused by the Z reinforcement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312443141">22</xref></sup> However, in these papers, 3D interlock woven fabric composites are adopted and this kind of structure composites suffer from substantial inherent crimp and exhibit inferior in-plane properties when compared with the 2D counterparts. The 3D orthogonal woven preform in this study had almost crimp free warp and weft yarns providing superior in-plane mechanical properties to the 2D laminated structures. Similar results could be found in recent literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998312443141">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998312443141">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The main reason why the 3D-weft sample has a normalized tensile strength 15% lower than that of the 3D-warp sample is the crimps in the weft yarns due to the transverse pressure applied by the z yarns to the top and bottom layers of the weft yarns. In addition, the 3D-warp sample has a normalized tensile modulus 18% higher than that of the 3D-weft, which was mainly due to that the warp yarns passed through a series of tensioning devices during the weaving process, leading to a higher and constant yarn tension than that of the weft yarns which kept warp yarn crimp free.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312443141">Figure 4</xref> shows the tensile failure mode of the two types of composites, which was mainly the fiber fracture and pulling out. It could be seen that more glass fibers ruptured in the 2D composite than that in their 3D counterparts.

<p>The compression stress–strain curves of both composites are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312443141">Figure 5</xref>.

The 3D-weft sample had the highest compression strength and modulus. When the fiber volume fraction was considered, however, the 3D-warp sample had the highest values. The normalized compression strengths of 3D-warp and 3D-weft samples are 29% and 25% higher than that of the 2D sample, respectively. The normalized compression modulus of 3D-warp sample is 18% higher than that of the 2D sample. The compression modulus of the 3D-weft sample is close to that of the 2D sample due to the effect of the crimped weft interlaced with z yarns on the top and bottom layers of the 3D composite.

<p>The 3-point bending tests were conducted using an SANS HG100 testing machine on regular specimens of 250 × 25 mm<sup>2</sup>, with the span length fixed at 150 mm. Five specimens were tested for each group at room temperature with a cross-head speed of 3 mm/min. The specimens were deflected until rupture occurred in the outer fiber.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312443141">Figure 7</xref> shows the typical load-displacement curves for 3-point bending test of the two types of composites. It was obvious that the 3D composite had a much higher ultimate load due to through the thickness z yarns existing in the composite. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0021998312443141">Table 5</xref> lists the bending strengths and moduli of the two types of composites. When the fiber volume fraction was considered, the bending strengths and moduli in the warp direction of the 3D composite were higher than the 2D composite. The normalized flexure strengths of 3D-warp and 3D-weft samples were both 42% higher than that of the 2D sample. The normalized flexure moduli of 3D-warp and 3D-weft samples were 32% and 28% higher than that of the 2D sample. It is concluded that the normalized flexure properties of the 3D composite were substantially increased over those of the 2D composite.

It could be seen that the specimens broke at mid span where the central pin was located. In addition, it shows clearly that the top surface of the specimen suffered compression and the bottom surface suffered tensile loads during the bending test. The fracture appearances of the two types of composites were very similar and the surface glass fiber suffered rupture.

When the number of loading cycles increased, the displacement of specimen middle point for both warp and weft direction were also increased and the tendency of both curves were almost same. At the early stage of the fatigue cycling, the displacement had a sharp increase initially, which could be rationalized by the dominance of localized flaws, followed by a more gradual increase. At this stage, the cracks or flaws were propagating slowly, which was quite different from a metal. At the end, the displacement increased rapidly until the material damaged.

The results showed that the weft direction had a significantly better fatigue performance than the corresponding warp direction. At a lower number of cycles, however, the residual modulus reduction rate for warp direction is almost the same as that for the weft direction. Both of them were degraded fast and then came to a steadily stage until the residual stiffness of the warp direction was reduced to 83% of its ultimate stiffness at 9000 cycles, whilst the residual stiffness of the weft direction was reduced to 84% of its ultimate stiffness at 13,000 cycles. After that point, the speed of stiffness degradation was accelerated until damaged.

<p>In fatigue test, the temperature of the specimen could be increased due to non-elastic deformation of the composite which consumes energy. Minak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998312443141">26</xref></sup> has reported that when the frequency (5–15 Hz) or the loading level (60–90% of ultimate load) of the fatigue test of a laminated graphite-epoxy composite is raised, the temperature of the tested specimen is also increased. It is reported that the higher the temperature, the shorter the fatigue life. In a polymer, it is resulted from intermolecular friction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998312443141">27</xref></sup> which could be enhanced if the temperature is raised to close to or above the glass transition temperature of the matrix when the molecules could move passing each other more freely and thus could generate more heat and cause more permanent deformation. In Minak’s study, 5 Hz and 80% of ultimate load lead to a temperature increase of 15°C. In this study, with a frequency of 2.5 Hz and 80% of ultimate load, the temperature increase should be less than 8°C, which may not be high enough to result in a significant difference in fatigue life since typical glass transition temperature of unsaturated polyester resins should be around 100°C according to the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998312443141">28</xref></sup></p>

<p>A 15 mm ultra-thick 3D glass fiber reinforced composite with the aramid as the z yarns was successfully fabricated. Compared with the 2D composite, the 3D composite demonstrated better mechanical properties based on the same fiber volume fractions were considered. The normalized tensile strength and modulus of the 3D composite were higher than those of the 2D composite. Similar results were obtained in the compression test although the two tests had different failure modes. In the 3-point bending test, the fracture appearances of the two types of composites were very similar and the glass fiber suffered rupture on the surface. The normalized flexure strengths of the 3D composite were substantially higher than that of the 2D composite. In the 3-point-bending fatigue test, the residual strength and modulus of both warp and weft directions show a sharp reduction initially, due to the localized flaws in the early part of fatigue cycling, followed by a more gradual decrease. The experimental results of fatigue residual stiffness reduction for warp and weft direction correlate reasonably well with the predictions of theoretical analysis.</p>
