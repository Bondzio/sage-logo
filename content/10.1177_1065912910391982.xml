<abstract>
<p>Patriotism poses a threat, not just to democracy but also to life itself. It finds expression in a new species of civic memorial dedicated to animals. In wartime, the animal world, including dogs, horses, elephants, and mules, is forced to serve. It is treated as militarily indispensable but also utterly disposable. Millions of animals have been killed in the name of country—not despite the patriotic love professed for them, but precisely because of it. The treatment of animals mimics the treatment of citizens and vice versa, where no sacrifice ultimately lies beyond justification. Thus, patriotism’s dependence on and even addiction to death acquires added intensity and depth.</p>

<title>J’Accuse</title>
<p>On April 1, 2001, Richard Ben Cramer issued a polemic entitled, “They Were Heroes Too,” published in <italic>Parade Magazine</italic>. It reached an audience of millions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1065912910391982">Cramer 2001</xref>). Cramer seemed intent on righting what he deemed an obvious and longstanding wrong. When it comes to war, the United States has perpetrated its share of civic slights against those who served it. On the National Mall in Washington, D.C., sacred symbolic space, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Korean War Memorial, and the World War II Memorial pay tribute to veterans in wars that were, respectively, reviled, forgotten, and ignored. One would think that the completion of Friedrich St. Florian’s grandiose World War II design settled memorial accounts. Not so. One group of vets has not received its due. Advocates have pushed for, among other things, a national monument, a tree outside Arlington National Cemetery, a commemorative postage stamp, and full inclusion in the National Museum of American History. Each effort resulted in failure, which does not mean efforts to secure recognition ceased. Cramer assumes that if the country knew of the patriotic crime being committed against some of its most loyal denizens, surely a remedy would emerge. Hence, the piece in <italic>Parade Magazine</italic> calling attention to this sorry state of affairs and detailing the heroics of an underappreciated band of brothers—the dogs we sent to war to serve and die on our behalf.</p>
<p>Cramer’s reproach, whatever its merits, neglected numerous memorial developments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1065912910391982">1</xref></sup> To cite one example, on July 21, 1994, the fiftieth anniversary of Guam’s invasion, the Marine War Dog Memorial was unveiled at the United States Marine Corps War Dog Cemetery on the island. The memorial salutes 25 dogs killed “liberating Guam in 1944.” Featuring the life-size rendering of a deployed Doberman (Kurt), the statue sits on a pedestal surrounded by the graves of 25 dogs killed in the name of country. Kurt is in the down position, relaxed but ready for action. Ears pointed, he is alert and forever on duty guarding his comrades, much as soldiers “patrol” the space in front of the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery. Reminiscent of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington, the names of the dogs (Kurt, Skipper, etc.) are inscribed on the side of the pedestal. The following memorial inscription mimics tributes offered to humans, invoking the idea of volunteered sacrifice in the name of freedom: “25 Marine War Dogs gave their lives liberating Guam in 1944. They served as sentries, messengers, scouts. They explored caves, detected mines and booby traps. SEMPER FIDELIS.” Nevertheless, insofar as no single war dog memorial is considered a national memorial, the <italic>story</italic> of animals in war remains largely untold. To many animal lovers, this lack constitutes a grave political injustice.</p>
<p>This sense of injustice, however, may be misplaced, and with this suspicion in mind I would like to make patriotism itself a question. Patriotism requires, even demands, public recognition of service to country, especially military service. Such demands extend beyond citizens to animals. Ironically, patriotism reveals much about itself—perhaps more than intended—through the memorialization of animals. In short, telling stories of animals in war backfires. To demonstrate and analyze this result, I explore the following question: What happens when people sacrifice what they claim to love most, that which morally defines them, and celebrate the sacrifice? This involves not just families “giving” sons and daughters, husbands and wives, mothers and fathers over to military service; it involves another intimate relationship, a distinctive emotional bond that transcends the purely human. It involves patriotism’s readiness to bring even the nonhuman world into its moral and political orbit. Insofar as patriotic culture routinely searches for new memorial and monumental forms on which to sustain and solidify it, “man’s best friends” represent vital matter. What, then, do the sacrifice of animals and its subsequent celebration signify? Patriotism’s constitutive attachment to sacrifice, death first of all, renders it dangerous not only to democratic politics (Johnston 2007) but also in a more fundamental way. Patriotism is antithetical to life itself.</p>

<title>Loving Animals to Death</title>
<p>Civic memorials, manifestations of love, make the past present. As such, the contents of the past become the object of contestation, but contestation channels the politics of the present. People invent and reinvent themselves in the course of erecting monuments to their triumphs, their tribulations, and their achievements. Commemoration and memorialization thus amount to an existential struggle in which rivals seek hegemony. Love seeks unanimity, forced if necessary, but resolution or consensus appears to be wishful thinking. The drive to secure univocality engenders opposition and plurality, which finds vivid expression in the controversies surrounding public design competitions governing monuments and memorials.</p>
<p>Remarkably, then, politics seems absent in the memorialization of animals. Animals don’t divide, they unite. Pet-loving nations that would honor them have no doubts about the legitimacy or necessity of this ambition. Given the wartime “service” rendered by animals, it would seem impossible not to acknowledge and recognize them. Skeptics may need to be educated about the role that animals play in wartime or they may seek to place limits on the honors to be accorded (do not bestow medals, for example) to preserve one dimension of the human/animal boundary, but they too wish to pay proper respects.</p>
<p>It is precisely the imperative surrounding the question of animal memorialization to which I would like to call attention. What does it say about patriotism that people feel compelled to honor animals in the first place? What does it say about people that they honor them in the way they do? What does it say about people that the following words can be read only as tribute and not as condemnation: “For their contribution to the war effort, the dogs paid a dear price, but the good they did was still far out of proportion to the sacrifice they made” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912910391982">Putney 2003</xref>, xi)? It’s not as if animals can share in the fruits of victory. It’s not as if animal survivors can appreciate the tribute they receive. It’s not as if bereaved “parents” can take solace in seeing their offspring’s names inscribed in stone for all eternity. It’s not as if future generations of animals can be inspired to match the exploits of their forebears. Animals don’t visit sacred public spaces. Ordinarily, they’re not even allowed to traverse memorial grounds. Memorials to animals necessarily raise questions about their reason for being. If anything, the very reasons given for honoring animals perform double duty: they simultaneously dishonor those bestowing it. It’s not just that animals are subjected to the known horrors of war, but that war turns inward on and against animals themselves. War consumes everything in its path, including the very beings that make that consumption possible. Think of war as cannibalization, a kind of killing field for animals (a theme I elaborate below). Still, animal memorials have come to form a valued part of the patriotic memorial complex. As such, they purport to embody the love that humans and animals share, a love reaching its perfection in wartime. We salute animals and, given the place that animals, perhaps especially dogs, occupy in the lives of human beings, they in turn salute us. It’s a mutual admiration and affection society. Yet animal memorials also confirm, solidify, and expand patriotism’s perverse addiction to death. Patriotism feeds on sacrifice, which leads to debt that requires more sacrifice, to be redeemed by taking on additional debt, that is, death. With animal memorials, a new manifestation of sacrifice and a new class of “heroes” enter the patriotic universe. Death thus resupplied, these memorials suggest that patriotism is hostile to life itself. They reveal that patriotism, ultimately, respects no boundaries. Insofar as sacrifice, in particular the sacrifice of what is most precious, signals love of country, and insofar as such sacrifice names the condition of possibility of social and political life, a life designed for human beings, animal sacrifice belies the very notion of limits. Love enhances itself the greater the substance of sacrifice. Love and cost are codependents. As cost rises, it proves love’s conviction, which in turn, makes what is most precious expendable. Patriotism, then, exalts what ought to be unthinkable. Animal memorials embody, while obscuring, practices worthy of disbelief and horror rather than celebration and respect. The love of country that informs animal memorialization, however, seems blind to its own narcissistic, life-denying character.</p>

<title>Take My Life, Please</title>
<p>Narrative sameness informs animal war stories, which differ in one crucial respect from stories about two-legged soldiers. Animals that execute the everyday tasks assigned to them become the subjects of heroization. Dogs, for example, are deployed in war for one reason: to save human lives. Anything they do that can be linked to such a result brings patriotic encomiums, including to the owners who volunteer them. Performance proves beyond doubt (if doubt there were) that dogs are brave, loyal, and steadfast. The rigorous training forcibly imposed, with absolute obedience required for service, fades from view, even if success must be attained through the select application of pain. Likewise, if dogs cannot be trained, whether because of physical impairment, disease, or so-called character defect, they may be destroyed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912910391982">Lemish 2008</xref>, 45).</p>
<p>What is it that dogs do? They assume some of the most dangerous assignments military forces prefer to spare human beings. Taking point on patrol, especially in jungle settings, is one of the riskiest combat assignments along with landmine and booby trap detection. It exposes dogs to initial enemy fire. Military foes soon adapt to the roles dogs play and begin to target them individually, even, in the case of Vietnam, offering bounties for their execution, thereby effectively doubling the danger to which they were exposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912910391982">Lemish 2008</xref>, 242). Regardless, dogs are considered successful to the extent that they “alert” to enemy forces or draw fire and prevent the loss of American lives. Dog casualties are irrelevant; human lives saved alone matter.</p>
<p>The United States military supposedly uses dogs for defensive rather than offensive purposes (a hard distinction to make), the latter leading to cruel and excessive treatment. Yet, the United States routinely experiments to determine the capabilities of dogs (and other species). During World War II, for example, the army attempted to train dogs to destroy enemy pillboxes. The effort was ultimately abandoned, but not because of any moral concern. It was abandoned because the suicide mission proved unsuccessful. The chaos and wreckage of the battlefield rendered dogs unreliable, even dangerous to those on whose behalf they were directed to kill. Dogs might return to their handlers just as the explosives they carried were about to detonate. In short, the United States military has operated on the assumption that if dogs can perform a task, especially one considered highly dangerous or risky, they will perform it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912910391982">Lemish 2008</xref>, 53–59, 88–90).</p>
<p>Training of military working dogs starts when they are young—between six months and two years of age. These are the most malleable years, though some may start as young as five days old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912910391982">Lemish 2008</xref>, 216). This means that dogs, if we compare them to humans, are taken as “infants” or “children.” The regimen forced on them is difficult. They must not only learn to obey commands without hesitation; they must also be able to function under circumstances that would ordinarily provoke paralysis or flight. It is critical, therefore, to expose and normalize dogs to battle-like conditions. Subjection up close and personal to the repetitive sound of gunfire as well as the loud, concussive experience of bombardment, which shock and horrify many dogs, form key components of training. Unlike human soldiers, however, dogs do not understand the difference between appearance and reality. The terror inflicted on them cannot be dismissed or rationalized as a simulation. The very training that dogs suffer thus anticipates the so-called real thing more closely than their handlers apparently realize. Because the military ultimately considers dogs to be equipment no different than a machine, this treatment, “bordering on the inhumane,” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912910391982">Putney 2003</xref>, 42) does not necessarily pose ethical problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912910391982">Lemish 2008</xref>, 142; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912910391982">Putney 2003</xref>, 25, 29, 42).</p>
<p>Treating dogs as equipment, the flip side of love, reached its grisly logical conclusion during the Vietnam War. Of the roughly 5,000 military working dogs employed, a little more than 200 returned to the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1065912910391982">O’Donnell 2001</xref>). Combat deaths aside, thousands of survivors were left behind with the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. Most were euthanized. None returned to civilian life, as it were. Reintegration was deemed too difficult, meaning too expensive, thus making it logistically and fiscally convenient to continue to treat dogs as a species of military property despite war’s end, to be disposed of in whatever manner worked best, that is, posed the fewest problems.</p>
<p>The United States War Dog Association, an advocacy group launched by current and former handlers dedicated to spreading the gospel about military working dogs and securing proper recognition and memorialization, enacts the performative contradiction bedeviling animal lovers and animals in war. With love, it too considers dogs to be property. On the Association’s Website, you find its K-9 Wall of Honor, a tribute which lists dozens of dogs killed in action and describes the circumstances, invariably heroic, of their deaths. The Wall of Honor also includes the so-called K-9 promise. This declaration involves people who love dogs most, speaking on their behalf. Because animals cannot speak for themselves, you would think the association would deliver a skilled impersonation. You find the following declaration: “My eyes are your eyes to watch and protect you and yours. My ears are your ears to hear and detect evil minds in the dark. My nose is your nose to scent the invader of your domain. And, so you may live, my life is also yours.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1065912910391982">2</xref></sup> The dog, as it were, dissects and offers itself piece by piece to humans to use as they see fit, in short, to continue running their vast war machine. Despite the rhetoric of equality the military circulates about dogs as fellow soldiers, the possibility that dogs “in” the military might have needs or wants or interests of their own, is precluded. Any of these canine gifts, once taken, means the effective end of the dog’s life. The pledge amounts to the dog surrendering its own life and welcoming, even inviting, its own death. For the dog soldier, the injunction, “I was only following orders,” thus rendering it the mere extension of another’s will, represents war’s perfection rather than its perversion. Is it any wonder that dogs were made complicit in the torture of enemy prisoners, whether in Vietnam or Iraq? The degradation of another species takes whatever form necessary.</p>

<title>Do We Love Our Dogs?</title>
<p>One might think that the use of animals in war, especially dogs, would pose serious ethical problems for the families who donate, the experts who breed and train, and the people who venerate them. One would be wrong. As nationally renowned dog breeder and self-styled patriot Arlene Erlanger put it after the United States entered World War II, “the dog world must play its part in this thing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912910391982">Lemish 2008</xref>, 36). The imperative reveals patriotism’s power to fabricate and then order the world, converting it into standing reserve. No thing escapes its optic. Other so-called animal worlds may be called into being, too, if necessary. The imperative also suggests not just a free-floating resentment about assuming the burdens of citizenship during wartime, it suggests that death’s creative reach can be extended in new, unexpected ways to bind the political order. To say that the dog world, given life as such for lethal purposes, must do its part is to say that dogs, too, must sacrifice and die. Erlanger referred vaguely to “what the war means to dogs,” which intimates new depths to patriotism’s narcissism and sense of enmity. They, too, have a stake in the fighting. Liberty is at issue for us; perhaps the very idea of a family pet is at risk for them, thanks to our common enemy. In short, dogs are threatened, they can be enlisted, they can be rendered part of us. If the objection were made that dogs are forced to serve in wars for which they are not responsible, a response is ready—this makes dogs no different than the average soldier, who is entitled to no such concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912910391982">Lemish 2008</xref>, x–xi). Besides, in the patriotic world, we show the rightness of our cause and the value of what we die for by sacrificing what is most precious to us, sacrificing it unbidden. Love of country leads to instrumentalization.</p>
<p>To appreciate the successful military use of animals, especially dogs, and its subsequent public affirmation through memorialization, I turn to Kennan Ferguson’s essay on dogs and love. It illuminates the love people feel for dogs (and by extension other animals), which scrambles the traditional hierarchy governing human–animal relations. People often bestow not just special privileges but unique status on pets. When making fundamental ethical decisions, then, how is it that people routinely prioritize dogs over human beings? Doesn’t this ranking represent a betrayal of humanity? Doesn’t this, in turn, pose a problem for democratic citizenship and its presumptions of equality and solidarity? How can people choose dogs (or other animals) over their fellow human beings, their fellow citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912910391982">Ferguson 2004</xref>)?</p>
<p>People love dogs, but they love them individually and not generally. Specificity matters. People would opt to save their fellow human beings, generally speaking, rather than dogs, generally speaking. Yet, people’s love of their own dogs is different and undoes quotidian ethical comportments. People and dogs satisfy mutual needs in one another, but “the emotional attachment is not reducible to those needs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912910391982">Ferguson 2004</xref>, 375). Owners would not hesitate to save their pet’s life by paying for an expensive operation, even if such money could be used to save the lives of other (abstract) human beings. Abstract considerations cannot compete with the specificity of dog love.</p>
<p>Dogs figure as more than objects of care and concern. They can make us better—more fully human. Loving dogs, according to popular belief, indicates “a caring, kind, humane soul.” People attain virtue as they transcend narrow self-interest and act on behalf of those “beasts [that] cannot even speak.” As people care for dogs, they cultivate skills and aptitudes that redound to human relationships—parent–child, for one. Dogs have also served as role models, “virtuous actors rather than insensate embodiments of abstract virtues,” for human beings to emulate. They have even been understood to be “morally superior to human beings,” in part because they were naturally or inherently good and “did not need to remind [themselves] to be loyal and courageous, as did a man.” Of course, we were responsible for this moral triumph, for human beings domesticated dogs and thereby expunged their ferocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912910391982">Ferguson 2004</xref>, 376–77).</p>
<p>The very love of dogs (or other animals) enabling humans to take decisive action on their behalf and make sacrifices for them governs the sacrifice that people make of these self-same dogs (or other animals) in wartime. As Ferguson notes, “the ideal canine is one with the human ideals of compassion, loyalty, and bravery.” These are its “essential qualities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912910391982">Ferguson 2004</xref>, 376). Not surprisingly, then, dog owners in the United States, Great Britain, and elsewhere have rushed to volunteer their pets for war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912910391982">Cooper 2002</xref>, 75; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912910391982">Lemish 2008</xref>, 47). Patriotism thereby reinstates the human/animal boundary transcended by pet love, even as it seems to erase it. People love their dogs. They also love their countries. And while country may be an abstraction, war makes it real. These loves prove to be compatible: if we all must make sacrifices in war, including the people we love, why not our dogs, too? The specificity that furnished dogs (and other pets) with a privileged status renders them ideal for service with the advent of war and patriotism’s demands for sacrifice. We want those we love to serve, we want to be proud of them, and we want them to share our love of country. Love unites us. Patriotism, then, re-covers love of dogs (or horses or pigeons).</p>
<p>Ferguson is surely right, “even if one strongly believes that humans are more important to protect than are dogs, one may not necessarily act that way” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912910391982">Ferguson 2004</xref>, 380, 384). Nevertheless, practices of patriotism work to reverse the reversal. Vast numbers of pets fail to return home war after war, but owners do not fail to volunteer them with every repetition. Jilly Cooper suspects that if people knew what kind of training their dogs must endure, they might change their minds—patriotism or not. But given that people equate war with death and assume or at least fear their dear pets may not return, the attribution of a protective impulse to pet owners, if fully informed, seems unwarranted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912910391982">Cooper 2002</xref>, 75). Moreover, dog owners prepared the ground for their own civic sacrifices. With the advent of pet cemeteries and “ceremoniously burying and memorializing dogs,” people were predisposed to mourn the loss of their beloveds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912910391982">Ferguson 2004</xref>, 375). Dying for country, entailing a transition from pet to soldier, would only double the love (and pride and mourning).</p>

<title>Build It and They Will Come?</title>
<p>On November 24, 2004, London unveiled the Animals in War Memorial. The monument covers not just the twentieth century and its gruesome conflicts but warfare throughout history. The use of animals to fight wars did not originate in the modern age, though it may have been pushed to its logical destructive extreme, thanks to technological prowess, in the 1900s. In World War I, some eight million horses perished. The staggering figure stems largely from the logistical reality that war would have been impossible to wage without them. Given the state of European battlefields, which finally rendered trucks inoperative, horses (and mules and donkeys) became the condition of the possibility of war. It did not matter how many died; they enabled war to continue. It would have ground to a halt in their absence, which was unthinkable. Animals in War, then, would seem to have much memorial work to do.</p>
<p>At first glance, the Animals in War Memorial displays a feel for its own ambiguity. Two inscriptions confront the visitor on a large wall that contains a narrow passageway at its center. One inscription salutes, “all the animals that served and died alongside British and Allied forces in wars and campaigns throughout time.” The other states, “They had no choice.” Reminiscent of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall in Washington, D.C., it seems to understand the dilemmatic character of its memorial undertaking. Nevertheless, the four monumental figures represented—two cargo-bearing mules enacting the burdens of war on the lower side of the wall, a frolicking horse and dog representing “hope for the future” on the higher side of the wall, betray little, if anything, of war’s actual experiences. Thematically, the mules are supposed to be hard at work, examples of sacrifice in action, but the sculptures don’t register viscerally. Death has no architectural presence in what is a conservative memorial form. It fails to move the visitor. Aesthetically, the Animals in War Memorial resembles Frederick Hart’s <italic>The Three Soldiers</italic> at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial complex in Washington, D.C., a banal representational sculpture designed to convey the youth, innocence, and vulnerability of men at war, ostensibly honoring “sacrifice” while ignoring the war’s imperial, arguably genocidal, certainly self-destructive character.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1065912910391982">3</xref></sup> Likewise, the recognition of animals on offer in London seems minor and minimal, corresponding to the supporting role that animals, by definition, play in war. They served, as it were, and died, yes, but their suffering could not compare to what human beings endured. They may have had no choice, but consent is irrelevant regarding animals. The four-word inscription suggests resignation, perhaps something of a lament rather than a criticism or rebuke. War deals in necessities, after all. We had no choice either. Thus, an inscription on the far side of the wall opposite the mules informs the reader: “many and various animals were <italic>employed</italic> . . . and as a result <italic>millions died</italic> from the pigeon to the elephant. They all played a vital role in every region of the world <italic>in the cause of human freedom</italic>. Their contribution must never be forgotten.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1065912910391982">4</xref></sup> The role they played in the cause they served means mass carnage can be readily incorporated into the traditional patriotic narrative that countries tell—must tell—of themselves. Note the passive, understated formulations. Animals were employed. Millions died. Love of country perdures insofar as mere events cannot alter or affect the ideal to which love gives expression.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1065912910391982">5</xref></sup> Nevertheless, what do the memorial inscriptions reveal without formally disclosing? More broadly, what does the mnemonic imperative to keep mass death, however sanitized, alive in perpetuity signify?</p>
<p>Washington’s World War II Memorial likewise proclaims the duty of eternal recollection, driven by a notion of debt. Balancing civic accounts funds the dynamic of endless sacrifice. Pericles established the official terms of payment 2,500 years ago in his funeral oration: each generation must enhance the legacy bequeathed to it (at great cost) and surpass the achievements of its forebears. Once done, the old debt can be considered paid. New debt, however, has been generated in the process, requiring new sacrifice, leading to new debt, and so forth. Life and death live on generation after generation in a mutually supportive circle.</p>
<p>To animals in war, however, debt’s unpayability works differently; they do not and cannot participate in, let alone benefit from, war’s outcome or aftermath. They have no legacy to enhance. Wars to make the world safe for freedom or democracy provide no returns, nor could they, to animals. It’s not so much that debt is unpayable to animals (so-called payments could be made in perpetuity). It’s that the very notion of debt, implying a reciprocal relationship of some kind, denies what was done to them. Animals didn’t just die from employment, as the memorial suggests; they were subject to an exterminatory logic to enable, to facilitate, to wage war—including against them.</p>
<p>Again, to appreciate the successful military use of animals, it might prove illuminating to consider how the treatment of animals in war differs from the treatment of animals in other domains. It’s true, for example, that humans breed animals at an industrial scale to feed on them at will. Such creation and reproduction of life results in countless deaths, yet it still serves life and perpetuates it. The idea is to always create new and more life; thus, life is to be preserved. Death must be controlled and contained. When it comes to war and its patriotic celebration, however, animals fare differently. War, too, produces countless deaths, but if every member of another species were eradicated in the course of a hard-won victory, it would fall within the parameters of patriotic logic, not run contrary to it. Death may be not just final but total, suggesting hostility to life in its plurality. What’s one fewer species, or less, in the cause of human freedom?</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Animals in War Memorial not only confirms and solidifies patriotism’s death logic but also enhances and extends it. Think memorial art as colonization. The playful horse and adorable dog toward which the mules walk suggest that animal sacrifice enabled a better world, including for animals themselves, thus justifying the toll exacted. Death turns out to be good for all creatures, and patriotism celebrates it.</p>
<p>The sleight of hand perpetrated by the Animals in War Memorial is masterful. Compare it, first, to the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London, an “empty tomb” built to salute World War I dead. Deceptively simple in design, the Cenotaph models rather than denies the traumas of war, including the doubtful character of victory. Geography forces it into the city’s daily life. Located in the middle of traffic at the heart of national government, it becomes that which cannot be circumvented. Jenny Edkins argues, “[The Cenotaph] attempts no narrative or interpretation. It marks something that is shared yet inexpressible in more explicit terms. What is shared, we might say, is the inexpressibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912910391982">Edkins 2003</xref>, 64). Compare it, next, to the civil rights memorials at Kelly Ingram Park in Birmingham, Alabama. Unlike James Drake’s <italic>Police and Dog Attack</italic> or Ronald S. McDowell’s <italic>The Salute to the Foot Soldiers</italic>, both of which depict police attack dogs to induce in visitors an experience resonant of the one produced in citizens subjected to state violence, the Animals in War Memorial effectively erases what it purports to embody. With memorial visitors reduced to mere spectators, it offers a scene of mules at work that could be located almost anywhere, anytime, anyplace. To bring war alive, to materialize its horrors, to render animal “contributions” real, war’s destructive impact on the landscape and on the animals needs to be imparted. Why not mules drowning in craters of mud and water? Why not horses dismembered, remnants of body parts strewn about? Why not dog corpses piled on top of dog corpses? Or, more subtly, why not present a mélange of animals on one side of the wall and leave the other side vacant, suggesting that animals enter the war machine but do not exit it? Wouldn’t this facilitate remembrance? Here, at this site, these questions are misplaced. the Animals in War Memorial is a patriotic memorial. If it were a memorial to animals in war, it might well call its very reason for being into question, moving from tribute to counter-monument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1065912910391982">Young 1993</xref>). Rather, mimicking the Japanese-American Memorial to Patriotism During World War II in Washington, D.C., which ostensibly represents America’s apology for incarcerating its own citizens after Pearl Harbor but instead salutes the country making the apology for in fact making it, the Animals in War Memorial affirms the goodness of a country that publicly addresses the cost of war—a candor which serves to enhance national greatness.</p>

<title>Animal Memorialization: A (Brief) Genealogy</title>
<p>The Animals in War Memorial forms part of a transnational trend. Equally troubling are the two identical war dog memorials built at March Air Field Museum, March Air Force Base in Riverside, California, and at Sacrifice Field, National Infantry Museum in Fort Benning, Georgia. The monument showcases a soldier, standing, peering into the distance. A German shepherd, leashed, sits next to him. Both are alert, especially the dog, but not quite tense. They are ready for action, on call for country. They ooze power, confidence, security, and strength. At the dedication ceremony in Riverside, California Associate Supreme Court Justice Ming Chin, a decorated Vietnam officer, welcomed the war dogs home, repatriated at last—like their human comrades were “returned” through the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall. Betrayed by the country they served, the Vietnam dogs were left behind at war’s close, their fate mimicking the POWs and MIAs allegedly abandoned. Chin reminds the audience that dogs have feelings, too. They feel, they hurt, they suffer, but most important of all, they save human lives. Thus dogs are elevated-only to be reduced. As the ceremony concludes, hundreds of Vietnam veterans walk by the statue, pause, and pet the dog as if it were real, alive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1065912910391982">6</xref></sup> But only they are alive.</p>
<p>The growing effort to pay tribute to animals in war raises questions that call the enterprise into question. How is it that millions have died? What were the circumstances of death? What, if anything, do the circumstances have in common? What does the commonality reveal about not just the character of warfare but also the moral and political creature who, alone in nature, wages war against itself? Does the patriotic scheme of animal memorialization enable the cruelties inflicted on animals to be repeated ad infinitum? Once a debt is paid, must not more debt be assumed? Given patriotism’s inveterate borrowing practices, does the very idea of a healthy or rational form of patriotism, much cherished on the liberal and democratic left, suffer, deservedly, an irrecoverable blow? Ironically, the evidence that supports such a possibility comes from self-styled animal lovers themselves. Those who bear witness to or document so-called animal service provide damning substantiation against the patriotic apparatus feeding on it.</p>
<p>The American and British militaries, by no means unique, presume that with war’s advent, the animal world is available for use as they see fit. Animals are assigned routinely to a number of tasks. Effectiveness is the only criterion. First among priorities: if animals can be used to save human life, they will be so used. The danger attending the assignment doesn’t matter. Nor does it matter if animals lose their lives in the process. How could it? The point of animal use is to do whatever it takes to protect and save human lives. The number of animals killed likewise makes no difference. As long as war goes on and animals can be used to “good” purpose, they will be so used. If this entails deploying animals without properly caring for them, which in turn can mean working them until expiration—that is, working them literally to death—they will be so worked. The logic is exterminatory. If every member of a species has to be sacrificed to win a war, winning trumps life, its very plurality.</p>
<p>Even ostensibly humanitarian organizations such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals contribute to the patriotic logic of total sacrifice. Starting with the Franco-Prussian War, the Royal Society’s advocacy for better care and treatment of animals exacerbated their exploitation. Those wounded could be treated and returned to service—whether they were fully healed or capable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912910391982">Cooper 2002</xref>, 32, 48–49, 62). Better to extract as much labor as is possible from beasts of burden than let them die and get nothing. After all, it was not necessarily certain if more animals would (soon) be forthcoming and “there was a war to be won,” which meant fueling and refueling the military machine.</p>
<p>This logic takes remarkable turns as it unfolds. In World War I, for example, pigeons were used extensively for communication (as were dogs). It’s not just that “enlistment” subjected pigeons to a life likely to be nasty, brutish, and short; it’s not just that it subjected them to specific countermeasures that escalated their risk (the Germans targeted them with hawks and falcons, thus setting nature at war with itself, as well as machine gun fire); it’s that their utter disposability subjected them to eradication, by any means necessary, by the very people already exploiting them and supposedly recognizing their value. One British commander, rather than let 2,500 pigeons fall under enemy control, set them on fire and burned them to death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912910391982">Cooper 2002</xref>, 103). In east Africa, from 1916 to 1917, more than 10,000 donkeys and horses died from exposure to tsetse flies. Once the first contingent expired, a second shipment was brought in, despite the known consequences. The temporary cure, arsenic, extended their miserable lives a few weeks before they would drop dead in their tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912910391982">Cooper 2002</xref>, 199–200). In World War II, the Soviets trained dogs to run—with explosives strapped to their backs—beneath tanks. Poland was emptied of dogs (it was rumored) for these one-way missions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912910391982">Cooper 2002</xref>, 95). The British needed mules for transport in Burma, where they were deemed uniquely suited to local conditions. Yet, they had a tendency to bray, which would place human lives in danger. The military thus severed the vocal cords of some 5,500 mules before shipping them overseas. Also in Burma, elephants were used extensively to build bridges and roads. However, if the British couldn’t use them, no one could. The Royal Air Force targeted elephants employed by the Japanese. When circumstances became dire, again in World War I, the British took transport horses (millions killed) and slaughtered them for food and comfort (mattresses). This reduced the subordinate standing from which they already suffered. It’s not just, then, that horses would be killed as war exploded around them; they were literally deconstructed and converted into many usable pieces and edible parts. At conflict’s end, the War Office insisted on some kind of return on its investment and declared the remaining horses unfit for duty so they could be sold to slaughterhouses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912910391982">Cooper 2002</xref>, 139, 154, 36, 62–63, 65). The French required no such rationale, let alone return on investment; they destroyed 15,000 dogs at war’s end (a policy duplicated by the other combatants; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912910391982">Lemish 2008</xref>, 29). Even mascots, animals exempted from combat duty and designed to provide emotional comfort, could find themselves converted to food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912910391982">Cooper 2002</xref>, 186). Still, in World War I, the British, having exhausted their supply of camels, appropriated 3,000 cow camels, most of them pregnant. They were forced to give birth along the way. This doubled the risk to the life of camels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912910391982">Cooper 2002</xref>, 123). At one moment, it makes good logistical sense to slaughter those you claim, at another moment, to be serving alongside you.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1065912910391982">7</xref></sup> Jilly Cooper inadvertently expresses the ethos of exploitation: “a dead mule was only a disaster if he floated out to sea with his pack saddle on” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912910391982">Cooper 2002</xref>, 137). Equally deplored: disabling a dog to exempt it from combat operations, which happened, if infrequently, in Vietnam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912910391982">Lemish 2008</xref>, 224–25).</p>
<p>The animal’s useful military-patriotic life does not end with death. In Washington’s National Museum of American History, you can find a stuffed dog and pigeon, both considered heroes, from World War I. These animals, which would have been awarded purple hearts if human, saved lives under fire, with Cher Ami, the pigeon, losing a leg in the process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1065912910391982">8</xref></sup> (Imagine finding Sergeant Alvin York, internationally acclaimed, medal-winning World War I soldier, in the museum.) It’s as if placing the animals on display proves that nature, perhaps the world itself, was on our side. Patriotism’s life-denying dream, however, needs to be contested.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1065912910391982">
<title>Patriotism and the Question of Life Itself</title>
<p>What does it mean to claim that patriotism displays hostility to life itself? The claim relates both to the logic of sacrifice at the heart of patriotism and the nature of patriotic celebration accompanying it. More than death and more than the potential reduction of plurality are involved, though death remains central. Patriotism demands not only the giving and taking of life as the test of love of country but also, as a condition of possibility, life’s conformity to its dictates.</p>
<p>Here life cannot be reduced to one aspect or dimension that, in turn, might provide a definition. Nietzsche, however, posits resistance as a constitutive element of life— as opposed to creation, unity, or harmonization. This projection corresponds to a conception of life as will to power. Insofar as the human animal requires social form to complete it, yet was not designed to receive any one form in particular, power necessarily performs the work of completion—hence, the component of resistance. Will to power, then, simultaneously engenders opposition to its very exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1065912910391982">Nietzsche, 1968a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912910391982">1968b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912910391982">Connolly 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>The Nietzschean projection need not be confined to the human animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1065912910391982">Calarco 2008</xref>). Animal training proceeds on the assumption that nature can be mastered and made to specifications, given either human being’s creative power or nature’s susceptibility to fashioning (or both). Jilly Cooper’s <italic>Animals in War</italic> records the “heroic” and “sacrificial” deeds of various species of animals conscripted and trained for military service. It also, if inadvertently, documents the active resistance of animals to the projects of their human overlords and the latter’s response to that resistance.</p>
<p>Mules seem particularly predisposed to balk at military work, though Cooper converts resistance into personality, thereby concealing and co-opting it. Mules thus become “mischievous,” “tricky customers,” and “characters” who do not “suffer fools gladly.” According to Cooper, this means that mules must be handled with particular care, manipulated with the right touch, for “like many husbands, in fact, you cannot coerce the mule, but he will do anything if he thinks it’s his idea in the first place.” The violence mules direct against their human handlers can thus be redescribed and effectively negated, a sign not of resistance or refusal at the demands that compulsory service entails but of the incompetence of the trainer or driver. It’s as if the use of mules would be free of incident if only all humans actually knew, as they should, what they were doing. Knowledge can overcome, or better, preempt any infelicity. Yet, Cooper’s narrative doesn’t quite convince: “But as [one] General Daunt points out . . . it is a case of one bad apple. Of the 200 mules [he] supervised [in World War I], only one was really dangerous; and he was a killer. If you took your eyes off him for a second, he had you in his teeth, shaking you like a terrier with a rat. There always had to be two men in the stable with him, one to groom, one to watch” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912910391982">Cooper 2002</xref>, 130, 134, 141, 142, 131, 130). One bad apple? Only one was really dangerous? But he was a killer? Insofar as mules do not cooperate as planned, Cooper either suggests it’s just something that happens or brings moral approbation to bear, thus indicating where responsibility for failure lies. Either way, bad apples are discarded to prevent infection from spreading. Even when complimenting mules, she salutes in to conceal the violence done to them. “Jimmy Gray,” for example, becomes a source of ironic amusement: a “character” that invariably performed well under fire. He would resent the act of transportation Monday morning at the start of the work week, but positively welcome it Friday night at week’s close. (Resentment aside, the mule wound up in the truck.) Here Cooper’s presentation of Jimmy resembles the average soldier who gripes and grumbles about his duty—who wouldn’t under the circumstances?—only to do it superbly with life at stake.</p>
<p>Jimmy and other animals embody Nietzsche’s ontological given resistance. No more so than humans, animals are not designed to receive, nor are they inherently susceptible to the form to be imposed on them. Referring to and ostensibly treating animals as if they were fellow soldiers cannot alter this actuality, though it may deny or obscure it. Violence, therefore, must be deployed to accomplish the training to which they are subjected. Tellingly, it would not occur to Cooper that animals might resist the identity selected for them as an affirmation or expression of life. Such recognition would differ from Cooper’s appreciation of the difficulty of training animals, which often fails. Failure is attributable not to any constitutive human or animal characteristic but to this or that contingent aspect of training or perhaps some temporary human limitation (regarding expert knowledge, for example).</p>
<p>Cooper’s tales of mules shipped to Burma also reveal animal dispositions. To start, mules would try to break free of their restraints in airplanes transporting them overseas and would be shot if they kicked at the plane, potentially placing it in danger. Difficulties did not end with arrival. Mules tend to bray (to communicate) and this habit could place soldiers in danger by advertising their very existence and position to the enemy (which tended not to use mules). Because silence keyed effective use of mules, they were silenced, their vocal cords cut. The medical arts, designed to heal, to protect and save lives, were deployed to make its sacrifice possible. Rather than heed, let alone respect, animal recalcitrance, we effectively disabled one of the principal means through which anger and annoyance, that is, resistance manifest. If one started, the rest would follow suit (more bad apples). It’s not enough that resistance be overcome by training, but the very possibility of resistance must be subverted as well, in this case rendered mute. While most mules apparently adapted to mutilation, many did not. They would bite, kick more, and try to dislodge their cargo. They needed to be handled with additional care.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1065912910391982">9</xref></sup> These signs of resistance and resentment were otherwise ignored. The military’s and Cooper’s sole concern was that following surgery, it was possible to return the mules to work quickly.</p>
<p>Dogs, too, resist human manufacture, resulting in their destruction. Dogs that defy human mastery become dangerous by definition. Subsequent killing is blamed on the dog, of course, for being defective, that is, untrainable. If it can’t be trained, it loses the value it might have acquired through usability. Without value, its mere existence cannot be justified—anything but. Recall the queer formulation of Arlene Erlanger, one of America’s leading canine trainers. The very formulation, “the dog world must do its part,” at once signals and refuses both the independence and alterity of dogs. The presumption driving the moral imperative reflects and enacts dogs’ subordinate status, thereby obscuring the violent appropriation at work. Morality conceals immorality. War means the lives of dogs cannot be allowed to continue as before, as if nothing is happening—even though nothing is happening as far as they are concerned. They can’t be allowed to be just dogs, that is, dogs. Despite domestication, dogs compose a separate and distinct “universe,” contributing to the world’s diversity and plurality. (Even the best-trained pets resist domestication. It’s not just that dogs can turn on their owners in an instant, that millions of dogs bite people every year, resulting in euthanasia for thousands; think of the beloved family pet that sleeps on the forbidden couch or pries open the kitchen trash in search of hidden treasure as soon as it is alone.) These animal worlds have nothing to do with humankind’s geopolitical conflicts and crusades. Yet, this independence does not shield them from, or protect them against, human sovereignty and thus appropriation and deployment.</p>
<p>It’s as if Rousseau’s characterization of the alleged ontological difference between humans and animals informed Cooper’s benign narrative. While humans find themselves endowed, thanks to the author of things, with the nearly unlimited faculty of perfectibility, animals find themselves stuck in an eternal sameness. Rousseau insists that “an animal is at the end of a few months what it will be all its life; and its species is at the end of a thousand years what it was the first year of that thousand” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912910391982">Rousseau 1964</xref>, 114–15). It does not occur to Cooper that an animal might become more than it is. This prejudice, given or nurtured, makes exploitation easier. Cooper again provides critical evidence. In Burma during World War II, elephants built bridges, roads, and ships, and they also hauled trees to satisfy England’s insatiable demand for lumber. Elephants would lift huge logs ten feet high for transport, an exercise placing their drivers in danger. This relationship was not lost on one elephant. After nearly losing control of a log, it “pondered for a minute. Then it searched round for and found a stout stick and wedged it vertically between one of his tusks and his trunk, so the log was checked if it rolled backwards. Thus assured of his driver’s safety, it carried on picking up logs and lifting them onto the platform as easily as a mobile crane” (Cooper 2000, 145).</p>
<p>Perhaps this kind of intelligence informs a story told by Cooper of elephant reaction to war. She recounts a famous Roman battle against the Syrians in 190 B.C.E. in which elephants stampeded the Syrians deploying them. Plutarch describes elephants spearing soldiers with tusks and pitching them in the air. For Cooper, this kind of episode indicates nothing more than animal contingency. Yet, life does not just convert to standing reserve. Reflexive refusal to be appropriated, possessed, organized, put to use—as opposed to living life according to its own terms or dictates—suggests resistance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, military use of animals operates on the assumption that animals can be trained to perform the tasks assigned them. Animals consist of matter (more or less) ready to receive the form to be impressed on it. Animals “failing” to meet established specifications become deviations, thus exposing them to additional measures, including destruction. If they refuse to be (made) useful, they can lose what little, if any, position they might have enjoyed. An ethic rooted in mastery cannot see that animal recalcitrance, let alone resistance, suggests creatures that are more, other, or greater than humans can imagine. The autonomy of animal life, informed by a constitutive resistance, renders its sacrifice in war and subsequent patriotic appropriation doubly problematic. We not only take life, we crush resistance to that taking—that is, life itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1065912910391982">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Re-covering Sacrifice</title>
<p>Given an underlying assumption of disposability, animal casualties achieve such a scale that they threaten to become indefensible and unthinkable, even for those advocating their use. As Cooper’s <italic>Animals in War</italic> indicates, peoples seek to justify or redeem the slaughter to which they give sanction, an alchemical process at which patriotism excels. One strategy centers on recovering the notion of choice. As mentioned above, animals undergo brutal, oftentimes sadistic training to be able to perform in wartime conditions. Unaccustomed to machine gun, mortar, or artillery fire, they must be exposed, repeatedly, to each of them. Food is the principal weapon of choice in training. Hunger conquers all, including fear—if you wait long enough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912910391982">Cooper 2002</xref>, 75-76). Pain is prohibited, scorned—unless no other method proves effective, that is. Despite the requirements and goals of training, experts insist that an animal such as a dog can’t be made to do whatever you like.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1065912910391982">11</xref></sup> Dogs, the story goes, have a (kind of) will of their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912910391982">Lemish 2008</xref>, 141). In the end, what they are made to do, which puts them in harm’s way and generates countless casualties, is nothing other than what they (would) want to do for us anyway. Cooper, speaking of the dog per se, said “he acted out of love, not because he was made to” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912910391982">Cooper 2002</xref>, 73).</p>
<p>Richard Ben Cramer prefers a more subtle approach. Following Pearl Harbor, he writes, “canine combatants were recruited just as men were. But no draft was required.” A few owners may have been unloading unwanted pets, “but most were patriots who sent a dog off to war just as they would a son.” Here dogs bask in human equivalence and absorb the patriotic glow of their owner-parents, as if to suggest that no draft was needed for dogs, because dogs, who act out of love, were ready and waiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1065912910391982">Cramer 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In this context, Cooper writes of one of war’s “redeeming” features: the mutual devotion that develops between human and animal. Humans experience animals as extensions of themselves. Animals reciprocate the feeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912910391982">Cooper 2002</xref>, 47). Hence the story of the dog left behind as his master ships off to France, who (somehow) tracks him down overseas. This testifies to the unique bond joining humans and animals. The dog could only be at home by his master’s side. It might look like we exploit them, but they want to serve us and because they do, service ennobles both them and us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912910391982">Cooper 2002</xref>, 192). The sense of home and family, which unites human and animal, makes it possible to argue that in war, the dog world must do its part. We’re in it together. It’s a seamless transition for dogs to provide on the battlefield the love and devotion they provide at home. These dispositions must be hardened, sharpened, honed; then they can be put to the test. Just as a citizen’s love of country can be truly tested only in war, transmogrifying citizen into patriot, a dog’s love can be enhanced, exalted, and proved through a conflict about which it can know nothing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1065912910391982">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Celebrants of animals in war recount, ad nauseam, stories of what animals have done to save human lives for a reason. The feats so astound they must point to something deeper, a bond or connection suggesting animals had no choice but to act as <italic>they</italic> did. This is what <italic>they</italic> had to do. Animals can’t just be responding to the training they have received. Training alone would not enable them to endure and overcome the pain and agony they suffer. Consider Satan, a half-breed Greyhound working for the French in World War I. With one corner of Verdun hanging in the balance and a French position about to buckle, a dog races to deliver news. Shot hundreds of yards from the French lines, his master stands up in full view of the enemy and yells, “Courage, Satan, my friend. Come for France.” The handler is killed, but Satan rises from the dead and returns to the lines with information that help would be forthcoming. Because Satan also carried pigeons on his back, the beleaguered French were able to communicate the position of German batteries targeting them—and target them in return. A piece of Verdun was saved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912910391982">Cooper 2002</xref>, 79; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912910391982">Lemish 2008</xref>, 19-20). Or consider Winkie, the damaged pigeon that flew 129 miles from the North Sea to Scotland triggering the rescue of an otherwise doomed World War II bomber crew.

<title>Patriomorphism</title>
<p>The British decorate animals. The Dickin Medal, named after the founder of the People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals, Maria Dickin, functions as the animal version of the Victoria Cross.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1065912910391982">13</xref></sup> Animals receive plaudits for bravery, courage, and devotion to duty. The Medal reads, “For Gallantry, We also Serve,” suggesting patriotic oneness between human and animal. World War II saw 49 medals awarded. For those who insist that tribute must be paid to animals necessarily anthropomorphize them, building public monuments and memorials to them represents the culmination of this process. It doesn’t seem to matter that animals do not and cannot <italic>know</italic> they acted heroically. Given limited cognitive abilities, they lack concepts such as country, war, death, freedom, courage, and sacrifice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1065912910391982">Horowitz 2009</xref>, 238–41). Nevertheless, we insist on projecting onto animals what we take to be our best patriotic qualities and pretend equivalence while we continue to treat them as disposable. Likewise, the Animals in War memorial projects patriotic meaning into the deeds they perform in war—not despite but precisely because of the ever-accumulating corpses. Otherwise mass death would overwhelm the notion of sacrifice and render it sheer slaughter.</p>
<p>What might this analysis reveal about patriotic memorialization? Animals, it might seem, can be expended in singular ways. They may be sent through a minefield to clear a path for troops, for example. Still, the use of animals informs the use of soldiers and vice versa. Patriotism overcomes any ethical ambiguity humans perform with their pets by reducing both to a common disposable denominator. Consider the decisive moment in World War II in the west. Allied forces breached Normandy and sacrificed thousands to do it. These lives were written off in advance, effectively reduced to cannon fodder (they had no choice, they had no chance). The invasion nevertheless defines the stuff of patriotic legend, a feat of organizational and physical derring-do. Concerns did arise, especially from the British, to minimize casualties. Morality may have imposed an implicit ceiling on the losses deemed acceptable. Prospects of success, of course, tend to govern notions of acceptability. Normandy might have been abandoned if projected casualties crossed a certain threshold, thereby placing the remainder of the war in jeopardy. Yet, what number of casualties, if any, would have been considered intolerable with success a possible outcome? Put differently, what number of casualties could not be retroactively memorialized as the heroic price paid to win a terrible—but also necessary, good, even just—war against an enemy that made surrender anathema? In Washington, the World War II Memorial’s Field of Stars, “mark[ing] the price of freedom,” salutes 400,000 war dead. How many more zeroes might American patriotism accommodate? Can’t patriotism—not just American—always accommodate additional zeroes?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1065912910391982">14</xref></sup></p>

<title>We Are the World</title>
<p>Insofar as a memorial to war animals can’t survive scrutiny as a tribute and it refuses to present itself as a warning or an admission of wrongdoing, the recent surge in memorialization refines patriotism’s traditional narcissism and symbiotic relationship to death. Nations salute themselves—for saluting—as they salute those who have no choice. The “loss” of animal life may be officially regretted at memorial sites, but it also testifies to the value of the cause served. The suffering inflicted, deliberately not incidentally, on animals must have—must be given—meaning. As people recognize and acknowledge the horrors of war, they become worthy of the sacrifices they impose on animals in furtherance of their great pursuits. Through remembrance, they redeem themselves.</p>
<p>Moreover, with patriotism facing a persistent shortage of human subjects and events to immortalize, countries have turned to the animal world for sustenance. Through memorialization, democracies would transform victims into heroes, abomination into virtue, gratuity into necessity, cruelty into camaraderie, exploitation into love, life into death—transformations that deflect questions of responsibility for wars waged not against enemies but against the very animal world they would ostensibly honor. It’s as if human and animal worlds become not just interconnected, not just interdependent, but one, thanks to a singular goal. Cooper salutes animals with words that indict the eulogisation and signal its emptiness: “Most animals who died have no memorial. Sick, wounded, starved, slaughtered, they have perished as though they had never been. The only way we can repay them is to treat them with more kindness in peace, and hope that in the future they are drawn as little as possible into our wars” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912910391982">Cooper 2002</xref>, 211). The only way? Hope? As little as possible? Cooper presumes and reaffirms the ethos toward animals—disposability—that not only defeats the very notion of repayment but also subverts the lament and hope expressed. If anything, debt on these terms can only be exacerbated.</p>
<p>Patriotism, however, lives on the perpetual issuance of debt and enforcement of sacrifice. Citizens, just like animals, have no choice but to “give,” or at least they are supposed to feel as if they have none. They answer the call—on patriotic cue. The use of animals, especially pets, captures the narcissism inherent to patriotism. Pets enjoy a distinct status—more precious, in a sense, because they are more vulnerable, more vulnerable because they are utterly dependent. They resemble small children, even infants. Yet they are sacrificed without question, without hesitation. Love of country makes it not only possible but also mandatory. There is no limit to what country can prescribe for animals, which mimics the unwritten ethos of sacrifice essential to patriotism. Magically, we disclose our goodness through death, through killing. Willing to sacrifice this much or to that extent, including that which is contrary to our own values, we must not only be doing what is good, we must be good ourselves. The greater the loss, then, the greater we make ourselves. This is patriotism’s logic, newly and neatly exemplified by animals in war, first the killing of them, then the tribute that cannot be one—not to animals, anyway.</p>
<p>In the ever-present aftermath of war, American, British, and Australian patriotisms, to name three, insist that animal contributions “never be forgotten.” What kind of memory, though, is to be cultivated at memorial sites dedicated to animals? Historical, rooted in appreciation of the key roles animals played in the last century’s so-called freedom wars? Military, rooted in the esoteric knowledge that animal talents are ignored at peril, where failure to use them aptly could mean defeat in a future war? Civic, rooted in the ethos that societies be prepared to mobilize from top to bottom to win wars, which includes placing everyone and everything on call, including animals, ready to “serve” at a moment’s notice? If the memory in question is historical, military, civic, or some combination, it’s a memory of entitlement. It means “we the people” presume the right to take life or let live. Thus, there is no tragic sensibility on display intimating that the “good” that war achieves can only be secured by also doing great and gross wrong, including to animals. The Animals in War Memorial, for one, would have to look and feel radically otherwise, eschewing a redemptive narrative ethic in its inscriptions and sculptures. As a patriotic site, this is precisely what it cannot do. To be able to sacrifice with license, people unthinkingly celebrate themselves for it—even and especially as they also deflect and disavow doing so. With animals, no scale of death is too great for the life and celebration of country. With animals, no manner of death is too horrific for the life and celebration of country. Animals, including humans, are disposable, as is the world that houses them. Patriotism’s perfection, then, might be the domestication of extinction, the ultimate addiction to death. What greater proof of love of country could there be than sacrificing everything for it?</p>

<p>The memorial’s official website informs the visitor, “British, Commonwealth, and Allied forces enlisted many millions of animals to serve and often die alongside their armies.” The verb “enlist” hovers between the transitive and intransitive, obscuring the command nature of the relationship between human and animals.
