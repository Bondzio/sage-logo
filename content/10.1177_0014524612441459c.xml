<p><bold>Bible Stories for Children?</bold></p>
<p>We all know the story. It was taught to us many times over in Sunday school and Religious Education class. It is a part of popular culture, a referent in common language that tells us quickly that this was an unusual turn of events but that the bad guy was killed by someone smaller and through skill and clever thinking. It fits in with the archetypal stories which are of perennial fascination in books and films and which are constantly served to us as entertainment: that might and posturing are not right and that the underdog will triumph in the end. The development of Bible materials for Sunday Schools and teaching in school curricular or for parents to teach their children has seen this well known story continue to be a story of good boy David against big bad man Goliath, an object lesson in how to stand up to a bully and win.</p>
<p>And yet the story is violent, frightening and full of problems for us. How on earth did a story as violent and terrifying as David and Goliath, as presented in I Samuel 17, come to be the most famous story of a battle in the Bible, and one of the most well known stories for children from the Old Testament? And what were they fighting about in the first place? These questions of justice and the use of warfare to tackle conflict are not what the story focuses on at all. On these things, which fill the law, prophets and Gospels, this text is quiet.</p>
<p>Somehow, through traditioning processes which pull scholars into fascinating possibilities for exegesis, the bickering of brothers, the brass necked stubborn curiosity of David and the massacre of the Philistines which ensued are glossed over in the popular retellings of the story and in the lines drawn by the lectionary. The story, which is one of blood, guts and gore, becomes a sanitized bedtime tale for the encouragement of all those who are meek and mild, where the moral of the story rests on it being fine to stand up to bullies by killing them with stones and beheading them with a sword and then chasing down and massacring their associates. Through these interpretative lenses and the happy weight of the Israelite text we are placed in a position of gloating victory, thirsty for the blood of our enemies and celebrating when it is shed and when the stalemate of battle positions and posturing is over. Is this really the uncomplicated will of God?</p>
<p>A generous reading of the text might look at the way the Israelites and the Philistines have been lined up against each other in stalemate for 40 days and how the Philistines, with might on their side, have been pragmatic in their approach to conflict, wishing to save too many young men from blood shed by resolving the dispute through using champions. Its clear from the version of the story we receive in 1 Samuel that the Israelites were feeling hard done by and short of resources under Philistine domination. Scarcity is a well known source of conflict. Other readings tell us that this is the story of how David became King David and is tracing the trajectory of his rise and favour from humble beginnings. For me, the reading, with its terror and revenge killings, needs to be read against the stated will of God in 1 Samuel 8: 6-21 and God’s worry about Israel’s desire to be ruled by Kings. Perhaps the story of David and Goliath does trace the way David rose to kingship but when they asked for a king God has these unequivocal words of warning:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>9“Now listen to them; but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will claim as his rights.”<sup>10</sup> Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking him for a king.<sup>11</sup> He said, “This is what the king who will reign over you will claim as his rights: He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses, and they will run in front of his chariots.<sup>12</sup> Some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and others to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots.<sup>13</sup> He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers.<sup>14</sup> He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants.<sup>15</sup> He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants.<sup>16</sup> Your male and female servants and the best of your cattle and donkeys he will take for his own use.<sup>17</sup> He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves.<sup>18</sup> When that day comes, you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen, but the LORD will not answer you in that day.”</p>

<p>‘David slew Goliath’ read against this earlier text already offers an ominous resonance with God’s warnings and worry. We are told in 1 Samuel 8:19-20 that ‘the people refused to listen to Samuel. “No!” they said. “We want a king over us. Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles.”’ And this is what they then get with Saul, David, Solomon and the horrors of 1 &amp; 2 Kings, until all is lost and all is exile once again. Violence, unadulterated centralized power and control fill God with foreboding, for humans seem to be wed to the myth of redemptive violence and to myths of scarcity and fear the alternatives of love, trust and abundance.</p>
<p>I asked a group of friends who I know to be regular readers and interpreters of Biblical text what they thought the Israelites and Philistines were fighting about and received the following contemporary responses: “Resources - think oil”; “Power, land, possibly a bit of religion thrown in. But yes, primarily whatever would translate as oil.”; “Mine is bigger than yours?”; “The Israelites were threatening to enrich uranium.”; “Land, water, who had the shiniest armour, the prettiest girl, the biggest pointy things, the same old same old, but you can bet they all thought the other lot started it.”; “Real estate and landlord rights”; “The last rolo…. Or if you bring it down to the level of my children everything, anything &amp; nothing!”; “I think you’ll find it was football.”</p>
<p>Here we have the enduring power of this text to speak into our everyday ordinary arguments between family, friends and community and to our contemporary nation state conflicts. Here we have the deep understanding of the causes of conflict – accusations, resources, covetousness, jealousy and greed. It is no accident, I believe, that God’s commandments say ‘no coveting, no theft, no killing’. What causes violent conflict is well known; the justifications for supposed just war and the right to protect are common enough arguments and we find them circling around the story of David and Goliath, but the enduring task for us, as God’s people, is to work out how to overcome violence and establish the alternative orderings of just peace.</p>

<title>Joshua for Academy and Pulpit?</title>
<p>Pekka M.A. Pitkänen, <italic>Joshua</italic> (Apollos Old Testament Commentary; Nottingham: Apollos and Downers Grove IL: IVP, 2010. £24.99. pp. 454. ISBN: 978-1-84474-477-0 and 978-0-8308-2506-6).</p>
<p>This presentation of the book of Joshua is wide-ranging, but also somewhat unusual. It reads more like a series of essays on Joshua than a sustained reading of the book. It is also very discursive, and almost chatty; and that, for this reader, has proved more off-putting than engaging. Translation is often free and paraphrastic; and, while the relevant Hebrew is sometimes cited, it is frequently not explained. Attempts are repeatedly made to suggest that much of the book could be read as a product of Israel before the monarchy. It is surprising that an author who disclaims archaeological competence devotes as many as five of the twelve excursuses to critical discussion of excavations associated with ancient Jericho, Ai, Mt Ebal, Gibeon, and Arad. Most unusual within the commentary-on-Joshua genre is the space given to an account of the Israel-Palestine problem informed by Israeli revisionist historians and a Palestinian Christian writer. The genocide enjoined in Deuteronomy and reported in Joshua concerned Israel’s first taking of a land promised, and should never have been generalised to other situations. Reading these books as early conveniently places them long before the Bible’s prophets of justice. It is a pity that Pitkänen could not benefit from Douglas Earl’s more sure-footed <italic>Reading Joshua as Christian Scripture</italic>, 2010.</p>
