<abstract>
<p>In this article, I tell the story of an interview encounter I had in a previous study with a hospice patient. Even though I had prepared for our interaction, Meredith corrected me for all my false steps. I offer my account of the tense beginning of our interview and Meredith’s lectures, which transitioned into an invitational moment and a marked change in our interaction. While I cannot know what was inside Meredith’s mind that day, I read this experience as a lesson in research methods. As such I advocate for restructuring the way we, as health communication researchers, gather patient-centered data. I contend that we must not only allow, but encourage and facilitate patients’ narratives through narrative interviewing. The findings from the current ethnography are offered for use as rationale in future narrative interview studies.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Sarah.”</p>
<p>“Well, Sarah. No offense taken, no offense given,” she said as she offered her small hand. I waited to hear what situation she was referencing in which neither one of us should offend, assuming from the hand gesture that we were simply setting ground rules for the remainder of the visit. “Your fragrance is too strong. Much too strong. You should know better. You didn’t read the sign.”</p>
<p>Her voice was impaired, so she was only able to speak a few words very quietly, but there was no mistaking the tone of her statements. She wanted to start by talking about offenses, though it was clear I had already offended.</p>
<p>“What sign?” I waited for her to reveal that there was some kind of sign informing visitors of rules about perfume or cologne. She did not respond, but simply began to pull out a journal and pen. She had informed me when I first sat down that she wanted the tape recorder on but that she would be writing out her interview answers because of her difficulty speaking. Yet I had not even asked a question, when she turned to a blank page and began writing. I sat there stunned, trying to figure out what she was writing, when she turned to me and said, “Go out of the room and come back in again. Read the sign.”</p>
<p>I hesitated for a moment, trying to figure out if I was imaging her instruction. She continued writing notes, nonverbally expressing that she was not going to offer further explanation and simply assumed I would follow her command. I walked out into the hallway, turned around and looked back into the room. In the few seconds I stood in the door frame, I scanned as much of the room as I could, knowing my next test had already begun. <italic>Look for the sign</italic>, I began lecturing myself.</p>
<p>Finally, I noticed it. There on the wall by the door frame hung six unassuming cutout letters, spelling Purell. The humble letters looked as if they had been crafted by a small child in an elementary art class. The sign above the letters read: <italic>During cold and flu season, use the Purell by the door</italic>. I glanced to my left and on the small chair sat the hand sanitizer. I looked back at Meredith, who by this time had finished writing in her journal. She stared blankly back at me, without offering any affirmation.</p>
<p>I bent over the chair and pumped a few squirts into my hand. I looked back at her as I rubbed the sanitizer in, again expecting her to indicate that I had done well. <italic>You idiot</italic>, I thought to myself. <italic>She doesn’t care that you read the sign now. You already messed up</italic>. I took a deep breath and walked back over to her bedside. I sat down and she looked at me with a grin, “Wash your hands please.”</p>
<p>I was not sure I had understood her correctly. I had just used the sanitizer. I needed clarification.</p>
<p>“Um. You mean in the bathroom. Like <italic>wash</italic> them?” She nodded. “Is the . . . where’s the bathroom? I mean is it just around the corner-?” her simple nod stopped my stream of stuttering. “Okay.”</p>
<p>I walked over to the bathroom and began washing my hands. There were two soap dispensers, both full of some generic floral scented soap. I was unable after such an intense encounter to appreciate the irony in Meredith’s choice to have scented soaps in her bathroom. I stared at both bottles, wondering if this was the next test. <italic>Stop it Sarah. Don’t freak out. Just pick one and wash your hands.</italic> I pumped a small dollop of lavender soap into the palm of my hand and started scrubbing. Thinking back to the fragrance comment, I quickly scrubbed the perfumed pressure points on my wrists and then went back to Meredith’s room. Again I was in the doorway, staring at her as if asking if she would permit me to enter the room again. Before I took another step, I asked in a timid voice, “Would you like me to use the Purell again?” She nodded and continued to write in her journal. Once again I pumped a bit of the sanitizer into my hand, staring at the liquid as I rubbed it away.</p>
<p>I walked back to the chair and sat, feeling the panic rise up in my throat as I tried to anticipate what to expect next. Meredith’s pen continued to scratch across the thick surface of the journal page, and I swallowed as I attempted to see what she was writing.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Look—Observe—Not</italic></p>
<p><italic>Everyone is the same</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I quietly inhaled. <italic>Is she writing notes to me? “Look, observe,” because I didn’t read the sign? No, wait, she’s writing them to herself, to document my “offenses.” “Not everyone is the same” is like a mantra to her right now because she has to put up with my insolence!</italic></p>
<p>I could feel the anxiety build as I continued drawing assumptions from her delicate writing and decided that I was possibly engaging in another offense by attempting to read from her journal. I quickly looked away and tried to “observe” other areas in the room, as if preparing for my next test.</p>
<p>“I’m ready.”</p>
<p>Her voice was quiet, but just as before when she spoke, she commanded my attention. “Uh, okay,” I stammered. I began to pull out the notebook and attempted to move the recorder closer to her. “Can I uh, put um, this . . . I mean is your table okay? For the recorder I mean?” She nodded as I attempted to position the small remote. I tried to organize the interview procedures, as I had on the five previous ones with other patients, untangling the recorder’s cable and locating the consent forms, when Meredith sighed. I looked up expectantly.</p>
<p>Another sigh. “Be professional,” she said quietly.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, what?”</p>
<p>“Be professional, always be professional.” She paused and wrote in her journal.</p>
<p><italic>Always be professional.</italic></p>
<p>I began to understand. Her notes were for me.</p>
<p><disp-quote><p><italic>At this—Not in a</italic></p>
<p>Crisis—at an interview</p>
<p><italic>Great</italic>, I thought, <italic>another offense. Whatever happened to none given, none taken?</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Meredith put her pen down, as I was attempting to unplug the recorder’s cable. “I actually don’t even need it plugged into the recorder. See?” As I pulled the cable out, the recorder fell and clinked as it hit against her water glass. I quickly jumped up and reached for the recorder.</p>
<p>“It’s for the computer,” I explained, now a bit out of context. Meredith took the cord out of my hand and began winding it around her fingers, as she repeated “Always be professional.” “See, like this,” she said sternly. As I watched her wrap the cord around her tiny fingers, John came back into the room. “How’s everything so far?” he asked. “Uh, fine,” I stuttered. “Always be professional,” Meredith contributed.</p>
<p>“Did she tell you what she used to do?” I shook my head. “She worked at the MGM, serving people like Shaquille O’Neal and Donald Trump.” He pointed to a MGM promotional poster with Meredith posing, smiling as she filled a water glass. “I, uh, love Shaq,” was my feeble attempt at small talk. John looked at me for a moment. I went back to my seat, as he left the room. By this point, Meredith had finished wrapping the cord and with one last “Always be professional,” she handed it back to me. She picked up her pen and underlined <italic>Always be professional</italic> in her journal.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>You just</italic></p>
<p><italic>don’t rush into a</italic></p>
<p><italic>situation where you are</italic></p>
<p><italic>Not welcome—</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Welcome. Two years after that fateful encounter with Meredith, that word still gives me pause. At the time when Meredith implied that I was not welcome, I mistakenly assumed she was referring to the interview situation, and in that respect, I was quite confused about how it could possibly be that I was not welcome given the preparations I had made before our interview. I had reviewed relevant research on hospice care and the end-of-life (EOL). I had worked with my master’s committee, which consisted of three communication scholars and a professor in sociology of death and dying to craft appropriate research questions. My interview protocol was approved by the Office for the Protection of Research Subjects, whose members agreed that I would:<disp-quote>
<p>Ensure that subjects are adequately informed of the nature of the study; Ensure that subjects’ participation is voluntary; Ensure that the benefits of [my] study outweigh its risks Ensure that the risks and benefits of the study are evenly distributed among the possible subject populations, and Suspend human subjects activity that violates regulations, policies, procedures, or an approved protocol, and report such violation and suspension to the Associate Vice President for Research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077800413482099">Office of Research Integrity—Human Subjects Research</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After I was granted approval, I contacted the hospice volunteer coordinator for a list of participants who <italic>agreed</italic> to sit for an interview. I had conducted five interviews by the time I called Meredith, and like the previous phone calls, I had used my most polite conversational skills to arrange a time to interview Meredith about her experiences with hospice. The phone call had gone well, and I believed that my demeanor in that first mediated interaction was what any researcher would point to as appropriate, so I admit that I was confident that I would be welcomed by any patient. I saw myself as an experienced researcher who would be able to gather the native’s point of view without inflicting any harm.</p>
<p>Not only did I believe I had taken the necessary precautions in terms of ethics requirements, I was also employing what I thought was an appropriate method for the research questions I had crafted. I had wanted to understand hospice patient experiences of holistic care, relationships with interdisciplinary teams, and patients’ interactions with their social networks. In a more general sense, I was trying to understand whether patients were satisfied in their receipt of hospice care. My project was unique in the scope of the study as I was attempting to gain the patients’ perspective. Surprisingly, although the goal of hospice is to return to this person-centered care to address patient needs on a more intimate level, researchers relatively ignore patients’ perspectives regarding the success of this approach. Instead perceptions of the success of patient-centered approach are obtained through critiques from families and providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800413482099">Iedema, Sorenson, Braithwaite, &amp; Turnbull, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800413482099">Karlsson, Ehnfors, &amp; Ternestedt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800413482099">Kim &amp; Kim, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800413482099">Ragan, Wittenberg, &amp; Hall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077800413482099">Riggio &amp; Taylor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077800413482099">Wittenberg-Lyles, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077800413482099">Wyatt, Ogle, &amp; Given, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077800413482099">Zimmermann &amp; Applegate, 1992</xref>). Hospice patients are often an understudied population. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800413482099">Bowling (2002)</xref> explains that if research is aimed at trying to understand a topic about which little information exists, or is too complex for a standardized instrument, then the researcher should employ qualitative methods, such as in-depth interviews, focus groups, or observation. Given the paucity of research on my topic, a qualitative method seemed fitting, and I argued that semistructured interviewing was the ideal method.</p>
<p>I provided rationale for my semistructured interview format by explaining that as partly structured, these interviews have clear and specific objectives with predetermined questions. Semistructured interviews allow the interviewer to ask follow-up questions that would aid in the expansion of the respondents’ answers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077800413482099">Singleton Jr., &amp; Straits, 1999</xref>). I argued that in my study, a semistructured interview format would be most appropriate, as the structure would provide consistency in data collection and also sensitivity in the types of questions asked of the hospice patients, while unstructured interview elements would allow for probing and flexibility for patients to elaborate on their interpretation of hospice care communication.</p>
<p>In sum, I had developed what I considered was a strong rationale for my method, received confirmation that my project was ethically sound, and achieved experience from having completed five interviews before Meredith’s. What seemed like an airtight project, however, quickly disintegrated in those first few moments of the interview. I began to doubt all the work I had done as Meredith wrote those four lines:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>You just</italic></p>
<p><italic>don’t rush into a</italic></p>
<p><italic>situation where you are</italic></p>
<p><italic>Not welcome—</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I had been so tense, given the first part of the interview that I had failed to hear what else Meredith might be saying. I believe that she had not been referring to her home or her room as the place in which I was not welcome; she was talking about her life, her narrative, as a situation into which I should not rush. It was not until a revelatory moment later in the interview that I realized that it was never about whether or not I took the appropriate steps in preparing my protocol, the lesson is about the mind-set researchers have when they approach an interaction with a patient. Instead of regarding the study as a standardized interview with semistructured prompts, patient-centered research benefits when researchers employ narrative interviewing techniques and view the interview process as a coconstruction of a narrative. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800413482099">Mishler (1986)</xref> argues interviews should be approached by:<disp-quote>
<p>looking at how interviewees connect their responses into a sustained account, that is, a story, brings out problems and possibilities of interviewing that are not visible when attention is restricted to question–answer exchanges (p. 67).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Instead of applying a question/response model, in which questions are invariant, researchers might view the interview as a conversation, in which they are active participants. I believe my active participation began in a moment during my interview with Meredith when I responded to her invitation.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Not welcome— this is about Meredith and her Comfort</italic>. ♥</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>“Is that a reference to me?” I had asked, still terrified that Meredith was scolding me for my awkward presence and “unprofessional” behavior. She shook her head. I waited with bated breath and watched her slowly scratch out a response. Her answer was in reference to an earlier question.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>The lady from Premium. I would see her every night about 4AM. I knew she was hurting and wanted to talk to her. Yet she finally came to me. That’s the way it should be.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I knew she was talking about the woman who had organized her insurance, but since I did not understand much more about this woman’s role in Meredith’s life, I read her statement as a lesson to me. I tried to shake off those thoughts and maintain composure. I had planned to adhere to my protocol, as I thought any “good” researcher would do. “Do you have a relationship with a hospice spiritual mentor or a therapist?” I asked.</p>
<p>Meredith wrote: <italic>I speak with E. She is just awsume (sp?) To totally surrender to God is not an easy thing to do.</italic> Then abruptly she spoke. It was a whisper, but there was desperation in her voice as she started to gasp for breath. “Take my arm,” she begged.</p>
<p>I immediately stood up and started towards her, pausing for a half a second as I wondered what the ethics board would say about what I was about to do. Meredith gasped again. I reached for her and grabbed under her arms. Her body felt incredibly frail in my arms. Lifting her reminded me of holding the 6-year-old child I used to babysit. She felt so small, but her grip was intensely strong. She was holding on for her life. I helped prop her up and after I set her back against her pillows, she started to breathe more regularly. When her breathing returned to normal, we both sat there, still clinging to one another. I’m sure my fragrance was still too strong for her heightened sense, but this was not a moment for criticism. Meredith’s eyes were closed, as she spoke.</p>
<p>“Yet what you just did is just as grand as her being here with me.”</p>
<p>We held onto one another.</p>
<p>“Sometimes just Knowing that you are not alone is the very best medicine.”</p>
<p>She opened her eyes.</p>
<p>“Did you feel your invitation?”</p>
<p>She asked and looked at me pointedly. I nodded, speechless. “Yes,” I answered barely audibly.</p>
<p>It was that moment when I realized that her earlier lecture about being “welcome” was about being welcomed into her narrative, because the invitation Meredith asked me about marked the beginning of an entirely different interview in which I abandoned the rigidity of my protocol, and I was able to collect the richest data in my research to date as Meredith felt free to share her story. Meredith introduced me to a perspective of understanding interviews as coconstructed narratives.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077800413482099">
<title>Attention to Voice in Meredith’s Narrative</title>
<p>After my interview with Meredith, I investigated other methodological approaches to understand how I might have been better able to learn about Meredith’s position as a hospice patient. I knew it needed to be an approach which allowed for flexibility and openness, as it was only after the invitation that Meredith began to open up.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>So—god willing—</italic></p>
<p><italic>Nothing is incurable</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Disease—if you believe—</italic></p>
<p><italic>Is</italic></p>
<p><italic>Dis—Ease</italic></p>
<p><italic>Incurable—if you believe—</italic></p>
<p><italic>Cure from within</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In order to qualify as a hospice patient, Meredith had to meet the requirement of a prognosis of being likely to die within 6 months. Although Meredith was aware of her prognosis, she also maintained a belief “in a cure from within.” Meredith was essentially telling me that she did not agree with the prognosis she received and boldly explained her beliefs about her future, even though some of those beliefs were in opposition to the hospice mission. In Meredith’s narrative, her voice spoke out against the biomedical voice. Skeptics might argue that Meredith was just the type of person who clearly would not shy away from “telling it like it is,” as was evident in the beginning of the interview. But then it happened . . .</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Sarah, I go to God.</italic></p>
<p><italic>I can only open my Christ light, the glow that says I am never alone</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Meredith had used my name. In that moment, I knew our relationship had changed. We were responding to one another. I was no longer a distant, bumbling researcher; I was a participant, part of her narrative. I paused for a moment and then asked a question about the progression of her illness. She wrote the word progression and crossed it out.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Progression—if he wills</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I apologized for using that term. Then Meredith spoke. Her voice was quiet as before, but there were no harsh undertones and no lecture about how I should have been professional. She responded very simply:</p>
<p>“It’s okay.”</p>
<p>Then she continued to talk about her relationship with God, with others, her concerns about insurance, her beliefs about the American medical system, and her time as a hospice patient. Meredith offered answers to questions I might have had but could never ask according to my interview protocol. Meredith was performing a narrative, and my responses to her—formal and strict at first, then open and flexible after I accepted to my invitation—were coconstructing that narrative. In the remainder of the article, I utilize my data from my interview with Meredith to argue that a narrative interview method should be embraced as a standard for future patient-centered research in illness contexts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1077800413482099">
<title>Narrative Interviewing</title>
<p>Narrative interviews differ from generic, in-depth interviews because the goal of the narrative approach is to capture a full story. Specifically, while standard interview techniques, such as open-ended or semistructured questions, aim to gather the native’s perspective, these interviews often “take stories apart and reassemble the parts for their own analytic purposes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800413482099">Lindlof &amp; Taylor, 2002</xref>, . 180). Narrative interviews, on the other hand, work to gather the “whole story” (p. 179). To elaborate, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077800413482099">Wood (2001)</xref> explains that “narratives are not strictly personal accounts,” they are social, often producing, reproducing, or even changing cultural narratives (p. 241). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800413482099">Mattingly and Lawlor (2000)</xref> offer more detail, claiming:<disp-quote>
<p>Narratives are event-centered and historically particular, located in a particular time and place. Stories concern action, more specifically human action, and particularly social interaction. Stories have plots. They have a beginning, middle and end, so that while they unfold in time, the order is more than mere sequence but reveal a ‘sense of the whole’ (Aristotle, 1967; Ricoeur, 1984, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800413482099">Mattingly &amp; Lawlor, 2000</xref>, p. 6).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rather than follow a strict sequence, narratives can be fluid and unexpected, and emerge throughout the interviews. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800413482099">Riessman (2008)</xref> argues that narrative researchers do not <italic>find</italic> narratives but instead cocreate them through participation. Riessman likens the interview to an open conversation in which cultural rules of interaction apply, such as turn-taking, entrance and exit strategies (participants transition into new topics or summarize to end topics, moving in and out of the story world), and relevance. Narrative interviewers understand that participants are likely to engage in storytelling at any time. Thus, while conversations guided by cultural norms consist of equitable turn-taking, narrative interviews consist of longer turns as it is the researcher’s job to facilitate the storytelling by giving up control and surrendering their own turns.</p>
<p>While narrative interviewing requires that researchers give up control in favor of equality, as researchers follow participants’ leads, it is incorrect to assume that researchers enter their studies empty-headed. Instead, like any other researcher, when we narrative scholars engage in research, we have particular agendas in mind which fit with our theoretical perspectives and reviews of previous literature. Narrative interviews still maintain the standards of research regarding preparation for the interviews and continued commitment to the previously mentioned ethical guidelines of approval from an institutional review board. However, we enter interviews with the mind-set of a coparticipant, “encouraging participants to speak in their own way” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800413482099">Riessman, 2008</xref>, p. 24). Essentially, narrative interviews involve a partnership between the researcher and the interviewee. A partnership similar to the one I believe began when Meredith asked me if I felt my “invitation.”</p>
<p>At the applied level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800413482099">Riessman (2008)</xref> suggests that narrative interviewing begin with invoking narrative terms, such as “tell me your story.” Riessman cautions that inherent in the initial request is the expectation that the participant has a story to tell or is willing or prepared to immediately offer a lengthy account. Thus a more descriptive initial prompt might be necessary. Regardless of the level of detail researchers first offer participants, it is important to maintain the perspective that however the participants respond is significant as narrative interviewing involves following participants’ trails, as they work through their own stories.</p>
<p>By way of example, I applied a narrative interviewing approach to a study with hospice patients, after my experience with Meredith. I began with the following prompt:<disp-quote>
<p>When I was describing our conversation, I have been referring to “your story” and that is what I would like to hear from you today. Specifically, hospice has identified you as terminally ill or in the final stages of your illness. Since many people do not know very much about the end-of-life experience, I am interested in hearing the story of your experience.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even though I began by discussing hospice, the terminality of the illness, and the EOL, by ending this prompt with the phrase “I am interested in hearing the story of your experience,” I opened up the question again and did not offer any expectations regarding what story or what experience I was looking for. Instead, I simply allowed patients to understand this prompt as they would, and patients responded in a myriad of ways. Some patients began telling about their EOL experiences, some spoke about their first illness experience, and others opened up about their life histories, providing details about their childhoods, jobs and promotions, and family. One person who offered a life history, even after my initial prompt mentioned hospice and the EOL, explained, “My hospice situation really has no bearing on how I feel about life or the end-of-life.” Had I placed expectations on his response or redirected his narrative to focus more on the EOL, I might have missed the significance he placed on his life narrative. Through a narrative interview method, I was able to follow patients’ trails and obtain insight into their detailed and often unique meaning-making at the EOL.</p>
<sec id="section3-1077800413482099">
<title>Narrative Interviewing Within an Illness Context</title>
<p>As evident in the topic of the current ethnography and my subsequent research, my work focuses on hospice patient research. While I support narrative interviewing in many different contexts (note: especially with marginalized populations or contexts in which alternative meanings are not generally accepted) when the purpose is to gain detailed accounts of lived experiences without placing discursive boundaries on participants, I especially argue for the use of narrative research in illness contexts, as ailing individuals’ voices are often limited, minimized, or ignored.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800413482099">1985</xref>, Arntson wrote an article in which he reflected on the current methods of communication research within illness contexts. He argued that several areas of health research needed to be “pruned” so that the research might “bear fruit” in the future. Of interest to the current project is Arntson’s position on the narrow approach researchers take in evaluating communication. Arntson claims that the majority of health communication research involves relating communication variables to the two dependent measures of patient satisfaction and compliance. These studies suggest that successful communication occurs when the provider tells the patient what is expected and patients listen, essentially evaluating communication on a simple behavioral measure. However, Arntson argues that researchers need to understand that the “real unit of analysis is not what the doctor does or what the patient does, but what they are doing together” (p. 119). Overall Arntson argues that researchers need to examine the interactional nature of patient–provider communication, rather than a traditional one-sided approach. Although Arntson wrote his article over 20 years ago, his sentiments regarding the importance of an interactional approach for studying communication in health contexts is still apropos.</p>
<p>The significance of narratives in understanding illness experiences has been supported by several scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800413482099">Frank, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800413482099">Garro &amp; Mattingly, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800413482099">Kleinman, 1988</xref>), as narratives emerged in relation to health when a distinction was made between disease and illness. As Kleinman articulates, the label <italic>disease</italic> was applied by practitioners to describe the patients’ health needs through technical theories of disorders. Illness, on the other hand, could be used to describe the lived experience of human suffering. Speaking about the illness gave patients a chance to evaluate their conditions and explain how they perceive, work through, and/or live with their symptoms. Whereas disease positioned the ill individual as a corpus of replaceable parts through a medical history or diagnostic reports, <italic>illness narratives</italic> allowed patients to center the “I” in their accounts in the hopes of regaining some semblance of identity separate from the disease (Frank). Essentially illness narratives provided a way for individuals to move beyond a mere repetition of a provider’s medical report of disease and instead allow individuals to communicate their personal journeys of their illnesses. Frank argues that these personal aspects of storytelling about illnesses give voice to a body. He explains that bodies are not mute, as symptoms and pain speak volumes.</p>
<p>Attention to restoring the individual’s voice is paramount, as ill individuals often lack control as marginalized members of Western culture. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077800413482099">Parsons (1985)</xref> sick role theory posits that individuals with illnesses are regarded as deviant, defined as “failing in some way to fulfill the institutionally defined expectations of one of more of the roles in which the individual is implicated in the society” (p. 146). In addition, individuals with advanced or terminal illnesses might endure even further marginalized positions as scholars classify Western culture as a death-denying society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800413482099">Ochs, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800413482099">Ragon, 1983</xref>). Centuries ago, society was perhaps more accepting or realistic about death, as death was a common experience during times of illness epidemics and plagues. With advancements in biomedical technology, however, death could be thwarted or at the very least removed from the public eye. Consequently any phenomena which allude to death, such as chronic or advanced illnesses, are often displaced from everyday talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800413482099">Tarzian, Neal, &amp; O’Neil, 2005</xref>). Researchers who seek patients’ perspectives of illness experiences can utilize narrative interviewing to help restore patients’ culturally marginalized voices.</p>

<title>Lessons Learned</title>
<p>Although the research conducted in illness narratives and narrative medicine should provide strong rationale for the use of narrative interviewing for research in illness contexts, my main support for my argument derives primarily from my interview with Meredith. As an ailing, voice-impaired body and subject of research, Meredith maintains a culturally marginalized position. While I attempted to enter into interviews with utmost respect for participants, I still believed I held the control in these situations. However Meredith’s actions throughout the interview suggested an inversion of power assignments. After I had introduced myself and set up the tape recorder in Meredith’s room, Meredith had sent me out of her room as she was expecting company. Although we had set up this specific time for the interview, Meredith made it clear that she had a different agenda, and that I was now on her time. When her friends arrived, I sat in the living room for 45 minutes as they conversed. Meredith requested that I turn on the recorder and leave it with her while I was in the other room, and I learned that Meredith was going to record the entirety of her narrative, thereby emphasizing its significance. After 45 minutes I reentered the room, where I was condemned for my perfume and asked to wash my hands several times. Again, we were on Meredith’s time, and I was following her protocol, as my standardized protocol was dismissed. As we began the interview, Meredith took several moments to rewind my microphone cord and instruct me on proper coiling techniques.</p>
<p>Although the sheer actions Meredith performed might suffice in illustrating the fact that Meredith had taken control, issues of temporality led me to read her actions as instruction on interview methods. As a hospice patient of 3 years (Meredith had been re-evaluated every 6 months, and diagnosed as terminal each time), Meredith was not certain of how much time she had available. Given that she had already exceeded the 6-month timeline, it might be argued that Meredith was living on borrowed time. Furthermore Meredith barely had a voice or energy to sustain a lengthy interview, yet she continued to stall the formal interview as she lectured me, often verbally, on washing my hands and winding my cord. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800413482099">Charon (2006)</xref> explains from a narrative perspective, at times, a “doctor’s diachrony may be at odds with the patient’s expressive synchrony” (p. 121). While my research agenda was geared toward completing my set of fixed questions, I believe Meredith’s agenda was devoted to rerouting our conversation and teaching about narrative, as she explained:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Look—observe—Not Everyone is the same.</italic></p>
<p><italic>Always be professional. At this—not in a crisis. At an interview</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I do not profess to know what was inside Meredith’s mind that day, but in reflecting on my experience, the tense beginning of the interview, Meredith’s lectures, the invitational moment, and the marked change of our interaction, I can only read my experience as a lesson from Meredith in true research ethics, taught by patients in an organic way. As such I advocate for restructuring the way we, as researchers, gather patient-centered data. I contend that we must not only allow, but encourage and facilitate patients’ narratives through narrative interviewing.</p>
<p>Meredith began by lecturing on the basics about how to prepare for an interview, but at the end of our time together she began crying and told me to return to visit her. When I left, I was not a researcher who had completed data collection, I was a participant in Meredith’s narrative as she had invited me in, and I was finally <italic>welcome</italic>.</p>

<title>Narrative Medicine</title>
<p>The benefits of narrative interviewing are becoming evident for medical interactions as well. Narrative medicine is a relatively new approach some practitioners employ, which allows them to practice medicine with the “narrative skills of recognizing, absorbing, interpreting, and being moved by the stories of illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800413482099">Charon, 2006</xref>). By attending to the metaphors or images patients use in telling their stories and allowing ambiguity, providers are able to identify the subtext of the patients’ story and often get to the root of the illness problem. In many medical encounters, patients and providers are separated as the patient is “isolated by fear of the disease, [and] the professional [is] isolated by knowledge of it” (p. 19). However through narrative medicine, practitioners attempt to understand more about what the patients endure from the illnesses, can actually “enter the world of their patients (p. 9).” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800413482099">Marcel (1948)</xref> writes:<disp-quote>
<p>The person who is at my disposal is the one who is capable of being with me with the whole of himself when I am in need; while the one who is not at my disposal seems merely to offer me a temporary loan raised on his resources. For the one I am a presence; for the other I am an object (pp. 25-26).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Narrative medicine works to transform the relationship from an interrogator questioning an object, to a person in conversation with another person. Given that narrative medicine employs similar techniques to narrative interviewing (i.e., narrative medicine begins with providers asking a simple open-ended question such as: “Tell me what you think I should know about your situation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800413482099">Charon, 2006</xref>, p. 187), narrative medicine provides an informative example of how a narrative approach works to transform relationships. When providers enter into the world of their patients, the relationship is transformed and participants have the freedom to tell their stories of their marginalized bodies, similar to the way in which narrative interviewing could transform the researcher–subject relationship.</p>
