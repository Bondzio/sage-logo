<abstract>
<p>Several authors have argued that criminal behavior is generally caused by neurobiological deficits. This assumption not only questions the concept of free will and a person’s responsibility for his or her own actions but also the principle of guilt in criminal law. When critically examining the current state of research, it becomes apparent that the results are not sufficient to support the existence of a universally valid neurobiological causality of criminal behavior. Moreover, the assumption of total neurobiological determination of human behavior and the impossibility of individual responsibility are characterized by both faulty empiricism and methodical misconceptions. The principle of relative determinism and the analysis of the offender’s behavior at the time of the offense thus remain the central and cogent approach to the assessment of criminal responsibility.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>For several years, the concept of free will has been criticized based on neurobiological findings. The idea of free will implies that mental states can trigger physical events. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0306624X10395474">Singer (2003)</xref>, this is an “unsustainable assumption,” which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306624X10395474">Prinz (2003)</xref> refers to as “metaphysical impertinence.” In this context, it is questioned whether and to what extent human decision making and behavior is free. The view is held that all people, and therefore all offenders, are not responsible for their acts in principle, because their behavior is entirely determined by brain biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306624X10395474">Roth, 2003</xref>) and that the feeling of free decision making and action is an illusion, even if a necessary one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0306624X10395474">Roth, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>It is argued that the functional architecture of the neural networks determines what happens next in the brain depending on the state the brain is in at that moment, which in itself depends on all previous states. Even if some elements of this process can be perceived and reflected consciously, all approaches and decisions are based on neural processes and therefore should be considered to be of deterministic nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0306624X10395474">Singer, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, murderers must murder, as long as the immediate constellations of their neurons’ activity signal no other behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306624X10395474">Markowitsch, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306624X10395474">Singer (2005)</xref> maintains that both the conscious and the unconscious factors involved in a decision are completely irrelevant as long as the brain could make no other one in a given moment. Accordingly, violent behavior can be traced back to early brain-organic dysfunctions such as dysgenesis, to injuries of the orbitofrontal cortex, and to prenatal or postnatal dysfunctions of the cerebral inhibitory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0306624X10395474">Roth, 2004</xref>). This gives rise to the following guilt paradox: the graver the offense and moral guilt, the more apparent the psychological compulsion of the offender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0306624X10395474">Roth, 2004</xref>). Roth suggests the abandonment of the principle of moral guilt on which criminal law is based, stressing instead the importance for criminal law and the penal system to focus on aspects of correctional measures for treatable offenders and on protecting society from unreformable offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306624X10395474">Roth, 2003</xref>). This position seems to revive ideas of positivist criminology of the 1950s, with its assumption that criminal behavior does not result from active and rational choice of a free individual but is always a passive product of external social factors.</p>
<p>A further development of the neurodeterministic point of view would lead toward the development of a new, neurobiologically based legal system. However, according to Prinz, such a system would not necessarily have to be established, despite the incompatibility of psychological everyday assumptions and scientific findings. A different legal system could be created, which would lie beyond the direct implication of the principle of guilt and responsibility, but based on the principle of the adequacy of a response to illegal actions, independent of whether the harm-doer was free in his actions or not and independent of his criminal liability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306624X10395474">Prinz, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The view of absolute determinism is currently debated in the context of the development of neuroimaging techniques and is primarily based on two findings. First, various medical findings have been presented in recent years, particularly neurobiological findings in connection with violent and aberrant sexual behavior. These findings are understood as a sign of biological causality and an indication of the general predetermination of criminal behavior. Second, it has been suggested on the basis of specific experimental designs that there is an asynchrony, a time lag, between neurobiological will-formation and conscious decision making. The asynchrony is regarded as evidence that for every single act of volition, the brain takes the decision, not the consciously acting subject.</p>
<p>The objective of this article is a critical examination and discussion of the three core concepts on which neurobiological determinism is based:</p>
<list id="list1-0306624X10395474" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Causality</italic>: All human behavior is caused by unconscious biological processes in the brain. Criminal offenses originate from neurobiological deficits.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Determinism</italic>: Neurobiological processes are assumed to be strictly deterministic: The state of the brain at a certain point in time is entirely determined by the states of the brain that occurred prior to that point in time. Because all human behavior is caused by unconscious neurobiological processes, there is no possibility to behave in a different way. Thus, the behavior of a human being, including any criminal offense, is completely determined by biological processes in the brain.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Lack of human accountability and criminal responsibility</italic>: Because all human behavior is completely determined, there can be no individual guilt for a crime. Therefore, no offender can be held responsible for his actions in the sense of individual guilt.</p></list-item>

<title>Disorders in emotion processing and aggressive behavior</title>
<p>Various authors assume that impulsive aggression is the consequence of a faulty regulation of emotions. They believe that people are usually able to control negative emotions and know how to deal with adverse environmental signals. Violent people seem to have a malfunction of the central circuit of adaptive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X10395474">Bufkin &amp; Luttrell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X10395474">Davidson, Putnam, &amp; Larson, 2000</xref>). There is also evidence that some genetic variants could destabilize neuronal circuitry and therefore negatively affect emotion regulation and social evaluation, rendering impulsive and aggressive behavior more probable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X10395474">Buckholtz &amp; Meyer-Lindenberg, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306624X10395474">Müller et al. (2003)</xref> used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine brain activity in six psychopaths in response to emotional pictures. Pictures with negative content and pictures with positive content caused different and conspicuous increases and decreases in brain activity in areas that are important for the processing of emotions compared to control persons, as a sign of dysregulation and disturbed functional connectivity of emotion-related brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306624X10395474">Müller et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X10395474">Damasio (1996)</xref> found that damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex correlates with changes in personality and social behavior. Although intellectual, linguistic, and motor abilities are not affected, such patients are no longer capable of planning their activities in a way as to ensure long-term well-being in a social context. They make decisions that affect themselves and their environment adversely, they disregard social and moral conventions, and they show a lack of empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306624X10395474">Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, &amp; Anderson, 1994</xref>). Damasio suspects that the decision-making deficits of these patients are caused by their inability to draw on emotional markers that have been associated with the competing alternatives of a decision on prior occasions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X10395474">Damasio, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Patients suffering this kind of brain damage in early childhood are more strongly affected in their social behavior than those who contract such lesions during adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X10395474">Anderson, Bechara, Damasio, Tranel, &amp; Damasio, 1999</xref>). The result of a study on two adults who had suffered prefrontal lesions at the ages of 3 and 15 months, respectively, indicate that abnormal social and moral behavioral patterns developed irrespective of social and psychological factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X10395474">Anderson et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The fact that criminal behavior could be the result of early head injuries is also the conclusion of other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X10395474">Blair &amp; Cipolotti, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306624X10395474">Léon &amp; Chacartegui, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306624X10395474">Müller, Schuierer, Marienhagen, Putzhammer, &amp; Klein, 2003</xref>). Assessing 18 men sentenced to death for murder who had been minors at the time of their crimes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306624X10395474">Lewis, Yeager, Blake, Bard, and Strenziok (2004)</xref> discovered signs of prefrontal cortical dysfunctions in all cases. These findings can be explained by the fact that moral judgment, control of emotions and impulses, and the ability to feel remorse and empathy depend on the intact functionality of the frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0306624X10395474">Sapolski, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In a positron emission tomography (PET) study of 41 murderers and 41 control subjects, murderers were found to have significantly reduced glucose metabolism in the prefrontal cortex and the corpus callosum. Hemispheric asymmetries were found in the amygdala, the thalamus, and the medial temporal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306624X10395474">Raine, Buchsbaum, &amp; LaCasse, 1997</xref>). This led the authors to the conclusion that prefrontal deficits can cause impulsivity, low self-control, immaturity, emotional deficits, and thus aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306624X10395474">Raine et al., 1997</xref>). Along the same lines, the volume of prefrontal gray matter in 21 violent offenders diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder (APD) was found to be 11% smaller, on average, than in the normal population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306624X10395474">Raine, Lencz, Bihrle, LaCasse, &amp; Colletti, 2000</xref>). The prefrontal deficit was seen as the cause of low response to stimuli, lack of ability to feel guilt and fear, and deficits in decision making, all of which are typical signs of antisocial psychopathic behavior. Finally, a recent meta-analysis of 43 structural and functional imaging studies confirmed the finding of prefrontal structural and functional impairments in antisocial individuals, as no indication of statistically significant moderating effects of sample characteristics or methodology was found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0306624X10395474">Yang &amp; Raine, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In a meta-analysis of 17 neuroimaging studies on violent behavior, the violent, antisocial subjects showed dysfunctions in the prefrontal and in the medial temporal areas compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X10395474">Bufkin &amp; Luttrell, 2005</xref>). The authors explained these findings with the fact that people with prefrontal deficits have an increased tendency to misinterpret situations as threatening and dangerous and therefore to react aggressively.</p>

<title>Pedosexuality</title>
<p>In a study on neuropsychological correlates of pedophilia, a significantly larger number of left-handers (as an unspecific marker of atypical brain development) as well as generally lower IQ scores were found in pedophiles as compared to nonpedophile offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X10395474">Blanchard, et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X10395474">Blanchard, et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X10395474">Blanchard, et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X10395474">Bogaert, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X10395474">Cantor et al., 2004</xref>). Further findings in pedophile offenders are markedly reduced blood flow in the left cerebral hemisphere, skulls both significantly thinner and of poorer substance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306624X10395474">Hendricks et al., 1988</xref>), enlarged anterior and temporal horns of the lateral ventricles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306624X10395474">Hucker et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0306624X10395474">Wright, Nobrega, Langevin, &amp; Wortzman, 1990</xref>), and partial feminization as a result of a dysfunction of certain hypothalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306624X10395474">Gaffney &amp; Berlin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306624X10395474">Gladue, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306624X10395474">Pothast &amp; Allen, 1994</xref>). In one case, a married teacher who had a tumor in the frontal lobe reported that he suddenly felt a sexual attraction toward children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306624X10395474">Burns &amp; Swerdlow, 2003</xref>); similarly, two people with PET-detected prominent right temporal lobe hypometabolism were diagnosed with pedophilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306624X10395474">Mendez, Chow, Ringman, Geoff, &amp; Hinkin, 2000</xref>). Recent functional imaging studies have sought correlations of pedosexual urges with the activities in certain regions of the brain such as significant activation of the attention network and the right orbitofrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X10395474">Dressing et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306624X10395474">Paul et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0306624X10395474">Schiffer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0306624X10395474">Tost et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Neurobiological Determinism: Libet’s Experiments</title>
<p>With his experiments in the early eighties, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306624X10395474">Libet, Gleason, Wright, and Pearl (1983)</xref> intended to show an asynchrony between the conscious decision to make a certain movement and the neural activity underlying that same movement. Specifically, Libet and his colleagues measured the symmetric readiness potential that is generated within the supplementary motor area starting at least several hundreds of milliseconds before the onset of an action and is measurable through electroencephalography (EEG). The readiness potential is too weak to be detected in single-trial data; rather, the data from many trials have to be averaged in order for it to become apparent.</p>
<p>In Libet’s experiments, each subject was asked to move his or her right hand spontaneously at any time without planning ahead or concentrating on the act. The start of the movement was measured by electromyogram (EMG). By comparing the data of the EEG and EMG measurements, it was shown that the symmetric readiness potential was initiated 500 to 800 milliseconds before the movement started. The subjects were also instructed to note the exact time they formed the intention to move. This showed that the subjects realized their conscious intention to move only 150 to 200 milliseconds before the movement began. The findings were interpreted as an indication that consciousness of the intention to act occurred later than the action had started on a neuronal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306624X10395474">Libet et al., 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>Libet considered it possible that conscious will may not be able to initiate actions but to block an arising readiness potential. Furthermore, Libet reckoned that conscious balancing of the pros and cons of an action can initiate or inhibit actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306624X10395474">Libet et al., 1983</xref>).</p>

<title>Philosophical Arguments</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X10395474">Bieri (2005)</xref> objects to brain research’s criticism of free will. He states that like any other concept, “freedom” belongs to a certain area of examination and makes no sense beyond this context. He also states that physiology and neurobiology provide no conceptual framework to deal with phenomena such as free will, reflection, or decisions. According to Bieri, the brain is the wrong place to study ideas like freedom or the lack of it.</p>
<p>In his reflections, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X10395474">Burkhardt (2003)</xref> concentrates on what he calls human consciousness of freedom or human experience of freedom. He maintains that it consists primarily of people’s conviction that they have several alternatives when acting in everyday life. Burkhardt brings to mind Kant’s dictum, which says that freedom is a necessary practical condition for human beings to be able to accept the commands of reason as valid, which is why even the fatalist has to act as if he were free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X10395474">Burkhardt, 2003</xref>). According to Burkhardt, phenomena such as free will and intentionality are only perceivable subjectively. Therefore, criminal law should look at human beings the way they experience themselves. The principle of guilt is valid, as it makes no difference to human beings if they are free in an indeterministic sense or if they “merely” decide and act in a way <italic>as if</italic> they were free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X10395474">Burkhardt, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>On the Assumption of Causality</title>
<p>There are neurobiological findings that are indisputably associated with certain abilities or deficits. However, it remains unclear whether such neurobiological findings are at the source of a chain of causes or are themselves the result of other causes. Furthermore, the existing findings refer to individual cases or specific syndromes only and at present, therefore, do not conclusively connect general broad behavioral patterns, such as criminal behavior, to specific neurobiological causes. It is even less feasible to causally explain a specific category of criminal behavior with the current state of research.</p>
<p>Although with the help of functional imaging techniques much progress has been made over the past 10 years in uncovering the causes of psychiatric diseases, conclusive explanatory models, even for disorders like schizophrenia, are still far off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0306624X10395474">Tost et al., 2005</xref>). In the diagnostics of most diseases there are clearly describable and replicable symptoms, which can be traced back to an objective cause. In forensic psychiatry, criminal behavior is the “symptom.” Behavior is the result of complex individual and social interactive processes and is, therefore, in most cases not as easily experimentally replicable or explained by cause and effect. The “symptom” is shown by a statistically increased probability of the occurrence of certain behavior. In forensic psychiatry, questions are mostly about clarifying what type of behavioral dispositions is relevant to risk, when they occur and with what probability, and how they can be influenced. In addition, criminal behavior is not to be understood primarily as a mental health issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0306624X10395474">Urbaniok, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The neurobiological research on offenders presented to date only refers to individual cases or to highly selected samples with low numbers of subjects and control groups of voluntary subjects. The use of voluntary control groups is not suitable to proof specific causalities. Where a population of offenders differs from voluntary comparison group, alterations could just as well be explained by psychiatric deficits, such as depression, by the impact of time spent in a closed institution, or by many other factors. Therefore many confounding effects, especially in highly selected groups of offenders, need to be taken into account before generating assumptions about causes of criminal behavior.</p>
<p>The diversity of methodical problems does not make research in the area of forensic psychiatry impossible, but it does indicate that it is very costly, methodically as well as financially, and that the present state of research is far from being able to meet such methodical challenges. At present, universal causal connections between brain biological correlates and specific criminal behavior have not been shown.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0306624X10395474">
<title>On the Assumption of Determinism</title>
<p>Causality is a prerequisite for determinism. For most psychological phenomena, causality has not been shown yet. So in order to discuss determinism in the context of psychological and behavioral phenomena, causality needs to be assumed for the sake of argument.</p>
<p>Outside of strict monocausal phenomena, causal factors are almost never of conclusive importance. Often a causal factor is one of many, for example as an influence variable or a basic disposition. Often—and this is the case with most human behavior—the question is not “if,” but to what extent behavior is determined. Determination is therefore in most cases a quality that can theoretically be measured in gradual degrees.</p>
<sec id="section11-0306624X10395474">
<title>Criticism of Libet’s experiments and conclusions</title>
<p>To prove empirically a complete determination, the exact behavior of a person would have to be predicted on the basis of his or her neurobiological status unknown to the test subject. No experiment to date has been able to accomplish this.</p>
<p>The test design of the experiments conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306624X10395474">Haggart and Libet (2001)</xref> would be suitable to supply empirical evidence in the manner described. If it could be shown that there is a clear asynchrony between a specific unconscious activity potential and the decision determined by it, the construct of free will would have to be questioned.</p>
<p>One point of criticism concerns Libet’s conception of consciousness, something his experiments are implicitly based on: Libet assumes that events enter consciousness at a precise, definite time. This is countered by Dennett (2004), who states that there is no definite moment at which consciousness of a sensory event or a motor act occurs, because various systems used to process information are running simultaneously in the brain at all times. According to Walter, Libet’s conclusions are based on an incorrect theory of linear causal intentionality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0306624X10395474">Walter (1999)</xref> states it may be possible that in Libet’s experiments, the consciousness of intention was not examined at all. He states that the cause of the hand movements of the participants is not comparable with a decision as they only were following an instruction given before the experiment started.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X10395474">Pauen (2004)</xref> asks the question of whether the decision to act has really occurred at the assumed point in the experiment and whether what Libet measures is indeed the decision. He differentiates between an urge that “overcomes us” and the decision to be active, arguing that decisions do not overcome people but are made by them. In addition, he says that we can only speak of a decision if there are alternative courses of action—which was not the case in Libet’s experiments.</p>
<p>Concerning the verification of Libet’s experiments by the experiments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306624X10395474">Haggard and Eimer (1999)</xref>, it has to be mentioned critically that with two of eight subjects the lateral readiness potential (LRP) only started after the decision. The postulated causal dependency of the conscious decision on LRP seems therefore questionable. This skepticism is supported by a study that examines the phenomenon of the so-called smearing artifact, a systematic error that occurs while generating EEG-mean values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X10395474">Miller &amp; Trevena, 2002</xref>). If one considers the time difference as a result of this effect, according to the researchers, one would likely have to schedule the LRP <italic>after</italic> the conscious decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306624X10395474">Miller &amp; Trevena, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X10395474">Pauen (2004)</xref> located another source of error in dating a cognitive process in comparison to the visual perception of the clock, because differences in perception are not easily controlled, and perception plays a central role in the dating of stimuli. The neuroanatomist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0306624X10395474">Zilles (2004)</xref> points out that in brain research there is a dispute about the exact nature of the readiness potential that precedes the realization of a decision. Zilles speculates that the readiness potential is not just about a motor command to secondary motor brain structures, but that it could also be a measurable phenomenon of the cognitive effort that represents the willed decision of the subject. Furthermore, he states, the decision taken by participants in Libet’s experiments is morally and emotionally irrelevant and that it is possible that different brain mechanisms are activated compared to a morally and emotionally relevant decision, for example, a legally significant action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0306624X10395474">Zilles, 2004</xref>). In summary, the problems presented according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306624X10395474">Pauen (2004)</xref> show that the current data are far too unreliable in order to draw basic conclusions about the relationship between conscious decisions and unconscious neuronal processes.</p>
<p>Recent research has challenged Libet’s findings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306624X10395474">Trevena and Miller (2009)</xref> tested Libet’s assumptions using a paradigm that was not entirely the same as Libet’s own but offered a way to test the significance of the movement-preceding negativity observed in Libet’s experiment. No evidence of stronger electrophysiological signs before a decision to move than before a decision not to move was found. Postulating the absence of specific signs of movement preparation, Trevena and Miller concluded that Libet’s experiments do not provide evidence that voluntary movements are initiated unconsciously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0306624X10395474">Trevena &amp; Miller, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Asynchrony: Does it mean no responsibility?</title>
<p>In the tradition of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X10395474">Kant (2004)</xref>, the concept of free will is closely related to conscious cognitions. It is put forward that the term “free will” should be replaced by one such as “the scope of decisions available to an individual,” because the latter places the identity that generates the decisions less in conscious rationality. The scope of decisions available to individuals can be better measured by assessing their spectrum of possible actions.</p>
<p>Even if an asynchrony could be proven between preparatory brain activities and the perception of a decision, this would not imply a complete determination of behavior and an absence of individual responsibility. Determinism that in any instance relativizes responsibility entirely would only be given if the decision about a certain behavior (a) was external (e.g., a knee reflex triggered by an external impact), (b) was removed from the personal identity of a subject (e.g., speed of blood flow in a section of a blood vessel, very far removed from any conscious control and the core of personal identity), or (c) showed signs of a simple, stereotypical automatism (e.g., motor manifestation of an epileptic seizure).</p>
<p>The involvement of the personality becomes more intense the more complex and flexible psychological processes are. So decisions taken during such complex psychological processes lie closer to the individual’s personality and are therefore potentially more controllable and mutable. The more variable a person’s behavior is, the wider is his or her scope of possible decisions, the consciousness involved in the decisions and thus the higher is the person’s responsibility for his or her actions. If a person in similar situations does not always act the same way, that is, his behavior cannot be predicted with certainty, then this speaks against total determination of a person’s behavior.</p>

<title>Determinism: A philosophic discourse through the ages</title>
<p>In the tradition of the determinism/indeterminism discussion, which can be traced back as far as Democritus, the thesis of determinism is often explained in an abstract way as the logical consequence of the causal order of things. Accordingly, every physical state is the consequence of the state that has preceded it and the cause of the state that follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0306624X10395474">Spilgies, 2005</xref>). Determinism, evidently, does not only apply to neurobiological structures and processes; rather, it governed the state of the physical world prior to the existence of nervous systems and even prior to the existence of living organisms. Ultimately, determinism can be traced back to the very beginnings of the universe, to the Big Bang. Thus, a total determination of all consequences is abstractly derived from causality. The model of nontotally determined factors is discredited as “indeterminism based on intuitive workaday-psychological ideas whose supporters don’t actually deny that there are causes for decisions, but apparently believe that those causes don’t completely determine the decision” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0306624X10395474">Spilgies, 2005</xref>, p. 47). Against this background, Spilgies explains that relative determinism is logically not sustainable, because “partial determinism” presents a <italic>contradictio in adjecto</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306624X10395474">Kudlich (2004)</xref>, on the other hand, points out that the impossibility of relative determinism is not proven by Spilgies and addresses the central weak point of the abstract derivation of determinism, namely, how it can be scientifically proven that every state of the universe and every human action is entirely determined by previous states.</p>
<p>The argument is brought forward that total determinism necessarily follows from causality. But often many competing influential factors and causes prior to an event must be considered. As a consequence of absolute determinism—aside from stringent monocausal connections—there must be a hierarchy of all factors of potential causality before the event. This principle could be traced back as far as the beginning of the universe, and it means that starting with the first cause, the universe’s formation, all that has followed has been inevitably predetermined. The future would be just as invariable as the past. The first cause would therefore be similar to a genetic program and already include an implicit plan for everything. But the assumption of complete determinism means that there is an existing hierarchy prior to any impact that leads to a universal determinism, without any possibility of alternative development. Although it is possible to formulate such a theory, it becomes clear that there is no logical inevitability to support it. The other way for possible substantiation would be the one of empirical proof. There is only one way to obtain such proof.</p>
<p>Provided that every event is entirely determined by a number of causal factors, it should be possible, theoretically, to conclude from the exact nature of the event to the causal factors. Also, if all causal factors had been known prior to the event, then every event and action could have been predicted to any degree of accuracy. The only empirical proof of absolute determinism therefore would come from an entirely accurate prediction of future events. However, not only has this not been empirically proven, but it would also mean that whenever the prognosis of behavior is not entirely accurate not all the causal factors had been known or been assessed properly. This is therefore a thesis that cannot be falsified with empirical methods and therefore constitutes a dogma.</p>
<p>Although the thesis of absolute determinism implies an absolute predictability, it is precisely that which is disputed. It is pointed out that the ontological and epistemological levels must be kept apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0306624X10395474">Walter, 1999</xref>). It is said that because a perfect prognosis cannot exist in practice, it is reserved for Laplace’s demon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0306624X10395474">Spilgies, 2005</xref>). To plead a lack of feasibility of prognosis is essentially the equivalent of the rejection of empirical proof.</p>
<p>If the thesis of absolute determinism has no logical stringent derivation or empirical proof, one can demand plausibility. Einstein maintained that any future other than the one that has been certain for eternities is impossible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0306624X10395474">Vaas, 2001</xref>). However, modern physics raises objections to absolute determinism. For example, chaos theory systems can on one hand be retrospectively causally explained, but on the other hand it is questioned whether they are prospectively fully predetermined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306624X10395474">Briggs &amp; Peat, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X10395474">Eckhardt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306624X10395474">Küppers &amp; Günter, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, it is pointed out that quantum physics assumes a probabilistic status function for microscopic particles. This means, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X10395474">Koch (1994)</xref>, that in the area of quantum mechanics, physics does not appear to be deterministic. Also, hinting at Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle, it is said that according to the dominant interpretations of quantum physics, there are absolute coincidences on a subatomic level. Here the nature of causality is not deterministic but probabilistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X10395474">Koch, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Ultimately it is a question of faith and how one imagines the universe to be: predetermined or a self-adapting, progressing system of mechanisms and processes. Neither thesis can be empirically falsified. That is why <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306624X10395474">Koch (1994)</xref>, referring to quantum mechanics, maintains that one may speculate whether the world in the end is ruled by deterministic or indeterministic laws but one has to be aware that the speculations cannot be confirmed by empirical fact of any kind.</p>
<p>If we, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306624X10395474">Kant (2004)</xref>, assume that being is incognizable, then every cognition is contaminated by the rules and structures of the epistemological process. For this reason alone, it is impossible to extrapolate the causal order of the actual processes from the epistemological order of causality.</p>
<p>If the thesis of determinism applies, then cognition itself cannot be a significant correlate of a phenomenon that lies beyond the cognitive person, but is, comparable to free will, an illusion that was already determined and created in the unconscious brain’s biological structures. Then, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306624X10395474">Hochhuth (2005)</xref> rightly states, it is no longer a matter of objective accuracy but a matter of the biologically strongest determinants.</p>

<title>On the Assumption of Lack of Criminal Responsibility</title>
<p>For the rejection of the principle of guilt, the link between causality and complete determination is of central importance. It is stated that somebody who does not subscribe to complete determination assumes “acausality of decisions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0306624X10395474">Spilgies, 2005</xref>). Thus, there can only be one of two extreme scenarios: hundred percent determinism, or total acausality (which is unpredictable). From this point of view, the principle of relative determination is abandoned on the basis of a thesis that cannot be empirically verified. As shown, there is no reason for this because the principle of relative determination, meaning the assessment of the degree of determination of potentially guilt-diminishing personality-related factors, is the essence of any assessment of criminal responsibility. Central to this is the assessment of existing autonomy of action and the analysis of the actual behavior involved. If and to what extent an offender is free in his or her decision making and behavior is assessed by means of both intraindividual and interindividual comparison studies. For example, the offender’s autonomy at the time of the offense is compared to the autonomy of an average offender in a comparable situation. This shows that the objective is not the comparison with an entirely healthy and autonomous person but with a theoretical population of offenders with similar offenses.</p>
<p>Even more important is the intraindividual comparison. This is about finding out what kind of autonomy the offender had in the situation of the offense itself as compared to previous or subsequent situations. In doing so, the entire life history of the offender, his personality, and, in particular, the characteristics of the offense itself are taken into account in order to determine whether the offender was able to recognize the injustice committed (capacity for discernment) and whether he was able to act on this understanding (capacity for self-control). Psychological functions such as will-formation, decision making, self-control, and reality perception at the time of the offense are addressed. Substantial deficits are required in these psychological functions before a reduced criminal liability is assumed. Here the degree and type of causality, whether neurobiological or social, are not decisive. What matters is how distinct the deficits were at the time of the offense. The causality of those deficits is only of interest so far as they reveal something about the degree of limitations of the psychological functions, the level of the deficits present in the offender’s personality that determined the action relevant to offense. One, therefore, describes the extent to which the offender’s personality traits determine offense behavior and alternative actions are prevented because of evident deficits in the functions of perception, will-formation, decision making, and self-control. Reduced criminal responsibility cannot be assumed on the basis of any single psychiatric, physical, or neurobiological finding. A finding is only of relevance if it leads to significant limitations of the capacities to understand or to exercise self-control relevant to behavior at the time of the offense. For this reason, it is never possible to derive reduced criminal responsibility from the mere presence of biological brain findings. Such an approach, without examination of the individual case, would only be legitimate if we generally assumed that all human behavior is completely determined, and thus that there is no individual responsibility whatsoever for one’s actions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0306624X10395474">
<title>Criminal Behavior and Criminal Responsibility</title>
<p>Given that complete determination of human behavior has not been scientifically proven yet and in fact is impossible to prove with an epistemological approach, there is no reason why the concept of individual responsibility and guilt should be renounced. Therefore, all findings must be assessed by analyzing the concrete behavior of a person and its practical relevance to the evaluation of criminal responsibility. The primacy of behavioral analysis compared to the abstract weighing of alleged causes is amply justified. If one suspects that certain findings cause certain behavioral patterns, then the safest way to identify this is to analyze those behavioral patterns. The more aspects of planning, decision making, behavioral control, perception, thought, and self-control are observable in the actions of a person, the more it speaks against complete determination and reduced criminal responsibility of a person. To grant reduced criminal responsibility, it is not enough that there is a particular reason for certain behavior. Rather, what has to be examined is to what degree psychological functions that are important for behavior control were limited. Pedosexual offenders commit crimes because they are pedosexually oriented, because they are attracted to minors. Being pedosexual alone does not mean that a person must perform sexual acts with children. On the contrary, the heterogeneity of behavior of pedosexuals shows that pedosexuality in itself is not a hundred-percent determining factor. As is the case with many other partially determining factors, it is a matter of disposition that increases the probability of relevant actions compared to those who do not have this disposition. If, to what extent, and in what situations concrete sexual action is actually taken depends on a variety of further emotional and cognitive processes, as well as personal development. For these reasons, concrete behavioral monitoring and behavior analysis are the most reliable means to assess existing or missing options for decision taking and behavior control.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The assumption of total neurobiological determination of human behavior and the impossibility of individual responsibility and guilt are characterized by faulty empiricism on one hand and methodical misunderstandings on the other. No medical findings to date justify questioning the principle of guilt in general. The assessment of an offender’s criminal responsibility will also in the future have to be based on an in-depth analysis of the individual case for which the central source of information is the observable behavior of the assessee. Unarguably, modern neurobiological research methods have allowed for important insights into the functionality of the brain and neural processes relevant to behavior. Presumably, some behavior will be more easily connected to biologically subsumable brain correlates, and other behavior will have less obvious or less stringent connections. The future will show in which areas progress can be made with neurobiological research regarding diagnostic, prognostics, and possibly also treatment. For this, further in-depth studies regarding a whole row of detailed research topics will be necessary.</p>
