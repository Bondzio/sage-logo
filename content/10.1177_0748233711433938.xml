<p>Purpose: The aim of this study was to study the effect of ionizing radiation on apoptosis-related protein concentrations as well as the radio-protective role of <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> and <italic>Angelica archangelica</italic>. The experiments were performed on 68 adult Wistar rats weighing 175 g (±10 g). Animals were subdivided into control group in which the animals received neither the protector nor the isotopes. The second group represents the animals that received 1 mCi of <sup>99m</sup>Tc only. The third group represents the animals that received <italic>A. archangelica</italic> for 7 days. The fourth group represents the animals that received <italic>G. biloba</italic> for 7 days. The fifth group represents the animals that received 1 mCi of <sup>99m</sup>Tc once after receiving <italic>A. archangelica</italic> for 7 days. The sixth group represents the animals that received mCi of <sup>99m</sup>Tc once after receiving <italic>G. biloba</italic> for 7 days. Radiation was administered as intravenous injection by 1 mCi of <sup>99m</sup>Tc with the legend methoxyisobutylisonitrile for 24 h. The concentration of p53, Bcl2 and malondialdehyde in liver as well as histopathological examination of liver cells were carried out. Results showed that apoptotic to anti-apoptotic protein ratio significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) returned to its normal ratio when radioisotopic injection was administered after the protection period for a week by both <italic>A. archangelica</italic> and <italic>G. biloba</italic> in a dose based on the animal body weight. Electron microscope photographing supported this finding. Conclusion: It was concluded that both antioxidants can be used as radio-protective agents in cases of ionizing radiation exposure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Radiation therapy is an essential therapeutic modality in the management of a wide variety of tumors, but its immediate and delayed side effects on the normal tissues limit the effectiveness of the therapy. Tissue injury from ionizing radiation (IR) is believed to be a consequence of a cascade of cytokine activity, which ultimately begins with oxidative stress from radiolytic hydrolysis and formation of reactive oxygen metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748233711433938">Rubin et al., 1995</xref>). DNA, lipids and proteins are also attacked by free radicals induced by IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233711433938">Agrawal et al., 2001</xref>). The oxidative stress has been implicated in several diseases and extensive evidence indicates that antioxidants help prevent organ functional damage. Thus, the capability of the antioxidant in ameliorating biochemical alterations indicative of cellular injury and oxidative stress was studied to determine their effectiveness in protecting rats from IR.</p>
<p>Technetium is the chemical element with atomic number 43 and symbol Tc. It is the lowest atomic number element without any stable isotopes; every form of it is radioactive. Nearly all technetium is produced synthetically and only minute amounts are found in nature. Naturally occurring technetium occurs as a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore or by neutron capture in molybdenum ores. The chemical properties of this silvery gray, crystalline transition metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese.</p>
<p>The most stable radioactive isotopes are technetium-98 with a half-life of 4.2 million years (Ma), technetium-97 (half-life: 2.6 Ma) and technetium-99 (half-life: 211,000 years). Thirty other radioisotopes have been characterized with mass numbers ranging from 85 to 118. Most of these have half-lives that are less than an hour; the exceptions are technetium-93 (half-life: 2.73 h), technetium-94 (half-life: 4.88 h), technetium-95 (half-life: 20 h) and technetium-96 (half-life: 4.3 days; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748233711433938">Holden, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Its short-lived gamma ray-emitting nuclear isomer—technetium-99m—is used in nuclear medicine for a wide variety of diagnostic tests. Technetium-99 is used as a gamma ray-free source of beta particles. Long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are by-products of fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods. Because no isotope of technetium has a half-life longer than 4.2 Ma (technetium-98), its detection in red giants in 1952, which are billions of years old, helped bolster the theory that stars can produce heavier elements.</p>
<p>Cellular redox environment is a balance between production of ROS (O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>•−</sup> and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)) and their removal by antioxidants. Superoxide is converted into H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by superoxide dismutase enzymes (CuZnSOD: SOD1; MnSOD: SOD2; and EcSOD: SOD3), while catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidases (GSH-Pxs) neutralize H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. SOD2 is a nuclear encoded and mitochondria localized homotetramer (88 kDa) that is known to convert the mitochondria-generated O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>•−</sup> into H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. ROS can be generated both from endogenous sources (mitochondrial electron transport chain and oxygen metabolizing enzymes) and exogenous sources (e.g. IR). IR results in oxidative stress both by direct transfer of photons and indirectly by radiolysis of water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748233711433938">Biaglow et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748233711433938">Hall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233711433938">Oberley et al., 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>Pre-treatment with small molecular weight antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes have been reported to reverse IR-induced cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233711433938">Biaglow et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711433938">Epperly et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748233711433938">Kalen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748233711433938">St Clair et al., 1992</xref>). IR-induced changes in cellular antioxidant capacity are also known to influence cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233711433938">Guo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748233711433938">Oberley et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0748233711433938">Summers et al., 1989</xref>). Thus, it is commonly believed that the initial changes in cellular ROS levels immediately following the radiation exposure regulate all of the subsequent cellular effects.</p>
<p>The clinical importance of the herbal drugs has recently received considerable attention. Their role, though, has mainly been limited to act as an antioxidant and to provide better recovery in the altered biochemical variables. Water extraction of <italic>Angelica archangelica</italic> roots powder has been reported to be a potent free radical scavenger and an antioxidant against lead toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711433938">El-Gohary et al., 2009</xref>). The main constituents of essential oils of <italic>A. archangelica </italic>root are pynene, limonene and coumarin osthol that were recently stated to possess antioxidant effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748233711433938">Nivinshine and Mockute, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>An extract of the leaves of <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic>, a mixture mainly composed of flavonoid glycosides and terpenoides (ginkgolides and bilobalide), has been shown to exhibit antioxidant potency in protection against mercury II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0748233711433938">Sener and Sehirli, 2007</xref>) and IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233711433938">Enerl, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>G. biloba</italic> supplementation significantly increased the activities of SOD and GSH-Px enzymes and significantly decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) level. Total cranium irradiation of 5 Gy in a single dose promoted cataract formation and <italic>G. biloba</italic> supplementation protected the lenses from radiation-induced cataracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233711433938">Ertekin et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Apoptosis is the process of programmed cell death (PCD) that may occur in multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233711433938">Green, 2011</xref>). Biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death. These changes include blebbing, loss of cell membrane asymmetry and attachment, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation and chromosomal DNA fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748233711433938">Alberts et al., 2008</xref>). The apoptotic mode of cell death is an active and defined process which plays an important role in the development of multicellular organisms and in the regulation and maintenance of the cell populations in tissues upon physiological and pathological conditions. It should be stressed that apoptosis is a well defined and possibly the most frequent form of PCD, but that other, nonapoptotic types of cell death also might be of biological significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233711433938">Leist and Jaattela, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The rate of apoptosis is controlled by the balance between proteins that activate processes resulting in such death and other proteins that act to inhibit these processes. Thus, for example, the <italic>Bcl-2</italic> proto-oncogene was originally identified on the basis of its activation by chromosomal translocation in non-Hodgkin B cell lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748233711433938">Tsujimoto et al., 1985</xref>) and was subsequently shown to protect a wide variety of different cell types from PCD or apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748233711433938">Reed, 1994</xref>). Conversely, the p53 anti-oncogene protein, as well as inhibiting cellular proliferation, can also stimulate PCD. It is clear therefore that Bcl-2 and p53 represent proteins with opposite effects on the rate of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748233711433938">Agrawal et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, it appears that Bcl-2 can specifically inhibit p53-dependent apoptosis. Thus, although overexpression of p53 can induce apoptosis in different cell types, this is prevented by the overexpression of Bcl-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233711433938">Chiou et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748233711433938">Marcellus et al., 1996</xref>). In this regard, it is of interest that high levels of p53 are associated with low levels of Bcl-2 and vice versa, both during normal rat development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748233711433938">Ibrahim et al., 1997</xref>) and in different types of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748233711433938">Harn et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233711433938">Lee et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>This study studied the hypothesis that normal proliferation/apoptosis level in liver cells may be recovered when protection treatment with <italic>A. archangelica</italic> root powder water extraction and <italic>G. biloba</italic> was administered before <sup>99m</sup>Tc injection.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>The experiments were performed on 68 adult Wistar rats weighing 175 g (±10 g). All through the experiment duration, animals were housed in separate cages, fed standard laboratory food and allowed free access to water in room lightening with a 12-h light–dark cycle in animal house of the Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University.</p>
<p>Animals were subdivided into five groups. The first (12 rats) represent the control group in which the animals received neither the protector nor the isotopes. The second group (10 rats) represents animals that received 1 mCi of <sup>99m</sup>Tc once (G<sub>II</sub>). The third group (10 rats) represents animals that received <italic>A. archangelica</italic> root powder water extraction for 7 days as 0.11 g/kg body weight (G<sub>III</sub>). The fourth group represents animals (12 rats) that received 0.11 g/kg body weight of <italic>G. biloba</italic> for 7 days (G<sub>IV</sub>). The fifth group (12 rats) represents animals that received 1 mCi of <sup>99m</sup>Tc once after receiving 0.11 g/kg body weight of <italic>A. archangelica</italic> root powder water extraction for 7 days (G<sub>IV</sub>). The sixth group (12 rats) represents animals that received mCi of <sup>99m</sup>Tc once after receiving 0.11 g/kg body of weight of <italic>G. biloba</italic> for 7 days (G<sub>V</sub>).</p>
<p>During sample preparation, care was taken to avoid contamination, therefore, every step from the moment of sample until analysis was regarded as potential source of contamination and was checked not to contain or leach detectable amount of any contaminant.</p>
<p>
<italic>A. archangelica</italic> and <italic>G. biloba</italic> protection doses were calculated based on the body weight of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748233711433938">Raafat et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Radiation was administered as intravenous injection of 1 mCi <sup>99m</sup>Tc with the legend methoxyisobutylisonitrile as one dose 24 h before killing the animals.</p>
<p>Determination of molecular markers, apoptosis-related proteins p53 and Bcl2 in animals liver, was performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, where p53 (Catalog No. 900-117) and Bcl2 (Catalog No. 900-133) are determined by assay designs following the manufacturer instruction.</p>
<p>Determination of MDA in liver was carried out by a colorimetric method using Biodiagnostic kit package (Catalog No. MD 2529). Thiobarbituric acid (TBA) reacts with MDA in acidic medium at 95°C temperature for 30 min to form TBA reactive product. The absorbance of the resultant pink product can be measured at 534 nm. Tissues were perfused with a phosphate-buffered saline solution, pH 7.4, containing 0.16 mg/ml heparin to remove the red blood cells and clots. Tissues were homogenized in 5–10 ml cold buffer (i.e. 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5) per gram tissue and then centrifuged at 4000 r/min for 15 min to remove the supernatant for assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0748233711433938">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Histopathological examination</title>
<p>At the end of the experimental period, animals were killed with intravenous injection with sodium pentobarbital and subjected to a complete necropsy. Representative samples of liver were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for routine histopathology. Sections of 5 mm thickness were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin using the standard protocol.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nuclear medicine is a branch or specialty of medicine and medical imaging that uses radionuclides and relies on the process of radioactive decay in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. In nuclear medicine procedures, elemental radionuclides are combined with other elements to form chemical compounds or else combined with existing pharmaceutical compounds to form radiopharmaceuticals. These radiopharmaceuticals, once administered to the patient, can localize to specific organs or cellular receptors. This property of the radiopharmaceuticals allows nuclear medicine the ability to image the extent of a disease process in the body, based on the cellular function and physiology, rather than relying on physical changes in the tissue anatomy. In some diseases, nuclear medicine studies can identify medical problems at an earlier stage than other diagnostic tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748233711433938">Henkin et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>A radionuclide is an atom with an unstable nucleus, which is a nucleus characterized by excess energy available to be imparted either to a newly created radiation particle within the nucleus or to an atomic electron. The radionuclide, in this process, undergoes radioactive decay and emits gamma rays and/or subatomic particles. These particles constitute the IR. Radionuclides occur naturally and can also be produced artificially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748233711433938">Eckerman and Endo, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Technetium-99m is a widely used radionuclide in nuclear medicine. Its gamma ray energy of about 140 keV (these are about the same wavelength emitted by conventional X-ray diagnostic equipment) is convenient for detection. The fact that both its physical half-life and its biological half-life are very short leads to very fast clearing from the body after an imaging process. A further advantage is that the gamma ray is a single energy, not accompanied by beta emission, and that permits more precise alignment of imaging detectors. As in any IR the main side effect is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The destructive action of IR is predominantly due to ROS, including the superoxide radical (O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>−</sup>), the hydroxyl radical (OH<sup>−</sup>) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated by the decomposition of water. SOD catalyzes the dismutation of O<sub>2</sub>
<sup>−</sup> into H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can then be transformed into H<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub> by the enzymes CAT and GSH-Px. One of the indices of oxidative damage is the level of MDA, which is formed as an end product of lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233711433938">Bom et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, it has been hypothesized that irradiation-induced chemical and physiological alteration could result from the generation of ROS during IR exposure, which is considered as the most important indirect mechanism of radiation therapy. Free radicals can be generated by water radiolysis to act on Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/2Cl; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233711433938">Das et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Oxidative stress constitutes a major threat to organism living in an aerobic environment and for humans it might have a causative role in many disease processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748233711433938">Greenstock, 1993</xref>). Oxidants can trigger the activation of multiple signaling pathways, including the phosphorylation cascades leading to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748233711433938">Robinson and Cobb, 1997</xref>) and transcription factors such as nuclear factor κB and activator protein 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748233711433938">Moreno et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In aerobic organisms, the energy needed to fuel biological functions is produced in the mitochondria via the electron transport chain. In addition to energy, ROS that have the potential to cause cellular damage are produced. ROS can damage DNA, RNA and proteins, which, in theory, contributes to the physiology of ageing.</p>
<p>ROS are produced as a normal product of cellular metabolism. In particular, one major contributor to oxidative damage is H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which is converted from superoxide that leaks from the mitochondria. CAT and SOD ameliorate the damaging effects of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and superoxide by converting these compounds into oxygen and water, the benign molecules. However, this conversion is not 100% efficient and residual peroxides persist in the cell. While ROS are produced as a product of normal cellular functioning, excessive amounts can cause deleterious effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233711433938">Patel et al., 1999</xref>). Memory capabilities decline with age, evident in human degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, which is accompanied by an accumulation of oxidative damage. Current studies demonstrate that the accumulation of ROS can decrease an organism’s fitness because oxidative damage is a contributor to senescence. In particular, the accumulation of oxidative damage may lead to cognitive dysfunction, as demonstrated in a study in which old rats were given mitochondrial metabolites and then given cognitive tests. Results showed that the rats performed better after receiving the metabolites, suggesting that the metabolites reduced oxidative damage and improved mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748233711433938">Liu et al., 2002</xref>). Accumulating oxidative damage can then affect the efficiency of mitochondria and further increase the rate of ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748233711433938">Stadtman, 1992</xref>). The accumulation of oxidative damage and its implications for aging depend on the particular tissue type where the damage is occurring. Additional experimental results suggest that oxidative damage is responsible for age-related decline in brain functioning. Older gerbils were found to have higher levels of oxidized protein in comparison to younger gerbils. When old and young mice were treated with a spin trapping compound, the level of oxidized proteins decreased in older gerbils but did not have an effect on younger gerbils. In addition, older gerbils performed cognitive tasks better during treatment but ceased functional capacity when treatment was discontinued, causing oxidized protein levels to increase.</p>
<p>The Bcl-2 family of proteins regulates a late step in the apoptosis pathway. Bcl-2 protein is believed to be involved in imparting resistance to PCD or apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents and radiation. The anti-apoptotic function of the Bcl-2 protein appears to be modulated by its ability to heterodimerize with other members of the gene family, a protein favoring induction of apoptosis. Susceptibility to undergoing apoptosis may, therefore, be dependent on the ratio between Bcl-2 and Bax. Both Bax and Bcl-2 are regulated by the tumor-suppressor protein p53. The present study therefore aims to study the significance of the Bcl2, p53 expression in rat liver after injection with <sup>99m</sup>Tc.</p>
<p>One of the very interesting finding in our present work is the approximately constant ratio between p53 and Bcl2 protein concentrations in either control group (1.28) or those that received <italic>A. archangelica</italic> and <italic>G. biloba</italic> with no radiation exposure (1.25 and 1.21). Attention should be drawn to the concentration of apoptotic protein, which was always higher than that of the anti-apoptotic protein. Significant increase (1.83) in this ratio was recorded in animals exposed to the IR with no prior application of protectors, that may reflect the elevated rate of ROS formation. This ratio is nearly returned to normal when the rats were treated with these protections for a week before exposing to <sup>99m</sup>Tc. No significant changes were showed in the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 after exposure to technetium. Elevated level of p53 after exposure to IR may be due to the normal ratio between the concentrations of these proteins to the level adjusting cell proliferation/apoptosis rate.</p>
<p>The above finding was verified with the electron microscopic imaging of liver cells in animals of control and treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233711433938">Figure 2</xref>). Sections on animal’s liver exposed to technetium with no prior protector application showed severe hydropic and vascular degeneration in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233711433938">Figure 2</xref>(b)). A clear dilatation and congestion of the portal veins, in addition to perportal necrosis of the hepatocytes that surround the portal areas and the inflammatory infiltration were observed. Moderate pyknosis and a few vascular changes in hepatocytes were detected in animals that received both the protectors before radioexposure, chromatin is darker and healthy nuclear component was shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233711433938">Figure 2</xref>(e) and (f)). No dramatic changes were observed in hepatic cells of animals that received either <italic>A. archangelica</italic> or <italic>G. biloba</italic> with no isotopic exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748233711433938">Figure 2</xref>(c) and (d)).</p>

<p>Combination between apoptotic markers and histopathological examination of liver led us to state that higher apoptotic protein p53 concentration may result in normal proliferation/apoptosis rate as found in animals that received only technetium, but a very important value that has to be monitored is the ratio between the concentrations of two proteins. The regulatory function of p53 is always accommodated with the Bcl2 activity.</p>
<p>MDA concentration in liver cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0748233711433938">Table 2</xref>), obviously verifies the whole story and significant decrease (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in ROS was recorded in animals that received protection for 7 days before exposure to the IR. Attention should be drawn to the highly elevated value of MDA (16.25 ± 1.87) in animals that received technetium dose with no protection. This verifies oxidative stress accompanied with IR exposure. So, the antioxidant activity of both protectors was enough to modulate the high stress resulting from the IR.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233711433938">Chen and Wu (2004)</xref> assessed the radio-protective effects of <italic>G. biloba</italic> and tea polyphenols (TPP), used alone or in combination in radiation injury models of mice, and the results showed that <italic>Ginkgo</italic> and TPP were synergistic in antiradiation action. A similar experiment conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0748233711433938">Wang et al. (2004)</xref> also confirmed that <italic>G. biloba</italic> did have antiradiation action.</p>
<p>Our finding is in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748233711433938">Yeh et al. (2003)</xref> who found that <italic>A. archangelica</italic> inhibits the MDA formation in mouse liver homogenates both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <italic>A. archangelica</italic> and <italic>G. biloba</italic> were able to ameliorate the IR effects on the apoptotic-related proteins and returned a favorite ratio. Antioxidant potency of both protectors may be the main mode of action by which ROS was scavengered, that in role reduce the protein oxidative stress. These facts provided a theoretical basis for preparing anti-radiation and anti-tumor drugs with <italic>G. biloba</italic>.</p>
