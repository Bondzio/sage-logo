<abstract>
<p>Right pulmonary artery to left atrial fistula is a rare congenital vascular anomaly which usually presents with cyanosis, clubbing, dyspnea, and signs and symptoms of a right to left shunt. Paradoxical embolism to the brain resulting in cerebral abscess formation and death is a rare and ominous complication that has been described. We describe an unusual presentation with abdominal pain resulting from splenic infarction.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 19-year-old female was recently found to have a right pulmonary artery (RPA) to left atrial (LA) fistula after she presented with left upper quadrant abdominal pain. At 13 months of age, she underwent removal of a cyst on her jaw under general anesthesia. She was told at this time that her oxygen saturation was abnormal and that she might “have a hole in her heart.” She underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram at an outside facility, which was normal by report; no further evaluation was undertaken at that time. At age 12, her father noted that she demonstrated worsening fatigue during school, which resulted in poorer grades. During this time, she also developed dyspnea with activity, which was attributed to deconditioning. Three days prior to presentation, now at the age of 19, she developed abdominal pain that began in the epigastrum and migrated to the left upper quadrant. At the emergency department, her oxygen saturation was found to be 84% on room air. A computerized tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a splenic infarct in addition to a fistulous connection between the RPA and LA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135112438233">Figure 1</xref>). She was admitted to the hospital. An echocardiogram was performed, confirming the presence of a communication between the posterior–inferior aspect of the RPA and the roof of the LA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135112438233">Figure 2</xref>). Additional diagnostic studies included a hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dL, hematocrit of 37.3%, and iron of 12 μg/dL (range 33-150 μ/dL).</p>

<p>She was electively taken to the operating room and a limited median sternotomy was performed. The heart was found to be enlarged and hyperdynamic. Dissection was facilitated with the use of normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. The RPA was mobilized, and a large fistula approximately 5 mm in length and 10 to 12 mm in diameter was identified between the posterior wall of the RPA and the dome of the LA. The fistula was circumferentially mobilized and doubly ligated, after which her oxygen saturation increased to 97%. Her postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged home in 4 days. Her echocardiogram prior to discharge showed no residual fistula and unobstructed flow in the RPA and left pulmonary artery (LPA), with good biventricular systolic function. </p>
<p>At her two-month follow-up, she reported feeling dramatically better with less dyspnea than before with a higher energy level. Three months after surgery, she developed chest discomfort and shortness of breath. Cardiomegaly was noted on chest X-ray, and an echocardiogram demonstrated a moderate pericardial effusion. She was diagnosed with post-pericardiotomy syndrome which was treated with intravenous methylprednisilone and transitioned to colchicine and ibuprofen. She came for a follow-up six months after surgery, with resolution of her symptoms off all medical therapy.</p>

<title>Comment</title>
<p>Direct fistulous connection between the pulmonary artery (PA) and the LA is a rare anomaly. This case represents the 73rd case reported in the literature since the first description in 1950 by Friedlich and coauthors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135112438233">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135112438233"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135112438233"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135112438233">4</xref>
</sup> The embryology of this lesion is not completely understood and varies based on the anatomic subtype of RPA to LA communication. Categorization based on anatomic subtype was proposed by deSouza e Silva, et al, and later expanded by Ohara et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135112438233">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135112438233">6</xref>
</sup> In the most common type (type I), as demonstrated by this case, an anomalous vessel connects the posterior aspect of the proximal RPA to the LA. The pulmonary venous connections are normal. Embryologically, this may occur early in development as a fistula between the RPA and a pulmonary vein which subsequently becomes incorporated into the LA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135112438233">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135112438233">8</xref>
</sup> Type II is characterized by a supernumerary pulmonary branch of the PA and the associated absence of the right inferior pulmonary vein.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135112438233">5</xref>
</sup> Type III is associated with abnormal pulmonary venous return of all pulmonary veins to an aneurysmal connection between the LA and RPA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135112438233">5</xref>
</sup> In type IV, the right pulmonary veins return to a fistulous tract between the RPA and LA, while the left pulmonary veins return normally to the LA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135112438233">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Clinical presentation is variable, with the onset of symptoms occurring from infancy to late adulthood. Those who present late have a milder clinical course compared to those presenting in infancy. The usual clinical presentation is cyanosis, clubbing, and exertional dyspnea. Since the PA communicates directly with the LA, bypassing the pulmonary filter function, the patient may present with cerebral or systemic embolization or abscesses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135112438233">9</xref>
</sup> The patient presented in this report had the unusual presentation of abdominal pain related to splenic infarction. It is speculated that this patient developed a venous thrombus that embolized to the arterial system via the RPA to LA communication.</p>
<p>The diagnosis should be suspected in a patient with cyanosis and a structurally normal heart. Cyanosis resulting from the right-to-left shunt is usually not evident until adolescence or adulthood. In newborns, however, large shunts can cause severe heart failure, necessitating emergency surgical intervention. Echocardiography helps confirm a PA-to-pulmonary venous or LA fistula, the pathognomonic finding being early appearance of dense contrast in the LA (within 2-3 cardiac cycles) when contrast is injected into the arm veins. Cardiac catheterization shows LA desaturation not responding to inhaled oxygen, and a selective pulmonary angiogram discloses the communication by immediate opacification of the LA. Erythrocytosis would be expected in chronically hypoxemic patients. Interestingly, this patient had concomitant iron-deficiency anemia and therefore did not show erythrocytosis on presentation.</p>
<p>Associated lesions include patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect, and LPA stenosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135112438233">2</xref>
</sup> Associated atrial septal defects are common. Pulmonary abnormalities, including absence of the lower or middle lobe, right lung sequestration, and diverticulum of the right main bronchus, have also been reported.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135112438233">10</xref>
</sup> </p>
<p>Once diagnosed, this condition should be treated with elective surgery. Although therapeutic embolization has been reported, closure of large fistulae exposes the patient to the risk of complications, and surgery is the preferred therapeutic option. If the fistula is large it exposes the patient to the risk of complications; hence, surgery is the preferred therapeutic option.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135112438233">11</xref>
</sup> In the literature, most patients underwent ligation alone, a few had ligation and division, excision, and intracardiac repair.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135112438233">2</xref>
</sup> Our patient underwent ligation through a median sternotomy with the help of cardiopulmonary bypass due to the large size of the fistula and its posterior location which complicated the dissection off bypass. Fistulas with adequate length and limited width may be simply ligated without bypass. Cases with a short broad based fistula with a difficult dissection are better approached using bypass. An intracardiac repair is recommended if the boundaries of the fistula cannot be defined precisely and safely with an extracardiac approach. </p>
<p>The natural history of this lesion is characterized by pulmonary hypertension and risk of chronic cyanosis due to the left to right shunt. Untreated, pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas may lead to pulmonary edema with pulmonary hypertension, cerebral or systemic embolization, or with cerebral abscesses, endarteritis, infective endocarditis, and aneurysmal growth of the fistula, with the risk of fatal rupture.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135112438233">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135112438233">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Early diagnosis with the help of computed tomography (CT) scan is essential as a delay can lead to complications and death. Surgical correction soon after diagnosis is recommended with expectation of return to normal cardiovascular status. Routine postoperative follow-up and imaging is recommended. This patient had the complication of postpericardiotomy syndrome, which has not previously been reported with this lesion.</p>
