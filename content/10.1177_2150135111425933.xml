<p>Objective: There is currently no consensus of opinion regarding the optimal surgical management of Ebstein’s anomaly (EA) in neonates and young infants. Reported early mortality rates range from 25% to 100%. In this study, we present an algorithm for choosing the best management option for neonates with EA based on analysis of our experience. Patients and Methods: From 1994 to June, 2011, 48 neonates with a diagnosis of EA were managed by the same surgical team. Of these, two died before intervention; the remaining 46 either were managed medically initially (n = 20) or underwent surgical intervention during the neonatal period (n = 26) or early infancy (n = 9). Results: The mean weight was 3.6 ± 1.7 kg (1.9-8.6) and mean follow-up time was 6.3 ± 4.5 years (0.2-16). Of the 20 patients initially managed medically, 11 remain well without intervention and nine required complete repair in infancy, with 100% survival. Of the 26 neonatal operations, 23 (88%) were complete biventricular repairs, 1 Starnes’ palliation, and two Blalock–Taussig shunts (BTSs) ± pulmonary valvotomy. Among those having a two-ventricle repair, anatomic pulmonary atresia (APA) was a risk factor for early mortality (46.1%, 6 of 13) compared with those without pulmonary atresia (EA/no-PA; 10%, 1 of 10), <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. Conclusions: Most symptomatic neonates with EA will require early operation. For those with APA and mild tricuspid regurgitation (TR), a modified BTS and reduction atrioplasty may be the best initial option. For those with functional pulmonary atresia and severe TR and pulmonary regurgitation, ligation of the main pulmonary artery and placement of a BTS may provide the best initial palliation. For the rest, either a biventricular repair or a single-ventricle palliation is indicated.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is currently no consensus opinion regarding the surgical management of Ebstein’s anomaly (EA) in the neonate or young infant, despite nearly 100 neonates born each year with EA in the Unites States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111425933">1</xref></sup> The repairs that have evolved over the past 30 years were developed particularly in older children and adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111425933">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111425933">3</xref></sup> The presentation of EA in the symptomatic neonate is often one of critical illness with a mortality beyond 45% in many cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111425933">4</xref></sup> The Great Ormond Street Echo (GOSE) score, the ratio of the areas of the ([right atrium + “atrialized” right ventricle]/[functional right ventricle + left atrium + left ventricle]), emphasizes the relationship between the size of the redundant, atrialized portion of the right ventricle (RV), and the predicted mortality, with ratios ≥1.5, having an anticipated mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111425933">5</xref></sup> of 100%.

<title>Methods</title>
<p>From 1994 to June 2011, 48 neonates (&lt;28 days) and young infants (&lt;4 months) were managed by the same surgeon (C.J.K.-C.). Two patients died soon after birth during initial resuscitative efforts and another 20 were successfully managed medically during the neonatal period. Twenty-six critically ill neonates underwent early surgical intervention. This study was approved by the University of Tennessee Institutional Review Board.</p>
<sec id="section3-2150135111425933">
<title>Initial Medical Management Algorithm</title>
<p>In the immediate postnatal period, patients that are reasonably stable are given an initial trial of medical therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111425933">Figure 1</xref>
). This includes (1) supplemental oxygen, (2) observation for adequate cardiac output, and (3) ±prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub>. In an unstable patient, immediate therapy involves (1) intubation and paralysis, (2) inotropic support, (3) inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and (4) ±prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub>. In cases of associated “functional” pulmonary atresia (eg, no prograde pulmonary blood flow), the patient is closely observed in a cardiac intensive care unit with repeated echocardiograms. About half the neonates will stabilize and improve over a few days as the pulmonary vascular resistance decreases. During that time, echocardiograms will often demonstrate increasing prograde blood flow through the pulmonary valve. We have found that initially paralysis and volume-cycled ventilation (12-15 mL/kg per breath) is helpful in minimizing the effects on cardiac output of the gross cardiomegaly which is usually present. If improvement occurs, the prostaglandin infusion is weaned, and the oxygen saturations and serum lactates are carefully monitored, and an attempt is made to wean the positive pressure ventilation. We wean the prostaglandin infusion over a few days, carefully observing the oxygen saturations clinically, and the serial echocardiograms for evidence of progressive forward flow through the pulmonary valve. If their condition deteriorates or oxygen saturations fall below about 80%, they are treated surgically according to their anatomy. Those with associated anatomic pulmonary atresia (APA) will require early surgical intervention.</p>

<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>The principles of our two-ventricle repair have been well documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111425933">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111425933">8</xref></sup> The essential principles are as follows: (1) creation of a competent monocuspid valve out of the broad, “sail”-like anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve; (2) reduction right atrioplasty as the massive right atrium worsens the hemodynamic picture by compressing the lung fields; (3) fenestrated (3-4 mm) closure of the atrial septal defect; and (4) simultaneous repair of all other cardiac lesions (eg, pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect (VSD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), etc).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111425933">9</xref></sup> In one patient, a “cone” repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135111425933">10</xref></sup> was successfully done in a neonate with APA. We have used one to three Sebening sutures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111425933">11</xref></sup> liberally to support the tricuspid valve repair in most of the recent repairs.</p>

<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>Normally distributed continuous variables (paired) were compared by the paired <italic>t</italic> test, and nonnormally distributed variables by the Wilcoxon test. Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival estimates were assessed for all patients with EA. The data were analyzed with R 2.10.1 software, package “survival,” and all the results were validated with SPSS 17 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The mean weight of the study population was 3.6 ± 1.7 kg (1.9-8.6), and mean follow-up time was 6.3 ± 4.5 years (0.2-16). Follow-up was complete. Hospital survival for the entire cohort was 80% (28 of 35). For the neonates having repair, this was 73% (19 of 26). There has been one late death.</p>
<sec id="section7-2150135111425933">
<title>Medical Management</title>
<p>Of the 22 patients that were initially managed medically, two died early (9.1%, 2 of 22) and 19 survived the neonatal period. Eleven did not require surgical intervention. Nine patients became progressively more symptomatic and required surgery during early infancy (9 of 20, 45%). All these underwent a complete biventricular repair without early or late mortality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-2150135111425933">
<title>Surgical Management</title>
<p>The surgical management group is comprised of 26 patients who had surgery during the neonatal period and the nine patients that had surgery during early infancy (n = 35). Of the 26 neonates, 23 underwent complete biventricular repair (23 of 26, 88%). Thirteen (13 of 26, 50%) of these neonates had associated pulmonary atresia (EA/PA).</p>
<p>One neonate with APA, a hypoplastic functional RV, and rudimentary tricuspid valve (TV) leaflets were palliated with a Starnes single-ventricle procedure. This patient has successfully gone through to completion Fontan operation. Two other neonates with APA, small functional RV cavities, and mild tricuspid regurgitation (TR) underwent modified Blalock–Taussig shunts (BTSs). One of these also had an open pulmonary valvotomy. Both these neonates had been successfully staged to complete Fontan operation.</p>
<p>Of the 23 neonates with EA who underwent complete two-ventricle repair, 13 (13 of 23, 56%) had APA (EA/PA). These patients had a much higher early mortality (6 of 13, 46%) compared with 10% (1 of 10; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) for those who did not have APA (EA/no-PA). Earlier in our experience with patients with EA/PA, we constructed a transannular pericardial patch (n = 8), with a mortality of 75% (6 of 8). More recently, we have repaired the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) with an 8- to 10-mm diameter aortic or pulmonary homograft without mortality (0 of 5, 0%; <italic>P</italic> = .05), including a 1.9-kg preterm neonate. We believe having a competent pulmonary valve is critical to the survival of these neonates who often have significant right ventricular dysfunction in the first two to five days after surgery. Nitric oxide, muscle paralysis, and volume-cycled positive pressure ventilation are essential for every sick patient to survive during the early postoperative period. Among the seven neonates who died, three had a grade 4 intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) preoperatively and one had a diminutive left ventricle (left ventricular end diastolic diameter, 11 mm). The ICH progressed preoperatively, resulting in care being withdrawn in two patients.</p>
<p>There has been one late death from respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia &gt;1 year postoperatively in a patient who had a normal echocardiogram two weeks prior to her death.</p>
<p>Malignant tachyarrythmias were not infrequent preoperatively and were often difficult to manage, even with amiodarone, which was our preferred drug for these arrhythmias. Postoperatively, tachyarrhythmias (junctional ectopic tachycardia n = 2 and atrial flutter n = 1) were uncommon (3 of 26, 11%), short-lived, and easily managed with a short course of amiodarone (n = 2) or procainamide (n = 1). Only one patient was discharged on antiarrhythmic medications. Presence of a malignant tachyarrhythmia was an indication for earlier operative repair.</p>
<p>Survival to hospital discharge for the entire cohort was 80% (28 of 35), and 73.1% (19 of 26) for those needing surgery during the neonatal period. The need for postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was associated with 100% mortality in three patients with EA/PA and transannular patch. One neonate with EA/PA and a homograft replacement of the RVOT survived ECMO support. We believe that ECMO support in the presence of a transannular patch (incompetent pulmonary valve) results in a nonsustainable cardiac output.</p>
<p>At late follow-up out to 16 years, the survival estimate for the entire surgical group (n = 35) was 74% ± 8%, with a significant 15-year survival estimate difference on subgroup analysis when neonates with EA/PA were compared to those with EA/no-PA: 40% ± 15% versus 79% ± 13% (<italic>P</italic> = .03), respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111425933">8</xref></sup> There have been no early or late deaths in patients with EA/PA who had a homograft replacement of the RVOT.</p>

<title>Comment</title>
<p>Our surgical management of neonatal EA continues to evolve. Although we were reasonably satisfied with our results with repair in small infants and of neonates without anatomical PA, we were disappointed with the results in neonates with EA/PA in our early experience. We began to realize that only mild TR in these patients was a marker for an inadequate size of the functional RV and that these patients may be unsuitable for a two-ventricle repair. We subsequently stratified these patients to a single-ventricle pathway, either with only an initial BTS if the TR was mild or with a Starnes palliation if the TR was more severe and the functional RV was small. Using this strategy, we had success with seven of seven subsequent patients with EA/PA. Currently, if the RV seems adequate and severe TR is present, we reconstruct the RVOT with a small RV-PA valved conduit, usually an aortic or pulmonary homograft with a diameter of seven to ten mm, taking care to utilize only the most distal part of the infundibulum for the proximal anastomosis. Based on these observations, we propose the following algorithm for symptomatic neonates needing surgery for EA.</p>
<sec id="section10-2150135111425933">
<title>Anatomic Pulmonary Atresia</title>
<p>Patients with APA (EA/PA) are stratified into those with mild TR and those with moderate-to-severe TR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135111425933">Figure 2</xref>
). Patients with mild TR but a diminutive functional RV should have only a systemic pulmonary shunt placed, the ductus ligated, and a reduction atrioplasty, all of which can be done without the need for cardiopulmonary bypass. Alternatively, the ductus could be stented in the catheterization laboratory or hybrid suite, although we have no experience with this technique. A single-ventricle pathway will usually follow. Patients with moderate-to-severe TR and an adequate size functional RV can safely undergo a complete repair of the TV with the RVOT reconstruction with a valved conduit. If the RV is considered too small, a Starnes’ single-ventricle palliation is the safer alternative. When doing this, the atrialized portion of RV free wall needs to be sutured to the interventricular septum with a few interrupted sutures to minimize dilatation of the RV postoperatively.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, a uniform opinion regarding the management of neonates with EA is currently lacking.

We have done one cone operation in one neonate with EA/PA and this was successful.
