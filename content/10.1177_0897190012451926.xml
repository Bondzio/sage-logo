<bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess the practices associated with the application of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the management of children with structural–metabolic epilepsy. <bold>Methods:</bold> It was a retrospective chart review and included children aged ≥2 years old with structural–metabolic epilepsy, treated with AEDs, and received TDM. The data were extracted from the medical records. <bold>Results:</bold> Thirty-two patients were identified with 50 TDM assays. In two thirds of the assays, “check level” and “recheck level” were the reasons behind the requesting of serum level monitoring of AEDs. Knowledge of serum AED levels led to alterations in the management in 60% of the assays. Thirty-two (76%) pediatrician’s actions were consistent with the recommendation of TDM pharmacist. Forty-nine (98%) levels were appropriately indicated. In relation to the appropriateness of sampling time, 9 (18%) levels were not assessed due to missing data. Twenty-seven (54%) levels were appropriately sampled. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> More studies should be designed to improve the component of the current TDM request form, especially in the reason section.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Several factors increase the expenditure of health care, including the utilization of investigative tests. The expenses of ancillary examinations may constitute up to 25% of all hospital bills.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012451926">1</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, the expenditure on diagnostic examinations and routine tests that are reasonably priced can be expensive when added together.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012451926">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012451926">3</xref>
</sup> Therapeutic drug level monitoring has been categorized as one of the ancillary tests, and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) levels comprise a large fraction of all monitored drug levels.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012451926">4</xref>
</sup> Since automated and reliable techniques for measuring AED concentrations became available in the early 1980s, arguments have been raised regarding the rational and correct utilization of these levels and their effect on overall health care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012451926">5</xref>

</sup>
</p>
<p>The application of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in pediatric populations may be very different from that of adult populations. A majority of studies had shown that children experience shorter half-lives and larger volume of distribution values compared with adults.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012451926">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012451926"/>

</sup> Most of the existing reference ranges were completely derived from studies in adults, and these ranges may not be applicable in pediatric patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190012451926">13</xref>
</sup> Moreover, considerable changes in drug concentrations can result from pharmacokinetic interactions; either between AEDs and other drugs or among AEDs. The degree of these interactions are different in pediatric populations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012451926">14</xref>
</sup> In addition, clinical toxicity may be more difficult to evaluate in children. Therefore, careful assessment of the upper bound of the therapeutic range is necessary in such age group of patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190012451926">15</xref>
</sup> Even more, different types of seizures may require different serum concentrations of AEDs to achieve the target response. These differences are concerning for the management of pediatric patients who usually exhibit different types of seizures and epilepsies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012451926">16</xref>
</sup> In that way, this study was mainly focused on pediatric patients diagnosed with structural–metabolic epilepsy. Selecting patients based on seizure diagnostic scheme or underlying type of cause (etiology)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190012451926">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190012451926">18</xref>
</sup> may have some novelty compared with previous studies.</p>
<p>Based on the understanding that incorrect use of a service (e.g., TDM) may result in intolerable waste of funds<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012451926">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190012451926">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190012451926">20</xref>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was conducted in the Paediatric Neurology Clinic, Hospital Pulau Pinang, Malaysia. It was a retrospective chart review and included children aged ≥2 years old diagnosed with structural–metabolic epilepsy, treated with AEDs, and received TDM services. The required data were extracted from the identified patients’ medical records. The collected data included demographic characteristics, child development, seizure types, seizure frequency, AED information, and TDM data. Some of the important information were retrieved from the TDM laboratory (reason for TDM request, sampling time, last dose taken, and pharmacist’s recommendations), specifically from the patients’ TDM form. This form need to be completed and signed by the specialist. It includes a section that identifies the reasons why the doctor is requesting the serum drug level measurements. The doctor in charge has to mark one or more reasons stated in the TDM request form at the time she or he requests serum drug level monitoring. These reasons are check level, recheck level, compliance, patient not responding/frequency of attack, and suspected toxicity.</p>
<p>In Hospital Pulau Pinang, therapeutic ranges used were 50 to 100 mg/L for valproic acid, 10 to 20 mg/L for phenytoin, and 15 to 40 mg/L for phenobarbital. For carbamazepine, therapeutic range is based on the therapy type; for monotherapy it is 4 to 12 mg/L, whereas for polytherapy it is 4 to 10 mg/L. Appropriateness criteria derived from a previous study<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0897190012451926">24</xref>
</sup> were used to assess all of the identified AED serum level measurements. The criteria composed of 2 aspects: appropriateness of indication for TDM request and appropriateness of sampling time. The study was approved by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and by the Medical Research Ethics Committee (MREC), Ministry of Health Malaysia (Registration ID: NMRR-09-931-4714).</p>
<p>Majority of the results were illustrated by descriptive statistics. Percentages and frequencies were used for the categorical variables, while the mean ± standard deviation was calculated for the continuous variable (ie, age and seizure frequency). Fisher exact test was used to assess the association between the pediatrician adherence to the recommendation of TDM pharmacist and therapeutic AED levels (below, within, and above the therapeutic range). The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to determine the differences of seizure frequency among the 3 therapeutic AED levels. The Mann-Whitney test was used to assess the differences in seizure frequency between appropriately and inappropriately sampled levels. All of the analyses were performed by using the Predictive Analytics SoftWare (PASW) Statistics 18.0.</p>

<title>Patients’ Description</title>
<p>More than 1200 medical records were screened. However, only 32 patients satisfied the study criteria. The age of the studied patients was 6.87 ± 3.65 years, ranged from 2 to 14.5 years. There were 17 male (53%) and 15 female (47%). Ethnic distribution of the patients included Malay, 10 (31%); Chinese, 13 (41%); and Indian, 9 (28%). Twenty patients (62.5%) manifested with focal seizures and 12 (37.5%) had generalized seizures. About 53% of the patients had global developmental delay/intellectual disability (GDD/ID). Fifty assays were done for those patients; 8 were done during admissions and 42 tests were performed during clinic visits. Valproic acid was the most requested AED for serum monitoring in the investigated population. It constituted 42% of the total assays. Subsequently, carbamazepine made up 38% of the assays. While phenytoin and phenobarbital located at the bottom of the ranking table, they formed 12% and 8% of the tests, respectively.</p>

<title>Reasons for TDM Request</title>
<p>In more than half of the assays, “check level” was the reason behind the request of monitoring the serum level of AEDs. Seven (14%) of the assays were assigned as “recheck level,” while “compliance” and “patient not responding/frequency of attack” made up 12% and 8% of the total reasons, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190012451926">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Pattern of AED Levels</title>
<p>In general, 32 (64%) levels were within the therapeutic range, whereas 11 (22%) levels were below the therapeutic range and 7 (14%) levels were above the therapeutic range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0897190012451926">Figure 1</xref>). Majority of valproic acid levels (43%) were below the therapeutic range and 24% of the total valproic acid levels were above the therapeutic range. All carbamazepine measured levels were within the therapeutic range. Six phenytoin levels were identified, 2 levels were below the therapeutic range and 4 levels were within the therapeutic range. No toxic phenytoin levels were seen. Of 4 phenobarbital levels, 2 were within therapeutic range and 2 were above the therapeutic range. Although seizure frequency tended to be higher in patients with normal therapeutic levels (61.53 + 212.30 attacks per month) than in patients with levels lay below (18.40 + 44.54 attacks per month) or above (16.94 + 27.55 attacks per month) the therapeutic range, statistical analysis did not reveal any significant difference among the 3 therapeutic AED levels.</p>

<title>Alterations in the Management Made After the TDM Assay</title>
<p>Forty percent of the monitored levels did not result in any changes in the management. However, 28% of the measured levels led to an increase in the dose of AEDs. This was parallel with a decrease in AEDs dose in 16% of the assays. Discontinuation of the AEDs was noticed in 6% of the assays (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190012451926">Table 2</xref>). Following the result of TDM assays, 38 (76%) pediatricians’ actions were consistent with the recommendation of TDM pharmacist. The distribution of these consistent actions was as follow: 18 (47.36%) continue on the same dose, 13 (34.21%) increase dose, 3 (7.9%) decrease dose, 1 (2.63%) advice concerning compliance, and 3 (7.9%) increase dose and advice concerning compliance.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although concentration-related adverse effects were documented in the patient’s file by the pediatric neurologist, “suspected toxicity” was never rated as a reason for TDM request in the current study. Check level and recheck level were the reasons in 52% and 14% of the requested assays, respectively. These 2 terms do not give an inclusive meaning for the mentioned reasons. Check level and recheck level as mentioned in the TDM request form are ambiguous terms. Thus, it is not clear for the TDM pharmacist whether the patient is on newly initiated or reinitiated therapy, or if there are suspected changes in the AED pharmacokinetics due to renal or liver failure, or if there is a phenytoin dosage adjustment, etc. However, the TDM pharmacist can determine this by himself or herself and identify the justified reason behind the need for this assay from the other information mentioned on the TDM request form. In view of that the high frequency of check level may give the impression that the doctor’s choice is arbitrary. In the same way, these results cannot be considered new findings.

</sup> the reason for TDM request in about half of the assays was “routine level.” In other words, there was no specific indication for serum AED monitoring. Consistently, a retrospective study in Thailand showed that 74.7% of requests for serum AED levels monitoring were rated as check level.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0897190012451926">26</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In contrast, the value of this check level is underestimated in certain clinical situations, especially in patients with adequate seizure control. Regardless of the adopted dosing approach, achieving seizure-free patient for a long period of time assured that the dosage was optimized. In this situation, knowledge about serum AED concentrations will act as an identifiable tool to recognize the “individual therapeutic concentration.” Hence, the patient’s clinical picture will be clearer in further follow-up.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>In the present study, valproic acid and carbamazepine were the most frequently requested AEDs for monitoring serum levels. About one third of the valproic acid levels and all of the carbamazepine levels were within the therapeutic range. Different results were found in another prospective study, which aimed to evaluate the value of TDM at an epilepsy clinic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0897190012451926">30</xref>
</sup> The proportions of valproic acid and carbamazepine levels were within the therapeutic range for 40% and 50%, respectively, of the subjects in that study. However, the type of epilepsy and the patients’ ages may not be compatible between the 2 studies.</p>
<p>When serum AED levels are positively correlated with clinical response, one can anticipate that improvement in seizure control would be associated with an increase in the proportion of levels within the therapeutic range. Therefore, the findings of the current investigation portrayed a confusing picture. Even though seizure frequency showed no considerable difference between the 3 categories of therapeutic levels, seizure frequency tended to be higher in conjunction with levels that were within the therapeutic range. In relation to the results of an earlier study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0897190012451926">31</xref>
</sup> the increase in seizure frequency was accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of serum levels within the therapeutic range. In recent findings,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0897190012451926">32</xref>
</sup> 66.7% of phenytoin levels were highly correlated with clinical responses, while only 44% of valproic acid did. In the current study, several explanations may be available regarding the weak association between seizure frequency and serum AED levels. Initially, this can be attributed to the confrontation and unresponsiveness of the epilepsy type (structural metabolic epilepsy) chosen for this study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190012451926">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190012451926">18</xref>
</sup> For that reason, the studied patients may require serum AED levels at the upper end or slightly above the therapeutic range. This was supported by the conclusion of a previous study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0897190012451926">33</xref>
</sup> which found that neurologically abnormal pediatric patients with epilepsy are at a high risk for the development of status epilepticus despite having serum AEDs within the therapeutic range. Moreover, only 6 phenytoin assays were included in the current study, and the majority of the levels belonged to valproic acid. As mentioned in a previous study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0897190012451926">32</xref>
</sup> the correlation between serum AED levels and clinical response was stronger for phenytoin than valproic acid. In addition, a broad circadian variation with serum levels is demonstrated for valproic acid. The standard therapeutic range is hard to characterize, and the serum levels are not superior compared with the dosage for determining clinical response; in addition, the toxic effects illustrate no obvious association with serum levels.</p>
<p>In this study, TDM results of AED analysis led to alteration in the management in 60% of the monitored cases. This corresponded to 23% in a previous prospective study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0897190012451926">30</xref>
</sup> In the current study, the alterations related to the increase and decrease in dose were found in 44% of the monitored cases. In comparison, a similar distribution was seen in the above cited study<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0897190012451926">30</xref>
</sup>; the increase and decrease in the dose made up the highest proportion of alterations compared with advice concerning compliance, addition/discontinuation of AED, and earlier/later clinic appointment.</p>
<p>As a rule, knowledge of the serum AED levels is helpful only when determined in the context of clinical presentation, and requesting serum AED level monitoring should be performed to answer an exact medical problem.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012451926">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0897190012451926">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0897190012451926">35</xref>
</sup> By applying predeveloped and reliable criteria, 98% of all AED levels were deemed to be appropriately indicated. In relation to previous studies, this percentage was extremely variable ranging from 15% to 86.9%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012451926">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0897190012451926">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0897190012451926">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0897190012451926">36</xref>

</sup> Nonetheless, different assessment criteria, different clinical settings (ie, outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department), different epilepsy types, and different patients’ ages may contribute to this huge discrepancy among the published studies. This high proportion of appropriately indicated AED level determinations is not a new finding; a previous evaluation that included 3 hospitals on the east coast of Malaysia showed that 86.9% of AED levels had an appropriate indication for TDM.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0897190012451926">40</xref>
</sup> Moreover, the effect of pharmacist participation in the application of TDM services for AEDs was assessed in a previous study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0897190012451926">32</xref>
</sup> Pharmacist intervention significantly improved the proportion of appropriately indicated AED level measurements from 63.6% to 97.7%.</p>
<p>Remarkably, there is a huge variation between the current findings and those of an earlier investigation<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012451926">4</xref>
</sup> that adopted very similar assessment criteria in a tertiary care center in the United States. On the whole, the percentage of AED level determinations with appropriate indications in that study was 27%. The present study included only patients with structural–metabolic (symptomatic) epilepsy, which is often substituted for the concept of a poor prognosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190012451926">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190012451926">18</xref>
</sup> In addition, half of the studied patients had GDD/ID. There was a continued faith that intellectual deterioration was a definite outcome of poor seizure control.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0897190012451926">41</xref>
</sup> Thus the vast majority of investigated children experienced recurrent seizures and/or pharmacoresistance. As a consequence, the most frequently rated criteria were “insufficient clinical effect” and “potential drug–drug interaction.” Even though the pediatric neurologist intended to routinely monitor the serum AED levels in this subgroup of patients, the overwhelming proportion of these levels were appropriately indicated.</p>
<p>Likewise, it is imperative to ensure that a steady-state concentration is reached following therapy initiation or dosage alteration<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012451926">8</xref>
</sup> and to determine a set time for blood sampling in relation to the dose administered, mainly for AEDs with short elimination half-lives.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0897190012451926">42</xref>
</sup> Compliance with these clear standards may drastically improve the logical utilization of AED level measurements and could result directly in substantial savings.</p>
<p>With respect to sampling time, a previous study illustrated that only 34% of the monitored AED levels were appropriately sampled.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0897190012451926">40</xref>
</sup> Blood sampling at trough levels is a common difficulty in the setting of outpatient clinics. It is not easy to control the time of sampling especially in a long queue and crowded clinics. Hence, the present proportion of inappropriate sampling times due to the difficulty of getting trough levels is predictable.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>More studies should be specifically designed to improve the component of the current TDM request form, especially in the reason section. By the same token, the number of pointless assays and the costs to the health care system can be reduced both by enhancing and by improving the educational standards of the requesting neurologists.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0897190012451926">39</xref>
</sup> It is recommended that regular monitoring should not be practiced for valproic acid and is, actually, potentially deceptive.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0897190012451926">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0897190012451926">44</xref>
</sup> In the selected population, however, monitoring of valproic acid can be rationalized due to the special considerations related to patients’ age, epilepsy type, and high percentage of patients with GDD/ID. In relation to the alteration in management made after TDM assay, increase and decrease in the dose of AEDs formed the highest proportion of alterations.</p>
