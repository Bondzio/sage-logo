<abstract>
<p>Distorted weight perception (DWP), specifically overestimating weight status, is common in adolescents and may lead to eating disorders. The authors examined the role of acculturation proxies as effect modifiers of the relationship between race/ethnicity and DWP in a diverse adolescent population. Analysis of the 2005 California Health Interview Survey showed that of 2955 adolescents with underweight or healthy weight status, 10.6% reported DWP. Latino adolescents had increased odds of DWP compared with white adolescents (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.00, 4.57). Latinos who spoke English and other language(s) at home (aOR = 3.38; 95% CI = 2.11, 5.41) and Latino (aOR = 5.00; 95% CI = 2.34, 10.72) and Asian (aOR = 3.10, 95% CI = 1.15, 8.35) adolescents who spoke no English at home had increased odds of DWP compared with white, English-only speakers. Latino adolescents had increased odds (aOR = 3.98, 95% CI = 2.45, 6.47) of DWP if neither parent was US born. Assessing acculturation proxies may help identify adolescents at risk of DWP.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Distorted weight perception (DWP), where individuals overestimate or underestimate their body weight, is common in adolescents and has been noted across both genders and all adolescent ages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812458357">1</xref></sup> Negative health outcomes have been associated with DWP, specifically overestimating weight status, with DWP a possible precursor or driver of the development of an eating disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812458357">2</xref></sup> Additionally, overestimating weight status is more strongly associated with depressive symptomatology than actual weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812458357">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812458357"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812458357"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812458357">6</xref></sup> The relationship of race/ethnicity to DWP is uneven and contradictory. One study showed no relationship,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812458357">7</xref></sup> whereas others have shown higher rates of overestimating weight status in Latino or Asian adolescents compared with whites or blacks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812458357">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812458357">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>When considering the contradictory findings with DWP and race/ethnicity, one potentially influential variable may be the extent to which an adolescent has adopted the norms of Western culture that emphasize thinness as a beauty ideal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812458357">10</xref></sup> Known as acculturation, this multidimensional process occurs when 2 cultures influence each other at the individual and group levels, resulting in psychological, sociocultural, and economic adaptation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812458357">11</xref></sup> The association between acculturation and DWP has not been examined; however, studies evaluating associations between acculturation, race/ethnicity, and body dissatisfaction have produced conflicting results, with some studies indicating that acculturation to Western culture predisposes to body dissatisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812458357">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812458357"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812458357">14</xref></sup> Other studies report that populations less acculturated to Western society have higher rates of body dissatisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812458357">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812458357"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812458357">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>These mixed results may stem from the complexity of acculturation and difficulties in ensuring that the most relevant components of acculturation are examined. Acculturation at the individual level has been examined, but less information is available on parental and family acculturation. Family factors should be considered because generational differences in acculturation have been associated with higher depressive symptomatology and depression in adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812458357">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812458357">19</xref></sup> A comprehensive assessment of acculturation requires measures tailored to each cultural group,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812458357">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922812458357">21</xref></sup> but such measures are challenging to incorporate into studies with large, diverse populations. Proxies for acculturation such as nativity or language preference, although imperfect, have been used in prior studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812458357">17</xref></sup> and offer a starting point for examining the relation between acculturation and DWP.</p>
<p>The relation between acculturation and DWP, or how acculturation may moderate any associations between race/ethnicity and DWP, has not yet been studied. To address these issues, we examined the relation of proxies for acculturation and DWP in a population of racially and ethnically diverse adolescents. Specifically, we examined whether language spoken at home, parental birthplace, and adolescent birthplace were effect modifiers or confounders of the association of race/ethnicity with DWP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0009922812458357" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Analyses used the 2005 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) data from the public release file.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922812458357">22</xref></sup> As previously described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922812458357">23</xref></sup> CHIS is a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized population of California and includes a racially/ethnically diverse population, including a large immigrant community. In brief, households were surveyed by telephone using random-digit-dialing, and a computer-assisted telephone interviewing system was used for data collection. In each sampled household, 1 adult was randomly selected for interview; if that adult was the parent/legal guardian of adolescent(s) aged 12 to 17 years, 1 adolescent was also randomly selected and interviewed after obtaining consent from the parent/guardian and assent from the adolescent. Interviews were conducted in English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean. Of households sampled, 49.8% completed the screener; of those with an eligible adolescent, 48.5% completed an adolescent extended interview. The overall response rate (a product of the screener and extended response rates) was 29.6% for household interviews and 14.2% for adolescent interviews. The overall response rate for completed household interviews was consistent with contemporary telephone surveys, both general surveys and other health surveys conducted in California.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922812458357">24</xref></sup> No comparable telephone surveys of Californian adolescents alone are available. National telephone surveys of adolescents report response rates varying from 6.9% to 32%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922812458357">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922812458357">26</xref></sup> Data from 4029 adolescents were available for analysis of whom, 3.3% were underweight, 66.7% were of healthy weight, 15.7% were overweight, and 14.3% were obese. The Stanford University Panel for Medical Research in Human Subjects determined that this research did not require a full review because it involved a secondary analysis of deidentified data.</p>
<sec id="section3-0009922812458357">
<title>Weight Status and Weight Perception</title>
<p>Self-reported height and weight were used to determine BMI and sex- and age-adjusted BMI percentiles using growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/">http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/</ext-link>). Weight status was categorized as underweight (BMI &lt;5th percentile), healthy weight (BMI 5th to &lt;85th percentile), overweight (85th to &lt;95th percentile), and obese (BMI â¥95th percentile). Weight perception was assessed using the question: âWould you say that you are very underweight, slightly underweight, about the right weight, slightly overweight or very overweight?â Adolescents were prompted with âCompared to what you would like to be,â if needed. Adolescents who perceived themselves as slightly overweight or very overweight but had underweight or healthy weight status were classified as having DWP for the purposes of this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922812458357">
<title>Race/Ethnicity</title>
<p>Race/ethnicity was based on the 2005 California Department of Finance categories and recoded into 5 categories: Latino, non-Latino white, non-Latino Asian, non-Latino African American, and non-Latino other race (the majority of whom reported 2 or more race/ethnicity categories). These categories are abbreviated to Latino, white, Asian, African American, and Other for simplicity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922812458357">
<title>Acculturation</title>
<p>Proxies for acculturation used were language spoken at home (exclusively English, English and other language(s), and not English), parental birthplace (both parents born in the United States, 1 parent born in the United States, or neither parent born in the United States), and adolescent birthplace (US born vs not US born). Categorization of language spoken at home was collapsed into exclusively English and not exclusively English (English and other language(s) and not English) for some analyses because of small cell size.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0009922812458357">
<title>Confounders</title>
<p>Age, sex, and depressive symptomatology were considered to be confounders of the race/ethnicityâDWP association. Depressive symptomatology was ascertained using the 8-question Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, included in the overall CHIS survey. A score of â¥7 on this scale is associated with clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922812458357">27</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0009922812458357">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All analyses were weighted to account for sample selection probabilities, potential undercoverage, and nonresponse bias to ensure that the estimates were an unbiased representation of the California population. Additionally, 80 replicate weights and the jackknife method were used to calculate standard errors to account for the complex sampling design of the CHIS. SAS version 9.2 was used for all analyses (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Analyses included adolescents with underweight or healthy weight status. Means and proportions, along with their standard error, were used to describe the sample. Bivariate comparisons of adolescents with and without DWP were examined using weighted logistic regression. Weighted multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association of race/ethnicity and acculturation with DWP after adjusting for age, sex, and depressive symptomatology. Because of substantial collinearity between the acculturation proxies, each proxy was examined in separate logistic regression analyses. First, race/ethnicity was examined without adjusting for acculturation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812458357">Table 1</xref>, model 1), and each acculturation proxy was examined without adjusting for race/ethnicity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812458357">Table 1</xref>, models 2-4). Second, effect modification was tested by fitting the 2-way interaction between race/ethnicity and each proxy of acculturation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812458357">Table 2</xref>, models 5 and 6). If the interaction was not statistically significant at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05, main effects models were fitted to examine acculturation as a confounder of the relation of race/ethnicity with DWP. Two-way interactions among age, sex, and depressive symptomatology were also evaluated and retained if significant at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05. The logistic regression analyses are summarized using adjusted odds ratios (aORs) along with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).</p>

<p>Race/ethnicity was related to DWP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0009922812458357">Table 3</xref>). The prevalence of DWP was significantly higher for Latino and other adolescents compared with white and African American adolescents, whereas the prevalence was significantly lower for Asian compared with Latino adolescents (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Acculturation proxies were also related to DWP. The prevalence of DWP was also significantly higher among adolescents who were not US born, did not speak exclusively English at home, and where neither parent was US born. A higher percentage of adolescents with DWP had depressive symptomatology. Adolescent age or sex was not associated with DWP.</p>
<p>After adjusting for sex, age, and depressive symptomatology, the results of the main effects multivariable logistic regression analyses of race/ethnicity showed that, compared with whites, Latino adolescents had a 3-fold increased odds of DWP (95% CI = 2.00, 4.57). Asian and African Americans did not have significantly increased odds of DWP compared with whites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812458357">Table 1</xref>, model 1). Other race/ethnicity adolescents also had significantly increased odds of DWP compared with whites (aOR = 3.77; 95% CI = 1.82, 7.79), and Latino adolescents were at increased odds of DWP relative to Asian adolescents (aOR = 1.81; 95% CI = 1.06, 3.09). There was a significant interaction between age and sex, such that the odds of DWP increased for females compared with males as age increased (age 12: aOR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.38, 1.39; age 17 aOR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.33, 4.33). Adolescents with depressive symptomatology had a 1.82-fold increased odds of DWP (95% CI = 1.26, 2.63).</p>
<p>Regression analyses of acculturation proxies showed that language spoken at home and parental birthplace were associated with DWP. Compared with adolescents where the language spoken at home was exclusively English, those who spoke English and other language(s) at home had a 2.09-fold increased odds of DWP, whereas adolescents who did not speak English at home had 3.28 times the odds of DWP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812458357">Table 1</xref>, model 2). Adolescents with neither parent US born had a 2.31-fold increased odds of DWP compared with those with both parents born in the United States, whereas adolescents with 1 US born parent did not have an increased odds of DWP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812458357">Table 1</xref>, model 3). Adolescent birthplace was not significantly associated with DWP after adjusting for adolescent age, sex, and depressive symptomatology (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812458357">Table 1</xref>, model 4: aOR = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.95, 2.38).</p>
<p>Additionally, regression analyses showed that language spoken at home modified the association of race/ethnicity with DWP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812458357">Table 2</xref>, model 5, interaction <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The sample size was sufficient to estimate most, but not all, levels of the interaction. With the exception of adolescents of other race/ethnicity, race/ethnicity was not associated with DWP among adolescents where exclusively English was spoken at home (model 5âeg, Latino vs white: aOR = 1.62, 95% CI = 0.87, 2.99). However, there was a dose-response association of amount of English spoken at home and increased odds of DWP for Latinos. Compared with white adolescents where exclusively English was spoken at home, Latinos who spoke English and other language(s) at home had a 3.38-fold increased odds of DWP, whereas Latinos who did not speak English at home had 5 times the odds of DWP (95% CI = 2.24, 10.72). In contrast, Asian adolescents who spoke English and other language(s) at home did not have significantly increased odds of DWP (aOR = 1.59; 95% CI = 0.62, 4.09). However, Asians who did not speak English at home had more than 3 times the odds of DWP compared with the reference group (aOR = 3.10; 95% CI = 1.15, 8.35).</p>
<p>Parental birthplace also moderated the association between race/ethnicity and DWP (interaction <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). aORs and 95% CIs are reported for all levels of the interaction with sufficient sample size (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922812458357">Table 2</xref>, model 6). Compared with white adolescents whose parents were both US born, Latinos with neither parent US born had nearly 4 times the odds of DWP (aOR = 3.98; 95% CI = 2.45, 6.47), whereas Latino adolescents with both parents born in the United States had nearly 2-fold increased odds (aOR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.00, 3.66). However, Asian adolescents with 1 or neither parent US born and African American adolescents with both parents US born were not at increased odds of DWP relative to white adolescents with both parents born in the United States. Adolescents of other race/ethnicity with one or both parents born in the United States were at significantly increased odds of DWP compared with white adolescents whose parents were both US born (aOR = 6.54 and 3.15, respectively).</p>
<p>In contrast, regression analyses showed that adolescent birthplace was not an effect modifier for Latino ethnicity or Asian race with DWP. In main effects models, adolescent birthplace was not significantly associated with DWP after adjusting for adolescent age, sex, and depressive symptomatology (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812458357">Table 1</xref>) nor did it appreciably confound the association between race/ethnicity and DWP (results not shown).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that language spoken at home and parental birthplace modified the association between race/ethnicity and DWP in underweight and healthy weight adolescents. Less acculturation as suggested by not speaking English at home was associated with significantly higher odds of DWP in Latino and Asian adolescents compared with whites. This relation remained for Latino adolescents when considering speaking English and other language(s) at home compared with white English-only speakers. Similarly, less parental acculturation as suggested by parental birthplace was associated with DWP and modified the association of race/ethnicity and DWP. Latino and other race/ethnicity adolescents with neither parent US born had increased odds of DWP compared with white adolescents. However, adolescent birthplace was not significantly associated with DWP.</p>
<p>Consistent with previous studies, we found that underweight or healthy weight adolescents commonly report DWP, classifying themselves as overweight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812458357">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922812458357">28</xref></sup> Latino and other race/ethnicity adolescents had increased odds of DWP compared with whites. Furthermore, older adolescent females were at increased odds of reporting DWP, and there was a positive association with depressive symptomatology.</p>
<p>DWP as overweight has been associated with potentially harmful health behaviors and negative health outcomes, such as disordered eating, suicidal ideation, decreased self-esteem, and lower quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812458357">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812458357">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922812458357">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922812458357">30</xref></sup> Identifying subgroups of adolescents at higher risk of DWP is important to the development of appropriate interventions to help prevent and manage these negative health consequences.</p>
<p>Previous studies have proposed that acculturation contributes to body dissatisfaction but have provided inconclusive and contradictory results regarding associations with adolescent level of acculturation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812458357">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812458357">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812458357">17</xref></sup> and no studies have examined associations with acculturation and DWP. One strength of our study is the oversampling of Latino and Asian adolescents, enabling us to examine these subgroups. Additionally, in contrast to prior studies, we were able to include acculturation proxies for adolescents and parents as well. Furthermore, analyses were weighted so that the findings can be generalized to the noninstitutionalized population of California.</p>
<p>In our study, in analyses adjusted for adolescent age, sex, and depressive symptomatology, adolescent birthplace was not related to DWP, but language use at home and parental birthplace were. When considering parental birthplace, the relation between race and DWP was stronger for Latino adolescents if neither parent was US born, compared with white adolescents with both parents US born. Additionally, language spoken at home (not exclusively speaking English) was significantly related to DWP and moderated the relation between race/ethnicity and DWP. This proxy measure of acculturation incorporates both adolescent and parental influences because it is likely a product of language preferences of both the adolescent and those who live with the adolescent. This synergy between adolescent and parental preferences appears to have a meaningful impact on DWP.</p>
<p>It is possible that parental acculturation is associated with DWP because of an acculturation mismatch between the parent and adolescent. These differences represent varying levels of adaptation to the new culture, retention of the home culture, or proficiency in English and the home language. Greater differences between parents and children, for example, higher levels of acculturation in adolescents combined with low or moderate acculturation in parents, may result in higher rates of DWP. Increased differences between parents and children have been linked to elevated family distress and depressive symptoms in youth and parents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922812458357">31</xref></sup> In contrast, congruent levels of acculturation, either low (as in new immigrant adolescents and parents) or high, may result in lower rates of DWP. One study that only analyzed language differences showed that adolescents reported less depressive symptoms if their mothers were either proficient in English or both the adolescent and mother were proficient in their native language of Chinese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0009922812458357">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>We found that language spoken at home and parental birthplace were associated with DWP in adolescents and moderated the relation between race/ethnicity and DWP. Current clinical practice does not commonly include an assessment of adolescent, much less parental, acculturation when screening for body image concerns. A brief appraisal of proxies for acculturation incorporating language preferences and parental birthplace may provide insight into an adolescentâs risk for DWP and may identify those most likely to benefit from additional screening for risk factors.</p>
<p>Although our study is one of the largest to examine these associations, several limitations must be considered. First, the CHIS data set was not intended to comprehensively evaluate acculturation, and therefore, only limited proxies for acculturation were available. Birthplace and language preference cannot fully explain the complexities of the acculturation process and have limitations when used to assess differences in acculturation between generations or to reflect acculturation stress. Comprehensive measures of adolescent and parent acculturation could help further elucidate the relation between acculturation, race/ethnicity, and DWP. Second, although 4029 adolescent responses were available, this number represents an overall adolescent response rate of 14.2%. It is unclear how adolescents who did not complete the survey differed from those who did. However, a low response rate does not predict the extent of nonparticipation bias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0009922812458357">33</xref></sup> In addition, a prior study demonstrated that higher response rates resulting from a rigorous data collection protocol produced statistically indistinguishable results on a vast majority of items from an identical survey with a lower response rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922812458357">24</xref></sup> The CHIS data set was chosen for this study because it offers unique strengths that allow exploration of health-related questions in higher numbers of Latinos and Asians than most other large-scale data sets, and the analyses presented here, thus, offer a novel and significant contribution despite a low response rate. Although it is challenging to generalize the results of any study, the distribution of race/ethnicity and the percentage of households speaking a language other than English at home were comparable between the 2005 CHIS adolescent participants and the 2010 California Census Data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0009922812458357">34</xref></sup> This survey was also weighted to represent the noninstitutionalized population of California. Third, despite the large sample size, we were unable to examine the associations among acculturation, race/ethnicity, and DWP for several subpopulations (eg, African American adolescents who do not speak English at home) or clarify the associations by race/ethnicity for adolescents in the other race/ethnicity category. Further studies that specifically recruit adolescents from these subpopulations are needed to understand associations among race/ethnicity, acculturation, and DWP. Fourth, as is typical for a survey instrument in large epidemiological studies, weight status was determined by self-report and not direct measurement. It is possible that overweight or obese adolescents underreported their weight, such that their self-reported BMI was in the underweight or healthy weight range. In this study, these adolescents would have been classified as having DWP when their perception was actually correct. However, we do not suspect that such underreporting significantly varied by acculturation proxy or race/ethnicity, and therefore, this would not have appreciably biased these results. Finally, this is a cross-sectional study and cannot determine causation.</p>
<p>Our study is the first to identify language use at home and parental birthplace as having statistically significant relations to DWP. Moreover, language use at home and parental birthplace moderates the association between adolescent race/ethnicity and DWP. Previous studies that examined acculturation, race/ethnicity, and body dissatisfaction may not have adequately examined these associations. In particular, underweight or healthy weight Latino adolescents for whom language spoken at home is not exclusively English, Asian adolescents for whom language spoken at home is not English, and adolescents of other race/ethnicity are at increased odds of DWP. Although adolescent acculturation has been proposed as a possible moderator or confounder in the relation between DWP and race/ethnicity, our analyses do not support such an association for adolescent birthplace; however, parental and familial proxies for acculturation emerged as important factors. This finding could have relevance when evaluating adolescents whose parents were born outside the United States or who do not exclusively speak English in their home. Awareness of the effects of parental and familial acculturation on DWP may help identify adolescents at increased risk of associated negative health outcomes.</p>
