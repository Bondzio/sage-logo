<abstract>
<p>Many studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects that pharmacist-provided patient care services can have on patient health outcomes. However, the effectiveness of patient care services delivered by pharmacists in community pharmacy settings, where organizational barriers may affect service implementation or limit effectiveness, remains unclear. The authors systematically reviewed the literature on the effectiveness of pharmacist-delivered patient care services in community pharmacy settings in the United States. Of the 749 articles retrieved, 21 were eligible for inclusion in the review. Information concerning 134 outcomes was extracted from the included articles. Of these, 50 (37.3%) demonstrated statistically significant, beneficial intervention effects. The percentage of studies reporting favorable findings ranged from 50% for blood pressure to 0% for lipids, safety outcomes, and quality of life. Our findings suggest that evidence supporting the effectiveness of pharmacist-provided direct patient care services delivered in the community pharmacy setting is more limited than in other settings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Medications play a major role in the management of most chronic illnesses. Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that nearly 50% of all people in the United States report using at least one prescription drug during the past month and more than 10% report using five or more prescription drugs during that time frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077558712459215">National Center for Health Statistics, 2012</xref>). Used appropriately, medications can reduce morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, medications are not always used appropriately. Several prominent organizations have recognized that medication-related problems plague the U.S. health care system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077558712459215">Institute of Medicine, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077558712459215">Kohn, Corrigan, &amp; Donaldson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077558712459215">McGlynn et al., 2003</xref>). Inappropriate medication use can cause serious harm, including death, and increased health care expenditures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712459215">Ernst &amp; Grizzle, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077558712459215">Gurwitz &amp; Rochon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077558712459215">Hohl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1077558712459215">Weingart et al., 2009</xref>). Medication nonadherence is also a problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712459215">DiMatteo, Giordani, Lepper, &amp; Croghan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712459215">Krueger, Berger, &amp; Felkey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077558712459215">Osterberg &amp; Blaschke, 2005</xref>). In a review of studies that examined adherence to medications across diverse conditions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558712459215">DiMatteo (2004)</xref> estimated that 21% of patients do not take their medications as prescribed. Rates of nonadherence to medications used to treat asymptomatic conditions, such as hypertension, tend to be even higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077558712459215">Krueger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077558712459215">Osterberg &amp; Blaschke, 2005</xref>). In an attempt to improve the quality of medication use and reduce the risk of adverse events, medication therapy management programs were included as a key benefit when Medicare was expanded in 2003 to include an outpatient prescription drug benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1077558712459215">S. R. Smith &amp; Clancy, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the health care system, pharmacists are uniquely trained to assist patients and other health care providers deal with issues involving medication management. Over the past 40 years, the role of pharmacists has expanded considerably, moving beyond solely dispensing medications to also include the provision of comprehensive clinical services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558712459215">Cipolle, Strand, &amp; Morley, 1998</xref>). In many settings, interdisciplinary health care teams now include pharmacists who provide expertise concerning medication management issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712459215">Chisholm-Burns et al. (2010)</xref> recently conducted a systematic review evaluating the effects that clinical services delivered by pharmacists can have on patient health outcomes. This review identified a total of 298 publications from studies conducted in the United States that evaluated the effects of pharmacist-provided direct patient care services. The reviewed studies provided substantial evidence that pharmacist involvement in direct patient care can have beneficial effects on patient health outcomes. However, only 29 studies reviewed were conducted exclusively in community pharmacy settings, where most patients obtain their prescription medications. Moreover, in the Chisholm-Burns et al. review, studies that were conducted in community pharmacy settings were combined with those conducted in outpatient and ambulatory care settings for all analyses. Therefore, the effectiveness of patient care services delivered by pharmacists in community pharmacy settings remains unclear.</p>
<sec id="section2-1077558712459215">
<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>Much of the early work to expand pharmacists’ clinical role has occurred in inpatient and ambulatory care settings within teaching-focused health systems. However, many of the factors that facilitate pharmacist provision of effective direct patient care services in inpatient and ambulatory care settings are rarely present in community pharmacy settings. The dispensing process (i.e., filling prescriptions) drives the workflow in most community pharmacies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1077558712459215">Weinberger et al., 2002a</xref>). Successfully incorporating high-quality clinical services into the dispensing process is challenging. In addition, community pharmacists usually have access to little clinical information about their patients other than the medications that have been dispensed for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712459215">Cooksey, Knapp, Walton, &amp; Cultice, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, although community pharmacists regularly communicate with prescribers, this is usually accomplished by telephone or fax, mediated through support personnel, and often concerns nonclinically oriented tasks such as obtaining refill authorizations. Given the barriers to delivery of direct patient care services in the community pharmacy setting described above, it is reasonable to suspect that the effectiveness of interventions delivered in this setting may differ from those delivered in outpatient and ambulatory care settings. Thus, the objective of this article is to systematically review the literature on the effectiveness of direct patient care services provided by pharmacists in community pharmacy settings in the United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1077558712459215">
<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>We use an ecological framework based on the information–motivation–behavioral skills (IMB) model to guide this review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712459215">Fisher, Fisher, Williams, &amp; Malloy, 1994</xref>). Ecological models propose that patient behavior and health outcomes are influenced by both intrapersonal factors and factors operating at multiple levels of the physical and sociocultural environment (e.g., provider characteristics, availability and accessibility of services; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712459215">Blalock, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077558712459215">Glanz &amp; Bishop, 2010</xref>). When evaluating the effectiveness of direct patient care services provided by pharmacists in community pharmacy settings, four levels of the ecological framework are most relevant: the patient level, the pharmacist level, the pharmacy level, and the health system level, including factors that influence either the delivery of services or patient access to care.</p>
<p>Most work on the IMB model has focused on patient-level factors that affect patient engagement in care and the processes through which patient engagement results in recommended behavioral changes and improved health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712459215">Fisher et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077558712459215">Kelly, Melnyk, &amp; Belyea, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077558712459215">Osborn &amp; Egede, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077558712459215">Rivet Amico, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1077558712459215">Shell, Newman, Perry, &amp; Folsom, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1077558712459215">L. R. Smith, Fisher, Cunningham, &amp; Amico, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1077558712459215">Zarani, Besharat, Sadeghian, &amp; Sarami, 2010</xref>). According to the model, patients are more likely to engage in care when they (a) have adequate information about the services available, (b) are motivated to engage in care, and (c) have the skills required to access the services available. Engagement in care then leads to the adoption and maintenance of recommended behaviors and, ultimately, improved health outcomes.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077558712459215">Figure 1</xref>, we have extended this model by incorporating it into an ecological framework that includes the four levels specified above (i.e., patient, pharmacist, pharmacy, health system). Borrowing from the IMB model, this framework postulates that pharmacists are more likely to engage in the delivery of clinical services when they have the requisite information, motivation, and behavioral skills. Changes in patient health behavior and health outcomes are then influenced by the transaction that occurs when patients seek clinical services from a pharmacist as well as the quality of the services the pharmacist delivers.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077558712459215">Roberts, Benrimoj, Chen, Williams, and Aslani (2008)</xref> have identified seven factors that community pharmacists in Australia believe facilitate the successful implementation of clinical services in community pharmacy settings. These include one patient-level factor (i.e., patient receptivity), two pharmacist-level factors (i.e., having a good working relationship with local physicians, and good communication among pharmacy staff), two pharmacy-level factors (i.e., having an appropriate pharmacy layout, and adequate manpower), and two health system factors (i.e., external support to assist with program implementation, and reimbursement for clinical services provided).</p>
<p>At the patient level, little research has been conducted to examine factors that predict patient receptivity to receiving clinical services in the community pharmacy setting. However, in a cross-sectional study involving patients enrolled in a community pharmacy–based diabetes care program, self-reported intention to continue participating in the program was associated with patient beliefs concerning (a) perceived susceptibility to diabetes complications and (b) the extent to which program participation reduced their risk of developing these complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077558712459215">Pinto, Lively, Siganga, Holiday-Goodman, &amp; Kamm, 2006</xref>). Within the IMB model, these types of beliefs are conceptualized as motivating factors. In addition, as described above, other research suggests that patients have limited knowledge of the clinical services that can be provided by community pharmacists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1077558712459215">Truong, Layson-Wolf, de Bittner, Owen, &amp; Haupt, 2009</xref>). Thus, many patients may lack the information required to access services.</p>
<p>The two pharmacist-level factors identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077558712459215">Roberts et al. (2008)</xref>—that is, having a good working relationship with local physicians and good communication among pharmacy staff—underscore the importance of pharmacists’ communication skills. Finally, the pharmacy and health system–level factors highlight the impact that environmental factors may have on service delivery, even when both the patient and the pharmacist have the information, motivation, and skills required to engage in the care delivery process.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-1077558712459215">
<title>Literature Searches</title>
<p>We used a combination of strategies to identify relevant studies. First, we identified 194 articles that were included in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712459215">Chisholm-Burns et al. (2010)</xref> systematic review that were classified as having been conducted in the “outpatient/ambulatory care/retail/community setting.” We reviewed each of these articles to identify those that had been conducted exclusively in community pharmacy settings. Second, because the Chisholm-Burns et al. review was limited to studies published prior to February 2009, we performed an updated search to identify articles with publication dates between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2011. We modeled the updated search after the one used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712459215">Chisholm-Burns et al. (2010)</xref> but included terms to limit retrieved studies to those that were conducted in community pharmacy settings. The following search terms were used in PubMed/Medline: (<italic>community pharmacy</italic> OR <italic>community pharmacy services</italic> [MeSH] OR <italic>independent pharmacy</italic> OR <italic>independent pharmacies</italic> OR <italic>retail pharmacy</italic> OR <italic>retail pharmacies</italic> OR <italic>chain pharmacy</italic> OR <italic>chain pharmacies</italic>) AND (<italic>pharmacy</italic> OR <italic>pharmacist</italic> OR <italic>pharmacotherapy</italic> OR <italic>pharmaceutical</italic>) AND (<italic>cost</italic> OR <italic>medication</italic> OR <italic>satisfaction</italic> OR <italic>outcome</italic> OR <italic>patient</italic> OR <italic>safety</italic> OR <italic>quality of life</italic> OR <italic>intervention</italic> OR <italic>economic</italic> OR <italic>adherence</italic>). The search excluded editorials, letters to the editor, and review articles and was limited to articles written in English, and involving human participants. This search yielded a total of 511 articles. Finally, after consultation with a health science librarian, we searched other databases for additional articles. Specifically, we hand-searched the Web of Science (ISI) using articles from the PubMed search as our seed articles and searched Google Scholar using “pharmacist*,” “community practice intervention*,” and “retail pharmacy*” as key words. We also searched the International Pharmaceutical Abstracts using the following search strategy: (pharmacist OR pharmacists AND disease management OR patient compliance OR patient satisfaction OR disease outcome OR quality of life). These additional literature searches yielded 44 articles. Thus, a total of 749 articles were retrieved via the three strategies described above.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077558712459215">
<title>Study Selection</title>
<p>At least two members of the research team reviewed the abstract of all articles retrieved to assess eligibility for the full-text review. Three members of the research team (AWR, JCL, SKO) had PharmD degrees, one (SJB) had BS in pharmacy and PhD degrees, and one (TT) was a third-year pharmacy student. To be eligible for inclusion, articles had to (a) report the results of an empirical study; (b) assess an intervention that included pharmacist or pharmacy student involvement in direct patient care; (c) be conducted entirely in a community pharmacy setting, assess services delivered entirely by community pharmacists in another setting (e.g., patient’s workplace), or present results in a manner that allowed the effect of community pharmacist involvement to be isolated from other intervention effects; (d) include either a comparison group or a pre-intervention assessment of study outcomes; (e) report at least one patient outcome (e.g., therapeutic outcome, medication adherence, satisfaction); and (f) be conducted in the United States. Articles were excluded during the abstract review process only if both reviewers agreed that the article did not meet these eligibility criteria. When doubt regarding eligibility for inclusion remained after reviewing the abstract, the full text of the article was reviewed. A total of 684 articles were excluded based on review of abstracts and 27 additional articles were excluded based on review of the full-text articles. Average interrater agreement for study exclusion decisions was 93%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077558712459215">
<title>Data Extraction</title>
<p>Data from studies that met our inclusion criteria were extracted from each article by two members of the research team. Each member of the research team extracted data from an approximately equal number of articles. Each reviewer worked independently to extract information from their assigned articles into forms that were part of a Microsoft Access database (Microsoft Inc. 2010, Redmond, WA). Each pair of reviewers then met to resolve discrepancies. Studies were excluded during this stage if both reviewers agreed that they did not meet study inclusion criteria on full-text review.</p>
<p>The following information was extracted from each article: disease/condition targeted, study design, intended length of follow-up, number of individuals enrolled and number who completed planned follow-ups, narrative description of all study groups, demographic characteristics of study participants (e.g., mean age, race, ethnicity, gender), mode of intervention delivery (e.g., face-to-face, telephone), duration of the intervention, number of planned intervention sessions, total planned contact time, and all patient-level outcomes reported with the exception of economic outcomes. We also assessed factors that affect the risk of bias at the study level using criteria recommended by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (e.g., adequacy of randomization; appropriateness of comparison groups; attrition rate; adequacy of statistical analyses, including the use of intention-to-treat principles; statistical power; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1077558712459215">Viswanathan et al., 2012</xref>). We made a global assessment of the risk of bias—high, medium, or low—for each study, rating studies as having “high” risk of bias if we judged that the biases identified were so serious that they invalidated the results of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1077558712459215">Viswanathan et al., 2012</xref>). All members of the research team discussed all studies initially categorized as having a “high” risk of bias to confirm the appropriateness of this rating. We piloted extraction procedures using four articles. Throughout the extraction process, we relied entirely on data reported in the published articles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077558712459215">
<title>Data Synthesis</title>
<p>To minimize the risk of bias, we excluded studies rated as having a high risk of bias. In addition, at the outcome level, we excluded outcomes based on patient self-report measures unless a citation was provided indicating that the measure had been used in previous research. We also excluded the results of redundant analyses that yielded similar results and subgroup analyses unless they were supported by formal tests for interaction effects. Finally, we excluded before–after comparisons when the study included an independent comparison group. In these instances, to avoid inflation of Type I error, we only extracted information pertaining to the between-group differences.</p>
<p>We provide a qualitative synthesis of study findings. We also used a chi-square test to assess whether studies that used a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design were less likely to demonstrate beneficial intervention effects compared with studies that used other designs. We ruled out the possibility of conducting a meta-analysis due to the limited number of studies identified and the heterogeneity among studies in terms of design issues and outcome measures.</p>
<p>Finally, we compared our findings with those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712459215">Chisholm-Burns et al. (2010)</xref> in their review of pharmacist-provided direct patient care services across multiple health care settings. To perform this comparison, we classified the results of outcomes observed in the studies included in our review using the same classification system used in the previous review. These categories are</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1077558712459215">Figure 2</xref>, 684 of the 749 articles identified were excluded during the abstract review. Of the 65 articles included in the full-text review, 27 were excluded because review of the full-text articles revealed that they failed to meet the study inclusion criteria. Fifteen of the studies that we excluded based on the full-text review were included in the Chisholm-Burns review. We excluded 12 of these studies because they were not conducted exclusively in community pharmacy settings. Of the remaining three studies, one reported only process measures, one provided no information concerning the statistical significance of the findings reported, and one was not conducted in the United States.</p>

<p>We abstracted data from the remaining 38 articles. However, 17 studies were excluded following data abstraction because they were rated as having a high risk of bias. Thus, a total of 21 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis.</p>
<p>The included studies were published between 1973 and 2011 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712459215">Table 1</xref>). Twelve of the studies used RCT designs, four used before–after designs, four used cohort designs, and one used a nonrandomized comparison group design. The most common health conditions targeted by the interventions evaluated were diabetes (<italic>n</italic> = 4) and hypertension (<italic>n</italic> = 4). Three studies targeted multiple health conditions. Most of the interventions involved disease or medication management, three involved refill reminders, and one involved pharmacist administration of influenza vaccinations. The median sample size was 130 and the median length of planned follow-up was 9 months.</p>

<p>Information concerning a total of 134 outcomes was extracted from the 21 articles included in the review (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558712459215">Table 2</xref>). Of these 134 outcomes, the articles reported a total of 53 statistically significant differences at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Fifty of the 53 statistically significant differences favored the intervention group, indicating beneficial intervention effects. The remaining three statistically significant differences involved measures of health service utilization. Studies that used an RCT design were less likely to demonstrate a beneficial intervention effect compared with studies that used other designs (20.0% vs. 59.3%, respectively, χ<sup>2</sup> = 21.8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). In the next section, we discuss the findings reported, stratified by the type of outcome examined.</p>

<sec id="section11-1077558712459215">
<title>Behavior and Behavior Change Outcomes</title>
<p>The articles reviewed examined effects of the interventions on four types of behaviors: medication adherence, appropriate medication use, receipt of immunizations, and participation in self-care activities. The articles examined a total of 46 behavioral outcomes. Of these, 24 (52.2%) were statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
<sec id="section12-1077558712459215">
<title>Medication adherence</title>
<p>Twelve studies evaluated the effects of interventions on medication adherence. Six of these studies found no statistically significant effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712459215">Berringer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712459215">Gazmararian, Jacobson, Pan, Schmotzer, &amp; Kripalani, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077558712459215">Nietert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077558712459215">Planas, Crosby, Mitchell, &amp; Farmer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1077558712459215">Weinberger et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1077558712459215">Zillich, Sutherland, Kumbera, &amp; Carter, 2005</xref>). These included four studies that evaluated the effects of disease management programs and two that evaluated the effects of refill reminders. A total of 30 adherence outcomes were reported across the 12 studies. Of these, 13 were statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, with all significant differences favoring the intervention group. Eight of these statistically significant outcomes were from two articles by Hirsch and colleagues. In these articles, the investigators used a retrospective cohort design to examine the effects of an HIV/AIDS pharmacy medication management compensation pilot program targeting California Medicaid beneficiaries. The intervention group included individuals with HIV/AIDS who filled at least 50% of their antiretroviral therapy prescriptions at pilot pharmacies that provided a wide range of medication management services. The comparison group included individuals with HIV/AIDS who primarily used nonpilot pharmacies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712459215">Hirsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712459215">Hirsch, Rosenquist, Best, Miller, &amp; Gilmer, 2009</xref>). This study found consistent between-group differences in the percentage of patients classified as adherent of approximately 20% over the 3 years of the study. Of the remaining four studies that reported one or more statistically significant adherence outcomes, three had mixed findings and were based on relatively small samples, ranging from 49 to 102 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712459215">Ascione, Brown, &amp; Kirking, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077558712459215">McKenney, Slining, Henderson, Devins, &amp; Barr, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077558712459215">Park, Kelly, Carter, &amp; Burgess, 1996</xref>) and the remaining study did not report sample size.

<sec id="section13-1077558712459215">
<title>Appropriate medication use</title>
<p>Five studies evaluated the effects of interventions on appropriate medication use. Two of these studies, both using RCT designs, found no statistically significant effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712459215">Blalock et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077558712459215">Nola et al., 2000</xref>). Of the 10 outcomes reported across all 5 studies, 7 were statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, with all significant differences favoring the intervention group. Four of these were from the two articles by Hirsch and colleagues described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712459215">Hirsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712459215">Hirsch, Rosenquist, et al., 2009</xref>). Relative to individuals in the comparison group, these articles found that patients in the intervention group were approximately 30% less likely to use one or more contraindicated antiretroviral medication regimen. The remaining three statistically significant findings were from a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712459215">Chrischilles et al. (2004)</xref> that used a prospective cohort design to evaluate the effect of the Iowa Medicaid Pharmaceutical Case Management program. This program was targeted toward patients identified as being at high risk of experiencing medication-related adverse effects. In this study, the percentage of patients aged 65 years and older who were using a drug on the Beers list decreased by 14.3% from baseline to follow-up in the intervention group compared with 2.8% in the comparison group. The Beers list identifies medications that are potentially inappropriate for older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712459215">American Geriatrics Society 2012 Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel, 2012</xref>). In addition, the Medication Appropriateness Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1077558712459215">Samsa et al., 1994</xref>) revealed significant improvements from baseline to follow-up.</p>

<sec id="section14-1077558712459215">
<title>Immunization</title>
<p>One study evaluated the effect of a statewide policy change allowing pharmacist administration of immunization vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712459215">Grabenstein, Guess, Hartzema, Koch, &amp; Konrad, 2001</xref>). An adjacent state that did not allow pharmacist administration of these vaccines served as a comparison group. Among individuals who had not been vaccinated in the previous year, 34.7% were vaccinated the following year in the state that enacted the policy change compared with 23.9% in the comparison state (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). In addition, in the state that enacted the policy change, there was an increase of 9.2% in the percentage of people younger than 65 years who were vaccinated the following year compared with a decrease of 1.4% in the comparison state (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>

<sec id="section16-1077558712459215">
<title>Health Outcomes</title>
<p>The articles reviewed examined effects of the interventions on six types of health outcomes: blood pressure, blood glucose and HbA1c, lipids, pulmonary disease control, safety outcomes, and quality of life. The articles examined a total of 60 health outcomes. Of these, 18 (30.0%) were statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
<sec id="section17-1077558712459215">
<title>Blood pressure</title>
<p>Six studies evaluated the effects of interventions on blood pressure. Two of these studies, both using RCT designs, found no statistically significant effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712459215">Doucette et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077558712459215">McKenney et al., 1973</xref>). Of the 15 outcomes reported, 9 were statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 and favored the intervention group. Seven of the statistically significant effects were observed in three studies that used RCT designs. However, three of these outcomes were observed in a study that did not report the statistical significance of between-group comparisons involving blood pressure outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077558712459215">Park et al., 1996</xref>). Instead, the study assessed changes in blood pressure control within the intervention group over time. In one of the RCTs, 48.0% of patients in the intervention group were classified as having blood pressure at goal compared with 6.7% of patients in the control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077558712459215">Planas et al., 2009</xref>). Statistically significant differences reported in other studies were more modest, with differences in diastolic blood pressure ranging from 3.2 to 4.6 mmHg and differences in systolic blood pressure ranging from 3.7 to 12.3 mmHg.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1077558712459215">
<title>Blood glucose and HbA1c</title>
<p>Four studies evaluated the effects of interventions on either blood glucose or HbA1c. Of the eight outcomes reported, six were statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 and favored the intervention group. However, all of the statistically significant differences were observed in studies that used relatively weak research designs, either a before–after design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712459215">Berringer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712459215">Cranor, Bunting, &amp; Christensen, 2003</xref>) or a nonrandomized comparison group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712459215">Cranor &amp; Christensen, 2003</xref>). On average, HbA1c declined approximately 1% over time in these studies. One of these studies found that the percentage of patients with optimal HbA1c improved from less than 40% at baseline to more than 60% at follow-up. However, the only study that used an RCT design found no differences in HbA1c outcomes between groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712459215">Doucette et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Four studies evaluated the effects of interventions on safety outcomes, including American Heart Association Risk Factor prediction score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077558712459215">Nola et al., 2000</xref>), occurrence of opportunistic infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712459215">Hirsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712459215">Hirsch, Rosenquist et al., 2009</xref>), and rate of falls and injurious falls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712459215">Blalock et al., 2010</xref>).

<title>Other Outcome Measures</title>
<p>In addition to the behavioral and health outcomes described above, some studies evaluated effects of interventions on patient satisfaction, knowledge, and health care utilization. Findings for these outcomes are discussed below.</p>
<sec id="section24-1077558712459215">
<title>Patient satisfaction</title>
<p>Three studies assessed patient satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712459215">Cranor &amp; Christensen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712459215">Kradjan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1077558712459215">Weinberger et al., 2002b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712459215">Cranor and Christensen (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712459215">Kradjan et al.

<sec id="section25-1077558712459215">
<title>Knowledge</title>
<p>One study evaluated the effect of a hyperlipidemia disease management program on knowledge using a measure that had been used in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077558712459215">Nola et al., 2000</xref>). The program had no effect on this measure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1077558712459215">
<title>Health care utilization</title>
<p>Four studies evaluated the effects of interventions on health service utilization. Of the 11 outcomes reported, 3 were statistically significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, with all revealing greater utilization of health services in the intervention group. In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1077558712459215">Weinberger et al. (2002b)</xref>, the percentage of asthma patients who had a breathing-related emergency department visit or hospitalization was higher in the intervention group compared with the usual care control group (15.7% vs. 7.3%, respectively, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The other significant findings were observed by Cranor et al. in a study involving diabetes disease management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712459215">Cranor &amp; Christensen, 2003</xref>). From baseline to follow-up, this study found that (a) the average number of outpatient and inpatient claims with a diabetes diagnosis increased from 1.5 to 2.8 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and (b) the average number of total outpatient and inpatient claims increased from 5.2 to 7.4 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>

<title>Sensitivity Analyses</title>
<p>We performed two sensitivity analyses to determine if the outcomes reported in articles that we excluded due to high risk of bias were more likely to report beneficial intervention effects compared with included articles. The first analysis focused just on outcomes extracted from the 17 studies that were excluded due to a risk of bias. Of 86 outcomes abstracted from these 17 studies, 28 (32.6%) demonstrated beneficial effects, similar to our findings for the included studies.</p>
<p>The second analysis focused just on studies that were included in the Chisholm-Burns et al. review. This included a total of 26 studies, 15 that were included in our main review and 11 that were excluded following data extraction due to a high risk of bias. Of the 173 outcomes extracted from these studies, 58 (33.5%) demonstrated beneficial intervention effects. The 15 included and 11 excluded studies were similar with respect to the percentage of outcomes that demonstrated beneficial effects (32.0% vs. 35.7%, respectively).</p>

The figure is limited to seven outcomes that were reported both in the Chisholm-Burns et al. review and in at least three of the 21 articles included in our review. These outcomes are medication adherence, appropriate medication use, blood pressure, lipids, safety outcomes, quality of life, and patient satisfaction. As expected, the percentage of studies yielding favorable findings was lower in the community pharmacy–based studies than in the aggregated studies reported in the Chisholm-Burns et al. review. In the aggregated findings, the percentage of studies reporting favorable findings ranged from 84.7% for blood pressure to 12.9% for quality of life. In comparison, among the community pharmacy–based studies included in our review, the percentage of studies reporting favorable findings ranged from 50% for blood pressure to 0% for lipids, safety outcomes, and quality of life.</p>

<title>Analysis of Hypothesized Facilitating Factors</title>
<p>In this section, we discuss findings from the articles reviewed in relation to the seven factors hypothesized to facilitate the successful implementation of clinical services in community pharmacy settings: patient receptivity, pharmacists’ relationship with local physicians, communication among pharmacy staff, pharmacy layout, manpower issues, availability of external support to assist with program implementation, and reimbursement for clinical services provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1077558712459215">Roberts et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Three of the articles reviewed discussed patient receptivity to the intervention directly. One study evaluating an asthma pharmaceutical care program found that patients did not expect community pharmacists to provide clinical services and did not perceive the value of these services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712459215">Kradjan et al., 1999</xref>). Two other studies evaluating refill reminder interventions reported that patients were sometimes confused or annoyed by the reminders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712459215">Ascione et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077558712459215">Nietert et al., 2009</xref>). Participation rate may be another indicator of patient receptivity. Three of the studies reported that fewer than 25% of patients approached accepted invitations to participate in the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712459215">Blalock et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712459215">Gazmararian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077558712459215">Nola et al., 2000</xref>). Another study compared the outcomes of patients who primarily used community pharmacies that offered specialized services for HIV-positive patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712459215">Hirsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712459215">Hirsch, Rosenquist, et al., 2009</xref>). Because patients selected whether to use specialized versus traditional pharmacies, it is reasonable to speculate that those using the specialized pharmacies valued the services that they provided. Moreover, the percentage of patients using the specialized pharmacies increased from 5.9% in 2004 to 28.1% in 2007, suggesting that patient awareness and receptivity increased over time.</p>
<p>Several studies addressed issues related to the quality of the pharmacist–physician relationship. In most cases, this involved reporting the percentage of pharmacist recommendations that were accepted by the physician. Reported acceptance rates ranged from 28.6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712459215">Doucette et al., 2009</xref>) to 86% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1077558712459215">Zillich et al., 2005</xref>). Two articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712459215">Blalock et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712459215">Doucette et al., 2009</xref>) discussed difficulties that study pharmacists experienced when attempting to communicate with physicians. Finally, in a study involving refill reminders, 45% of the physicians contacted declined to participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077558712459215">Nietert et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Only one study described the processes through which pharmacy staff communicated with one another to coordinate service delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712459215">Berringer et al., 1999</xref>). This study found a significant reduction in blood glucose among study participants at a 12-month follow-up.</p>
<p>The only article that discussed a pharmacy layout issue indicated that inability to use the primary pharmacy computer to deliver the intervention may have resulted in inconsistent intervention implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1077558712459215">Weinberger et al., 2002b</xref>). In that study, pharmacists were required to access data on a separate computer located in the pharmacy each time a program participant filled a prescription. However, pharmacists actually accessed the data only 50% of the time and documented their actions only 50% of the times the data were accessed. This study found that the intervention, which targeted patients with reactive airways disease, improved peak expiratory flow rates in the intervention group compared with a usual care control group. However, no difference in this outcome was shown between the intervention group and a control group that received peak flow meters to facilitate self-monitoring.</p>
<p>Manpower issues were not discussed in a consistent way across articles. Only one article described how clinical services were integrated into the pharmacy workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712459215">Berringer et al., 1999</xref>). Three other articles indicated that a specific pharmacist or pharmacy residents were designated to deliver the intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712459215">Blalock et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712459215">Fincham &amp; Wallace, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077558712459215">McKenney et al., 1973</xref>). Another article suggested that lack of manpower may have limited the number of patients reached by the intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712459215">Chrischilles et al., 2004</xref>). This study evaluated the Iowa Medicaid Pharmaceutical Case Management program. This program targeted Medicaid patients who were at high risk for experiencing adverse drug reactions. Pharmacists were required to contact patients after receiving a list of the names of eligible patients from a central office. Of the 3,037 patients eligible for the program, only 690 received the services available. Although the investigators attributed this problem to pharmacy staffing issues, it is possible that patients declined the services when offered to them. Despite these issues, however, this study demonstrated substantial improvements in the quality of medication use among those participants who did receive the services available. Finally, in the study described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712459215">Hirsch, Rosenquist, et al. (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712459215">Hirsch et al. (2011)</xref>, intervention pharmacies were required to be able to begin offering medication therapy management services immediately after selection into the program and have qualified staff to identify patients who should receive the services available. This study demonstrated consistent positive effects of the intervention on measures of medication adherence and appropriate medication use.</p>
<p>None of the articles reviewed directly addressed the effect of the availability of external support in terms of either facilitating or hindering service delivery. However, three of the articles evaluated interventions that were delivered as part of employer-sponsored programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712459215">Cranor &amp; Christensen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712459215">Cranor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712459215">John et al., 2006</xref>) and three other articles evaluated interventions that were delivered as part of statewide Medicaid programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712459215">Chrischilles et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712459215">Hirsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077558712459215">Hirsch, Oen, Robertson, Nguyen, &amp; Daniels, 2009</xref>). In all these studies, pharmacists were compensated for the clinical services they provided. It seems likely that participating pharmacies may have received additional support from the sponsoring organizations. However, the articles provided little information concerning the nature or extent of support that was available.</p>
<p>Nine of the articles reported that pharmacists were reimbursed for the clinical services they provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712459215">Chrischilles et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712459215">Cranor &amp; Christensen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712459215">Cranor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712459215">Doucette et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712459215">Grabenstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712459215">Hirsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077558712459215">Hirsch, Rosenquist, et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077558712459215">John et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1077558712459215">Zillich et al., 2005</xref>). These articles tended to report more favorable outcomes compared with the other articles reviewed. However, only two of the studies reported in these articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077558712459215">Kradjan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1077558712459215">Zillich et al., 2005</xref>) used RCT designs. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether reimbursing pharmacists for the clinical services provided had an impact on the effectiveness of the intervention.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many studies conducted over the past 40 years have demonstrated the beneficial effects that pharmacist-provided direct patient care services can have on patient health outcomes. In their recent systematic review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712459215">Chisholm-Burns et al. (2010)</xref> concluded that “Pharmacist-provided direct patient care has favorable effects across various patient outcomes, health care settings, and disease states.” Because community pharmacists are among the most accessible health care providers, community pharmacist-provided clinical services have the potential to have a major impact on patient health outcomes. However, only 29 of the studies reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712459215">Chisholm-Burns et al. (2010)</xref> were conducted in community pharmacy settings. Moreover, our findings suggest that the evidence supporting the effectiveness of pharmacist-provided direct patient care services in this setting is more limited. The 21 articles included in our review were less likely to report favorable intervention effects than suggested in the review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712459215">Chisholm-Burns et al. (2010)</xref> in which study findings were aggregated across diverse practice settings. Only 50 of the 134 outcomes (37.3%) examined in the 21 articles that we reviewed revealed statistically significant between-group differences or changes over time that were consistent with beneficial intervention effects. Moreover, in studies that used RCT designs only 20% of the outcomes examined demonstrated statistically significant beneficial effects.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that setting matters. As reflected by the conceptual model that guided this review, the effectiveness of patient care services can be affected by many factors operating at different levels of the ecological framework. Unfortunately, most of the articles reviewed provided little information about factors that can affect intervention effectiveness, including patient receptivity to the services offered. This makes it impossible to assess the impact of different factors on intervention effectiveness. However, some general observations are possible that may account for the limited effectiveness of the community pharmacy–based interventions that we reviewed.</p>
<p>First, several studies noted difficulties that participating pharmacists experienced when communicating with physicians, sometimes reflected in low acceptance rates of pharmacist recommendations. As noted by others, developing strong collaborative relationships with physicians and other prescribers is likely to be critical to the success of pharmacist-delivered interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077558712459215">Kellerman &amp; Kirk, 2007</xref>). Therefore, future studies should attend carefully to this issue in the planning stages and report the processes and structures put in place to ensure that adequate collaborative relationships were established and maintained over the course of the study.</p>
<p>Second, several studies noted that patient receptivity to the interventions evaluated was mixed. Because most patients do not expect clinical services to be offered at community pharmacies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1077558712459215">Worley et al., 2007</xref>), they may not understand why the services are being offered, how they might benefit, and how the new services will be coordinated with the care they currently receive from other health care providers. Future research in this area should systematically assess patient receptivity, including knowledge of services, outcome expectations (both positive and negative), perceived barriers to care, and skills that may be needed to either access or fully participate in care delivery. In addition, changes in patient receptivity should be tracked longitudinally, as the findings from one study suggest that receptivity increases over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077558712459215">Hirsch et al., 2011</xref>), as would be expected based on the literature concerning the dissemination of innovations.</p>
<p>Third, pharmacists were reimbursed for the services they delivered in several of the studies reviewed and these studies tended to yield more positive findings, suggesting beneficial intervention effects, compared with the remaining studies. Reimbursement is likely to increase pharmacist motivation to engage in service delivery. Thus, reimbursement may enhance fidelity to intervention protocols. However, because reimbursement was usually provided by insurance providers, other systems-level factors may account for the differences observed.</p>
<p>Finally, it appears that lack of adequate manpower and pharmacy layout issues may have limited the effectiveness of the interventions evaluated in two of the studies reviewed. However, information concerning these factors was not discussed consistently enough to know the extent to which they may have attenuated the effectiveness of interventions in other studies as well.</p>
<p>Our findings highlight the need for rigorous, systematic research to better understand the patient-level, pharmacist-level, pharmacy-level, and health system–level factors that can affect the effectiveness of direct patient care services provided by community pharmacists. Without understanding the factors that are critical for success, investigators are likely to weaken interventions that have demonstrated effectiveness in other settings when attempting to implement them in the community pharmacy setting.</p>
<p>Implementation research is also needed to understand the mechanisms through which pharmacist-provided patient care services may lead to improved patient outcomes. Identifying all hypothesized intervention outcomes a priori, including hypothesized mediating and moderating variables, would allow for more complete evaluation of intervention effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712459215">DeVellis &amp; Blalock, 2008</xref>). In addition, future research evaluating pharmacist-provided direct patient care services in community pharmacy settings should use adequate research methods to ensure internal validity. Inadequate sample sizes, lack of fidelity to intervention protocols, and insensitive outcome measures may have contributed to the null findings that we observed.</p>
<p>This review has several limitations. First, we relied on published articles. Because studies with null results are less likely to be published, our findings may overestimate the effectiveness of pharmacist patient care services delivered in community pharmacy settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1077558712459215">Song et al., 2010</xref>). Second, we relied entirely on information reported in published reports of study findings. These reports often provided limited information concerning the exact services that were delivered or intervention intensity. Third, the information available was not sufficient to support a meta-analysis. Therefore, our conclusions are based on a qualitative synthesis of study findings.</p>
<p>In conclusion, community pharmacies are an important component of the health care system. They are widespread, located in nearly every community across the United States, providing easy access for most patients. Increasing community pharmacist involvement in patient care has the potential to help solve many of the medication use problems that currently plague our health system. However, we are unlikely to realize this potential unless future intervention studies address the unique barriers present in the community pharmacy setting that can compromise intervention effectiveness and the factors operating at different levels of the ecological framework that are necessary to increase the chances of success. Thus, we hope that this review will serve as a call-to-action for the development of theoretically informed community pharmacy–based interventions that address the implementation issues that may have limited the effectiveness of past intervention attempts.</p>
