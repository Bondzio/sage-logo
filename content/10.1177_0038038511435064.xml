<abstract>
<p>The relevance of community in the face of mounting individualism remains a pressing sociological issue. Social fragmentation challenges traditional communities of shared identifications and collective memberships while flexible relationship options lead sociologists to question the real benefits of friendships and the viability of personal commitments. These issues are sharply defined in current debates about ‘gay community’ and whether sexual practices can generate solidarity among a diversified social group. AIDS educators have long relied on notions of ‘gay community attachment’ and sociologists enthusiastically explore the innovative potential of gay and lesbian friendships for rethinking community today. Drawing evidence from a national e-male survey of the social relationships and sexual behaviour of over 4000 gay and bisexual men, we suggest that community pessimism is exaggerated. We contest unified sexualized notions of (gay) community and identify a potential for solidarity within these men’s friendships, sexual relationships and personal communities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Debate about ‘gay community’ has been extended and fraught (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038038511435064">Barrett and Pollack, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038038511435064">Fraser, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038038511435064">Gamson and Moone, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038038511435064">Green, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0038038511435064">Kippax et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0038038511435064">Ridge et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0038038511435064">Rowe and Dowsett, 2008</xref>), raising issues that divide health researchers and academics within sexuality studies and sociology. Gay community attachment has been an important idea in health policy and political mobilization. However, collectivized and sexualized notions of community ignore the diversity within the gay scene and new research on post traditional communities and the personal sources of solidarity. The tendency to link gay community to the ‘shared experiences of a transgressive sexuality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038038511435064">Irvine, 1994</xref>: 238) is well documented. Writing in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038038511435064">1956</xref>, Lesnoff and Westley (p. 257) described a socially isolated ‘homosexual community’ whose identification with ‘constituent social groups’ ultimately derived from shared sexual preferences. Subsequent studies of ‘gay community’ replicated social divisions, implying ‘that lesbian and gay individuals inhabit communities … completely set off from the rest of society, that they are members of an altogether different culture and even a different species’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0038038511435064">Stein and Plummer, 1994</xref>: 179). Defenders of gay community advocate its importance in the collective lives of many homosexual men, and critics assert that the zeitgeist and historical basis for a gay community have gone. However, both groups characterize community in surprisingly similar and collectivizing terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038511435064">Altman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038038511435064">Fraser, 2008</xref>: 248; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0038038511435064">Ridge et al., 1997</xref>), emphasizing the shared social characteristics derived from sexual experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038038511435064">Fraser, 2008</xref>: 248; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0038038511435064">Ridge et al., 1997</xref>: 147–8). A central problem emerging from this framing of gay community is that the prospects for any sort of solidarity disappear in the context of the growing fragmentation of the gay ‘scene’, sexual diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0038038511435064">Ridge et al., 1997</xref>: 150) and the processes of individualization that characterize late modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0038038511435064">Dowsett, 2009</xref>). New research on personal relationships and friendships shows a potential for solidarity which contests the polarization between individualization and community. Building on this research, our article attempts to build a bridge between research on gay men’s friendships and personal communities in an analysis of national data on men’s personal relationships we obtained from an e-male survey of gay men.</p>
<p>From the 1960s, researchers began studying homosexuality in social groups. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0038038511435064">Stein and Plummer (1994</xref>: 179) argued, the category of ‘the homosexual’ was applied ‘to the investigation of every nook and cranny of lesbian and gay life: bars, communities, identities, tearooms, and the like’. These ethnographies were paralleled by sociological interest in symbolic interactionism, labelling theory and social constructionism. This showed that sexuality was socially constructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0038038511435064">Plummer, 1982</xref>: 238) and tied the study of homosexuality to a ‘denaturalizing project’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038038511435064">Gamson and Moone, 2004</xref>: 48). Changing concepts of gay community have since reflected the varying status of lesbians and gays in society from a ‘deviant subculture’ to a ‘minority group’, a ‘community’, and a ‘movement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038038511435064">Epstein, 1994</xref>: 194). However, concepts of gay community remained confined to sexually bounded shared experiences. In the 1980s, Denis Altman wrote about ‘the homosexualisation of America’, noting a ‘certain sameness’ within local neighbourhood, culture and sexual values and suggesting on this basis that homosexual men were ‘members of a new community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038511435064">1982</xref>: 35).The threat of AIDS reinforced this sense of a distinctive but marginalized identity, ‘a community of people … stigmatized and … isolated from mainstream society, having to close ranks and draw largely on its own resources’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0038038511435064">Kippax et al., 1993</xref>). By the early 1990s, queer scholars rejected gay community as a ‘monolithic unit of analysis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038038511435064">Gamson and Moone, 2004</xref>), highlighting instead diverse sexual cultures, ‘nonstandard intimacies’, performativity and identity over community. Simultaneously, concern about AIDS positioned ‘gay community attachment’ centrally within public health strategies and placed it on a head-on collision course with the emergent queer theory. While queer theorists had concluded that a sexualized gay community was unviable, public health researchers maintained that ‘gay men in saunas, steam rooms and pubs’ facilitated community attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0038038511435064">Kippax et al., 1993</xref>: 109; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0038038511435064">Rowe and Dowsett, 2008</xref>). They rationalized that:
<disp-quote>
<p>… men who were immersed in gay community life, socially, politically, and sexually – the ‘fast lane’ gay men, the men with many partners – were, seemingly paradoxically, also the men who were at least risk because they had adopted condom use to protect themselves and their sexual partners. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0038038511435064">Kippax et al., 1993</xref>: 109)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In other research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038511435064">Connell (1992</xref>: 747) showed that gay community attachment was complicated by gender and hegemonic masculinity: ‘many men who have sex with men never enter a gay community … [and] some men who do enter a gay community have additional significant moments in the construction of sexuality’. There was no automatic connection between homosexual encounters and identification with a gay community because ‘developing and acting on sexual and gender identity is muddy, conflicted and provisional’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038038511435064">Green, 2002</xref>: 539). Gay community attachment was also affected by class, age, ethnicity, heterosexual family commitments and different gender identifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038038511435064">Barrett and Pollack, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038511435064">Connell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0038038511435064">Ridge et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0038038511435064">Sullivan and Jackson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0038038511435064">Taylor and Rupp, 2006</xref>). Moreover:
<disp-quote>
<p>… members of some of these subcultures … rarely, if ever, meet as they work, live and socialize in different geographic and social spaces. For example, not all lesbians and gay men participate in the ‘scene’, electing not to go to gay ghettos, bars, saunas, shopping areas or nightclubs, and they often hold different agendas and strategies for political action. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0038038511435064">Sullivan and Jackson, 1999</xref>: 21)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The combined effect of such research highlighted the limits of linking ‘gay community’ to sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0038038511435064">Ridge et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0038038511435064">Rowe and Dowsett, 2008</xref>), leading some researchers to substitute the acronym MSM, meaning ‘men who have sex with men’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038038511435064">Barrett and Pollack, 2005</xref>: n.1, 454) and others to abandon the term altogether.</p>
<p>Emerging from this debate is a larger question not just about the viability of gay community but about the viability of any community in late modernity anchored in shared identifications and collective memberships. The debate has centred around processes of individualization, ‘that increasingly questions and tends to break up people’s traditional rhythm of life … people are being forced to piece together their own biographies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038038511435064">Beck-Gernsheim, 1999</xref>: 57). When applied to the family, for example, this theory emphasizes the shift from a community of need to elective community.</p>
<p>Whereas traditional communities generated solidarity from collective obligations, individualized solidarity within elective communities depends on ‘personal inclinations, feelings and motives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038038511435064">Beck-Gernsheim, 1999</xref>: 59). Although reaction to individualization has spawned claims about ‘a world of casual, fleeting ties’, this approach, aptly described as the see-saw model of community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038038511435064">Lichterman, 1995</xref>), has been contested by community researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0038038511435064">Spencer and Pahl, 2006</xref>: 109). For example, Crow showed that neighbourly relations are not weakening with increasing privatization: ‘Rejecting the stark opposition between presence or absence of community allows recognition that several styles of neighbouring are possible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0038038511435064">Crow et al., 2002</xref>: 128). Their study revealed that individualization did not inhibit neighbour relations, but fostered ‘friendly distance’, some reciprocity and a tolerance of neighbours’ differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0038038511435064">2002</xref>: 142). Moreover, Savage (2008) found that ‘elective belonging’ or identification with place better reflects community. Moreover, in other research personal motivations and a desire for intimacy were seen to contribute to civic associations and community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038038511435064">Lichterman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0038038511435064">Wilkinson, 2010a</xref>). In combination, this research questions the dichotomy between the individual and community. Rather, these studies show that new community formations are emerging from a rebalancing ‘between individualization and communification’. A key theme here is that in late modernity ‘individualism and solidarity are intimately connected rather than being in tension with one another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038038511435064">Crow, 2002</xref>: 2). As we now examine, nowhere is this more starkly in evidence than in the research on friendships and personal communities.</p>

<title>Friendship, Families of Choice and Personal Communities</title>
<p>The modern friendship ideal emphasizes the qualities of a personal relationship as both ‘optional and expressive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038038511435064">Carrier, 1999</xref>: 135). Friendship is a voluntary relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0038038511435064">Friedman, 1993</xref>: 215) that ‘offers a way of inventing and re-inventing the self’ (O’Connor, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0038038511435064">Pahl and Pevalin, 2005</xref>: 435). It has thus been claimed that friendships exemplify the conditions of freedom in late modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038038511435064">Allan, 2008</xref>: 9), having ‘a degree of flexibility in their construction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038038511435064">2008</xref>: 5). Such claims raise questions about the potential within friendship for solidarity. These issues emerged sharply around research on gay men’s friendships and families of choice. Increasing research from the 1990s about friendships among same-sex couples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038038511435064">Nardi, 1992b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0038038511435064">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038038511435064">Nardi and Sherrod, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0038038511435064">Weston, 1991</xref>) underlined the contribution of informal personal relations to gay community. Gay friendship offered unique support and self-acceptance unavailable in heterosexual social institutions, suggesting that sexuality was vital to community definitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038038511435064">Nardi, 1992b</xref>: 109; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038038511435064">Nardi and Sherrod, 1994</xref>: 195). Research on families of choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0038038511435064">Weeks et al., 2001</xref>) positioned the study of gay men’s friendships more centrally within sociological debates about friendship and the future of family. Friendships provided lesbians and gay men with alternative sources of identity and family support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038038511435064">Nardi and Sherrod, 1994</xref>: 197). Moreover, the emphasis on ‘choice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0038038511435064">Weeks et al., 2001</xref>: 5) linked friendship explicitly to individualization and personal identification, thereby igniting heated debate about whether the research was more generally indicative of ‘a new pattern of individual life choices and narratives that many people are adopting in a rapidly changing world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0038038511435064">2001</xref>: 5, 8, 21). The key issue was not just whether friendship was replacing the genealogical family, but whether community and solidarity had been eclipsed by elective relationships:
<disp-quote>
<p>… those who emphasize increasing ‘choice’ and who then attempt to relate that to an imputed ‘individualization’, overstate their case … people are not choosing in a social supermarket of potential friends and filling their baskets with different friends for different purposes to take to the check-out as their ‘identity-making kit’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0038038511435064">Pahl and Pevalin, 2005</xref>: 438)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Research on personal communities took the debate beyond the family into community studies, whilst retaining a distinct emphasis on personal relationships. Originally developed through neighbourhood studies of ‘ego-centric networks’, personal communities were self-selected, individuated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0038038511435064">Wellman, 1979</xref>: 1211), and provided voluntary rather than obligatory informal support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0038038511435064">Wellman, 1993</xref>: 433). The framework was extended to include a more diverse network of personal ties including family, friends, colleagues and neighbours. Research on the meaning of these ties to individuals opened analysis to the more diverse sources of belonging and identification, which have since become markers of personal communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038038511435064">Wellman and Wortley, 1990</xref>: 559). In addition, personal communities seek especially to demonstrate the ‘community-like properties’ of committed personal relations, described as hidden solidarity. Despite additional research on gay friendships and personal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0038038511435064">Roseneil and Budgeon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0038038511435064">Smart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0038038511435064">Stacey, 2004</xref>), there has been no systematic attempt to analyse gay men’s interpersonal networks using a personal communities approach. This study builds on prior research on gay friendships to develop an alternative research framework for exploring gay men’s communities. Using national data from the e-male survey, we argue that the personal communities approach better recognizes gay men’s diverse sources of support and belonging. It is to that task we now turn.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0038038511435064" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The data come from the e-male survey of 5062 homosexually active men in 2007. Respondents were recruited largely online (81%), via banner advertisements on gay dating websites, email and community websites, while smaller proportions were recruited through offline methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0038038511435064">Rawstorne et al., 2009</xref>). Only respondents over 16 currently living in Australia, identifying as gay, bisexual, queer, expressing same-sex attraction, or who had sex with a man in the last five years were eligible. One in 10 of all eligible respondents were routed to a separate qualitative component, randomly assigned two of three items on 1) sexual encounters, 2) gay community, and 3) friendships and happiness, and were invited to respond to these. As the analysis of the qualitative data is incomplete, we have not included it here.</p>
<p>Of the 4240 men available for quantitative analysis, 3198 completed all relevant questions yielding a response rate of 75.4 per cent. The sample proportion recruited from the eight Australian States and Territories approximately corresponded to the proportions found in the most recent Australian Census of adults. The mean age of the sample was 35.5 years but the modal age was young (21 years). Most respondents were Australian born (82%) and fewer than 3 per cent spoke a language other than English at home. Some 61 per cent were employed full-time, while 32 per cent worked part-time, were self-employed or full-time students. A minority (8%) were retired. Respondents were well educated (40% university educated); only 13 per cent had not completed high school and 1 per cent were still at school. Two-thirds of the sample earned above the national average. Half the sample lived alone (29%) or with a male partner, and only 17 per cent lived with their parents. Over three-quarters (78%) described themselves as homosexual, gay or queer. The remainder identified as bisexual (19%). Over 80 per cent of these men reported sex with a male in the last six months, 12 per cent reported sex with female partners and roughly 8 per cent reported no sex with partners of either sex in last 12 months. Some 31 per cent of the sample had not been tested for HIV status in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Since this a self-selected sample recruited predominantly from internet sites, representativeness cannot be assured. Without official statistics and because sexual preference data is not collected in the five-yearly national census, representativeness is judged by comparing similar large surveys and knowledge about self-selected internet recruited samples.</p>
<p>The other large-scale survey about this population is the Gay Periodic Survey (GPS). Conducted in capital cities around Australia using a time/location sampling frame, this recruits men directly at gay social venues, gay sex-on-premises venues, gay men’s clinics and the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Fair Day. Although around 70 per cent responded, this method produces ‘convenience samples that may not be generalized to the whole population of MSM’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0038038511435064">Zablotska et al., 2006</xref>: 3). Undertaken in the context of HIV-AIDS prevention, respondents complete a questionnaire on sexual identification, types of sexual relationships, number of partners and nature of sexual activity.</p>
<p>By comparison, the e-male survey recruited more men who were under 25, bisexual, from rural locations, had never been tested for HIV and were homosexually active but not gay-identified. Since both surveys are non-probability samples, it is difficult to interpret what the comparison means for generalizability. Considering survey responses, bisexual men seem far less likely to visit gay venues and therefore are probably under-represented in the GPS. Reliance on self-selected surveys also affects the representation of other social groups, including older people, poorly educated and low income earners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0038038511435064">Chang and Krosnick, 2009</xref>). Because both the GPS and e-male survey have low proportions of these under-represented groups, we advise caution about generalizing from either sample. Nonetheless, within this seemingly educated, middle-class group of men, the survey provides large-scale data on collective and personal forms of community on which this article is based.</p>
<p>The survey combined questions from social capital surveys including trust and civic participation, items on gay community attachment and items on personal ties with family and friends. To investigate the nature and strength of different personal ties and their potential for solidarity, we included items on intimacy, commitment, reciprocity and practical assistance. Personal community research has previously relied on network analysis or has been qualitative, using personal community maps and interviews to explore the meaning of personal ties. Our quantitative data provide different and complementary evidence on personal communities, allowing ‘fuller analyses of the patterning of connections that join the different members of the network to one another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038038511435064">Allan and Phillipson, 2008</xref>: 165).</p>

<title>Gay Community Attachment</title>
<p>We first review evidence about gay community using the model of community attachment which underpinned sexual health promotion strategies in the early 1990s. This measured three types of engagement: sexual, social and community. More recently, researchers have collapsed this distinction into an inclusive measure of ‘gay social engagement’, using numbers of gay friends and time spent with them as indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038038511435064">Dowsett, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0038038511435064">Rawstorne et al., 2009</xref>). However, we retain the original distinctions to explore the precise patterns of association and breakdown between sexual and sociable relations which are central to our argument. Thus in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0038038511435064">Figure 1</xref>, types of sexual, social and civil activity are represented on the vertical axis, while the frequency of participation is indicated on the horizontal.</p>

</fig>
<p>By far the most common association shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0038038511435064">Figure 1</xref> is social – visiting bars, cafés and restaurants frequented by gay or bisexual men. About a third (34.4%) of respondents visited bars most months or more frequently. A further third (33.8%) visited these spots some months or at least once a year. The third most popular group of socializing activities is sporting, recreation or hobby groups with 56.7 per cent participating at least annually and one-fifth participating most months. High frequencies of partying were reported. More than half our sample (52.4%) attended a dance party at least once during the year, with one in six (14.4%) doing this most months or more frequently. However, the rates of visiting pools, beaches or gyms commonly used by gay or bisexual men were very low, with just 2.5 per cent visiting in the last year and only 0.3 per cent visiting a resort or holiday destination frequented by gay or bisexual men in the previous year.</p>
<p>Nearly 40 per cent of respondents attended events organized specifically for gay, lesbian or bisexual groups (e.g. Midsumma, Pride or Mardi Gras) at least once a year, with about a quarter reporting monthly or more frequent attendance. Participation in AIDS organizations occurred less regularly although 36.1 per cent participated in the past year. A comparison with civic participation rates for the general population provides a context for interpreting gay and same-sex participation. The majority of our respondents (55.2%) visited arts or cultural venues in the last 12 months, which is almost double the national average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0038038511435064">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2010</xref>). A strong cohort participated in organizations associated with gay community, including HIV/AIDS or health organizations (36.1%) and civil rights, human rights or environmental groups (31.3%). These rates are consistent with the national average for the rate of voluntary association in trade unions, political parties or professional associations (28.4%) and involvement with religious, church or spiritual groups (22.8%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0038038511435064">Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Attendance at saunas and sex clubs was low (especially when compared with the Gay Periodic Survey). Around 90 per cent had not attended in the last year, a low rate even allowing for the fact that our sample was drawn largely from online dating sites. The leather scene attracted an even smaller cohort, with only 5.3 per cent of respondents active in the last 12 months. On the other hand, 16.9 per cent of respondents reported going to private sex parties.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that homosexually active men exhibit a pattern of complex, somewhat compartmentalized community participation as reflected in social, civil and sexual engagement. Significantly, participation in social venues like bars and restaurants is popular with even higher participation in dance parties and other large events – an engagement which can only be matched by participation rates for sports and hobbies (56.7%). The emerging pattern shown in our three categories of community attachment is that homosexually active men are extremely sociable and maintain levels of civic engagement higher than the Australian national average. In contrast, the low interest in public sex venues is striking, challenging the relevance of sexuality in defining gay community attachment. The figures for attendance at invited sex parties (alongside the interest in private parties) suggest a slight tendency towards socializing and sexual activities in private rather than commercial settings.</p>
<p>However, researchers argue that low levels of sexual engagement in commercial venues can be at least partly explained by the increased popularity of the internet as a new social space which enables the same mix of sexual and sociable engagement as gay bars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0038038511435064">Rowe and Dowsett, 2008</xref>). AIDS educators have thus been keen to explore the internet as a possible site of safe sex information sharing. While survey results suggest that the internet may well represent an increasingly important arena for ‘hooking up’ with other gay men for sex, the evidence we next present suggests a very different interpretation. Our findings certainly confirm high internet use for sex. Yet they also demonstrate a potential for friendship and sociability not visible within the analysis of gay community attachment.</p>

<sec id="section5-0038038511435064">
<title>Friends with Real Benefits</title>
<p>When we asked respondents what they hoped to find when browsing gay websites, 55 per cent wanted casual sex partners, with a slightly smaller percentage (48%) seeking ‘men whom I can regularly meet for sex’ (e.g. ‘fuck buddies’) and 12 per cent seeking cybersex partners. The strong sexual motive is not surprising, given our recruitment methods, with Gaydar supplying 26 per cent, Manhunt 19 per cent and other websites 18 per cent. Significantly, however, 55 per cent said they were looking for friends, while 41 per cent were seeking chat buddies and 36 per cent were seeking people with similar interests and hobbies. The desire for sociability and friendship was very strong, equally matching the sexual motive. This conspicuous overlap between those seeking sex and those seeking friends was clearer still following cross tabulation of responses to questions about the amount of free time spent online on various activities. This confirmed that wanting to find friends online is significantly associated with increased hours spent searching for male sexual partners (Chi-square = 47.399, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.0005, 4df).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0038038511435064">1</xref></sup> Seeking friendship was also significantly associated with seeking casual sex (Chi-square = 42.431, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.0005, 1df) or ‘fuck buddies’. Cross tabulation revealed the overlap flowed in both directions so that, within the group of ‘friend-seekers’, 59 per cent were also looking for ‘casual sex partners’ and roughly 53 per cent were looking for ‘fuck buddies’, suggesting a strong blending of motives. Their aims were realized too: 88 per cent of those seeking casual sex and 76 per cent seeking regular sex partners got lucky. Moreover, 81 per cent of those seeking regular conversation (chat buddies) succeeded and a staggering 80 per cent of those seeking friends actually found them. Most striking of all is that nearly two-thirds of all respondents claimed they found friends when they had actually gone looking for sex. The online picture painted here reflects a different balance between sex and sociability than that revealed by our previous analysis of offline community attachment. Where those results indicated low attendance rates at public sex venues and high interest in socializing, these online findings suggest a strong interest in both sex and sociability and a complex overlap between them.</p>
<p>What can we make of this connection between sex and sociability? One hypothesis is that the term ‘friend’ is very general, meaning only an acquaintance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038038511435064">Morgan, 2009</xref>). In earlier research, the term was by far the most common label people used either to describe an associate who had no specific or clearly defined relationship to them, or someone with whom they shared similar interests, hobbies or social activity. In particular, conversation or ‘discussing a pastime’ was significant ‘in the odds of being called a friend’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038038511435064">Fischer, 1982</xref>: 294). In this context, the term ‘friend’ may not mean an intimate but someone you hang out with in a sociable way. Our findings show that seeking sex was often linked to the desire for sociability (67% seeking conversation and hobby chat). Commentary on friends with benefits relationships (FWBR) defines them as ‘hanging out and hooking up’, implying a casual blending of sociability and sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038038511435064">Denizet-Lewis, 2004</xref>). As Hughes et al. observe, ‘friends with benefits … appear to defy the conceptualization that friendship and sexuality cannot co-exist’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038038511435064">2005</xref>: 50). Research on FWBR suggests that the key motivation is the ‘benefit’ of sex with someone you know and trust, without the commitment. From this standpoint, friendship appears infinitely flexible and elastic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038038511435064">Allan, 2008</xref>). However, our research suggests a different balance between flexibility and commitment, which builds on other research on friendships among gay men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038038511435064">Nardi, 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038038511435064">Nardi and Sherrod, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0038038511435064">Roseneil and Budgeon, 2004</xref>). Nardi argued that friendship provides gay men with the support and recognition usually provided by heterosexual families. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038038511435064">Allan (1979)</xref>, Nardi argued that gay men’s friendships are shaped by social structures so that sexuality was a frequent component of their relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038038511435064">Nardi, 1992a</xref>: 173–85, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038038511435064">1992b</xref>: 108–20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038038511435064">Nardi and Sherrod, 1994</xref>: 195). Although the blending of sex and friendship did not include ‘best friends’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038038511435064">Nardi and Sherrod, 1994</xref>: 195), sexual relationships often develop into friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038038511435064">Nardi, 1992a</xref>: 182). Similarly, as Stacey shows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0038038511435064">2004</xref>: 190), ‘Anonymous gay sexual encounters do not ordinarily lead to conjugal coupling, but not infrequently they commence enduring friendships that evolve into kin-like ties, whether or not sexual interest continues.’ Other research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038038511435064">Nardi and Sherrod, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0038038511435064">Roseneil and Budgeon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0038038511435064">Weeks et al., 2001</xref>) supports this, highlighting the potential for intimacy, support and care within [a] ‘blurring of the boundaries, and movement between, friendship and sexual relationships … ’. The fact that 66 per cent of our respondents reported developing friendships from casual sexual encounters supports this body of qualitative research, inverting the balance within FWBR to suggest that one ‘real benefit’ of sex may be friendship itself.</p>

<title>Personal Communities</title>
<p>Having explored the potential for friendships to develop out of sexual encounters we turn now to examine the broader networks of gay men’s personal relations. Drawing on previous research, we recognize that close associations have a twin potential for intimacy and solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0038038511435064">Oliker, 1998</xref>: 20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0038038511435064">Silver, 1989</xref>: 274; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0038038511435064">Simmel, 1950</xref>: 126; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0038038511435064">Spencer and Pahl, 2006</xref>: 41). In our analysis, these two dimensions of personal relationships are evaluated using four items from Wright’s intimacy scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0038038511435064">Parks and Floyd, 1996</xref>). The first two are designed to measure self-disclosure and the communicative aspect of intimacy while the second two items are designed to measure relationship commitment. The scores for these four items when broken down by categories of friends and close associates are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0038038511435064">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Disclosure and Commitment</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0038038511435064">Figure 2</xref> shows that the patterns of intimacy and the strength of ties vary significantly across different categories of friends and close associates. Our respondents have strong ties to all groups of intimates with the strongest being to their families. The pattern of disclosure is different, showing that commitment levels and disclosure are not always aligned with the same groups. There is also a variation within the friendship groups according to gender and sexual preference, as shown by the contrasting propensities towards disclosing intimacy and commitment between female and male friends. Notably, gay and bisexual men are not as comfortable expressing ‘exactly how I feel’ to straight male friends (51.4%) or family (48.4%) as they do to other groups. However, they felt they could express themselves honestly with other gay and bisexual men (69%) and with female friends (70.1%). They felt most comfortable about sharing confidences with women since around two-thirds (65.3%) agreed that they confide ‘almost anything’ to female friends. Just less than half of the respondents felt they could confide in family and relatives (48.4%) or straight male friends (46%).</p>
<p>This pattern of intimacy is different from gay men’s responses on relationship commitment. Generally, commitment is high for every category of intimates on both items used to measure commitment. Between 70 and 80 per cent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that these relationships were ‘very important’ to them and 80 to 90 per cent agreed that maintaining their relationships was ‘important to them’. Specifically, the level of agreement that these relationships are ‘very important’ is highest for female friends (85%), second highest for straight male friends (83%), and lower for offline gay and bisexual friends (80%). Levels of agreement with the statement ‘I make a great effort to maintain my relationship’ reflect a similar pattern of strong commitment to most of the separate groups. Once again, the highest level of commitment is to female friends (78%), followed by straight male friends at 73 per cent and 70 per cent for gay and bisexual friends. Most striking of all was the fact that gay men thought their family relationships were important to them (89%) and worked hard to maintain them (81%).</p>
<p>These results reveal a complex pattern of intimacy and commitment which is differentiated across various groups and social divisions. This differentiation is further explored below in an analysis of responses to four additional questions about trust, reciprocity, financial support and emotional support in cases of relationship breakdown (not reflected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0038038511435064">Figure 2</xref>). This builds on other research on social support and friendship, showing that solidarity is demonstrated by looking out for the other, being trustworthy, acting reciprocally and providing emotional and practical support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0038038511435064">Spencer and Pahl, 2006</xref>: 83–6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038038511435064">Wellman and Wortley, 1990</xref>: 560). Generally, there are high levels of trust and expectations of reciprocity for all categories of intimates. Results follow similar patterns to results on other commitment items presented earlier, both in their measured strength and in the order of ranking. While agreement that these intimates ‘can be trusted to act in their best interests’ ranges from 70 per cent to 88 per cent, expectations that close associates ‘would help each other out’ are even higher, ranging from 78 per cent to 88 per cent. Specifically, of gay men’s various types of friends, women are consistently identified first as the most likely source of interpersonal trust (80.3%) and reciprocal assistance (83.3%), followed next by straight male friends (76.7% and 79.1%) and third, perhaps surprisingly, by offline gay and bisexual friends (71% and 77.4%) respectively. Strikingly, respondents overwhelmingly agree that their family and relatives are willing to ‘look out for me and act in my best interests’ (86%) and that ‘we are willing to help each other out’ (87%). These indications are confirmed by our findings on financial support. When asked whom they could approach for ‘financial support in an emergency’, almost half the respondents (46%) said ‘family members or relatives’, 34 per cent nominated a female friend, while roughly a quarter suggested they would seek help from gay and straight male friends.</p>
<p>Leaving the question of gendered intimacies aside, we see an emerging pattern of family-inclined commitment. With respect to trust, reciprocity and financial support, family members and relatives are rated highly. The one exception is emotional support when same-sex relationships break down. Thus, in these matters of the heart, our results are consistent with earlier research on gay men’s friendships, with 65 per cent preferring their gay and bisexual friends to any other intimates. When this occurred, gay and bisexual friends were favoured even to female friends (42%) who, as already outlined, were the preferred recipients of confidences (66%). Respondents were reluctant to discuss emotional issues with their families (29%), the group to whom they were otherwise most committed.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has shown how relevant personal communities are to gay men. In developing our analysis, we have taken debate about gay community beyond the idea of a sexually bounded collectivity. Our results and accompanying argument locate debates about the future of gay community more centrally within sociological research on personal community. This acknowledges research on changes to gay community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038511435064">Altman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038511435064">Connell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038038511435064">Epstein, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038038511435064">Gamson and Moone, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038038511435064">Green, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038038511435064">Irvine, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0038038511435064">Nardi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0038038511435064">Roseneil and Budgeon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0038038511435064">Stein and Plummer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0038038511435064">Weeks et al., 2001</xref>). It also recognizes that gay men’s needs are personal, concerning ‘sex, love, friendship, belonging and place’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0038038511435064">Rowe and Dowsett, 2008</xref>: 340). Despite healthy rates of participation in socializing activities and levels of civic engagement, our results showed infrequent visits to sex venues and thus provided scant support for sexually driven models of gay community attachment. Contesting ‘the see-saw model of community’ which arguably has shaped past debate about gay community, we show that alternative sources of community for gay men exist. However, despite the popularity of online dating, gay men’s new sources of community cannot be found solely within sexually bounded relations, either offline or on. Learning that our respondents who visited gay sex sites (66%) were as interested in making friends as they were in finding a casual sexual partner was a key discovery. It confirmed earlier research about the blending of sexual relationships and sociability, but it also showed that friendship may be the real benefit of sexual encounters. Not that friendship itself necessarily generates ‘community-like properties’ and in some situations may well be the basis of ‘an identity-making kit’. Nonetheless, our third analysis did show that elective relationships can also engender bonds of great loyalty, a desire to help, a readiness to listen and a commitment to the relationships, which are the resources for solidarity within personal relationships. The different types of solidarity that categories of intimates offered confirmed Wellman and Wortley’s claim that ‘not all ties provide the same sort of social support’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038038511435064">1990</xref>: 559). On this basis, it might also be argued that friendships and personal communities are shaped by social context and differentiated by class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038038511435064">Allan, 1979</xref>), history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0038038511435064">Silver, 1989</xref>), gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0038038511435064">O’Connor, 1992</xref>) and sexual orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038511435064">Connell, 1992</xref>: 46)</p>
<p>Researchers generally argue that ‘women … report forming friendships through self-revealing discussion, whereas the men we know report that they typically form friendships based on common activities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0038038511435064">Strikwerda and May, 1992</xref>: 116). Our research reveals a more complex picture of intimacy, which supports Connell’s claim that sexuality and gender both affect gay men’s community attachment. Women form great friendships with gay men, providing both intimacy and practical support. Their status as confidantes for gay men is consistent with findings that women encourage intimacy in their friendships (O’Connor, 1998). Yet gay men seem similarly adept, implying, as Nardi also suggests, that they engage in more ‘expressive and intimate modes of relating’ that challenge normative aspects of masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0038038511435064">1999</xref>: 46).</p>
<p>Although respondents preferred talking to their gay friends in cases of relationship breakdown, they generally chose women as confidantes. This shows that women are a really important source of support for gay men, especially if emotional support is defined to include ‘emotions talk’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0038038511435064">Park et al., 2009</xref>: 158). Our findings are therefore also sympathetic with recent findings that gay men befriend both heterosexual men and straight women in the workplace, also indicating potentials for non-sexual sources of identification and belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0038038511435064">Rumens, 2010</xref>: 147). Other research shows that particular workplace settings are important for personal communities, providing a professional context where personal friendships can develop between colleagues and work associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0038038511435064">Wilkinson, 2010b</xref>). When our findings about women’s support are taken alongside these recent discoveries about work, we can see the additional benefits of a personal community approach to gay men.</p>
<p>Our results also reveal a pattern of family-inclined support, suggesting that family is not being replaced by friendship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0038038511435064">Pahl and Pevalin, 2005</xref>: 433). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0038038511435064">Spencer and Pahl (2006)</xref> showed that personal relationships generally had a ‘given’ and a ‘chosen’ side. That is, intimate ties provide solidarity as well as individuation and identification. We saw earlier that friendships with different social groups provide gay men with solidarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038038511435064">Wellman and Wortley, 1990</xref>). However, it looks like family ties may also be flexible enough to assume some of the expressive and more personal qualities of a friendship. Longitudinal studies earlier revealed that respondents nominated family members when they were asked about their friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0038038511435064">Pahl and Pevalin, 2005</xref>: 433). The implication here is that some individuals may come to regard their biological family members in the same way as they do their friendships. Although our respondents ranked family members lower than they did other friends, half of them were still comfortable saying ‘exactly how they felt’ and exchanging confidences with family members and relatives. While not exactly a sea change, this finding suggests a level of intimacy and belonging around family relations which could be explored more deeply through a qualitative personal community study of gay men, because ‘it’s with friends that we test our sense of self in the world’ (Rubin, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038038511435064">Nardi, 1992b</xref>: 109).</p>
<p>In closing, it is important to note that the insights gleaned from our findings about alternative sources of gay community could be deepened using qualitative methods. The advantage of using large-scale data was that it allowed us to identify some general patterns of personal solidarity for our sample. These were seen to encompass diverse sources of identification and support that went well beyond sexualized gay community and gay friendships. However, a personal community approach could also access the subjective significance of gay men’s various personal relationships and their perceived contribution to a sense of being part of a community. Moreover, building on new research on gay men’s friendships at work in public settings, we could also explore the implications of our findings for gay men’s personal communities, not only within the intimate sphere, but also within the public settings of work, community and neighbourhood.</p>
