<p>Anyone reading commercial lighting publications or attending lighting trade shows could almost be convinced that whatever the lighting problem, there is only one answer – LEDs. Indeed, despite last ditch attempts by some manufacturers to point out the virtues of older light sources it seems that LEDs are poised to sweep aside all competitors. How has this occurred? I believe there are three components to this technological tsunami. The first has been the immense amount of money that has been invested in LEDs by companies and the consequent rapid and impressive improvement in their capabilities. The second has been the enthusiasm of regulators who see LEDs as the ultimate replacement for incandescents. The third is fashion. At the moment, opting for LEDs is considered progressive and enlightened, both literally and metaphorically. Anyone who does not choose LED equipment is considered quaint and reactionary.</p>
<p>The outcome of these processes has been the explosive growth in the LED market and, like all such markets it has attracted many suppliers, some with a reputation to preserve and some of unknown pedigree. As a result, the market is now saturated with LED equipment, much of it of unknown provenance. This means the question about LEDs, which most urgently needs to be addressed is how the purchaser is to tell good equipment from bad. You might think that lighting research could provide an answer. Sadly, so far it has not. There have been numerous studies addressing different aspects of LED equipment, ranging from the optimum spectrum through minimizing glare to limiting flicker and there have been many evaluations of LED installations. There have also been extensive discussions on better metrics for characterizing colour but so far little consensus. As a result there is little guidance for the purchaser to follow when selecting LED equipment. One valuable form of guidance would be a set of simple questions to ask the LED supplier. Any supplier unable or unwilling to answer the questions should be treated with caution. Any individual or organization willing to produce such a list would find a ready audience and would make a real contribution to lighting practice.</p>

<p>The Society of Light and Lighting is pleased to make the following awards for papers published in Lighting Research and Technology in 2012.</p>
<p>The Walsh-Weston Award goes to E Rautkylä, M Puolakka and L Halonen for their paper “Alerting effects of daytime light exposure – a proposed link between light exposure and brain mechanisms”</p>
<p>The Leon Gaster Award goes to RP Leslie, LC Radetsky and AM Smith for their paper “Conceptual design metrics for daylighting”</p>
<p>Congratulations to all authors</p></boxed-text>
