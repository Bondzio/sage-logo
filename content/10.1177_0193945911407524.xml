<abstract>
<p>The authors examined the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of Project Wings Girls’ Groups, a school-based mental health promotion program designed to improve well-being in Latina adolescents, as observed in outcomes, including perceived stress, depressive symptoms, coping, and connectedness. This pilot randomized controlled trial compared outcomes over 9 months postintervention for 42 9th and 10th grade adolescents attending two urban high schools. Girls were randomized to Project Wings Girls’ Groups, a 16-session facilitated curriculum, including sharing circles, mind–body exercises, and coping skills building or the attention control (i.e., similar format but focused on general health topics). Feasibility of retention and long-term follow-up data collection was demonstrated, with lessons learned for future study. Although not statistically powered, this trial demonstrated findings in the expected direction, including reduced perceived stress and depression and increased connectedness. A trial with sufficient power is warranted to examine Project Wings’ effects on mental health problems among Latina adolescents.</p>

<p>One in five students in the United States is Latino, and demographic rojections indicate that the number of Latino adolescents in the United States will increase by 60% compared with an 8% increase of overall teens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0193945911407524">U.S. Census Bureau, 2008</xref>). Compared with other girls across the United States, Latina adolescents have the highest rate of depressive symptoms, with more than 40% of Latinas reporting feeling hopeless or sad for more than 2 weeks in the past year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945911407524">Mulye, 2009</xref>). Latinas also have disproportionately high rates of related mental health risk factors, including anxiety, suicidal ideation (40% have reported thinking of taking their lives; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911407524">Garcia, Skay, Sieving, Naughton, &amp; Bearinger, 2008</xref>), and suicidal attempts in the past year (10% compared with 5% White; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945911407524">Crosby, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945911407524">DuarteVelez &amp; Bernal, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945911407524">Mulye, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0193945911407524">Zayas, Bright, Alvarez-Sanchez, &amp; Cabassa, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with research linking adolescent risk behaviors (e.g., substance use, truancy, and dropout) and poor mental health status (e.g., depression and suicidal ideation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945911407524">Hallfors et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945911407524">Minnesota Department of Health, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945911407524">Needham, 2009</xref>), Latina youth have disproportionately high rates of substance use, delinquency, pregnancy (i.e., Latinas have the highest teen birthrate at 139.5 per 1,000), and high school dropout (i.e., nearly 40% of Latino youth are not graduating from high school; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945911407524">Cuellar &amp; Curry, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193945911407524">Pew Hispanic Center, 2004</xref>). Adolescent mental health is influenced by stressors that are experienced in conjunction with existing resources at the individual and social levels.</p>
<p>A range of individual-level stressors (i.e., risks) and resources (i.e., protective factors) are present in every adolescent. Stressors might include biological or developmental vulnerability, isolation, perceived stress, and, specifically for immigrant youth, acculturative stress. Recent immigration has been shown to be protective for some Latino youth against risk behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945911407524">Garcia Coll &amp; Raffaelli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945911407524">M. S. Kaplan, Huguet, Newsom, &amp; McFarland, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0193945911407524">Trejos-Castillo &amp; Vazsonyi, 2009</xref>). However, immigration also presents stressors as youth embark on a process of acculturation and balancing between two cultural systems that often conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945911407524">Romero, Martinez, &amp; Carvajal, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0193945911407524">Romero &amp; Roberts, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0193945911407524">Smokowski, Buchanan, &amp; Bacallao, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0193945911407524">Torres &amp; Rollock, 2004</xref>). Protective individual-level resources might include hope, positive self-efficacy, perceived connectedness to caring adults, including parents and family members, and healthy coping behaviors.</p>
<p>With respect to coping behaviors, a primary target of the intervention program, the way in which an adolescent copes with a negative life event, or stressor, can be a valuable protective resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945911407524">Frydenberg, 2008</xref>). Healthy coping is the result of a complex interplay among biological (e.g., adrenal response), emotional (e.g., feelings such as fear or hope), mental (e.g., self-efficacy), and social–environmental (e.g., prior experiences dealing with similar stressors, available support) resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945911407524">Compas, 2001</xref>). It is well established that problem-oriented coping (i.e., efforts to modify the stressor) contributes to health promoting behaviors (e.g., seeking social support). In contrast, nonproductive coping, such as many emotion-based approaches (i.e., regulation of emotion in response to stressor; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945911407524">Frydenberg, 2008</xref>), can include risk-taking behaviors (e.g., substance use, violence; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193945911407524">Piko, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0193945911407524">Rhodes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0193945911407524">Turner, Kaplan, &amp; Badger, 2006</xref>). Adolescents who rely on unhealthy coping strategies are more likely to experience an array of adverse outcomes, including depression, stress, and suicidality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945911407524">Galaif, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193945911407524">Olvera, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0193945911407524">Spence (2002)</xref> observed that increases in adolescent depressive symptoms more than 12 months could be predicted by a pessimistic life outlook and concluded that health interventions for adolescents should encourage problem-solving coping skills.</p>
<p>Family and school are critical social-level influences on Latina adolescents’ mental health. Protective familial and cultural factors can include traditional values that emphasize strong family interdependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945911407524">Comas-Díaz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945911407524">Fervert &amp; Miranda, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193945911407524">Romero, Robinson, Haydel, Mendoza, &amp; Killen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0193945911407524">Urdaneta, Aguilar, Livingston, Gonzales-Bogran, &amp; Kaye, 2001</xref>), extensive family/extended family presence, respect of authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945911407524">Calzada, Fernandez, &amp; Cortes, 2010</xref>), and valuing of education and hard work. These can be valuable resources for Latina adolescents when faced with stressors; however, family factors can also be sources of stress. For example, when family members are separated and reunited during the immigration process, which can occur over years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945911407524">Mena, Mitrani, Muir, &amp; Santisteban, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945911407524">Mitrani, Santisteban, &amp; Muir, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0193945911407524">Schapiro, 2002</xref>), the parent–teen relationship can experience strain that extends beyond what is generally expected as a result of normative adolescent developmental tasks (i.e., identity formation with peer groups).</p>
<p>Schools are also sources of risk or protection. School connectedness, a belief that adults in the school care about them, and healthy adult and peer relationships have been shown to protect adolescents against numerous risk behaviors and problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945911407524">McNeely &amp; Falci, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0193945911407524">Shochet, Dadds, Ham, &amp; Montague, 2006</xref>). However, many Latina adolescents report experiencing social isolation, intraracial discrimination, and distrust in school staff; subsequently, they disengage or limit involvement in school activities and many drop out of high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945911407524">Fry, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945911407524">Garcia &amp; Lindgren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945911407524">C. Kaplan, Turner, &amp; Badger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193945911407524">Pew Hispanic Center, 2004</xref>). The complexity of factors influencing Latina adolescents’ mental health necessitates development of health promotion interventions that are multifaceted and alters both individual- and social-level stressors and resources.</p>
<p>Existing research demonstrates that school-based approaches are effective in preventing risk behaviors, including substance use and violence, among Latino youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945911407524">Dishion &amp; Kavanagh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193945911407524">Pantin, Schwartz, Sullivan, Coatsworth, &amp; Szapoxznik, 2003</xref>). The evidence from these intervention frameworks, although not directly targeting mental health promotion, suggests that Latina youth will respond positively to interventions that promote individual-level assets and address key social-level influences in their lives, family, and school. Furthermore, these researchers and others have demonstrated relatively successful recruitment and retention rates with Latino adolescents (i.e., more than 80% youth retained at 12-month follow-up by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0193945911407524">Villarruel, Jemmott, &amp; Jemmott, 2006</xref>). In an earlier study developing our intervention, recruitment feasibility and acceptability were demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945911407524">Garcia, Kemmick Pintor, &amp; Lindgren, 2010</xref>); however, retention in long-term follow-up data collection was not established. Retention is important, and one aim of this study, because ability to retain Latina adolescents over time is necessary to document and demonstrate long-term outcomes beyond immediate postintervention outcomes.</p>
<p>Our new overarching intervention framework, named Project Wings (Proyecto Alas in Spanish), has been developed using a community-based participatory approach and is grounded in existing evidence of successful preventive interventions with Latino youth. It is school based and family centric and has two proposed core components: groups and home visits. Each core component was piloted separately to provide preliminary data necessary to inform a full-scale effectiveness trial. This article reports on the girls’ group pilot study that occurred in the 2008-2009 school year. See Garcia et al., 2011 for a description of the process used to develop the home visiting component, which occurred in the 2009-2010 school year.</p>
<p>Guided by an integrated ecological-resiliency model, this study realizes and intervenes on multiple etiologies contributing to Latina adolescents’ mental health problems.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945911407524">Bronfenbrenner’s (1979)</xref> ecological model supports a multilayered approach to health promotion that considers the individual and social levels surrounding the adolescent. At the individual level, an adolescent has traits, beliefs, values, and experiences that influence the way she perceives a stressor (e.g., relationship issues, family fights, parental control, school demands, etc.). She responds to these stressors in the context of microsystems around her, including family and school systems. It is critical that she can identify resources she needs to cope with the stressor in a healthy manner (e.g., problem solving and seeking social support) so that unhealthy responses and outcomes are minimized and, ideally, avoided.</p>
<p>Fostering protective factors where stressors and risks are present might optimally encourage ecological resiliency. Resilience theory explains that in the presence of harmful experiences, or risks, some adolescents thrive where others do poorly. Resilience theory, in the context of an ecological framework, emphasizes building protective factors at multiple levels, including individual, school, and family contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945911407524">O’Donnell, O’Donnell, Wardlaw, &amp; Stueve, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945911407524">Parsai, Voisine, Marsiglia, Kulis, &amp; Nieri, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193945911407524">Reid, Stewart, Mangham, &amp; McGrath, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945911407524">Resnick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0193945911407524">Rodriguez &amp; Morrobel, 2004</xref>). Project Wings Girl’s Groups intervenes to reduce girls’ depressive symptoms and perceived stress by increasing healthy coping through enhancing individual- and social-level protective resources (i.e., adolescent knowledge of stress and coping, group social support, family connectedness, and school connectedness). See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0193945911407524">Figure 1</xref> for a visual representation of the relationship among the theoretical frameworks, intervention components, and anticipated outcomes.</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The aims of this randomized, controlled pilot study were to (a) determine recruitment and retention feasibility and (b) examine outcomes of Project Wings Girls’ Group to improve the mental health (i.e., reduced depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and increased family and school connectedness) of Latina adolescents as compared with an attention control condition.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0193945911407524">
<title>Design</title>
<p>A parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted between September 2008 and September 2009 in two neighboring, urban high schools in a midwestern metropolitan area, with Latino adolescents constituting 11% and 26% of the student body in each school, respectively. Study procedures were approved by Institutional Review Boards at the University of Minnesota and the Public School District.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0193945911407524">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Latina adolescents were eligible to participate if they were between the ages of 13 and 16 and spoke Spanish. Because our intervention sought to include recently immigrated adolescents, it was important that all participants could understand Spanish to fully participate in the group sessions. Participants were recruited by research staff, with the coordinating help of school staff, via presentations at the schools’ back-to-school kick-off events and lunch breaks in the first 2 weeks of class. With permission from the girls, the research staff followed up via telephone to further describe the program, answer questions, and confirm availability as well as interest. Active parental consent and adolescent assent were obtained in writing prior to the initial group.</p>
<p>Enrolled Latina students in the 9th or 10th grades were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group in a 1:1 allocation. A computerized permuted block randomization schedule was created for each study site, and students were stratified into two groups according to whether they had attended elementary school in the United States. This was necessary to avoid unequal distribution of recent immigrants.</p>

<sec id="section5-0193945911407524">
<title>Intervention Condition: Description and Protocol</title>
<p>Project Wings Girls’ Group is a stress and coping mental health promotion program grounded in the evidence of successful interventions for adolescent girls such as girls’ circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945911407524">Irvine, 2005</xref>) and an understanding of adolescent girls’ development and needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0193945911407524">Rew, 2005</xref>) and known protective factors, including the presence of a caring adult. The program is designed to encourage healthy coping behaviors and resources through skills building; increasing understanding of, among other things, how stress functions; common sources of stress and strategies that can help to manage stress in a positive way; and modeling/identifying healthy school- and family-based social supports. The sixteen 3-hr weekly group sessions and a booster session at 3-month postintervention include time for sharing circles, relaxation exercises, and skills building (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0193945911407524">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0193945911407524">2</xref>). The intervention length was informed by literature suggesting that sustained intervention dosage might encourage lasting change and anecdotal insights among research team members, and that fewer sessions would limit two influencing factors on program success when working with adolescent girls: trust and relationship. The intervention condition lead facilitators were study-hired bilingual staff with prior experience or education in mental health, girls’ group facilitation, and Latino adolescent development (i.e., a youth worker with 6+ years leading programming for Latino adolescents and parents). The intervention condition groups were cofacilitated by a bilingual, Latina school staff member, to encourage school connectedness and continued support from a school staff following study conclusion. Didactic training, approximately 30 hr, was provided to all facilitators for the respective curriculum, ethics and safety, and research protocol details.</p>

<title>Attention Control Condition: Description and Protocol</title>
<p>Participants assigned to the attention control condition received a parallel group program encouraging healthy living with activities such as crafts (e.g., Halloween pumpkins, homemade lip gloss, and homemade ice cream), movies, and health-focused education (e.g., skin, teeth and nails, and menstruation). Content was intended to avoid mental health, stress, and coping information. Attention control condition facilitators were graduate research assistants enrolled in the School of Public Health.</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Self-report paper–pencil surveys were administered at baseline, midintervention, postintervention, 3-month postintervention, and 9-month postintervention. The Latina adolescents completed the questionnaire at their respective school supervised by a research team member. Of the 42 participants, 5 (12%) preferred to complete a Spanish questionnaire, rather than the English version. Refreshments and transportation were provided to all participants. Gift cards to a national chain store were offered weekly to encourage attendance (US$5) and as tokens of appreciation for survey completion (US$20). A participant completing all study elements had the potential, over the 12-month period, to obtain US$185 for attending 17 sessions (16 plus booster) and completing five surveys.</p>

<title>Individual-Level Variables</title>
<sec id="section10-0193945911407524">
<title>Perceived stress</title>
<p>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a 14-item, 5-point scale (range: 0 = <italic>never</italic> to 4 = <italic>always</italic>), assessing the extent to which one perceives their life to be stressful in the past 30 days (e.g., How often have you felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945911407524">Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983</xref>). A greater score implies a higher level of perceived stress. The internal consistency score (α = .78) was comparable with Cohen et al.’s original study (α = .84-.86) as well as studies that have utilized the Spanish version of the PSS with samples in the United States (α = .74; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945911407524">Dunn &amp; O’Brien, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS) has a 14-item stress subscale, 4-point response options (range: 1 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 4 = <italic>most of the time</italic>) that was also used to assess perceived stress (e.g., I found myself getting upset by quite trivial things. I found it difficult to relax; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911407524">Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995</xref>). The greater the score, the higher the level of stress symptoms, with a score greater than 20 indicating “extreme stress” and a score between 0 and 7 indicating “no stress.” The internal consistency score was high (α = .92), similar to that achieved in the original study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911407524">Lovibond and Lovibond (1995</xref>; α = .90).</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Participant characteristics and outcome measures were compared between the intervention and control condition using independent samples <italic>t</italic> test and Pearson chi-square. Due to the pilot nature of this study and that it is not adequately powered to detect differences between the conditions (i.e., for α at .05 and effect size 0.1, power is 0.06; for α at .10 and effect size 0.10, power is 0.12), a <italic>p</italic> value &lt; .10 and an effect size &gt; 0.10 were used as indicators of potential intervention effectiveness. To assess the preliminary findings of Project Wings Girls’ Groups Pilot study, we evaluated whether the intervention group differed from the active control group over time for select individual- and social-level variables. Analyses were performed on all participants with at least two postintervention assessments. We estimated the linear trend over the five assessments in each group for the difference between the score at each time assessment and the preintervention score. The test for intervention over time effect was estimated as the interaction effect. Effect values are presented in the original scale value and as Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> statistics.</p>
<p>Outcome values at each assessment are reported and were compared by condition. Linear mixed models were used to account for the repeated measures (multiple measures over time) in all analyses. All analyses were generated in SAS/STAT software Version 9.2 using PROC MIXED.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Latina adolescents demonstrate mental health problems that necessitate identification of effective preventive interventions. This study explored the feasibility and initial outcomes of Project Wings Girls’ Groups, a school-based stress and coping intervention for Latina adolescents.</p>
<p>Some useful insights were gained from this trial regarding recruitment and retention. With respect to recruitment, we successfully recruited slightly more than our goal of 40 Latina adolescents within the allotted time frame, a noteworthy accomplishment given the challenges associated with school-based recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945911407524">Elder et al., 2008</xref>). It is our belief that the community-based nature of the study optimized recruitment efforts in part because of shared commitment to the project, which facilitated identification of opportunities to present the study to our target population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945911407524">Minkler &amp; Wallerstein, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0193945911407524">Shetgiri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0193945911407524">Wallerstein &amp; Duran, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0193945911407524">Yancey, Ortega, &amp; Kumanyika, 2006</xref>). For example, the opportunity to present the study directly to a group of parents during an orientation meeting fostered parental support for student participation. It is also possible that our recruitment success was also the result of offering an attention control condition, rather than a survey-only control condition, because this enabled every girl to participate and receive something. Evidence for this is anecdotal and based on parents’ comments.</p>
<p>There are well-known challenges to school-based recruitment such as communicating with parents/families in a timely manner and coordinating recruitment activities with school staff. These were minimized in part because school staff, as community-based partners, contributed in all aspects of the study process, thereby helping to avoid common barriers to successful study implementation (i.e., limited access to potential participants or hesitation to participate due to lacking relationship or trust). We did not experience difficulties reaching interested adolescents or their parents via phone, as has been documented in some previous research, particularly with low-income families; instead, our experience reinforced data trends indicating that a high percentage of Latina adolescents own cell phones (i.e., range between 78%-90%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945911407524">Livingston, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Our retention was generally high and demonstrated success, which can be difficult in longitudinal studies involving adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0193945911407524">Stephens, Thibodeaux, Sloboda, &amp; Tonkin, 2007</xref>), yet we learned lessons that might improve future trial retention rates. For example, a few participants attended only one or two sessions. It is possible that offering a demonstration session for girls to assess their interest might have yielded higher retention rates. Our data indicate two categories of participants: girls who tried it and did not like it and girls who really liked the program and attended most of it.</p>
<p>It is also possible that the weekly incentive, although modest, was a contributing factor to consistent attendance for some girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0193945911407524">Villarruel, Jemmott, Jemmott, &amp; Eakin, 2006</xref>). Many participants reported having responsibility of younger siblings at home; this contextual factor might have influenced attendance consistency for some of the girls. In addition to garnering parental support for adolescent participation, future study efforts might also ensure that parents and girls are aware of potential benefits associated with consistent attendance.</p>
<p>We observed a difference in completion rates for the intervention condition participants between the two schools. This is partially explained by the assignment of two girls to the intervention condition who did not subsequently attend an intervention session. In fact, only three girls assigned to the intervention condition in that school actually dropped out of the program after attending sessions. Girls who started but dropped out of the program did so due to factors such as moving out of state, opting to engage in a different after-school activity, deciding the program was not of interest to them, or experiencing extraneous issue such as family problems at home. Future studies should assess reasons for dropout and with larger sample sizes should yield more similar participation rates across sites.</p>
<p>Fewer girls in the attention control condition completed the study (65% compared with more than 80%), potentially indicating a need for revision of the content provided in this condition, although facilitator skills and relationship building might have also contributed (i.e., control condition facilitators were graduate students, not necessarily with previous experience, leading adolescent girls’ groups).</p>
<p>A good proportion of participants completed most of the surveys. Even among those who did not attend the study consistently, half continued data collection. We demonstrated ability to find participants after the summer break and in the following academic year. This is important because longitudinal trials are necessary to observe sustained changes and to document more distal outcomes, such as graduation rates as indicators of school connectedness. Even though many of our participants had at-risk and high-risk demographics, including high rates of transience and school truancy, most returned to their respective school the following year and completed the 9-month postintervention survey.</p>
<p>High reliability was demonstrated for all measures except School Connectedness. The reliability coefficient for School Connectedness was low for our sample, necessitating some examination of the utility of this measure for Latina adolescents, even though it has been used in national- and state-level surveys with diverse adolescent populations. Our findings in this pilot study will inform measure selection in subsequent studies.</p>
<p>Our study yielded trends in the expected direction for some of our assessed outcomes. For example, the reporting of fewer feelings of depression is a positive trend, as is reporting lower levels of perceived stress. There are potential explanations for the lack of statistically significant findings. First, the trial was conducted to primarily assess feasibility of recruiting and retaining Latina adolescents in a randomized mental health promotion trial and secondarily, to examine outcomes. As a result, the sample size was not determined by statistical power analysis but rather, the availability of partnering high schools and capacity with available funding to implement the trial. Second, potential contamination of the attention control participants due to within-school randomization and a moderate level of social support offered to control condition participants might have contributed to nonsignificant outcome results. Third, it is possible that the participants did not receive an adequate intervention “dose” to yield statistically significant outcome differences between the conditions. We anecdotally determined that attendance in 11 of the 16 sessions was adequate “dosage,” but this requires further study. Intent-to-treat analysis does not consider dosage received and with our small sample, likely contributes to nonsignificant findings. Finally, the intervention did not include a family-level component, or parental involvement, which might strengthen intervention impact.</p>
<p>Our study randomized girls to intervention and control groups within schools, which might have led to contamination. Information and skills learned in the intervention might have been shared with participants in the control condition, and there was no way to assure that close friends/acquaintances were not randomized to separate conditions. This might explain some of the positive outcome trends observed across the conditions and suggests that future trials need to randomize across schools to minimize contamination potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945911407524">Murray, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>It is established that simply being a part of a girls’ group can yield improved outcomes but because both conditions received a group-format protocol, our findings are more likely the result of factors beyond the group format. We also encountered challenges ensuring that the content of the control condition did not directly address mental health, stress, or coping. There were several occasions when girls in the control condition would suggest or request a discussion of mental health issues, and facilitators admittedly struggled with balancing the need to redirect the conversation and the girls’ needs. Condition curriculum fidelity was monitored, yet the nature of most facilitated girls’ groups will lead to trust and openness that can present dilemmas such as those we experienced; a possible solution might be to develop an attention control curriculum that is less interactive, more structured, and inclusive of content that is beneficial but distinct from health (e.g., financial literacy training or Latin dancing lessons).</p>
<p>The study examined the preliminary findings of Project Wings Girls’ Groups using a pilot randomized controlled trial design involving multiple assessments. Via mechanisms yet to be understood, Project Wings Girls’ Groups might aid Latina girls in reducing their perceived stress and depressive symptoms and in building meaningful connections. The school-based nature of the program promises potential sustainability and continuity and for some girls, offers a primary reason to stay connected to school. Project Wings Girls’ Group is part of a larger prevention framework that is grounded in existing evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945911407524">Dishion &amp; Kavanagh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193945911407524">Pantin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0193945911407524">Wilson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0193945911407524">Zayas et al., 2009</xref>) and designed to holistically build assets and minimize risks for Latina adolescents. Our research results are encouraging and provide another step toward realizing school-based intervention strategies that might be successful in promoting Latina adolescent mental health.</p>
