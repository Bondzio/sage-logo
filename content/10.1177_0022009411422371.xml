<abstract>
<p>The socialist industrial designs displayed in Czechoslovakia’s EXPO ’58 pavilion spoke a visual language understood on both sides of the Iron Curtain, making the pavilion a site of common ground between East and West. The showcase was also a point of convergence between Czechoslovak visual artists and Communist Party authorities who engaged in complex political negotiations in the years after Stalin’s death. Visual artists vied for liberation from socialist realism’s constraints, although they kept their demands within limits to avoid risking Party backlash. Communist Party leaders wanted domestic stability and saw improving the living standard as a tactic for insuring popular support. They increasingly perceived industrial design to be a visual-arts activity with special promise. Well-designed furniture, textiles, glass, ceramics and other consumer goods could generate state income useful for raising the living standard at home and earning hard currency abroad. The Party needed the designers’ cooperation to achieve efficient, attractive production within the command economy. In the Brussels showcase communist authorities compromised with visual artists helping to insure the latter’s support and success, demonstrating that culture in postwar Czechoslovakia was not merely imposed ‘from above’ by omnipotent authorities but could be the outcome of multidirectional negotiations between various competing interests.</p>

<p>On 17 April 1958 the first world’s fair of the Cold War opened in Brussels, Belgium with spectacular pavilions filling the exhibition grounds, two of the largest belonging to the United States and the Soviet Union.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022009411422371">1</xref></sup> The Belgian planning commission placed the superpowers’ showcases across from one another on the Square of Nations, hoping to create a spatial rhetoric of peace. Edward Durell Stone designed the circular American pavilion, reminiscent of the ancient Roman coliseum.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009411422371">2</xref></sup> Outside, state flags waved and an abstract Alexander Calder sculpture rose from a pool of dancing water. Inside, visitors gazed upon a cigarette-lighting robot, fashion shows and abstract expressionist fine arts. The Soviet pavilion, designed by a team of architects and engineers, was rectangular. Its transparent glass exterior walls showed that, after Nikita Khrushchev’s rise to power, Soviet architecture had broken from Josef Stalin’s favorite stone-clad neo-classicism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009411422371">3</xref></sup> Still, a demonstratively large red star and hammer and sickle hung above the entrance of the pavilion. Inside it fairgoers walked by a mural with children in red scarves carrying red flags, passed under an enormous statue of Lenin and wandered among important examples of Soviet socialist realist art, including Vera Mukhina’s iconic communist couple, ‘Factory Man and Collective Farm Woman’, with hammer and sickle confidently raised high above their heads. Visitors also saw models of Sputnik, consumer goods suitable for a Soviet ‘piknik’ and model housing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009411422371">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>As large and extravagant as these superpower edifices and their displays were, neither was recognized as the best pavilion. It was the smaller Czechoslovak pavilion – representing a satellite in the Soviet orbit – that won the most points in the official jury’s judgment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009411422371">5</xref></sup> Interviews with fair-goers mirrored the jury’s assessment. For ten days in May the United States Information Agency (USIA) asked 1000 visitors about their reactions to pavilions at EXPO ’58. Survey results rated Czechoslovakia’s pavilion ‘the most excellent’, followed by France, then the Soviet Union; the United States placed fourth. When asked what visitors liked best and least about the American pavilion, the highest ranked areas were electronic machines and color television while the lowest were fashion shows and abstract expressionist fine arts. In the Soviet showcase the favorites were Sputnik and the socialist realist fine arts, with ‘too much propaganda’ least popular by a wide margin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009411422371">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Czechoslovak pavilion contained little overt propaganda.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009411422371">7</xref></sup> There were few red flags, red stars, hammers and sickles, heroic socialist realist depictions of iconic Party leaders or signs laden with ideology. No young Pioneers wearing red scarves were to be seen. This light touch contrasted with the heavy display of Party symbols in the Soviet pavilion. Further, the modernist art works that socialist Czechoslovakia displayed tended to be conservative in nature and thus did not jar visitors’ sensitivities like the radical abstract expressionist works in the American showcase. Some of the displayed works were paintings or sculptures suited for museum acquisitions. Much of the modernism in the Czechoslovak pavilion appeared in industrial designs, including glass, ceramics and textile prototypes, created for everyday consumption and appealing to visions of domesticity then gaining popularity on both sides of the Cold War divide.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009411422371">8</xref></sup> These industrial designs were created within the socialist economic system, in which the state owned all manufacturing resources, central Party planners decided production priorities, prices and wages, and capitalism was presented as rapacious evil.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009411422371">9</xref></sup> Still, through their sleek lines, cosmic swirls, geometric shapes and lack of Party icons, the designs spoke a visual language that groups on both sides of the Iron Curtain grasped and enjoyed; for this reason, the pavilion was a common ground between East and West in the postwar world order.</p>
<p>Industrial design reveals that the Czechoslovak pavilion at EXPO ’58 was a Cold War common ground in another way, as well. It was a site where the divergent interests of visual artists and Communist Party authorities intersected and complex cultural and political struggles took place during the 1950s. This was a decade that leading historians of Czechoslovakia have called a time of crisis for the regime due to domestic economic challenges unleashed by nationalization and collectivization, policy shifts in the Soviet Union, including Khrushchev’s February 1956 ‘Secret Speech’, and subsequent revolutionary upheavals in Poland and Hungary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009411422371">10</xref></sup> At stake in the struggles were, on the one hand, liberation from heavily imposed socialist realism for abstract and non-figurative visual artists, including industrial designers, and, on the other hand, domestic stability and political control for Party powerbrokers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009411422371">11</xref></sup> Many Czechoslovak artists still had strong ties to international, interwar avant-garde art movements, including expressionism, cubism and surrealism. Party proponents of socialist realism castigated avant-garde art as bourgeois and counter-revolutionary, prohibiting its display for much of the 1950s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009411422371">12</xref></sup> Artists vied for some autonomy from socialist realism’s constraints on cultural expression, especially on the creation of abstract and non-figurative art, although they kept their demands within limits to avoid risking Party backlash. Communist Party leaders wanted political power and saw improving the living standard as a tactic for insuring popular support and domestic stability. They increasingly perceived industrial design to be an arts field with special political promise. Unlike painting or sculpture which had limited sales and revenue potential, furniture, textiles, glass, ceramics and other industrial-design products could generate state income and public confidence through the manufacture of consumer goods for raising the living standard at home and earning much-needed hard currency abroad. The Party needed the cooperation of industrial designers, who were experts in uniting the forces of art and technology, to help achieve efficient, attractive production within the command economy and bolster the Party’s influence in society. In the Brussels showcase, with its widely appealing displays of industrial designs and very limited communist iconography, political leaders permitted artists some creative autonomy as part of a larger, ongoing effort to maintain Party power.</p>
<p>Thus, this article argues that the Czechoslovak pavilion’s character and success resulted in significant part from struggles in which artists pressed for autonomy from the constraints of state-imposed socialist realism, and communist authorities sought carefully designed everyday-life enticements useful for Party control. This serious power game is a matter of grave importance for modern European history and historiography, because it contributes to recent studies of the nature of state-society relations under dictatorship. These studies, many of them treating East Germany, reveal the deficiencies of the old totalitarian paradigm resting on suppositions about monolithic, omnipotent states in which populations had absolutely no autonomy, and they demonstrate complex multidirectional interactions between ‘rulers’ and the ‘ruled’ – interactions in which ‘people could force the authorities to make compromises’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009411422371">13</xref></sup> Recent works show that the experience of dictatorship in Eastern Europe ‘had attributes other than cowering before total Party control’ and party-state stability ‘depended on more than Soviet tanks’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009411422371">14</xref></sup> The history of the Czechoslovak pavilion at EXPO ’58 similarly reveals intricate state-society interactions, conflicts and compromises, demonstrating that culture in postwar Eastern Europe could be the contingent outcome of complex negotiations between peoples and parties and not simply a centrally planned mandate imposed ‘from above’ by unchallenged repressive authorities. This is not to say that the Soviet-styled regimes were gentle; it is to say that they relied on more than force for control and inhabitants had some relative agency.</p>
<p>The history of postwar Czechoslovakia’s industrial design has roots in Czech applied arts before the First World War when first the Artěl (1908) and then the Czech Werkbund (<italic>Svaz českého díla</italic>; 1914) were founded. Both groups, very active after the state’s foundation in October 1918, were dedicated to promoting tasteful living with quality products that did not alienate workers from their labor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009411422371">15</xref></sup> Their members drew from and contributed to important visual movements in the interwar international avant-garde. Many also simultaneously maintained ties to Czech folk handicraft traditions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009411422371">16</xref></sup> While the Artěl ceased to exist in 1935, the Czech Werkbund lasted until late 1948 when it was absorbed into the Center for Folk and Artistic Manufacture (<italic>Ústředí lidové a umělecké výroby</italic>; hereafter ÚLUV). A 1945 postwar decree of Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš called ÚLUV into being to organize and oversee factories and workshops confiscated from Germans and other ‘enemies of the people’ before the communist takeover. It was ‘to insure the healthy developmental premises of folk and artistic production’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022009411422371">17</xref></sup> Some Czech Werkbund members became ÚLUV members, including Alois Fišárek, Jan Kaplický, Antonín Kybal, Jan Kotík, J.H. Nušl and Ludvika Smrčková, all of whom contributed to the Czechoslovak pavilion at EXPO ’58.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022009411422371">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Communist seizure of power over Czechoslovakia’s government took place in February 1948. Subsequently, under the leadership of First Party Secretary Klement Gottwald, a loyal Stalinist, the Party strove to consolidate its hold over society through arrests, torture, purges, show trials, executions, nationalization and collectivization. After the deaths of Gottwald and Stalin in March 1953, Antonín Novotný became first Party secretary. Antonín Zápotocký served as the country’s president from 1953 until his death in 1957. Novotný’s power grew as he added that state title to his Party title, holding both until 1968.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022009411422371">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the autumn of 1953 Novotný began considering efforts to improve the living standard of Czechoslovak workers. Soviet Prime Minister Georgii Malenkov’s announcement of the New Course in the Soviet Union encouraged Novotný in these efforts. So did the Czechoslovak Party’s recognition that, after the dislocations of nationalization and collectivization, workers were struggling economically and ‘that the satisfaction of people is the best means for calming the mood in society …’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022009411422371">20</xref></sup> Novotný’s government started with raising wages and cutting prices for basic consumer goods. Between 1953 and 1955 wages increased on average 4.5 per cent per year and between 1953 and 1956 prices were lowered six times.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022009411422371">21</xref></sup> Novotný’s attention to improving the living standard continued well after Khrushchev’s 1956 ‘Secret Speech’ and provided important background for the character and success of the Czechoslovak pavilion.</p>
<p>In ÚLUV’s earliest days it had no overt, mandatory communist mission, but following the 1948 coup and the Party’s 1949 announcement of the First Five-Year Plan, its manufacturing activities became explicitly counterpoised to capitalism and enmeshed in the party-state’s command economy. The leading journal of Czechoslovak industrial design from 1948 to 1970, <italic>Tvar</italic> (<italic>Shape</italic>), was under ÚLUV’s auspices until 1957. <italic>Tvar’s</italic> first article, ‘Manufacture Yesterday and Tomorrow’, spoke to industrial design’s place in the socialist order. It criticized capitalist production as profit-driven and non-collective, thereby allowing a few individuals to exploit the faceless masses and resulting in poor quality goods that quickly needed replacing and lacked culture. Its message was that nationalized production enabled artists, technical experts and workers to pool their talents, knowledge and labor, not for individual material gain, but to manufacture quality, long-lasting goods that had ‘cultural meaning’ for everyone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022009411422371">22</xref></sup> An article appearing that same year linked <italic>Tvar’s</italic> industrial-design activities to the country’s First Five-Year Plan. It proclaimed the plan ‘will fundamentally change the structure of our economy, our manufacture and our distribution, our spiritual and material culture and our entire society’. It listed steps ÚLUV needed to take to support the plan, including the establishment of ateliers and schools, and thereby ‘raise the general cultural level and strengthen our road to socialism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022009411422371">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>ÚLUV was distinct from the Union of Czechoslovak Visual Artists (<italic>Svaz československých výtvarných umělců</italic>), although leading industrial designers were involved with both. The former was devoted to organizing the manufacture of folk and artistic goods, while the latter was created in 1949 to oversee who officially qualified to work as an artist, what works could be exhibited, and which artists could exhibit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022009411422371">24</xref></sup> Before 1956 only socialist realist works could be displayed. Some visual artists were producing abstract and non-figurative art throughout the 1950s, but for much of that time they pursued their non-sanctioned cultural expressions in isolation, were excluded from public shows and at times persecuted. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022009411422371">25</xref></sup> A small number of abstract and non-figurative artists, notably the painter Jan Kotík who made important contributions to the Czechoslovak pavilion, privately painted or sculpted but publicly earned incomes through participation in the Union as industrial designers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022009411422371">26</xref></sup> Industrial design was an area of visual arts that received less scrutiny than the fine arts. Due to its ties with folk handicrafts traditions, Party leaders perceived it to be ‘of the people’, not aristocratic or bourgeois in origin. For this reason, and the fact that some communist officials considered design to be mere decoration rather than fine art, industrial designers had a bit more room in which to negotiate for some autonomy from socialist realism than painters and sculptors who were often on the Party radar. Further, design promised the regime domestic stability and power through consumer goods useful for raising the living standard at home and earning hard currency abroad; and its production was enmeshed in socialist manufacture and also Party visions of technology’s promised role in the building of communist utopia.</p>
<p>Initially, Party-approved painters, sculptors, graphic artists, architects and industrial designers were all Union members. In the autumn of 1955 the architects printed a lengthy call for the creation of a separate Union of Czechoslovak Architects. This demand came shortly after the Czechoslovak government officially committed to building a pavilion at EXPO ’58.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022009411422371">27</xref></sup> The call appeared in late 1955 in a lengthy letter on the front page in <italic>Výtvarná práce</italic> (<italic>Visual Work</italic>), the Union’s official paper. There readers found a statement that ultimately opened opportunities for abstract and non-figurative artists to have their works exhibited. It appealed for ‘the creation of free ideological groups of artists, close to one another in visual outlook which, especially through exhibitions and creative discussions, would call into being a free battle of opinions'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022009411422371">28</xref></sup> The architects were granted their separate Union in January 1956, while calls for some liberation of the visual arts from socialist realism continued throughout much of 1956. Those calls gained momentum after Khrushchev’s February ‘Secret Speech’ and after the April Second Congress of the Union of Czechoslovak Writers’, in which František Hrubín and Jaroslav Seifert, both respected poets, castigated socialist realism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022009411422371">29</xref></sup> The April Writers’ Congress and a ‘retreat from Stalinist dogmatism’ after Krushchev’s speech encouraged visual artists to continue their quest for autonomy from socialist realism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022009411422371">30</xref></sup> Union discussions about the liberation of the visual arts bore fruit on 27–8 October 1956 when, at an important meeting, its members revised their statute, allowing exhibitions of abstract and non-figurative work. The Party at that time was watching the Hungarian Revolution which began on 23 October. No similar revolutionary activities look place in Czechoslovakia and to a notable degree the country’s citizens opposed the Hungarian Revolution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022009411422371">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>The new statute shook up socialist Czechoslovakia’s exhibition scene. In April 1957 Kotík’s abstract art and industrial design were exhibited in the Gallery of Czechoslovak Writers in Prague, and two months later works of the May ’57 group, young artists who drew from the international avant-garde, were displayed in Prague’s Municipal House.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022009411422371">32</xref></sup> The fact that the visual artists kept their call for the liberation of the visual arts within limits encouraged the Party to allow both exhibitions and others to be shown. For example, while the new statute no longer said the Union had to ‘care for the anchoring of the principles of socialist realism’ (this is the language from the old statute), it did state the Union had to ‘[care for] the anchoring of principles tied with reality and penetrating the ideals of the building of socialism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0022009411422371">33</xref></sup> The Union also unanimously passed a resolution supporting the Hungarian Communist Party during the revolution. It simultaneously sent Pablo Picasso best wishes on his 75th birthday.</p>
<p>After 1956 Party leaders regularly spoke out against revisionism and enemies of the people, showing its post-stalinist commitment to Marxist-Leninism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022009411422371">34</xref></sup> It also gave increased attention to raising the living standard through higher wages, lower prices and increased availability of consumer goods. In 1956 the Party created the Ministry of Consumer Industry (<italic>Ministerstvo spotřebního průmyslu</italic>) under the directorship of Božena Machačová-Dostálová, one of socialist Czechoslovakia’s most powerful women. Among Machačová-Dostálová’s goals was raising Czechoslovakia’s living standard through the increased availability of consumer goods for sale at home and abroad. In 1957 the government sponsored the exhibition ‘Furniture and Clothing’ at Prague’s fairgrounds. On display were various industrial-design objects, including furniture, glass and ceramic household decorations, clothing, shoes and leather goods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0022009411422371">35</xref></sup> Historical circumstances had moved the designers and Party authorities to identify common ground in industrial design – common ground that was impressively displayed in the Czechoslovak pavilion at EXPO ’58 and well received by western visitors to the socialist showcase.</p>
<p>The architects of Czechoslovakia’s Brussels pavilion, a two-story building forming a backwards ‘L’, were František Cubr, Josef Hrubý and Zdeněk Pokorný. All three started their careers during the interwar period when they belonged among left-leaning, modernist Czech designers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022009411422371">36</xref></sup> While the pavilion’s clean lines and transparency resembled interwar functionalism, the architects insisted that their design was different from the ‘inhuman strictness’ of that bourgeois style and from the ‘unconsoling bare buildings’ developed following Khrushchev’s 1954 speech at the All-Union Conference of Builders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0022009411422371">37</xref></sup> They aimed for ‘a new synthesis of all creative areas’, refusing to approach their task ‘with a certain form of architectural selfishness’ as, according to them, many architects at EXPO '58 did. They ‘wanted to create a complex work, resulting from the widest cooperation with painters, sculptures and graphic artists’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0022009411422371">38</xref></sup> This collectivism, they argued, distinguished the Czechoslovak pavilion from older bourgeois functionalist designs and also from capitalism which promoted individual architectural stars (Le Corbusier and his Philips pavilion in Brussels were specifically mentioned) and placed the building in the socialist system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0022009411422371">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most of the building’s exterior walls were windowless and covered with gold-hued glass tiles – glass being an important area of industrial design in postwar Czechoslovakia (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022009411422371">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0022009411422371">40</xref></sup> None of the standard symbols of Communist Party power and ideology – the red flag, red star and hammer and sickle – adorned the building’s exterior. However, a reflection of the back of the Soviet showcase could be seen in the Czechoslovak pavilion’s two-story high, plate-glass entrance. The competition rules governing the selection of the pavilion’s design stated that the building had to be situated so that, when leaving it, visitors viewed the Soviet pavilion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0022009411422371">41</xref></sup> Owing to the placement and the large plate-glass entrance, a literal Soviet reflection appeared on the front of the Czechoslovak pavilion. Resting behind the pavilion and opposite the bend of its ‘L’ shape was a crescent-shaped, two-storey restaurant that Cubr, Pokorný and Hrubý also designed.
<fig id="fig1-0022009411422371" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The Front of the Czechoslovak Pavilion with Vincenc Makovský’s ‘New Age’. Collection of Cathleen M. Giustino. (See colour version in the plate section.).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022009411422371-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>When approaching the pavilion’s entrance, visitors saw to their right a Kaplan turbine, a propeller-type water-turbine as tall as the building, representing Czechoslovak ‘technological maturity’. On their left stood Vincenc Makovský’s bronze sculpture, ‘The New Age’, symbolizing ‘the character of Czechoslovakia and its people’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0022009411422371">42</xref></sup> ‘The New Age’ consisted of a male and a female figure standing in static heroic poses with a large star exploding between them (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022009411422371">Figure 1</xref>). The pair bore some resemblance to the iconic communist couple in the Soviet pavilion, but were different. The woman wore a short Grecian gown instead of a farm apron and carried a sheaf of wheat rather than a sickle. The man’s long coat, similar to those of medieval scholars, reached to the ground; his hands held a scroll, not a hammer. The variously shaped rays of Makovský’s star were a departure from older representations of stars, because Makovský wanted it – while exploding between the two static historically dressed figures – to emphasize the new age.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0022009411422371">43</xref></sup> Its shape looked nothing like the neatly shaped red star of communist iconography but resembled more the star that Belgian graphic artist, Lucien de Rock, designed for the EXPO logo – an asymmetrical, elongated star, each of its five arms representing one continent.</p>
<p>Still, Makovský’s ‘New Age’ belonged within the socialist system. Václav Kopecký, the powerful Communist Minister of Information from 1945 to 1953, identified Makovský, a one-time surrealist, as a leading communist sculptor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0022009411422371">44</xref></sup> During the Second World War Makovský became a pioneering Czechoslovak industrial designer while teaching at the School of Art in Zlín (renamed Gottwaldov in 1949). There he worked with engineers in the MAS machine-works factory developing prototypes for new machines and tools, including ergonomic scissors for shoe-making and the VR8, a radial drilling machine. His designs were to improve workers’ lives, not merely increase profits. Makovský did little with industrial design after 1945 but his student, Zdeněk Kovář, pushed forward this area, producing prototypes for tools, machines, cars, sewing machines, home-movie projectors and phonographs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0022009411422371">45</xref></sup> His designs were applauded for improving the working and living conditions of labourers, making their lives safer and more aesthetically pleasant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0022009411422371">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>Upon entering the pavilion visitors gazed around an airy, rectangular vestibule with golden panels visually connecting the building’s interior and exterior (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022009411422371">Figure 2</xref>). A large stained-glass mural stretched out across from the entry doors. Vladimír Sychra created this 7×5 meter image of domestic bliss, filling its background with ribbons of warm-colored glass abstractly suggestive of a caressing sun. Shortly before EXPO ’58, Sychra, a Party member, had designed the heroic mosaic images of Soviet soldiers in the Hall of the Red Army within the enormous National Memorial atop Prague’s Vítkov Hill. The Hall was opened in 1955 to honor ‘the memory of Soviet heroes who sacrificed their lives in the fight for our country’s freedom’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0022009411422371">47</xref></sup> The theme of the glass mural in Brussels was ‘The Happy Family’. In it half-clad parents reached out to their sturdy male toddler who strode confidently towards the vestibule filled with visual symbols of the Communist Party’s care for its people. The symbols were seven statues, each depicting one of the Seven Basic Laws of socialist Czechoslovakia’s constitution. The Basic Laws (and the statues) included: ‘All People Have the Right to Education’; ‘All People Have the Right to Work’; ‘With a Unified Economic Plan the State is Directing All Activities towards the Public Good’; ‘All Power Comes from the People’; ‘Health Care for Free’; ‘The Land Belongs to Those who Work on It’; and ‘All People are Equal’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0022009411422371">48</xref></sup> The figures in the sculptures bore the heroic static qualities of socialist realism, although their settings had abstracted details.

<p>Mounted on the entry vestibule’s ceiling was Sychra’s mosaic plaque of the official state symbol. At that time it contained a crowned lion, the symbol of the Kingdom of Bohemia, holding in his paw the double silver cross of Slovakia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0022009411422371">49</xref></sup> No red star, flag or hammer and sickle appeared on the plaque; the communist star was only added to the official state symbol in 1960. With only one exception (the sculpture ‘All Power Comes from the People’), this fundamental communist iconography was hard to find in the entry vestibule. Further, little verbal text was seen in it or other parts of the pavilion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0022009411422371">50</xref></sup> On one wall of the vestibule there was a poem by Vítězslav Nezval that paid homage (in French) to people’s democracy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0022009411422371">51</xref></sup> Nezval was a member of <italic>Devětsil</italic> (Nine Forces), an important group of leftist modernist writers and artists in interwar Czechoslovakia. In 1924 he joined the Communist Party which he continued to serve after 1945, even holding a post in Kopecký’s Ministry of Information. Still, the poem was no heavy ideological paean laden with political phrases, so it did not overwhelm visitors with communist propaganda.</p>
<p>Once inside the pavilion, visitors often received the brochure, <italic>One Day in Czechoslovakia</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0022009411422371">52</xref></sup> Its narrative, translated into Western European languages, introduced readers to a purportedly average Czechoslovak family. Images of a pristine countryside, historic monuments and a cornucopia spilling forth abundant consumer goods, including electricity-powered household appliances, gave the impression that ordinary Czechoslovak citizens enjoyed a high living standard (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022009411422371">Figure 3</xref>). This impression was much more positive than those presented in Politburo discussions about the living standard.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0022009411422371">53</xref></sup> This difference between representation and reality was acknowledged by the art historian V. V. Štech who told members of the pavilion planning committee, ‘Every exhibition is a bit of a swindle … On the other hand, it is a measure of what should be attained in a state’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0022009411422371">54</xref></sup>

Giustino. (See colour version in the plate section.).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022009411422371-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The brochure’s theme, ‘One Day in Czechoslovakia’, served to organize what followed the entry vestibule. Exhibition rooms and their displays were divided into three sections, each purportedly typical of non-elite Czechoslovak citizens’ everyday routines: Work, Leisure and Culture. In Work, displays pertaining to Czechoslovak energy, engineering, glass and textiles were installed; Leisure contained displays on children, puppets, historic monuments, nature and free time; Culture held exhibits about literature, music and education. Work was the first and most elaborate section.</p>
<p>The developers of the theme ‘One Day in Czechoslovakia,’ were first the graphic artist Adolf Hoffmeister and then the architect Jindřich Santar. Hoffmeister, who had been active in the Czech interwar leftist avant-garde, readily joined the Communist Party in August 1945 after Kopecký invited him to return from exile in the United States. He worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including serving as Czechoslovak Ambassador to France, until 1951 when, during the time of the purges, he fell from Party graces (probably due to attacks on socialist realism).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0022009411422371">55</xref></sup> In 1956 Hoffmeister agreed to write the libretto for the Czechoslovak showcase at Brussels. Because of other projects, he stepped down from that job. Jindřich Santar replaced him as chief script-writer for the pavilion. Santar, a young architect who worked in Kopecký’s Ministry of Information, was the son-in-law of the leftist poet Vladislav Vančura. In 1952, when working for the Ministry, Santar designed the exhibition ‘The Development of the Universe, the Earth, and Man (Vývoj vesmíru, země a člověka)’, the brochure for which praised Soviet science and critiqued American imperialism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0022009411422371">56</xref></sup> His script for Brussels lacked such heavy ideological dressing.</p>
<p>In January 1957 a Czechoslovak Politburo report strongly criticized both Hoffmeister’s libretto and Santar’s script. It called their main deficiency ‘their low political standard’. Hoffmeister’s libretto needed ideological language to make it politically acceptable, including a new introduction that proclaimed, ‘Czechoslovakia is a people’s democratic republic. It is a state of laborers, farmers and the working intelligentsia’. Santar’s script was ‘little political’, it lacked ‘references to the socialist character of our system’ and it failed to show that ‘Socialist democracy is the democracy of working people and is thereby the most democratic’. It said the organizing theme of ‘One Day in Czechoslovakia’ was too narrow, because its stated goal was to show ‘in the first place’ that Czechoslovakia was a beautiful land and only secondarily that it was a ‘people’s democratic order’. The Politburo authorities wanted visitors first convinced that Czechoslovakia was a people’s democratic state ‘with a rich tradition of fighting for freedom and progress’, and then that it was a beautiful land. In its last paragraphs, the Politburo report called for an ideologically loaded introductory exhibition at the very start of the pavilion, which would give visitors’ initial favorable opinions of socialism in Czechoslovakia and predetermine their subsequent impressions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0022009411422371">57</xref></sup> As the above description of the entry vestibule shows, the display called for in the Politburo report was ignored as were other criticisms in it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0022009411422371">58</xref></sup> The Party knew what the visual artists were doing, but did not force them to create an overtly ideological pavilion. It needed the artists’ support as the industrial designs on display had the potential of helping to secure power for the regime through the conception and production of appealing consumer goods.</p>
<p>The first room of the Work section contained the Energy exhibit. Theater designer František Tröster arranged it, demonstrating collective dialogue between art and technology. A giant model of a uranium atom with colourfully lit protons and neutrons greeted visitors as they entered. Filling the room’s center were a floor-to-ceiling model of an energy plant and a large betatron, a type of particle accelerator, painted light blue to enhance its casing’s aesthetic qualities. Blinking blue, pink and yellow neon signs signalled plans for future electricity production in Czechoslovakia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0022009411422371">59</xref></sup> There was little text beyond a quote in French from Zápotocký, stating, ‘In a short time the extraction of uranium ore was developed to such a level that in this area Czechoslovakia has reached one of the foremost places on earth’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0022009411422371">60</xref></sup> Originally, designers had planned to include a map of Czechoslovakia with uranium deposits marked on it. Communist officials forbade the map’s inclusion, because ‘the principle of concealment opposed’ showing uranium locations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0022009411422371">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second room in the Work section contained the large Machinery display. None were household appliances, like televisions, refrigerators or washing machines; the largest were machines for industrial production that artists and engineers collectively designed. Kovář, Makovský’s industrial-design student and a member of <italic>Tvar’s</italic> editorial board since 1948, worked to make the machines look artistic and humane, designing attractive, ergonomic casings for them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0022009411422371">62</xref></sup> He, Tröster and others also made special efforts to install the machines in an aesthetic manner. To endow them with sculptural qualities they painted them ‘elephant bone’, a color specially created for EXPO ’58.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0022009411422371">63</xref></sup> After seeing the industrial machines, visitors viewed displays visually communicating ideas about technology’s benefits. Ladislav Guderna, a surrealist, painted ‘The Victory of Technology (<italic>Vítězství techniky</italic>)’, using geometric forms to depict the rising heights of socialist construction. Nearby stood his mural of a nude woman holding a dove of peace with a hydroelectric plant behind her. Josef Svoboda, the principle scenographer at Prague’s National Theatre, created a display with swirling cosmic shapes mounted on antennae. As the shapes moved, locations on a map of Europe lit up and media broadcasts played in various European languages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0022009411422371">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>The next room contained the Glass and Ceramics display. Josef Saal, with assistance from Svoboda, designed this exhibition that included a poem celebrating glass. The poem’s author was Hrubín, a lifetime member of the Communist Party who at the Second Czechoslovak Writers’ Congress in April 1956 criticized socialist realism. In Glass and Ceramics visitors first saw a darkened display about historic glass in Czechoslovakia. From there they moved into an illuminated area with prototypes of some of the finest household glass and ceramics produced in socialist Czechoslovakia. On display were works from such notable state-owned glass enterprises as Borské Glass, Železnobrodské Glass and Škrdlovice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0022009411422371">65</xref></sup> They included the designs of Ludvika Smrčková who, during the 1950s, worked for ÚLUV, served on <italic>Tvar’s</italic> editorial board and wrote articles for the socialist glass-industry journal <italic>Sklář a keramik</italic> (<italic>Glassmaker and Ceramicist</italic>). Ceramic works included Jaroslav Ježek’s porcelain animal figurines with elegant abstracted details and his uniquely shaped porcelain Elka coffee set with subtle references to flight projectories in the new space age.</p>
<p>Glass and Ceramics also contained a number of large artistic works (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022009411422371">Figure 4</xref>). Adolf Benš’s elegant fountain resembled a tree with branches supporting semi-circular clear-glass bowls from which water dropped into a mosaic pool. Josef Kaplický’s mosaic mural, ‘Homage to Glass’, depicted six voluptuous women dressed in Grecian garb expressing adoration for a glass vase and plate. René Roubíček’s ‘Glass: Matter, Shape, Expression’, was a colorful ensemble of variously shaped glass vessels and sheets precariously mounted on thin metal rods, behind which visitors saw Stanislav Libenský and Jaroslava Brychtová’s richly colored zoomorphic relief wall reminiscent of ancient cave art and illuminated from behind. Another large work was Jan Kotík’s free-standing glass curtain, ‘Sunlight, Air, Water’. In this kaleidoscopic floor-to-ceiling sculpture, a collage of geometric shapes depicted a bright sun shining down over a soaring bird and below it a swimming fish.

<p>Few people involved in the pavilion’s creation better represented industrial design in socialist Czechoslovakia than Kotík, although his primary passion was painting. During the Second World War he was a member of ‘Skupina 42 (Group 42)’, which pursued avant-garde art during the Nazi occupation of Bohemia and Moravia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0022009411422371">66</xref></sup> After the Communist takeover, Kotík could not officially paint so he earned his living as an artistic director for ÚLUV and designed glass at the Škrdlovice factory, a very important center of socialist industrial design where Smrčková, and others with pieces displayed in Brussels, worked.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0022009411422371">67</xref></sup> Kotík also served on <italic>Tvar’s</italic> editorial board and as its graphic designer, producing dozens of covers and page-spreads. Further, he wrote many articles for the journal in which he theorized about the character and functions of industrial design within Czechoslovakia’s socialist system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0022009411422371">68</xref></sup> Still, Kotík’s greatest talent and love lay in abstract painting. In 1956 he and Pravoslav Rada, a Czech ceramic artist with work in Brussels, traveled to Albisola Italy where they met COBRA-member Asger Jorn and signed the situationist manifesto.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0022009411422371">69</xref></sup> In April 1957, following changes in the Union’s statutes that allowed non-socialist realist art to be exhibited, Kotík’s paintings and glasswork were shown in the Gallery of Czechoslovak Writers in Prague. The communist daily, <italic>Rudé pravo</italic> (Red Right), condemned the show stating, ‘Kotik follows the dogmas of abstract and formal painting … which have spread in the West in an epidemic of willfulness and chaos. … We are opposed to abstraction and dogmatism because they degrade art to a meaningless play of forms’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0022009411422371">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>Minister of Culture František Kahuda appointed a committee to review all visual works created for Brussels. The committee’s meetings occurred around the end of February 1958, that is, shortly before the EXPO’s opening, leaving no time to replace any works deemed inappropriate for socialist display. Most works were quickly approved without comment or debate. A small number, however, received disapproval. One controversial work was Kotík’s glass curtain, which the committee praised for its technical inventiveness, but criticized for failing to respect socialist realism. Its report stated, ‘The visual discourse of the window, however, issues from principles of abstract art and thus does not represent the leading ideological principles of our present visual art.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0022009411422371">71</xref></sup> The report was sent to Minister Kahuda. Because of a distinction he made between art and decoration, Kahuda allowed the exhibition of Kotik’s glass curtain in Brussels. He permitted the work’s display, because he deemed it ‘a decorative exponent without any sort of pictorial intention …’. While Kahuda approved the showing of Kotík’s curtain, he wanted it placed in a non-prominent spot.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0022009411422371">72</xref></sup> As large and colorful as it was, though, there was no peripheralizing ‘Sunlight, Air, Water’. Kotík himself travelled to Brussels to help install his creation in the central, well-lit section of the glass exhibit and while there he visited the exhibition of international modern art arranged for the World’s Fair.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0022009411422371">73</xref></sup> The glass curtain was not the only abstract work Kotík contributed to the pavilion. He also illustrated <italic>Les aventures des hommes et des machines</italic>, the official Czechoslovak pavilion book on industry, using abstract compositions on the book’s casing, fly leaves and illustrations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0022009411422371">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the Glass and Ceramics room visitors went up to a mezzanine where they saw the Agriculture display, which Tröster designed. Here were arguably the most overt ideological statements found in the pavilion, although no red stars or flags were prominent and the Party disapproved of the display.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0022009411422371">75</xref></sup> The Agriculture exhibition’s motto was ‘In Czechoslovakia land only belongs to those who work on it’. As visitors walked up the stairs to enter Agriculture they passed a quotation from Novotný, stating, ‘If we want to consummate socialist change in our country, it is necessary to spread further socialist productive relations in the countryside and secure the further growth of agricultural output’. A tractor, the symbol of the Party bringing progress to the countryside, rested at the display’s start. Backing up this message about the benefits of socialist technology was modernist L’udovít Fulla’s triptych painted with rich reds and yellows, depicting rural society before and after the introduction of machinery into farming.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0022009411422371">76</xref></sup> Fulla was one of very few Slovaks with work in the pavilion. Another machine bespeaking the promises of socialist technology for agriculture was Kovář’s microbrewery, a carefully crafted piece of industrial design. Instead of being an imposingly tall, static monolith, Kovář’s microbrewery was a long, low machine with curved glass covers, giving the microbrewery human dimensions and a transparent quality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0022009411422371">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>Taste was the last display in the Work section. Here textiles, clothing, shoes and other industrial designs were exhibited. With the exception of one electric guitar and some lighting, Taste was devoid of consumer goods needing an electric outlet.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0022009411422371">78</xref></sup> Its creator was Antonín Kybal, a textile designer and, after 1945, Professor of Textile Arts at Prague’s Academy of Fine Arts. Kybal was also a member of <italic>Tvar’s</italic> editorial board since its founding. His draperies and carpets decorated the Czechoslovak Embassy in Moscow (which two pavilion architects, Cubr and Pokorný, also decorated). A summary of Kybal’s design theory said he believed ‘Every great age created its own style and there is no doubt that even today’s great epoch of the building of socialism is creating one’. Further, Kybal argued, textile design ‘should be directed towards the closest cooperation with large industrial manufacturing, which is the basis for satisfying the widest levels of working people  …'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0022009411422371">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>By dividing Taste into four sections – representing spring, summer, fall and winter – Kybal exhibited a great variety of Czechoslovak fabrics according to color schemes associated with seasons of the year. Further, using the seasons he thematically presented other industrially designed consumer goods, including furniture, clothing, costume jewelry, shoes, purses, books, musical instruments and sporting goods. The fabrics used to depict spring were lightweight, pastel and with pale prints. Gloves holding artificial spring flowers were incorporated into this display. Easter eggs in a large wicker basket and traditional Easter thrashing sticks (<italic>pomlázky</italic>) further reminded viewers of the season, as did two suspended circles on which girls’ dresses were hung as if fluttering in a breeze. Lightweight textiles with bold solid colors and prints were displayed to represent summer. Seven rows of them stretched out below a large mirror decorated with metal bars depicting the sun’s rays. Nearby wicker chairs were shaped to suggest relaxed human figures. In fall, woolen and cashmere fabrics in typical autumn colors were draped over tall wooden poles representing wheat ready for harvesting. Leather purses rested on a plaid blanket above which hunting rifles and binoculars were displayed. Winter was divided into interior and exterior depictions of life during the coldest season. To depict the interior as a place of fun and conviviality, Kybal created a fantastical musical quartet out of musical instruments decorated with dark brocades. Figures created from skiing and hockey equipment represented outdoor winter life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0022009411422371">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>Leisure and Culture, the other two sections comprising ‘One Day in Czechoslovakia’, also presented blissful depictions of life under socialism and did so without heavy-handed communist propaganda or radical artistic modernism. A highlight of Leisure was the large Children and Puppets display, which puppeteer and animator Jiří Trnka helped to design. Two trees dominated this space, one crafted with abstracted detailing and the other cut from a real tree. A hole was left open in the truck of the abstract tree and inside it visitors viewed a whimsical scene from Trnka’s forthcoming puppet film, ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’. The second tree was the Tree of Toys with platforms cut into its truck and branches for the display of wooden toys, an important area of industrial design in socialist Czechoslovakia. Visitors moved from the Tree of Toys to a cluster of carefully arranged tables filled with colorful wooden figures depicting happy people enjoying everyday life in a Czechoslovak town. Viktor Fixl, founder of the Department of Toys and Decorative Arts at Prague’s University of Applied Art, Václav Kubát and Vít Grus, among others, designed this very popular wooden toy town.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0022009411422371">81</xref></sup> No communist icons appeared in the Children and Puppets display; nor was there any mention of communist youth organizations, including the Pioneers or the Czechoslovak Union of Youth. A Politburo report from 15 September 1958 complained about the absence of the official youth organizations in the pavilion, and it disapproved of ‘nuns boarding a tram with children’ in the wooden toy town.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0022009411422371">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>The next exhibition in the Leisure section was entitled Free Time. Its first part was about general leisure activities. Karel Souček’s large mural with blue and red tones greeted visitors. His geometric rendering of Czechoslovaks enjoying theatre, concerts, art galleries and dance halls broke from socialist realism, although his figures and their activities were easily identifiable. Statistics on ownership of televisions and cameras and attendance at galleries suggested a high living standard. Some Party leaders hoped that the second part of Free Time would attract foreign tourists to Czechoslovakia. In it visitors learned about the country’s many historic monuments and read the following words of Gottwald: ‘It is necessary to make accessible to people the treasures of the past and open wide the gates to knowledge and beauty’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0022009411422371">83</xref></sup> Not all visitors knew that the author of these enlightened-sounding words was a devoted follower of Stalin and the regime’s leader during the purges. A poem by Seifert appeared near Gottwald’s words. Seifert, who left the Czechoslovak Communist Party in 1929 after protesting its Bolshevik tendencies, spoke out against socialist realism at the 1956 Second Writers Congress.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0022009411422371">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Culture section was the last of the pavilion’s three main areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0022009411422371">85</xref></sup> In it visitors first saw a display about Czechoslovak literature with a historic part treating Jan Amos Komenský and the chronicles of Kosmas and Dalimil followed by a modern section featuring S.K. Neumann, Karel Čapek, Jaroslav Hašek, Vančura and Nezval. A separate, small display was devoted to the journalist Julius Fučík. It was very ideological, given the prominent role that Fučík, a communist resister whom the Nazis executed, played in Party iconography after 1945.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0022009411422371">86</xref></sup> However, its location deep within the pavilion lessened its political force. After viewing the literature section, visitors next saw the music section of Culture with a model of the piano that Mozart played while in Prague, and Jan Bauch’s paintings depicting <italic>The Bartered Bride</italic>, <italic>Rusalka</italic> and <italic>Jenůfa</italic>, three Czech operas. Like Kotík’s glass curtain, Bauch’s paintings were criticized for being abstract. The Ministry of Culture’s committee deemed that Bauch had failed to comprehend the content ‘of these classical works of Czech music’, and, due to ‘subjectivity’, his solution was out of keeping ‘with the ideological principles of contemporary Czechoslovak art’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0022009411422371">87</xref></sup> Bauch had earned the Party’s ire in December 1957, when he called for art’s liberation from socialist realism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0022009411422371">88</xref></sup> The committee did not even recommend that Minister Kahuda review Bauch’s paintings; it simply rejected them. Still, after being so condemned, the works were installed, showing that visual artists were not cowering before Party authorities. A Party report written after the World’s Fair had closed stated that Bauch’s paintings, like Kotík’s industrial design, only had substance due to their ‘decorative function'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0022009411422371">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the last part of Culture visitors watched the Polyekran, a new multimedia spectacle with music and multiple screens showing different film clips. Emil Radok and Jiří Svoboda designed the show, the theme of which was ‘Prague Spring’, an annual musical festival in the Czechoslovak capital. From here visitors could next go to the ‘Magic Lantern’ performance, another new multimedia attraction. Or they could go outside to the courtyard and the restaurant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0022009411422371">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>In June 1958, not long after the fair’s opening, the Czechoslovak Communist Party held its Eleventh Party Congress in Prague. In contrast to the pavilion in Brussels, the façade of the Congress’s meeting place was decorated with a red star, hammer and sickle, and a large sign reading ‘Under the Leadership of the KSČ forward to the Consummation of Socialist Construction (Pod vedením KSČ kupředu za dovršení socialistické výstavby)’. Hanging in its interior were the Party’s red flag, the Czechoslovak national flag, portraits of Marx, Engels and Lenin, and a photograph of Gottwald. At the Congress Novotný delivered the official report, which applauded the Soviet Union for rescuing Czechoslovakia from Nazi Germany and criticized revisionists who ‘undertook a general attack against all principles of Marxist-Leninist teachings’. He also made an announcement with great relevance for Czechoslovak industrial design. Novotný announced that by 1970 the Party would construct 1,200,000 new apartments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0022009411422371">91</xref></sup> The construction of so many apartments was to raise the living standard, encourage social satisfaction and, thereby, help the Party maintain stability and control.</p>
<p>Furnishing the great number of new domestic spaces with attractive, affordable, quality furniture and décor conducive to the building of socialism – and helping to pay for them with foreign sales – demanded assistance from industrial designers and it encouraged the reaping of inspiration from EXPO ’58.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0022009411422371">92</xref></sup> Six thousand Czechoslovaks were granted rare permission to leave the East Bloc and travel to Brussels, out of which 262 worked for the Ministry of Consumer Industry. Many members of the smaller select group were industrial designers sent to Brussels to study consumer goods on display in other countries’ pavilions, including western countries’, and to visit department stores in Brussels, like Au Bon Marché. Members of this special contingent wrote reports about and drew pictures of consumer goods that they observed. On 1 January 1959 the Ministry of Consumer Industry opened the Institute for Domestic and Clothing Culture (Ústav bytové a oděvní kultury; hereafter ÚBOK). The task of ÚBOK was to increase the availability and quality of consumer goods for domestic and foreign sales. Its designers, among them Kotík and other contributors to the Czechoslovak pavilion, used the reports and sketches from Brussels to compile a brochure for state-owned factories to use when manufacturing household consumer goods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0022009411422371">93</xref></sup> The brochure presented examples from both sides of the East–West divide. It mentioned unit furniture, including stackable shelves and drawers from Sweden; ‘interestingly shaped chairs made from thermoplastic plywood’ in the French pavilion; ‘folding chairs … with plastic materials of different colors’ in the West German pavilion; a collapsible arm-chair in Au Bon Marché that was ‘shaped not too attractively, but was designed functionally and usefully’; and Soviet chairs judged as ‘very well designed from the perspective of manufacturing technology, as well as from the viewpoint of modern aesthetic effect’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0022009411422371">94</xref></sup> The brochure also applauded curtains in Au Bon Marché decorated with abstract, non-figurative designs reminiscent of Wassily Kandinský and Joan Miró.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0022009411422371">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>Using inspiration from Brussels and with Party support, ÚBOK employees and other industrial designers created prototypes for furniture, glass, ceramics, textiles and other consumer goods that could adorn the new housing. These objects came to be considered exemplary of the Brussels Style, a design wave in socialist Czechoslovakia characterized by ‘asymmetry and eccentricity, lightness bordering on the loss of stability, an expressive language of curves and parabolas, irregular curved surfaces, geometric figures standing unstably on spikes or a thin edge, or expressive lined structures and complicated drawn tangles in space as well as on a surface’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0022009411422371">96</xref></sup> The Party tolerated Brussels-Style design, with its interwar avant-garde and western influences, even after the June 1959 Congress of Socialist Culture where leading Communists sought renewed commitment to socialist realism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0022009411422371">97</xref></sup> The Brussels Style promised to promote domestic stability and Party power through consumer goods that could be sold at home and abroad. Further, it was firmly enmeshed in the socialist system due to the command economy and the convictions of Czechoslovak industrial designers who broke from socialist realist principles, but heeded Party limits in other ways. ‘We are designing the style of the socialist epoch – of socialist man,’ wrote the abstract painter Kotík in a May 1959 article in <italic>Výtvarná práce</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0022009411422371">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Party’s attention to industrially designed consumer goods at and after EXPO ’58 held some potential to increase its already significant powers to intervene into the private lives of Czechoslovak citizens. Various forces worked against this potential and the establishment of total Party control over society, however. Shortages of consumer goods, especially quality goods, were chronic in Czechoslovakia and elsewhere in Eastern Europe throughout the Cold War, causing popular frustration and dissatisfaction with the Party. Furthermore, Czechoslovaks, like other residents of Eastern Europe, did not simply absorb Party ideology through design in their private lives. Rather, they selected, interpreted and reinvented objects in a manner that helped them carve out – to use a word from German historiography – <italic>Eigen-Sinn</italic>, that is, small but important spaces for the making of some meaning and identity autonomous from Party intentions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0022009411422371">99</xref></sup> The study of industrial design is a high-stakes political matter promising illumination of modalities of power through the world of mundane things. Its further study in Eastern European history promises to deepen knowledge of the possibilities for authority and autonomy in consumer societies with single-party rule and elsewhere, the causes of Soviet-styled communism’s longevity and collapse, and reasons for some fond post-socialist memories of life during the Cold War.</p>

Certainly the last three are characteristic of socialism in Czechoslovakia; the first element is less applicable due to Czechoslovakia’s more advanced economy before the Second World War. See G.

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn12-0022009411422371"><label>12</label><p>Socialist realism was an artistic style that relied heavily on figurative depiction to further Communist Party goals. Partisan fighters and soldiers, industrial and agricultural laborers and Communist Party leaders gazing off into the future in heroic, static poses provided much subject matter for socialist realist artists, as did moments important in the Party’s history. Abstract art was condemned as anathema to socialist realism and Party goals, on the grounds that it was bourgeois, counterrevolutionary and difficult for the masses to understand. In the Soviet Union socialist realism became official cultural policy in 1932 following Stalin’s decree, ‘On the Reconstruction of Literary and Art Organizations’. In Czechoslovakia it was made official cultural policy in 1949, thereby having a shorter life and less firm roots there before Stalin’s demise in 1953.

In this survey asking artists what they wished for Czechoslovak art during 1958, Bauch wrote, ‘[I wish] that artistic associations would be re-established according to various visual outlooks’. Kovář said, ‘I wish for our visual art that it permeates even further … there where the worker spends one-third of his life – at the workplace’. Bohumír Dvorský, President of the Artists’ Union, stated, ‘I wish that all artists would … lay foundations for works of such captivating beauty and emotional appeal like the forty victorious years of the Great October Revolution and Manifesto of Peace are for us. The understanding of this path is the path to socialist realism’.</p></fn>

<p><bold>Cathleen M. Giustino</bold> is Associate Professor of History at Auburn University. She is author of <italic>Tearing Down Prague’s Jewish Town</italic>, a study of the radical reconstruction of Prague’s former Jewish ghetto around 1900. She is currently writing a book-length manuscript on the fate of confiscated cultural property, including castles, chateaux, art and antiques, in Czechoslovakia from 1918 to 1980. This project grows out of her interest in the politics of architecture, design and display and research she completed while a Fulbright Research Scholar at the Institute of Art History in Prague.</p>
