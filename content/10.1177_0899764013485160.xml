<abstract>
<p>The welfare reforms initiated in the 1990s prompted increased discussion of the use of faith-based organizations for the provision of social services. This is the second of two articles examining the progress of this debate. The first article provides the scope of inquiry, defines specific characteristics of faith-based organizations, and outlines methods used to study them. This article discusses specific services provided by faith-based organizations and how these organizations are related to the government. Faith-based organizations compared favorably to secular organizations in the services they provided while providing a somewhat narrower range of services. The implementation of Charitable Choice and other faith-based initiatives as policy required consideration of constitutional and practical issues with the implementation of collaborations and partnerships between government and faith-based organizations along with increased government funding and contracting for these organizations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Faith-based organizations (FBOs) provide a significant amount of social service in the United States. In most cities, social services are offered in parallel by both FBOs and secular organizations. In smaller communities, it is not uncommon that FBOs are the primary social service providers. Due to the complementary nature of services provided, inevitable comparisons arise between secular organizations and FBOs for both the types of services and their quality. FBOs are selective in the services they provide. FBOs and their secular counterparts build and mobilize social capital differently.</p>
<p>The relationship between church and state persistently raises important policy and practical issues. Government funding of social services provided by FBOs continues to raise questions, despite over a century of such funding. The rise of Charitable Choice as public policy in the 1990s followed by faith-based initiatives in the 2000s brought the relationship between FBOs and the government into intense academic focus. There was doubt that FBOs could or would assume the role currently played by government services despite some openness for the organizations to explore closer partnerships with government. Examination of the policy developments refined understanding of the ongoing constitutional questions of separation of church and state along with the equal treatment of organizations. As FBOs became more entwined with the government through collaborations, partnerships, contracting, and other funding arrangements, the practical implications of navigating these constitutional issues became clearer through the identification and resolution of problems.</p>
<p>This is the second of two articles reviewing the literature about faith-based organizations. The first of these articles, “Defining Faith-Based Organizations and Understanding them through Research” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764013485160">Bielefeld &amp; Cleveland, 2013</xref>, also in this volume) reviews the religious aspects of faith-based organizations and scholarly methods of inquiry used to understand them. As underlined at the beginning of the first article, our inquiry focuses on independent faith-based organizations and excludes research about religious congregations. As done in the first article, we will shorten the designation of “faith-based organization” to “FBO” and refer to them collectively as “FBOs.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0899764013485160">
<title>Faith-Based Organizations as Service Providers</title>
<p>FBOs exist in large numbers and provide a wide variety of services. The breadth of activities in which FBOs engage is too wide to adequately cover in this review. Topics such as education, services for immigrants, employment support, and advocacy are omitted since we are unable to do them justice in this format. However, we touch on many other services such as rehabilitation of criminals and substance abusers, provision of an extensive variety of health services, and many forms of aid to the poor. The presence of and dependence on volunteers to provide services, including running the organization on the Board of Directors, helps FBOs in a competitive marketplace but does not prevent improprieties within some FBOs. Competitive forces result in inevitable comparisons between secular organizations and FBOs. Comparisons of the quality of service provided generally favor FBOs. Among the factors contributing to the relative success of FBOs include the selection of specific types of services and self-selection of clients either toward or away from FBOs.</p>
<p>The faith-based subsector is large in terms of number of organizations and money raised. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0899764013485160">Scheitle (2010)</xref> analyzed 501(c)(3) registrations and estimated 47,000 to 58,000 independent FBOs, depending on the interpretation of registrations and submission of 990 forms. Some of the activities of FBOs fit with their religious identity such as missionary work and evangelism which also may be pursued through advocacy and activism. Recognizing different channels of religiously related charity for social services, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0899764013485160">Salamon and Teitelbaum (1985)</xref> noted three forms of giving: direct services provided by congregations, providing cash or in-kind assistance to other service providers such as FBOs, and funding federations used to raise and disperse funds such as Lutheran Services, Catholic Charities, or Jewish Federations. While donors may view religious giving by these three categories, we are most interested here in the second form, direct support to FBOs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0899764013485160">Stritt (2008)</xref> evaluated several studies of contributions to the faith-based sector and estimate the combined value of voluntary contributions at around US$50 billion annually. Roughly half of this goes to social service provision by congregations, with the other half to independent FBOs plus “national network” FBOs which include the social service arms of denominations and networks of related organizations.</p>
<p>FBOs are more likely to use volunteers and use them in more roles than secular organizations. In this brief review, we focus only on faith-based volunteering and do not include the vast literature on volunteering reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-0899764013485160">J. Wilson (2012)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0899764013485160">Hodgkinson (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0899764013485160">Perry and Imperial (2001)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0899764013485160">Cnaan, Handy, and Wadsworth (1996)</xref>. Religion attracts, motivates, and sustains volunteers as a method of exploring and expressing their own faith. The faith-based aspect of programming served as a recruiting tool for volunteers and staff especially when high turnover of staff resulted in dependence on volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0899764013485160">Netting, O’Connor, Thomas, &amp; Yancey, 2005</xref>). Religious motivation was consistent for volunteers at two FBOs studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0899764013485160">Belcher and DeForge (2007)</xref>. Reinforcing this basic finding, providing a response to God by helping meet the needs of others was a primary motivation for 25 volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0899764013485160">Garland, Myers, &amp; Wolfer, 2009</xref>). Religious motivation to volunteer helped high school seniors build their own identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-0899764013485160">Youniss, McLellan, &amp; Yates, 1999</xref>). Predicting who is more likely to volunteer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0899764013485160">Grønbjerg and Never (2004)</xref> found higher family status, socioeconomic status, community attachment, and religious involvement to be the most important variables. However, these variables do not predict the specific type of volunteering someone will perform. Nonetheless, religious involvement correlated more closely with volunteering for religious services and direct services. Religious elements impact and help sustain volunteers within service programs. Learning about the need for foster parents through religious organizations inspired more years of service while not affecting other measures of participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0899764013485160">Cox, Buehler, &amp; Orme, 2002</xref>). The impact of interaction with impoverished clients created a secular transformation for volunteers in the Jesuit Volunteer Corps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0899764013485160">Perl, 2006</xref>). These volunteers gained perspective on social justice issues and developed more liberal opinions of welfare reform.</p>
<p>Despite the active involvement in daily activity by volunteers and other stakeholders, FBOs are not immune to malfeasance. In a study of news reports of improprieties, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0899764013485160">Gibelman and Gelman (2002)</xref> found FBOs and secular counterparts equally likely to exhibit management and accountability shortcomings. The offenses included financial misdeeds such as embezzlement, fraud, and misuse of funds along with abuse, which was typically subjected on children. Proper board oversight could have prevented the embezzlement schemes at the FBOs profiled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0899764013485160">Gibelman, Gelman, and Pollack (1997)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr160-0899764013485160">Wosh (2004)</xref> detailed how Covenant House emerged as a respectable organization after weathering exposure of sexual abuse and financial misdeeds.</p>
<p>The sexual abuse scandal within the Catholic Church caused many ripple effects beyond the core misdeeds. Focusing on the Archdiocese of Boston, when the church reorganized its services and schools, the government was not included in the process. The closure of schools especially impacted the families and communities involved as they sought other services. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0899764013485160">Heuer (2006)</xref> suggested policy remedies requiring inclusion of important stakeholders when organizations elect to cease providing social services with a substantial public impact.</p>
<sec id="section3-0899764013485160">
<title>Faith-Based Organizations Compared to Secular Organizations</title>
<p>Numerous studies directly compare FBOs and secular organizations. Two main avenues of inquiry are the quality of the services provided and the ability to select services. For quality of services, FBOs and secular organizations are mostly viewed as equivalent in service delivery. This equivalence in performance reveals a common basis for providing social service. However, in some cases, the services provided are deemed superior by FBOs and in others by secular organizations. The overwhelming number of studies found FBOs provided equivalent or superior services to their secular counterparts. As we explore, this may be attributable to the selection of services by FBOs and the sorts of clients drawn to, or avoiding, FBOs. FBOs are uniformly viewed as providing a narrower scope of services than secular organizations while still considered a significant provider of vital services. The ability of clients to choose between secular service providers and FBOs probably contributes to the overall improvement in service for both groups as those with a particular affinity can select an organization that best meet their needs.</p>
<sec id="section4-0899764013485160">
<title>Equivalent Provision of Service</title>
<p>Isomorphic pressures, especially in terms of market forces and government requirements, may drive equivalence in program effectiveness between FBOs and secular organizations. Isomorphism, using Amos Hawley’s definition, “is a constraining process that forces one unit in a population to resemble other units that face the same set of environmental conditions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0899764013485160">DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983</xref>, p. 149). In the clearest connection illustrating isomorphism, no performance differences between religiously affiliated and secular nonprofit nursing homes were found in 3,000 nursing homes by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0899764013485160">Amirkhanyan, Kim, and Lambright (2008)</xref>. The number of violations reported, quality of care, and quality of life are clear to regulators and families of residents which force the nursing homes to provide similar levels of care. In another instance with high government involvement, no reduction in reincarceration in the first 2 years after release from prison was found for nearly 1,000 inmates participating in a faith-based program compared to the nearly 80,000 prisoners statewide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0899764013485160">Brazzell &amp; LaVigne, 2008</xref>). In a review of over 100 articles about the provision of health services by FBOs related to prevention, health maintenance, cardiovascular health, and cancer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0899764013485160">DeHaven, Hunter, Wilder, Walton, and Berry (2004)</xref> found these programs effectively improved health outcomes. Improvements in screening, knowledge about diseases, and behavioral changes which improved health indicated the capacity for FBOs to serve as an effective service provider. In a comparative study of Charitable Choice implementation in Massachusetts, Indiana, and North Carolina, FBOs were comparable in effectiveness to secular or government providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0899764013485160">Kennedy &amp; Bielefeld, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0899764013485160">Queen, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond their core programs, services provided by FBOs added value in several instances. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-0899764013485160">Stoltzfus (2007)</xref> reviewed the empirical outcomes of 16 studies of programs addressing substance use and abuse through 12-step programs, meditation, prayer, rites of passage, sweat lodges, and other religious programs. The faith-based treatments proved comparable to secular programs for successfully addressing substance use and provided somewhat better results in other variables. The cost competitiveness of the faith-based services argued strongly for their continuation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0899764013485160">Monsma’s (2006)</xref> examination of client evaluation of 17 welfare-to-work programs in Los Angeles found no systematic superiority in effectiveness in program performance between FBOs and secular counterparts. Instead, programs appeared specialized with FBOs more effectively providing emotional and sympathetic support whereas for-profit providers excelled in job skill training and securing employment.</p>
<p>Interviews with participants revealed a perception of equivalence in service provision by FBOs and secular organizations. FBOs and secular organizations were viewed differently by nonprofit directors in the personalized treatment of clients, religiosity in service delivery, community connections, and level of professionalization while clients experienced the two types of organizations in similar ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0899764013485160">Kissane, 2008</xref>). Staff and volunteers at 36 refugee programs in the United States perceived similar program implementation for resettlement between FBOs and secular organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0899764013485160">Nawyn, 2006</xref>). However, in this case, due to the connection of religion and culture, religion was expressed differently. Providers view religion as a motivation for providing the largely secular services while clients used religion as an important sense of self-identification.</p>
<p>FBOs and secular counterparts have equivalent general management attributes. Targeted organizational capacity building interventions produced robust and equivalent gains in capacity for both faith-based and secular organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0899764013485160">Leake et al., 2007</xref>). These interventions covered many aspects of management including board development, funding and financial management, human resources management, and program management. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0899764013485160">Kearns, Park, and Yankoski (2005)</xref> surveyed 237 organizations in western Pennsylvania and found FBOs comparable to secular counterparts in size, funding, program capacity, and management systems. FBOs relied more on volunteers and less on government funding while engaging in less political advocacy or lobbying compared to secular equivalents. FBOs and secular organizations experienced similar levels of funding volatility and inconsistencies in the provision of services year-to-year. North Philadelphia FBOs maintained a substantial presence in providing services in low-income communities that may be overlooked because they sometimes function as “silent partners” within their communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0899764013485160">Botchwey, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0899764013485160">
<title>FBOs Providing Superior Service</title>
<p>Contrary to the findings of equivalence in service provision, some studies show superior performance by FBOs compared to their secular counterparts. In a review of nearly 800 studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0899764013485160">Johnson, Tompkins, and Webb (2002)</xref> concluded that available research strongly supports the premise that FBOs provide services more effectively than secular or government equivalents. This corroborated their observation that participation in religious activities led to better mental and physical health. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0899764013485160">Kim et al. (2008)</xref> studied an experimental method in which significantly more weight loss occurred for those going through the faith-based program than those in the control group. A similar approach to postabortion grief by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0899764013485160">Layer, Roberts, Wild, and Walters (2004)</xref> found reinforcing results with participants exhibiting significant decreases in shame and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, decreases which participants attributed to religious beliefs and the spiritual nature of the intervention.</p>
<p>Measuring program completion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764013485160">Daggett, Camp, Kwon, Rosenmerkel, and Klein-Saffran (2008)</xref> surveyed nearly 800 participants and found scripture reading, the perception of self-worth, and desire to reintegrate into society as critical factors in completion of the faith-based “Life Connections Program” offered in federal prisons. A majority of participants who completed a faith-based reentry program increased their spiritual faith as a result of their prison experience while those who decreased their faith were 34 times more likely to drop out of the program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0899764013485160">Roman, Wolff, Correa, &amp; Buck, 2007</xref>). The recidivism rate was 3% compared to a national average of 50% in a reentry program for a broad cross-section of participants in the San Diego Welcome Home Ministries. Essential services in this program included peer-driven planning, moral and logistical support, as well as support groups for mental illness or substance abuse and spiritual needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0899764013485160">Miller, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0899764013485160">Goldstein, Warner-Robbins, McClean, Macatula, and Conklin (2009)</xref> studied 44 women in this same faith-based program and found a 77% reduction in recidivism in the 12 months after release. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-0899764013485160">Tangenberg (2005)</xref> found inconclusive results in a review of 12-step substance abuse programs, although client participation in spiritual activities within a residential treatment program resulted in higher program completion rates than those not participating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr158-0899764013485160">Wolf-Branigin &amp; Duke, 2007</xref>). This correlation raised the question if the program preferentially attracted and retained clients based on the religious component or if clients felt less accepted due to nonparticipation in the spiritual content.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0899764013485160">
<title>Client and Program Selection</title>
<p>Clients are often drawn to programs consistent with their own religious beliefs. This program affinity was an important theme for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0899764013485160">Hodge (2000)</xref> in the analysis of residential treatment programs in which both faith-based and secular programs had equivalent treatment, especially related to client autonomy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0899764013485160">Monsma and Soper’s (2006)</xref> evaluation of Los Angeles welfare-to-work programs found religiously active clients had better outcomes than those who were not. However, this difference disappeared for participation in faith-based programs with greater gains in social capital and highly rated religious components. Importantly, secular programs excelled in finding employment for clients. Building on the concept of self-selection, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0899764013485160">Garner (2007)</xref> found 26% of chronic public inebriates who entered a secular organization’s rehabilitation program would refuse to utilize an equivalent program offered by an FBO. Similarly, strong religious affiliation of the client increased the likelihood of using faith-based providers while nonreligious clients were half as likely to use faith-based providers in an analysis of data from homeless women in Los Angeles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0899764013485160">Heslin, Andersen, &amp; Gelberg, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>FBOs offer a narrower range of services than secular providers and are selective about services they provide. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0899764013485160">Graddy (2006)</xref> studied nearly 3,500 providers of over 100 types of social services providers in Los Angeles. FBOs provided fewer types and a different mix of services than secular counterparts. The modest and focused role of FBOs complemented secular organizations. In a different analysis of this same data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0899764013485160">Graddy and Ye (2006)</xref> described FBOs focused on transitional assistance and multiservice interventions while secular organizations provided a comprehensive range of services. FBOs provided a disproportionate share of essential social services in low-income communities in survey of 230 western Pennsylvania nonprofits despite equivalent management infrastructure and an even distribution of FBOs according to prosperity of communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0899764013485160">Kearns, 2007</xref>). Also examining accessibility to the poor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0899764013485160">Allard (2008)</xref> found FBOs including religious elements in service provision had greater accessibility to the poor than FBOs not incorporating religious elements.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0899764013485160">Misleh and Hanneman (2004)</xref> discuss the motivations for several Christian denominations to provide victim offender reconciliation programs in which the offenders meet their victims to accept personal responsibility and aid the process of repair. However, not all organizations desire to create prison programs. Responses from 128 FBOs in Indiana indicated that FBOs are selective about engaging in prison ministries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0899764013485160">Gray (2006)</xref> found that religious affiliation, denomination, and type of community influenced an organization’s involvement in prison-related programs.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0899764013485160">Reingold, Pirog, and Brady (2007)</xref> found the most disadvantaged welfare recipients used the services of FBOs more than secular providers. Contrarily, a study of 2,000 residents of low-income neighborhoods by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr161-0899764013485160">Wuthnow, Hackett, and Hsu (2004)</xref> found the financial needs and scope of problems served were equivalent between clients of FBOs and government agencies. However, there were significant differences with clients of FBO services. In this study, clients perceived that faith-based and secular nonprofit organizations to be equally trustworthy and effective. However, they evaluated the trustworthiness and effectiveness of public agencies lower than FBOs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0899764013485160">
<title>Social capital</title>
<p>The mobilization of social capital provides contrary results depending on if it is spurred by FBOs or secular organizations. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0899764013485160">Schneider (2009)</xref> for an overview of conceptual issues and empirical complications in the study of social capital. FBOs create both bonding and bridging social capital. Bonding social capital creates stronger relationships within a group while bridging social capital crosses between groups to create wider social bonds. In a study of programs encouraging relationships outside the group, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0899764013485160">Lockhart’s (2005)</xref> comparison of five poverty-to-work programs found FBOs developed more bridging and bonding social capital than their secular counterparts. This included the establishment lasting relationships for clients with religious congregations as part of their program. In a contrary finding comparing the creation of social capital, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr151-0899764013485160">Weare, Musso, and Crigler (2008)</xref> found secular neighborhood councils built better bridging networks than faith-based equivalents.</p>
<p>Creation of social capital has its limits. At an individual level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0899764013485160">Smith and Peyrot (2008)</xref> found religious behaviors and beliefs correlated strongly with personal involvement with FBOs and less so with secular civic involvement. Three Quaker organizations studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0899764013485160">Schneider (1999)</xref> depended on shared understandings, behaviors, and patterns of trust as the basis for social capital. Spreading this social capital relied on proactive efforts to build bridging relationships in terms of network relations. However, these programs generally did not incorporate outsiders. A study of Habitat for Humanity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0899764013485160">Hays, 2002</xref>) found the social capital created did not erase socioeconomic barriers. Volunteers working to improve the lives of others accessed resources, raised awareness of community needs, and created new links between individuals in different social groups. While making a contribution to bridging capital, organizational leadership remained predominantly White and affluent.</p>
<p>Race can polarize the development of social capital. Comparing organizations in Jackson, Mississippi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0899764013485160">Silverman (2001)</xref> found that FBOs mobilized social capital based on religion and secular organizations mobilized social capital based on race. However, the social capital has limited application by being focused on the specific activity of the organization and may not carry over into other aspects of community development. Building on this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-0899764013485160">Silverman (2002)</xref> found religiously based social capital was compatible with race-based social capital for the FBOs studied. Accessing faith-based networks to spur neighborhood revitalization was one potential method for racial reconciliation and economic development. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr159-0899764013485160">Wood (2002)</xref> found two organizations in Oakland, California developed faith-based religious social capital and secular race-based social capital. These organizations accessed social capital differently with complementary outcomes for equality and social justice. However, some programs intentionally avoided creating divides along racial or class distinctions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0899764013485160">Marquez (2000)</xref> studied an FBO working in poor neighborhoods with high proportions of Mexican Americans, which sought to repair damage to social ties and rebuild social institutions.</p>

<title>How Are Faith-Based Organizations Related to Government?</title>
<p>The literature in this review was nurtured by, when not actually born during, the debate about how welfare reform might impact the role of religion in the public sphere. Consequently, the relationship of FBOs to government was a prominent topic of discussion. Topics in this category include how FBOs fit into the social welfare system in the United States, the analysis of Charitable Choice as government policy, the implementation of Charitable Choice, how FBOs partner with government agencies, and government funding and contracting.</p>

<title>Faith-Based Organizations and the Social Welfare System</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr150-0899764013485160">Walsh (2001)</xref> showed, religious groups provide a variety of social welfare services. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0899764013485160">Falbo (1998)</xref> maintained that a religious orientation can be compatible with community service. As part of welfare reform, however, FBOs were called upon to become more heavily involved in the provision of government-funded social welfare services. This led to several concerns about the capacity of FBOs to increase services from an operational standpoint, challenging a fundamental assumption of the faith-based initiatives. Government funding issues are discussed later in this article.</p>
<p>A number of authors studied particular types and cases of social welfare provision. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0899764013485160">Fossett (2004)</xref> considered the role of FBOs in health care and in Medicaid in particular. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0899764013485160">Mapes (2004)</xref> examined the role that FBO-provided social services played within Indianapolis’s larger social welfare support system. Numerous authors examined the involvement of Catholic religious organizations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0899764013485160">Coleman (2001)</xref> described how American Catholic institutions played a crucial and continuous role in debates about welfare reform. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764013485160">Adloff (2006)</xref> described how Catholic Charities USA became a publicly active actor on a national level, involved in societal and political discourse in addition to service provision.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0899764013485160">Bishop (2006)</xref> described the increased service demands on community action agencies resulting from cutbacks in state social service spending and welfare reform. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764013485160">Alexander (1999)</xref>, however, noted that the capacity of FBOs to play major roles as government contractors is limited by their financial and human resources and the potential conflict between market orientation and organizational mission. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0899764013485160">Sosin and Smith (2006)</xref> found the level of services provided rarely increased to meet increasing demand and any increment to service delivery was not responsive to eligibility for government funding due to policy changes. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0899764013485160">Kissane (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0899764013485160">2008</xref>) questioned the capacity of FBOs to take on services for low-income and welfare-reliant families and poor women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0899764013485160">Poole (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0899764013485160">Poole, Ferguson, DiNitto, and Schwab (2002)</xref> raised doubts about the capacity of FBOs to achieve the goal of moving welfare families into the labor force and taking leadership role in welfare reform. Resources and operational ability limit the growth of some FBOs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0899764013485160">Dunn (2009)</xref> found problems in the availability of volunteer physicians and inability to secure surgical services at no cost for a newly established free health clinic. To help explain limitations of FBOs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0899764013485160">Gibelman and Gelman (2003)</xref> found the perceptions of FBOs being nonbureaucratic, cheaper, and more effective differed from the realities of these organizations, which could entail lacking accountability, having untested costs, and providing no defensible data for effectiveness.</p>
<sec id="section10-0899764013485160">
<title>Charitable Choice as policy</title>
<p>Charitable Choice and government funding of FBOs received substantial scholarly attention in a number of areas: government policy, court decisions, organizational governance, and the evolution of policy regarding government funding of religious organizations. Government policy and court decisions centered on constitutional questions of the separation of church and state with attention also given to freedom of speech and hiring restrictions for religious organizations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0899764013485160">Kuzma (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0899764013485160">Knippenberg (2003)</xref> summarize the full range of constitutional issues with government funding of FBOs. Central to the discussions were elements of the first amendment prohibiting laws respecting the establishment of religion along with guaranteeing the free exercise of religion freedom of speech. Government neutrality regarding religion and the equal treatment of organizations were relevant factors. Considerations included whether financial support led to a perceived endorsement of religion with direct or indirect government aid to FBOs. Proselytization or coercion of beneficiaries to engage in religious activities was another key issue among the diverse organizations competing for funding and clients to assist. Religious discrimination in hiring created another sticky issue for religious organizations desiring to maintain their distinctive identity.</p>
<p>How far back is it appropriate to trace the origin of government support of faith-based initiatives? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0899764013485160">Daly (2009)</xref> claimed the need to look back to the pluralist tradition of the 19th century Christian democracies in Europe. During this period, secular government in countries such as the Netherlands shared sovereignty with social organizations providing education and social services. These organizations sought to protect themselves philosophically and legally against government dominance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0899764013485160">Hall (2001)</xref> amplified this by noting that liberal Protestantism in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries profoundly impacted social service organizations emerging at the time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0899764013485160">Fitzgerald (2011)</xref> also traced the origins of religious traditionalism as it informs social welfare to the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries. She tied thinkers such as Edmund Burke, Pope Leo XIII, leaders of the Social Gospel movement, and Reinhold Niebuhr to writers inspiring “compassionate conservatism” such as Marvin Olasky and John DiIulio.</p>
<p>The definition of separation of church and state evolved from vague to more specific starting in the earliest era of the country. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0899764013485160">Firoz and Matthews (2003)</xref> traced the discussion of separation of church and state to President Jefferson’s reassurance of the constitutional protection of Ursuline nuns who provided education and care for orphans in the freshly acquired New Orleans. Jefferson also loaned government money to groups Christianizing Native Americans. Federal policy subsequently articulated a prohibition against funding religious activity. The porosity of the establishment clause was traced through the funding of hospitals, education, and the child benefit theory which states that money can be spent directly on beneficiaries as long as it does not directly go from the government to a religious institution. Tying these historic events to current concerns predicted problems for the faith-based initiatives included religious-based hiring preferences, proselytization of beneficiaries of programs, compromised vitality of religious communities, undue competition between groups, favoritism between religious groups, no proof of efficacy for religiously based programs, and the potential for increased regulation of religious organizations.</p>
<p>Beyond constitutional concerns, scholars connected the dismantling of the welfare state to Charitable Choice and faith-based initiatives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0899764013485160">Isaac (2003)</xref> countered this view by arguing that the faith-based initiative was part of a nuanced evolution of the dismantling of the welfare state, moving the country to a civil society approach encouraging civic engagement rather than a liberal, bureaucratic government approach. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0899764013485160">Belcher, Fandetti, and Cole (2004)</xref> noted elements of Christian conservatism were incompatible with a liberal welfare state. The two ideologies could cooperatively meet basic human needs while the state should remain the driving force for social change. B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-0899764013485160">Wineburg (2007)</xref> argued that the devolution of social welfare programs to the private sector, and FBOs in particular, was part of a culture war to increase the number and influence of evangelical Christians as voters. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr157-0899764013485160">R. J. Wineburg, Coleman, Boddie, and Cnaan (2008)</xref> pointed to the recruitment of FBOs during the Reagan administration as an increasing wave of state-centered New Federalism, implemented through block grants and related programs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0899764013485160">Biebricher (2011)</xref> argued that the Faith-Based and Community Initiative was a typical case of government restructuring with the outsourcing of social services to private organizations. In this effort, government bureaucrats faced challenges in maintaining the separation of church and state while performing necessary functions such as contracting procedures, contract administration, and performance evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0899764013485160">Kennedy &amp; Bielefeld, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Case law plays an important role defining the implementation and limits of policy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0899764013485160">Schragger (2011)</xref> found under-enforcement of the establishment clause, albeit perhaps for good reasons, left many activities legally unregulated. One element of this misalignment was activity funded by local governments versus the federal government since federal courts examine federal activity much more closely. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr152-0899764013485160">Wedlock and Jasper (1973)</xref> reviewed several important cases affecting the treatment of parochial schools and government funding in regards to separation of church and state, especially focusing on the doctrines of secular purpose, child benefit, and neutrality. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0899764013485160">Leavy and Raps (1979)</xref> outlined how the Supreme Court established double standards in their decisions regarding the constitutionality of government funding of parochial schools depending on their status as elementary schools, secondary schools, and institutions of higher learning. Renewing this discussion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0899764013485160">Dolan (2004)</xref> considered similar arguments in anticipation of court challenges to faith-based provisions in the No Child Left Behind Act regarding accountability, grants, and supplemental services.</p>
<p>Standing for initiating legal action is created for taxpayers when religious organizations are funded by government and not simply the issuance of an executive order or passage of enabling legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0899764013485160">Establishment Clause, 2006</xref>). Standing was revisited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0899764013485160">Savage (2007)</xref> in a discussion of freedom of speech and the limits of government funding religious organizations, finding that, while taxpayers have standing, religious organizations and the government both were free to speak about religion.</p>
<p>Government funding of evangelism and other overtly religious activity was a persistent concern. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0899764013485160">Sider and Unruh (2001)</xref> used their research into the range of religious expression within organizations to understand the degree of proselytization occurring in FBOs. They found evangelism can be passive, by invitation, by creating relationships, integrated into programs but optional for participants, or mandatorily integrated into the programs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0899764013485160">Broyles (2003)</xref> argued against restricting free speech for government-funded FBOs on the basis that it violated the principle of neutrality. The potential that evangelism may occur with government funding did not justify the restriction of speech for religious organizations accepting this funding. However, noting how prisoners experienced proselytizing through FBOs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0899764013485160">Persky (2008)</xref> described as unconstitutional the funding of tough programs successful at reducing prison overcrowding that crossed the line to Christian evangelism.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0899764013485160">Saperstein (2003)</xref> presented a number of policy reasons to avoid direct government funding of pervasively sectarian FBOs, even though the Supreme Court held this funding to be legal if funds are used for secular purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0899764013485160"><italic>Agostini v. Felton</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0899764013485160"><italic>Mitchell v. Helms</italic>, 2000</xref>). Policy reasons included potential threats to religious autonomy, dilution of religious mission, reduction in ability for religious organizations to hold the government accountable, limitations on the benefits of competition, weakened support from individuals to their religious organizations, increased divisiveness, and lack of evidence of efficacy of faith-based programs. In addition, neutrality in treating all entities similarly is fraught with paradox due to the establishment clause and exemplified by the general exemption of religious organizations from employment discrimination laws.</p>
<p>FBOs receiving government funding undergo changes reflected in accountability and bureaucratization. Accountability works both to hold the government and its funded organizations responsible for expenditures of funds as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0899764013485160">Gilman (2002)</xref>. Accountability due to certain protections afforded nonprofits, especially tort immunities, are diluted with government funding of nonprofit organizations, especially religious ones. Accountability for religious organizations was additionally complicated by the first amendment establishment clause. However, as argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0899764013485160">Gibeaut (2001)</xref>, these complications needed to protect against illegal actions such as child abuse regardless of where it occurs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0899764013485160">Sherman (1995)</xref> articulated the risks to FBOs receiving government funding, noting how the Salvation Army accepted a large government contract in Michigan. Risks to this FBO included the paradox of helping people become independent from welfare while the organization itself depended on government funds, the depersonalization of service, increased bureaucracy through paperwork, organizational drift, and secularization.</p>
<p>The restriction on hiring created one of the stickiest problems for the faith-based initiative. The ability for religious organizations to hire people based on their religious views was restricted by state and federal laws. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0899764013485160">McClellan (2004)</xref> outlined the preemption issue wherein the federal rules and accompanying federal funding may legally preempt state rules on hiring discrimination. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0899764013485160">Rosenthal (2006)</xref> outlined four ways the hiring question can be managed. First was explicit extension of the coreligionist and ministerial exemptions for program-related employees of funded organizations. The second was denial of discriminatory exemptions for program-related employees. The third was denial of any discriminatory exemptions for any positions within a funded organization. The fourth was government silence on the issue, maintaining the status quo.</p>
<p>One tool government bureaucrats used to get feedback as well as guide their actions was public opinion surveys. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-0899764013485160">VanSlyke, Horne, and Thomas (2005)</xref> found that two thirds of Georgians agreed that FBOs should be able to compete for government funds while maintaining their religious identities. Fifty-five percent of these respondents believed it was constitutional for the government to provide funds to FBOs. In consideration of the religious freedoms of social service clients, respondents were evenly split, with about one third each agreeing, being neutral, or disagreeing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0899764013485160">Lugo et al. (2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0899764013485160">2009</xref>) found popularity of faith-based initiatives, with approximately two thirds of Americans supporting government funding of social services provided by FBOs. However, a minority of only one third, favored proselytizing. Similarly, less than a quarter favored religious restrictions for hiring when government funds went to faith-based groups. When focusing only on public funding of faith-based correctional programs, opinions were similar, with 70% of respondents opposed proselytizing and 79% opposed to hiring discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0899764013485160">Cullen et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Authors were split in their support of government funding of FBOs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr155-0899764013485160">P. A. Wilson (2003)</xref> argued for FBOs eligibility to receive government funding in order to better address the increasing diversity in society and encourage better decisions and responsiveness in the public’s interest. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0899764013485160">Glenn (2000)</xref> argued for funding and accountability based on the effectiveness of schools and social services provided, especially for the most vulnerable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0899764013485160">DiIulio (2007)</xref> argued for a balanced approach for funding FBOs which neither unduly protects or disempowers them based on the long history of government funding religious organizations and his experiences in the Bush administration’s Faith-Based and Community Initiatives. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0899764013485160">Gill (2004)</xref> rejected the idea of government funding of FBOs unless the funded organizations are required to comply with all the same rules as secular counterparts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0899764013485160">
<title>Implementation of Charitable Choice</title>
<p>State-level implementation of Charitable Choice provided critical tests of government relations with FBOs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0899764013485160">Orr and Spoto (2003)</xref> found a lack of statewide Charitable Choice regulations handicapped implementation in California. The prospect of public funding interested FBO leaders in Southern California, although increased funding would not lead to FBOs completely assuming tasks performed by government agencies since the 1930s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0899764013485160">Orr, Mounts, &amp; Spoto, 2001</xref>). After California developed statewide pilot programs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0899764013485160">Campbell (2011)</xref> found that California’s top-down implementation approach of providing short-term funding for isolated local organizations did not create enduring programs and partnerships. These findings suggested demonstration projects within specific communities would better increase the network of social services offered. Charitable Choice implementation differed depending on the state’s contracting regimes, political cultures, and policies in social welfare departments in a comparative study of Massachusetts, Indiana, and North Carolina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0899764013485160">Kennedy &amp; Bielefeld, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0899764013485160">Queen, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Governmental factors influencing implementation include logistics, personnel, and administration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0899764013485160">Kinney (2006)</xref> identified three factors affecting implementation: employment background of state program coordinators, the rural or urban setting of state programs, and constraints on state welfare apparatuses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0899764013485160">Sager (2007a)</xref> examined the use of state-appointed “faith-based liaisons” to link religious groups and state agencies and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0899764013485160">Sager (2007b)</xref> examined state outreach to the Black religious community. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0899764013485160">Cnaan and Newman (2010)</xref> noted how the government needed the Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, but that this office needed to adopt new approaches that were more community oriented.</p>

<sec id="section12-0899764013485160">
<title>Government—FBO collaboration and partnerships</title>
<p>Several books centered on collaborations between FBOs and government. Five hundred welfare-to-work programs in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Dallas included programs administered by a variety of public agencies, secular nonprofits, and FBOs, with FBOs comprising from 14.1% to 40.6% of the programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0899764013485160">Monsma, 2004</xref>). Findings included the fact that, contrary to findings mentioned earlier, two thirds of FBOs getting government money reported this permitted them to expand their services to more people in need. Over 90% of all those who led faith-based programs wanted to expand their programs. While over half received no public funds, 60% of those wanted to apply. Finally, while public–FBO partnerships increased, FBOs were rejected for funding three times more often than secular nonprofits, despite lack of credible evidence that they performed more poorly.</p>
<p>Inclusion of FBOs in disaster planning and response networks strengthened efforts at multiple levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0899764013485160">Koenig (2006)</xref> proposed that federal, state, and local government policy leaders cooperate formally to integrate religious organizations into disaster response systems. Drawing upon evidence from Hurricane Katrina, he described how the contributions of FBOs were highlights amidst bungled government responses. The contributions of FBOs to Katrina disaster relief showed how FBOs were part of the existing organic structures of communities and were, therefore, in a position to respond quickly to coordinate delivery of material and nonmaterial relief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0899764013485160">Ealy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0899764013485160">Pant, Kirsch, Subbarao, Hsieh, &amp; Vu, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-0899764013485160">Suite, Rollin, Bowman, and La Bril (2007)</xref> found interdisciplinary trauma training intended to improve capacity of urban trauma respondents that specifically incorporated secular and faith-based approaches received positive feedback from nearly all participants.</p>
<p>Several studies examined a range of collaborations to describe their variety and identify factors promoting their success. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-0899764013485160">Thomas (2009)</xref> carried out a qualitative study of the relationships between public and private sector organizations, including FBOs in 15 social service programs. FBOs collaborated with government and other organizations for a variety of purposes, including service delivery, administration, and sharing volunteers and other resources. The degree of interaction varied from fairly autonomous and limited cooperation to more intense and substantial collaborative linkages. Finally, the governance of the collaboration varied from a formal contract to an informal understanding.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0899764013485160">Rogers (2009)</xref> drew on in-depth interviews to identify keys to effective collaborations between government and community-based, religiously affiliated nonprofits. Communication, resource sharing, and common goals and values were key factors. Communication should be regular and frequent, formal as well as informal, and across all organizational units and levels. In addition, interaction should be based on mutual respect in order to encourage and enable productive interactions both within and across the partnering agencies. Formal and informal relationships between the FBOs and others are also important. None of the collaborative programs would have existed without government funding. In addition, however, the networks FBOs had with other organizations in their community were important sources of both tangible and intangible assets. Finally, both the FBOs and their government partners committed to improving the prospects for individuals and families. This overarching goal brought the various agencies to the table. They also shared important values, such as a respect for the partners and quality in administration and service.</p>
<p>Government collaboration with provider coalitions revealed effective, even if problematic, solutions to social service delivery. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0899764013485160">Pipes and Ebaugh (2002)</xref> noted that much religious outreach is provided by faith-based coalitions. They studied 14 faith-based coalitions and their response to accepting government funding. These coalitions had a variety of structures, resources, programs, and attitudes toward government contracting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0899764013485160">Campbell (2002)</xref>, likewise, concluded that a more effective approach by government would be to put less focus on funding individual contractors and more on building church-based coalitions and organizing networks. However, several authors noted difficulties in these collaborative relationships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0899764013485160">Ebaugh, Chafetz, and Pipes (2007)</xref> in a study of faith-based social service coalitions found that FBOs collaborated most often with other FBOs and that the most explicitly religious were least likely to collaborate with government. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0899764013485160">B. L. Lewis, Boulahanis, and Matheny (2009)</xref> examined a collaborative network among homeless serving agencies. In this case, collaboration was required for receiving government funds.

<title>Government funding and contracting</title>
<p>Studies documented the extent of government funding of FBO’s and identified positive impacts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0899764013485160">Monsma (1996)</xref> used data from a nationwide survey to document the extent and nature of government funds flowing to FBOs. The data showed that even highly religious organizations received substantial funding. In addition, most nonprofits report relatively little overt pressure on their religious practices from government, watchdog organizations, or the press. These results were consistent with Monsma and Mounts’ welfare-to-work study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0899764013485160">2002</xref>) which found that FBOs received substantial government funding and that only few of them were opposed to such funding. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0899764013485160">Monsma (2003)</xref> provided some suggestions for fostering the role of FBOs in welfare to work programs, including limiting the percentage of their income that comes from government and making it easier to develop alternative funding. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0899764013485160">Lampkin and Raghavan (2008)</xref> examined factors influencing funding decision and found that government funding is affected positively by FBO age, negatively by size, and negatively by debt ratio and cash on hand.</p>
<p>Traditional funding systems limited the impact of government funding on some FBOs. Organizations affiliated with many religions including Jewish, Catholic, Lutheran, Episcopal, Methodist, and Presbyterian have extensive experience implementing government contracts for hospitals, schools, immigration services, and other activities. However, different sampling techniques illustrated substantial nuances. Because many FBOs rely more on voluntary contributions than government funding, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-0899764013485160">Twombly (2002)</xref> questioned how increasing availability of government funding through faith-based initiatives would lead to increased provision of services by FBOs and if FBOs had the capacity to manage government grants or contracts. Increased competition within and among denominational organizations led to more social service provision as measured by spending on programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0899764013485160">DeBartolo, 2009</xref>). Despite extremely similar expenditure patterns, FBOs depended on donor contributions to a very high degree while secular organizations were far more likely to depend on government contracts and grants based on information from over 2,000 large service providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-0899764013485160">Twombly, 2002</xref>). This finding was reinforced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0899764013485160">Ebaugh, Pipes, Chafetz, and Daniels (2003)</xref> who found very low reliance of FBOs on government support, either funding or in-kind, while secular organizations relied heavily on government support. With similar results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0899764013485160">Ebaugh, Chafetz, and Pipes (2006b)</xref> found organizations reporting higher measures of religiosity were much less likely to receive government funding while being much more likely to evangelize. Furthering a preference for private support, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0899764013485160">Sherman and Green (2006)</xref> found 37% of the FBOs operated earned-income ventures and a further 20% intended to do so.</p>
<p>Government funding has led to some positive effects. Federal funding effectively built organizational capacity in FBOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0899764013485160">Popescu, Sugawara, Hernandez, and Dewan, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0899764013485160">Sinha (2013</xref>, this issue) examined changes in 33 FBOs between 2001 and 2008 representing a variety of denominational affiliations. Of these, four small African American FBOs received new federal faith-based-related funding. These funds were used, in part, to build capacity. This included applying for 501(c)(3) status, expanding governance capacity, adding staff and facilities, and leveraging additional funding. Sinha concluded that without this funding the capacity building would have been unlikely for these younger and newer FBOs. In addition, contrary to notions of crowding out, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0899764013485160">Horne, VanSlyke, and Johnson (2006)</xref> found that private funders would not change their support of FBOs if government funding increased.</p>
<p>A number of qualifications, however, have been raised. It is noteworthy that in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0899764013485160">Sinha’s (2013</xref>, this issue) study, none of the other 29 FBOs received any increased federal funds, although eight of them engaged in strategies to seek new resources. Their strategies were aimed at a variety of private sector funding sources. This may attest to limitations in the appeal of federal faith-based-related funding. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764013485160">Carlson-Thies (2009)</xref> found that attitudes toward government funding varied by religion. He found evangelical support for Charitable Choice. Faith-based initiatives were seen as representing the end, or at least mitigation of, governmental indifference or hostility to social-service providers that are distinctly religious. On the other hand, he found Jewish opposition to government funding because it was seen as a violation of the Establishment Clause’s requirement of “no aid to religion” and a harmful breach in the wall between church and state. Moreover, since the United States is primarily Christian, government support for religious organizations would mean support for Christianity to the detriment of Jews and other minority religions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0899764013485160">Ebaugh, Chafetz, and Pipes (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0899764013485160">2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0899764013485160">2006b</xref>), in a study of faith-based service coalitions, found complex relationships between funding and FBO attitudes toward funding sources, religiosity, and structural features. Government funding was inversely related to religiosity measures and evangelical influence was negatively related to attitudes toward government.</p>
<p>Difficulties in the funding relationship include legal, expressive, and capacity dilemmas. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0899764013485160">Gibelman (2007)</xref> discussed a range of constitutional, philosophical, and practical issues raised by government contracting with FBOs. In a study of applications for government funding, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0899764013485160">Farnsley (2001)</xref> found that small FBOs had difficulties answering proposal requests and applying for funds because they were often newcomers to the government funding process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0899764013485160">Guellich (2002)</xref> likewise questioned the capacity of small FBOs to manage the government funding process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0899764013485160">Loconte (1999)</xref> voiced concerns about the possibility of voucher programs, with their accompanying government scrutiny and bureaucracy, undermining the mission of religious schools. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0899764013485160">B. M. Lewis (2003)</xref> examined the Salvation Army of Greater Philadelphia and noted issues and dilemmas that FBOs may encounter in service delivery using contracted public funding, particularly in the area of staff upgrading and the development of professional services. In another case study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0899764013485160">Goode (2006)</xref> documented an FBO’s response to the pressures of securing stable funding and recruiting more volunteers. The organization shifted its mission from community empowerment to training, replaced collective interactions with hierarchical ascriptions of differential worth, and increased the cultural-experiential distance between givers and receivers. There are also issues on the government side. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0899764013485160">Rushton (2005)</xref> looked at the problems government may run into in terms of monitoring contracts and ensuring both fairness in the procurement process and quality of service provision. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0899764013485160">Montiel and Wright (2006)</xref> noted the lack of capacity that government may have in identifying the faith-character of grantees and contractors and how this presents obstacles for tracking the award of federal funds to religious groups.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The collective impact of the services provided by tens of thousands of FBOs in the United States, such as the tens of billions of dollars raised annually and millions of clients served, merits pursuit of meaningful scholarly research. Questions remain about what FBOs do, to what extent they may expand provision of social services, and how they relate to government. Given the breadth and complexity of activities engaged in by FBOs, it is difficult to concisely summarize their attributes with any sort of comprehensiveness. FBOs are pervasive in the provision of social services, as part of congregations, as independent organizations, or working in networks collaboratively with government. FBOs have interesting characteristics which differ from comparable secular organizations which justifies a certain degree of attention.</p>
<p>When directly comparing FBOs with comparable secular organizations, the services provided by FBOs were equivalent or superior. Given the number of individual studies conducted, we noted a conspicuous absence of research pointing to markedly inferior performance by FBOs. Some of this may be explained by the fact that FBOs were selective in the services provided and clients gravitate to organizations which meet their religious preferences. As well, there was isomorphic pressure to meet a basic level of service quality among competing service options for clients, donors, and regulators. The existence of a wide spectrum of service providers in regard to religious expression allowed for the possibility of better fit between organizations and their clients. This spectrum of service providers also helped develop social capital. However, as we saw, there were limits to its creation along the lines of socioeconomic status and race.</p>
<p>Charitable Choice furthered a centuries-old debate about the relationship between FBOs and government. The debate in the most recent decades added clarity to the constitutional questions of the separation of church and state, freedom of speech, and hiring flexibility. Some view Charitable Choice and the faith-based initiatives which followed as continuing the trend of devolution of government-provided social welfare services to the private sector initiated during the Reagan administration. Case law defined important arguments and brings some resolution to the most pressing questions. Paramount among these was the concern of government funding of evangelical activities which was something of particular concern with FBOs due to the wide spectrum of inclusion of faith elements in the services provided.</p>
<p>The scope and funding issues raised the legitimate question of whether or not Charitable Choice and subsequent faith-based initiatives to make government funds increasingly available to FBOs have the potential to actually increase the amount of services provided. While the leaders of FBOs expressed interest in the potential of government funding, bureaucratic constraints on administering these funds were realities discouraging the expansion of services. There were measurable impacts on FBOs electing to pursue government funding. In some cases, there was reduction in autonomy, a trend toward secularization, and difficulties with accountability. On the other hand, there was also evidence that government funding facilitated capacity building in some FBOs, especially smaller and younger ones. The stickiest issue proved to be the restrictions on hiring individuals who have, or do not have, a similar spiritual outlook as the FBO. Implementation was complicated by the variety of state-level policies and methods of pursuing faith-based initiatives.</p>
<p>In addition to the policy issues, the implementation of Charitable Choice involved a host of operational factors and associated concerns. Given limitations on their scope and capacity, there were doubts that FBOs could significantly expand the social welfare system. In addition, welfare provision was largely a state matter and the research showed that some states were more proactive than others in supporting the various provisions of Charitable Choice. The resulting patchwork of state support for implementation needs to be studied further before conclusions regarding the outcomes of Charitable Choice policy can be drawn. It is clear, however, that collaboration between FBOs and government are critical to specific program success. This is challenging, because in addition to the usual factors that need to be attended to in collaborations, the special nature of the FBO partner must be taken into account. Accommodations may need to be made by both the government and the FBO and for either party there may be limits to flexibility. Further, unanticipated consequences may arise. For example, while government funding can provide useful resources to an FBO, the infusion of large sums could destabilize it by necessitating more staff, encountering different types of clients, or precipitating questions about its mission.</p>
