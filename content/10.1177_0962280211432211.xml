<abstract>
<p>We review controversies associated with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) stopped early for apparent benefit (truncated RCTs or tRCTs) and present our groups’ perspective. Long-established theory, simulations and recent empirical evidence demonstrate that tRCTs will on average overestimate treatment effects, and this overestimation may be large, particularly when tRCTs have small number of events. Theoretical considerations and simulations demonstrate that on average, meta-analyses of RCTs with appropriate stopping rules will lead to only trivial overestimation of treatment effects. However, tRCTs will disproportionally contribute to meta-analytic estimates when tRCTs occur early in the sequence of trials with few subsequent studies, publication of nontruncated RCTs is delayed, there is publication bias, or tRCTs result in a ‘freezing’ effect in which ‘correcting’ trials are never undertaken. To avoid applying overestimates of effect to clinical decision-making, clinicians should view the results of individual tRCTs with small sample sizes and small number of events with skepticism. Pooled effects from meta-analyses including tRCTs are likely to overestimate effect when there is a substantial difference in effect estimates between the tRCTs and the nontruncated RCTs, and in which the tRCTs have a substantial weight in the meta-analysis despite themselves having a relatively small number of events. Such circumstances call for sensitivity analyses omitting tRCTs.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0962280211432211" sec-type="intro"><title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>Stopping rules for clinical trials were devised to make more rapid decisions about identifying a superior treatment and thus minimizing the number of patients to whom this superior treatment is denied. Clinical decision-making, however, invariably involves trading off the desirable and undesirable consequences of interventions. Frequently, tradeoffs are sufficiently closely balanced that accurate estimates of treatment effects are necessary to ensure decisions accurately reflect patients’ underlying values and preferences. Thus, it matters not only if one treatment is better than another, but also how much better it is.</p>
<p>In this article, we exclusively focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that are stopped early because of apparent benefit. We do not consider RCTs that are stopped on the basis of ‘futility’, when interim results indicate that it is unlikely that results at the scheduled end of the trial will demonstrate a significant effect.</p>
<p>In earlier work, we discussed the issue of overestimation of effects in truncated RCTs (tRCTs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0962280211432211">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0962280211432211">4</xref></sup> Our articles have generated a public debate about the interpretation of tRCTs, primarily with Dr Steven Goodman, in which we have participated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0962280211432211">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0962280211432211">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2005, building on previous theory and simulations that had established that tRCTs overestimate treatment effects, we published a systematic review that summarized the epidemiology and reporting quality of 143 tRCTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0962280211432211">1</xref></sup> We found that the magnitude of the effect size was often implausibly large. Subsequently, we used a framework of seven requirements for determining whether clinical research is ethical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0962280211432211">8</xref></sup> to argue that stopping early creates an ethical problem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0962280211432211">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>We then examined how authors of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that include tRCTs address the potential for overestimation of treatment effects, and determined the weight of the tRCTs on pooled results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0962280211432211">2</xref></sup> We found that most systematic reviews and meta-analyses including tRCTs fail to consider the possible overestimation of effect that may result from early stopping for benefit and recommended safeguards that address this possibility.</p>
<p>In a second systematic review and meta-analysis that compared the treatment effect from tRCTs with that from meta-analyses of RCTs addressing the same question but not stopped early,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0962280211432211">3</xref></sup> we found the pooled ratio of relative risks in tRCTs <italic>versus</italic> matching nontruncated RCTs was 0.71 (95% CI 0.65–0.77), suggesting substantial overestimation of effect. This overestimation could not be explained by differences in methodological quality or by the presence of a statistical stopping rule, but was associated with the total number of outcome events. For this meta-analysis, we used a random effects model and focused primarily on RCTs providing binary data but also included studies that provided results using continuous data by estimating an approximate dichotomous equivalent.</p>
<p>In a series of correspondences on the subject, Goodman gave counter arguments to our perspective. In a commentary Goodman argued that, overall, the average of estimates from trials that use stopping rules differs only minimally from the true value and that demonstrating non-zero effects – rather then providing precise estimates of magnitude of effect – may be satisfactory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0962280211432211">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Goodman further argued that statistical theory definitively establishes that systematic reviews are not biased by including results from tRCTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0962280211432211">7</xref></sup> Regarding our second systematic review comparing tRCTs and RCTs asking the same question, Goodman and colleagues stated that we misinterpreted our data, and suggested that stopped early trials may represent no threat whatever to unbiased estimation in meta-analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0962280211432211">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Following a discussion of this issue on the Cochrane Statistical Methods Group email list, a public airing of views was organized at the October 2010 Cochrane Colloquium. The prior discussions with Dr Goodman that preceded the Cochrane meeting led to the reformulation of our groups’ assessment that we present in this article.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0962280211432211"><title>2 Why might trials stopped early for benefit overestimate treatment effects – a reformulation</title>
<p>In our prior work, we repeatedly referred to the bias associated with stopping RCTs early for efficacy. We now see this as a misleading characterization. As we will describe below, the overestimates that occur in trials stopped early for benefit are largely the result of random error. There is a bias, in addition, a bias that stopping early creates, but it is a relatively minor contributor to the overestimation. There is also potential for bias at the level of the meta-analysis, but this is due to factors other than bias at the level of the individual study.</p>
<p>Our recent systematic review showed that, even in systematic reviews that include tRCTs effect sizes generally tend to be of small to moderate size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0962280211432211">3</xref></sup> If, as our results suggest is usually the case, the true effect size is modest, many studies in which stopping rules are invoked at boundaries above what is expected before the start of the trial will overestimate the true effect.</p>
<p>To understand this overestimation, imagine 1000 identical size studies of the same research question, the results of which will vary due to chance variation between studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0962280211432211">Figure 1</xref>). The tRCT will belong to the group of trials that tend to overestimate because these trials are at the high end of the random distribution of results (and, correspondingly, the non-tRCTs will tend to slightly underestimate). Thus, the overestimation from tRCTs is largely the result of random error. If such studies were to continue to their planned sample sizes, then because of what Pocock has described as ‘regression to the truth’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0962280211432211">10</xref></sup> they would still produce overestimates of effect, but those overestimates would be smaller that those seen with early stopping.
<fig id="fig1-0962280211432211" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Course of trials and its impact on trial results.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0962280211432211-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0962280211432211">Figure 1</xref> suggests, large random differences from the true effect are more likely to happen early in a trial when sample sizes are small.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0962280211432211">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0962280211432211">11</xref></sup> Thus, trials stopped early with extreme stopping boundaries that are set well above what is <italic>a priori</italic> expected will often tend to have estimates much greater than the truth. Furthermore, the smaller the sample size and in particular, the smaller the number of events, the larger an effect estimate needs to be to qualify for standard stopping rules, and thus the larger the overestimation of effect is likely to be.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0962280211432211"><title>3 The risks of relying on the results of individual trials stopped early for benefit: a real world example</title>
<p>In 1999, the <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic> published an unblinded trial of bisoprolol in patients undergoing elective vascular surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0962280211432211">12</xref></sup> After enrolling 112 of a planned 266 patients, observing results that exceeded the O’Brien-Fleming boundary, the investigators stopped the trial. The primary end point of death or non-fatal myocardial infarction had occurred in 3.4% of bisoprolol patients and in 34% of placebo patients (relative risk [RR] 0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02–0.37).</p>
<p>Subsequently, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association strongly issued recommendations advocating the use of perioperative beta-blockers in very high-risk patients undergoing vascular surgery and in lower risk patients undergoing other non-cardiac surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0962280211432211">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0962280211432211">14</xref></sup> The use of beta-blockers <italic>prior</italic> to cardiac surgery was widely adopted, and became a criterion for quality of care in many American hospitals.</p>
<p>Skeptical of the results of the tRCT, an international group of investigators launched a very large RCT – perioperative ischemic evaluation (POISE) study – addressing the same question.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0962280211432211">15</xref></sup> The investigators initially encountered resistance from clinicians illustrated by a comment from the head of one of the contributing hospitals: ‘When it [the POISE trial] started 6 or 7 years ago, the cardiologists were using beta-blockers liberally and haphazardly. It was a huge challenge to convince them that conducting the trial was justifiable – that the case for perioperative beta-blockers had not been absolutely and overwhelmingly proved’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0962280211432211">16</xref></sup> With 8351 patients, POISE estimated a far smaller treatment effect for the primary endpoint with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.84 (95% CI 0.70–0.99; <italic>p</italic> = 0.04). Furthermore, the positive effect was restricted to myocardial infarction HR 0.73 (95% CI 0.6–0.89; <italic>p</italic> = 0.002), still much less than seen in the Polderman’s trial; the results suggested an increase in stroke and all-cause mortality with beta-blockers.</p>
<p>A meta-analysis of more than 12 000 patients, including both the tRCT and the POISE trial, failed to demonstrate an effect on all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.2, 95% CI 0.95–1.51) but beta-blockers were associated with a decrease (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.54–0.79) in non-fatal myocardial infarction at the expense of an increase (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.27–3.68) in non-fatal strokes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0962280211432211">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>This story epitomizes the dangers we have suggested in our writings regarding trials stopped early for benefit. Such trials will often overestimate treatment effects, and when sample sizes and number of events are small, such overestimation is likely to be very large. Because many find their large effects compelling, such trials are very often published in the most prominent journals, and thus gain wide dissemination and high levels of attention. Uncritical acceptance of findings may lead to premature changes in practice, and development of guidelines based on the large overestimates from the tRCT. The premature stopping can result in adverse effects of treatment (in this case, stroke) never being discovered. The results, and the guidelines, may then lead to a freezing or stifling effect on further research.</p>
<p>These warnings apply, to a considerable extent, to any trial with a very large effect coming from small number of patients, and small number of events. Such trials, like tRCTs, are very likely to be at the upper level of the distribution of the family of trials addressing a particular question (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0962280211432211">Figure 1</xref>). Stopping early adds an additional small bias, but if our warnings are heeded, may provide a red flag for overestimates. Any small trial with large effects, stopped early or not, should be greeted with substantial skepticism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0962280211432211"><title>4 Trials stopped early for benefit in the context of systematic reviews</title>
<sec id="sec5-0962280211432211"><title>4.1. Theory and simulations</title>
<p>The arguments we have presented strongly suggest a cautious approach to the results of individual tRCTs. Systematic reviews, however, provide the potential for solving the problem associated with tRCTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0962280211432211">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0962280211432211">21</xref></sup> Results from simulations have established that if one follows suggested stopping rules and runs a large series of hypothetical trials to their conclusion, the overestimation caused by truncation will be minimal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0962280211432211">5</xref></sup> If true effects are large, overestimation in tRCTs (which will be more frequent under this condition) will be relatively small. If the true effect is small, the tRCTs will be infrequent and have fewer events and thus they will have little weight in the meta-analyses. Thus, meta-analyses of a reasonably large number of RCTs with appropriate stopping rules should solve the problem of potential overestimation caused by early stopping.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0962280211432211">7</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0962280211432211"><title>5 Why might systematic reviews and meta-analyses including tRCTs overestimate treatment effects?</title>
<p>The assumptions underlying simulations, suggesting that tRCTs do not bias the results of systematic reviews include no differences in time to publication, no impact of tRCTs on the conduct of subsequent trials and use of appropriate stopping rules. In case of applying inappropriate stopping rules, the results of tRCTs may, however, be biased. Although the CONSORT statement recommends the reporting of whether and what kind of stopping rule was applied, whether the trial was stopped early and if so, for what reason,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0962280211432211">22</xref></sup> we know from empirical evidence that the reporting of trial stopping characteristics is often unsatisfactory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0962280211432211">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0962280211432211">3</xref></sup> Thus, early stopping may have been arbitrary, the result of multiple interim data analyses without stopping rules, or the result of unconventional stopping strategies (e.g. analyzing the results after every five events and stopping when the <italic>p</italic>-value crosses a target <italic>p</italic>-value<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0962280211432211">23</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>Putting aside the issue of inappropriate stopping rules, simulations depend on a sufficient number of trials conducted that estimates become asymptotic and thus accurately reflect the true effect size. In practice, however, when tRCTs occur early in a sequence of trials, systematic reviews may often not achieve a sample size sufficient to compensate for the extreme result of a tRCT. Furthermore, even if a substantial number of RCTs have been conducted (sufficient to minimize the impact of any overestimation from the tRCTs), tRCTs that being siumultaneously with other trials may be published earlier several years than RCTs with less positive or non-significant results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0962280211432211">24</xref></sup> The result from either of these conditions (correcting RCTs not yet conducted, or conducted but not yet published) is that an early meta-analysis will overestimate treatment effects. More worrisome yet, if publication bias occurs, the correcting RCTs, while conducted, may never be published.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps of most concern, the tRCTs may have problematic impacts on subsequent trials. If the academic community accepts the effect estimate from the tRCTs (often an overestimation) and uses this estimate in planning their sample size, they are likely to err in choosing a smaller sample size than a more realistic estimate of the effect would dictate. Much more serious, the tRCTs may create a ‘freezing’ or ‘stifling’ effect that impedes the conduct of future trials. This will occur if the clinical community accepts the rationale for early termination – that it is no longer ethical to not offer patients the experimental treatment (which it rightly should if the decision on early termination was well justified) – and is uncomfortable with the initiation of new trials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0962280211432211"><title>6 The empirical view: Are concerns about meta-analyses including tRCTs justified?</title>
<p>In our systematic review of 91 tRCTs asking 63 different questions and 424 matching nontruncated RCTs, the pooled ratio of RRs in tRCTs <italic>versus</italic> nontruncated RCTs was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.65–0.77). Given this result, one would expect on average that if the RR from the nontruncated RCTs was 0.8 (a modest 20% RR reduction), the RR from the tRCTs would be approximately 0.57 (a 43% RR reduction). In nearly two-thirds of comparisons, the pooled estimate for nontruncated RCTs failed to show a statistically significant effect, suggesting that a true treatment effect may not exist.</p>
<p>Consider the results that we would have seen in our systematic review if the true underlying effect in the meta-analyses had been large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0962280211432211">Figure 2</xref>). Under these circumstances, there may have been a number of tRCTs, their weight in the meta-analyses might have been substantial, and the differences between the tRCTs and nontruncated RCTs would have been relatively small. Indeed, we found a strikingly large weight of the tRCTs in the pooled estimated: the median weight of the tRCTs was 28% (interquartile range 12% to 40%). Furthermore, in more than half of the 43 meta-analyses including tRCTs with less than 100 events (and thus prone to substantial overestimation of the treatment effect), the weight of the tRCTs was more than 20%.
<fig id="fig2-0962280211432211" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Expected results if true large effect.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0962280211432211-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The second result we would have expected under the circumstances that the effect size would be large and the difference between the tRCTs and the nontruncated RCTs would be small is not consistent with the data. Of the 63 pooled estimates from the nontruncated RCTs, 40 showed RRs between 0.75 and 1.0 and 5 greater than 1.0. Furthermore, the ratio of RRs of the tRCTs and the nontruncated RCTs, 0.71, was substantial. Thus, results are inconsistent with what simulations would predict if effect sizes underlying the meta-analyses were large.</p>
<p>What would we have expected from our systematic review if the true underlying effects were modest? Under these circumstances, one would expect a large difference between the tRCT (which, particularly with small sample sizes, require a large effect to cross the stopping threshold) and the nontruncated RCTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0962280211432211">Figure 3</xref>). This large difference is consistent with the data. One would also expect, however, that the tRCTs would have a low weight in the meta-analyses. This, as we have noted in the previous paragraph, was not the case.
<fig id="fig3-0962280211432211" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Expected results if true small effect.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0962280211432211-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>What result would emerge if the situations we have postulated (tRCTs occur early in the sequence of possible RCTs with only a few subsequent studies, are published earlier than nontruncated RCTs, the meta-analyses suffer from publication bias or the tRCTs had exerted a freezing or stifling effect on RCTs that might have been conducted in the future)? Under these circumstances, one would see modest treatment effects in the nontruncated RCTs, a large difference in effect between the tRCTs and nontruncated RCTs, a modest number of nontruncated RCTs in most meta-analyses and a substantial weight of the tRCTs in many of the analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0962280211432211">Figure 4</xref>). These are the results we observed. This suggests that, at least some of the time, the factors that result in misleading overestimates of effect in meta-analyses including tRCTs may be at play.

<sec id="sec8-0962280211432211"><title>7 Implications</title>
<p>Our findings and interpretations have implications on two levels, for individual trials and for meta-analyses.</p>
<p>Because most treatment effects are modest, tRCTs, viewed in isolation, will on average overestimate treatment effects. The overestimation will tend to be particularly large when there is only a small number of events, say &lt;200, in the tRCTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0962280211432211">3</xref></sup> As a consequence, clinicians, policy makers and methodologists should not rely on the results of individual small tRCTs for effect estimates.</p>
<p>When considering tRCTs in the context of meta-analyses, one must bear in mind that – although theoretically meta-analyses should serve to correct overestimates from individual tRCTs – the pooled results of currently available trials may nevertheless tend to overestimate. In our view, the danger of overestimation will be particularly high when all the following three conditions exist:
<list id="list1-0962280211432211" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>tRCTs have a relatively small number of events (e.g. &lt;200)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>there is a substantial difference (e.g. a ratio of RR &lt; 0.7) in the RRs between the tRCTs and the nontruncated RCTs;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the tRCTs have a substantial (&gt;20%) weight in the meta-analysis.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>When these conditions exist, systematic reviews should offer sensitivity analyses with and without inclusion of tRCTs.</p>
<p>When the three conditions do not exist, and RCTs have instituted safeguards against bias, and yield precise estimates that are consistent across trials,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0962280211432211">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0962280211432211">26</xref></sup> authors of systematic reviews and meta-analyses can, regardless of the presence of tRCTs, have a high level of confidence in the results.</p>
<p>Alternatively, and perhaps preferably, authors of all reviews should adopt approaches (e.g. Bayesian) that would shrink estimates from all systematic reviews, in which surprisingly large effects occur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0962280211432211">5</xref></sup> Our systematic review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0962280211432211">3</xref></sup> suggests that even in meta-analyses in which tRCTs are present (which will typically yield larger estimates of effect than meta-analyses in which tRCTs are not present), effect sizes tend to be modest.</p>
