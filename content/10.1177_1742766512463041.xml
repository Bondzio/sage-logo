<p>Ten years after the publishing of <italic>De-Westernizing Media Studies</italic>, edited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742766512463041">James Curran and Myung-Jin Park (2000)</xref>, <italic>De-Westernizing Communication Research</italic> represents another conscious intellectual endeavour to move beyond ‘Westerncentrism’ in media and communication studies. The book aims to explore more culturally and geographically specific frameworks, both theoretically and methodologically. If <italic>De-Westernizing Media Studies</italic> focused mainly on case studies of individual countries’ media systems, then <italic>De-Westernizing Communication Research</italic> can be considered a deliberate and purposeful intellectual inquiry for alternative theoretical bases and methods beyond dominant Western communication research models.</p>
<p>As the editor, Georgette Wang, claims, the book tries to answer two big questions: ‘first, is it necessary to de-Westernize, and second, is it possible to do so?’ (p.3). Wang explicitly declares that ‘the purpose of going beyond Eurocentrism’ is not to deny or reject Western models, but to enrich. For this purpose, the book intends to invite debate and conversation and to share and challenge.</p>
<p>The book is structured around the abovementioned two major research questions. It consists of four parts. Part A tackles mainly the philosophical and theoretical bases on which Western communication research models are built. Parts B and C deal primarily with the ‘how-to’ issue by proposing solutions to the problem of Eurocentrism while trying to avoid dichotomous conceptualizations. Finally, Part D discusses opportunities, limitations and implications for future communication research.</p>
<p>In Part A, four renowned scholars analyse Eurocentrism in communication research from the humanistic perspectives of Western philosophy and culture. Molefi Kete Asante examines the myths of Westernity, individualism and the Western mastery attitude towards nature, and warns about the dangers of non-Western researchers applying Western ideas to their own cultures. Shelton Gunaratne discusses how the fundamental East–West philosophical divide has contributed to global divides, and argues for a more complex structure of universalism. Marwan Kraidy calls for communication researchers to replace the ‘the global-local dyad with a translocal vision’ (p.51) and advocates a ‘multiple-modernities’ (p.54) perspective. Georgette Wang traces the historical context of Occidentalism and Orientalism and champions a ‘Cultural Reconnaissance Movement’ (p.72) for researchers in the periphery.</p>
<p>In Parts B and C, eight scholars take a further step to suggest ways to do culturally specific communication research and to avoid dichotomous pitfalls of thinking. Among them, Paul Lee’s article stands out as a rigorous communication-centred study. He unpacks the word, ‘de-Westernization’, by analysing two prevailing paradigms in communication research: positivist and interpretive. Lee delineates the historical trajectory of the dominant positivist paradigm in the West and provides a thorough examination of communication studies in Chinese societies. Comparing the Chinese Confucian philosophy and the Western positivist paradigm, Lee believes it is desirable for Chinese societies to de-emphasize the research models dominated by the positivist paradigm and to revisit the Confucian approach to produce more locally relevant studies. However, Lee argues, ‘there is no need for a total and all-inclusive effort to de-Westernize communication research in Chinese societies’ (p.89), as an open-minded attitude would be more beneficial.</p>
<p>Another renowned scholar, Graham Murdock, maps out Asia’s encounter with Western capitalism from the Qing Dynasty to the socialist market reform of the People’s Republic of China, from a historical perspective. He contends that the capitalist modernity based on the volatile economic system is in crisis and suggests that the issue of de-Westernization in the Asian context is fundamentally related to the issue of Asian modernities. Eddie Kuo and Han Chew then remind us of the pitfalls of the ethnocentric paradigm and propose a culture-centric approach. However, the quest for culture- specific approaches does not equate with dichotomizing cultures, as David Morley and Guo-Ming Chen point out in their articles. To make a clear division between the West and the rest of the world in terms of culture poses conceptual problems ontologically, epistemologically and methodologically.</p>
<p>In the final section of the book, four scholars each suggest paths towards de-Westernizing and indigenizing communication research. For example, Wimal Dissanayake discusses two types of theory central to the creation of Asian communication theories. The key to future research would be dialogue between those theories that deal with traditional Asian thoughts and those that engage with Western thoughts. Another chapter by Wang distinguishes three types of incommensurability in transcultural settings: cultural incommensurability, conceptual incommensurability and institutional incommensurability. The first step in going beyond Eurocentrism is to search for concepts and theories in local cultural discourses to build commensurability, while the ultimate goal is to establish commensurate universality.</p>
<p>This path-breaking and engaging book demonstrates the tremendous effort of non-Western scholars to seek alternatives to Western models. Some would argue that communication research is inherently Western from its birth, as reflected in the field’s close association with the three major trends of industrialization, urbanization and modernization. Therefore, it is a formidable task to de-Westernize communication research in a disciplinary sense. To search for ‘home-grown’ communication theories is also difficult. Asian societies are abundant in philosophy, history and literature, whereas the concept of communication in the disciplinary sense seems foreign. However, the elements of human communication appear to be evident in Asian culture. The book is based on a special issue of the <italic>Asian Journal of Communication</italic>, but its contributors have made a serious attempt to avoid the dichotomous divide between Eurocentrism and Asia-centrism. The book symbolizes the genuine desire of Asian scholars to initiate a paradigm shift, and will no doubt impact the future direction of communication studies in many significant ways.</p>
