<abstract>
<p>This article is based on research with men who have embraced the new technological opportunities offered by the internet to sell counterfeit products and engage in forms of intellectual property crime, specifically trading counterfeit items through internet websites. It examines case studies and qualitative material generated through interviews with professional criminal entrepreneurs who have made use of the web-site ‘eBay’ in order to distribute goods while minimizing the risk of detection and prosecution. This empirical material, it suggests, provides some initial evidence of how more traditional forms of working class male enterprise crime are now being mutated and superseded, and are shifting in light of the opportunities provided by new technology, moving from traditional local marketplaces to new online settings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article uses empirical material gathered from interviews with professional intellectual property offenders involved in the distribution of counterfeit products. It uses this empirical material to make some more general observations about how these more routine and mundane forms of organized crime are changing in light of new technological advances impact on criminal cultures and associated enterprises. Specifically, it considers the way in which intellectual property crime, and the distribution of counterfeit products is being transformed by new technological opportunities afforded by the internet. This form of computer assisted cybercrime has been little documented in discussions, but the shifts now being witnessed in this form of illicit trading may highlight wider changes in the criminal marketplace and criminal enterprise.</p>
<p>One of the most perplexing aspects of contemporary empirical criminology is that it seems to have been so slow to engage with crime committed ‘online’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748895811428173">Jewkes, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895811428173">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895811428173">Yar, 2006</xref>). While the criminological community are now countering that slowly, with studies charting a range of online criminality incorporating topics as diverse as cyber-stalking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748895811428173">Wykes, 2007</xref>) and web-based ‘football hooliganism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748895811428173">Fafinsky, 2007</xref>) through to the trade in counterfeit automotive components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1748895811428173">Yar, 2005</xref>), more routine and mundane forms of cybercrime arguably have received far less attention.</p>
<p>Criminologists, it seems, are still struggling to incorporate the online world into traditional ways of thinking and theorizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748895811428173">Jewkes and Yar, 2009</xref>). Perhaps in part this occurs because the term ‘cybercrime’ is one which conjures images of sophisticates, pirates and property thieves (of the intellectual type) who hide away behind their screens and firewalls protected from research scrutiny. The dominant representation of cybercrime arguably portrays it as a highly sophisticated activity that the technologically unsophisticated and uninitiated find difficult to grasp (for an overview see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895811428173">Yar, 2006</xref>). In many cases cybercrime (or at least the representation of it), has become synonymous with the idea that the typical perpetrators are a ‘new breed of criminals whose ill gotten toolkit consists of Central Processing Units, modulator demodulators, war diallers, viruses, and warez’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748895811428173">Corriea and Bowling, 1999</xref>: 225).</p>
<p>Using the internet it might be possible to, ‘buy a bride, cruise gay bars, go on a global shopping spree with someone else’s credit card, break into a bank’s security system, plan a demonstration in another country and hack into the pentagon all on the same day’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748895811428173">Jewkes and Sharp, 2003</xref>: 2). Yet contrary to popular representation and belief, much cybercrime might actuality be much more mundane and routine than it is sophisticated, innovative and new. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748895811428173">Wall (2001)</xref> has observed, when so-called cases of cybercrime come to court, they often have the familiar ring of the traditional to them. Similarly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748895811428173">Grabosky (2001)</xref> has argued that cybercrime (with some notable exceptions such as hacking and the planting of viruses) should often be understood as a continuance and metamorphosis of existing criminal practices, a case of old wine, new bottles as it were.</p>
<p>This article is framed by the idea that viewing intellectual property crime and the selling of counterfeits as a form of cybercrime (albeit a less sophisticated form of professional offending) might open up a new and interesting area for study, that can also shed light upon more general changes in the nature of professional criminal conduct generally. The article is concerned with individuals involved in low tech, routine forms of intellectual property driven cybercrime that are part of ‘everyday life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748895811428173">Felson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895811428173">Presdee, 2005</xref>). The research on which the article is based stems from the recognition that there was something happening in the criminal landscape that was not being written about. Other ethnographic projects on professional criminal practices had led the author to believe that computers were now being employed by some career criminals to commit quite old-fashioned and familiar offences, and that the criminological community could no longer seek to understand offences such as fraud, or for that matter criminal identities, without grasping the place and role of the ‘third space’. The central observation of this study, then, is that testimony from active, career offenders provides evidence that new technology and new lucrative criminal ventures have caused a mutation and change in the traditional criminal marketplaces, and that now, to grasp adequately current criminal practices, criminologists must engage with the third space.</p>
<p>Traditionally a number of criminological works attest to the fact that much criminal conduct is essentially a form of working class entrepreneurialism that involves an array of criminal practices, for example the selling of counterfeit and stolen property (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811428173">Hobbs, 1988</xref>). Yet it seems that this culture has been transformed in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895811428173">Hall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895811428173">Winlow, 2001</xref>) as the market in illicit drugs and duty free products has come to provide a more lucrative and rewarding form of criminal venture (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895811428173">Hall et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet that is now potentially being transformed in light of socio-economic cultural shifts. For example, Shover and colleagues (2003) have suggested that phone line telemarketing frauds have been created by both technological advances, and socio- economic and cultural transformations. New criminal ventures may well be linked to the emergence and prevalence of access to the internet. As both the cyber security strategy of the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748895811428173">Cabinet Office, 2009</xref>) and the UK’s intellectual property (IP) crime strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895811428173">Patent Office, 2004</xref>) recognize, cybercrime and counterfeiting are part of an array of criminal ventures which form part of the more general pattern and profile of the diverse activities that constitute organized crime.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1748895811428173">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both cybercrime and counterfeiting provide excellent opportunities for the enterprising offender. It is estimated that 7 per cent of all world trade is in counterfeit goods, with a total annual value of over £250 billion; counterfeiting is a crime that has grown alongside globalization as the proliferation of technology and more porous borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895811428173">Patent Office, 2004</xref>). In addition it has been stated that online fraud generated £52 billion worldwide in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748895811428173">Cabinet Office, 2009</xref>). The commonly held perception of both types of offending suggest that it is controlled by organized criminal syndicates, yet clearly such crime likely runs a continuum from the macro level of the sophisticated counterfeiting cartel through to the micro level of neighbourhood and localized criminal actors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748895811428173">Ruggiero, 2000</xref>). However, accounts of ‘cybercrime’ and counterfeiting crime rarely intersect with this more common and micro form of professional criminal enterprise, and instead empirical works (though quite rare) tend to focus on serious online criminality, such as complex online frauds used to secure victims’ bank account details (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895811428173">Glenny, 2008</xref>), or more organized forms of intellectual property offences such as the trades in safety critical counterfeits such as automotive components and pharmaceuticals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1748895811428173">Yar, 2005</xref>). Few accounts have examined how these global influences impact upon professional intellectual property crime and counterfeiting at the macro level in globally localized or ‘glocalized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748895811428173">Hobbs, 1998</xref>) places.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1748895811428173" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The research that informs this article commenced as an attempt to investigate everyday forms of intellectual property crime and the link with online trading. It involved the author undertaking a number of unstructured interviews lasting between an hour and half a day with a range of individuals who had embraced the new possibilities offered by the internet to conduct illicit enterprises, and specifically to sell counterfeit products.</p>
<p>It may be worth addressing the terminology which I have used to describe the merchandise being sold in this piece. All those documented here were involved in the sale of counterfeit products, that is to say all were involved in forms of intellectual property crime (IPC), involving commercial products which infringe on trademarks, essentially for the most part, digital products such as software and games, fashion wear (particularly luxury clothing and footwear) rather than higher end products such as pharmaceuticals, automotive components and electrical items and other manufactured goods. For professional criminals, IPC is attractive because it offers a large financial return from, typically, a low starting investment, while the risk of detection is comparatively low, and certainly lower than trading in narcotics. However, these terms do not adequately capture the fluidity or dynamism of the forms of entrepreneurial online trading below. Therefore while for the most part I describe the crimes committed by the individuals documented here as intellectual property crime and selling counterfeits, this perhaps does not reflect the way that the merchandise sold by them also runs a continuum between legally acquired items through to illicit products. However, because all the participants were regularly and routinely involved in intellectual property crime and the selling of counterfeit products, and this activity unifies each of them as a collective, I have prioritized these as a focal concern. Nevertheless, in places, a lack of consistency in the descriptions and nature of the merchandise being referred to and sold simply reflects the messy realities of the business that individuals were involved in where legitimate and illegitimate ventures often overlapped, and where the online trading (including trading in counterfeits) is driven more by instrumental concerns than confined to narrow, convenient categories. Those documented here were well versed in internet trading, and worried little about the legality or otherwise of the products they distributed, rather they were willing to trade in anything where a healthy profit margin could be made as, in the words of one interviewee their trading was ‘all about the profit’.</p>
<p>The subjects were gathered from a range of different contacts, most particularly using a gatekeeper (who was himself part of the sample) familiar with illicit internet trading and who arranged access to other contacts. Those interviewed (10 in total) were all involved in the sale of counterfeit property online (for the most part fashion items) and almost exclusively relied on the auction website eBay in order to facilitate their trading. The trading encountered was as diverse, ranging from selling illicit items such as sex toys stolen by shoplifters from ‘adult store’ Anne Summers, to deceptions such as the sale of non-existent mobile phones, games consoles and laptops as part of what has been described as ‘short-firm’ frauds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895811428173">Wall, 2007</xref>). Yet, all the individuals who participated were primarily involved in intellectual property crime and the sale of counterfeit fashion products online. The discussion is therefore restricted to the online sale of counterfeit products as it seemed that, even given the limited sample size, this is the most prevalent and widespread form of illicit online trading.</p>
<p>The sample of 10 individuals in all is relatively small, and reflects the methods employed to recruit participants. As a number of criminologists have suggested, it is not easy to recruit undetected offenders who likely have little to gain in sharing their insights (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895811428173">Hobbs, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748895811428173">McGuire, 2000</xref>). For the most part, the interviewees were recruited by snowball sampling, with respondents recommended by an acquaintance the researcher had met during a previous research project who was heavily involved in illicit forms of online trading.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1748895811428173">2</xref></sup> Most participants were only interviewed once, but several were interviewed on more than one occasion. From the outset the researcher gave some assurances of anonymity and agreed to change some details so as to make subjects less easily identified. The interviewees were also given the choice of whether interviews were tape recorded, and if they did not consent to recording, the interviewer made contemporaneous notes in a manner not dissimilar to that described recently by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895811428173">Hall and colleagues (2008)</xref>. The majority of the material presented here is transcribed by the author from tape recorded interviews.</p>
<p>The interviews were conducted in both public and private settings (some in quiet pubs, some in the individuals’ homes and one in a university office) and for the most part those involved in interviews were willing to speak openly about their involvement in illicit trading. The research project was conducted in and in a manner in keeping with traditional ethnographic qualitative criminology on criminal enterprise (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811428173">Foster, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811428173">Hobbs, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895811428173">Winlow, 2001</xref>). After the interviews, the subjects were given the opportunity to review any notes or transcribed quotes that were to be used when interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim. In addition, at the conclusion of the interviews the researcher returned home or to the work office and immediately wrote up a more detailed set of notes concerning the interview, more in keeping with reflexive accounts produced as part of ethnographic fieldwork (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895811428173">Hall et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Interviews focused on participants’ trading history, use of the internet and prior offending and previous criminal history and ventures. The researcher used a standard set of questions at the end of interviews concerning levels of income, length of time trading, yet often these were covered in the course of interviews. The focus of this article was in part developed by a process of grounded theorizing drawing upon recurrent themes encountered in interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748895811428173">Glaser and Strauss, 1967</xref>). Due to the restrictions of space, case study material that focuses on the criminal trading careers of two individuals Des and Mike<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1748895811428173">3</xref></sup> is used extensively. While this may make the data look a little skewed, dominance of relevant data by a small number of participants can be quite common in social sciences, with criminology increasingly recognizing the value of small scale case studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748895811428173">Gadd, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748895811428173">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The decision to focus primarily on these two case studies was made because it allowed for more extensive excavation of these individuals’ criminal biographies. However, the two key participants selected are not atypical, and many of the other people interviewed had antecedent history of entrepreneurial and instrumental offending similar to or comparable with the cases presented. Less extensive quotes gained from other participants are also included within the article. Therefore while the findings are by no means generalizable, I hope that what follows presents a useful provisional picture of the backgrounds, motivations and observations of those involved in intellectual property crime and counterfeit trading online, and allows some general discussion about how and why new criminal marketplaces may be replacing older, established criminal trading sites.</p>

<title>Doing Business Online – the Everyday Realities of Counterfeit Crime Online</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘Intellectual Property’ (IP) crime is not a new phenomenon but due to globalisation and advances in technology counterfeiting and piracy has become big business. The criminals involved are often well organised as a result of other endeavours and are set up to sell the counterfeited or pirated items for vast profits. However, public perception has not developed as quickly and the common view is that counterfeiting and piracy causes little harm. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895811428173">Patent Office, 2004</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Before moving on to a discussion of the way in which intellectual property crime, and specifically counterfeiting as it is commonly practised in the contemporary English criminal marketplace, it is necessary to clarify some of the terminology used. The men documented in this piece (for all those interviewed were male) were all involved in what is termed intellectual property crime, or counterfeiting and piracy as it is more commonly known. However, those interviewed here were often involved interchangeably in both selling counterfeit and pirated products (counterfeits are products that wilfully infringe trademarks, such as designer clothes and expensive jewellery; whereas piracy involves wilful copyright infringement, for example, making unauthorized reproductions of computer software or recorded music – see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895811428173">Patent Office, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Few of those interviewed for this article were actively involved in <italic>production</italic> of counterfeit products (when they were, their involvement was fairly rudimentary and unsophisticated piracy, such as illegally copying pornographic DVDs). Most were distributors who were able to source often large amounts of counterfeit products in both pirate and counterfeit goods through local networks. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811428173">Large (2009</xref>: 9) has noted for the most part, the types of illicit product they were selling ‘has to be considered separately from other types of “safety critical” counterfeits’ in that the nature of harm, and obvious criminality of such activity (with the exemption of the harm to legitimate brands) is less apparent than in some other forms of intellectual property offending, for example pharmaceuticals or automotive parts (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1748895811428173">Yar, 2005</xref>). To regard the participants of this study as being involved in ‘organized crime’, or in activities with a direct and obvious link to other high end forms of economic crime (or even terrorism) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895811428173">ACG, 2007</xref>) is undoubtedly problematic. They were not retailers of products that were necessarily or immediately obvious in being ‘devastating to both consumers and legitimate enterprises’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811428173">Large, 2009</xref>: 4). That is not to say that many were not involved in much more general and everyday forms of criminality, some of which was much more traditional. The role of trading on the internet was often only one form of crime that they were willing to admit, and it was frequently combined with selling stolen products, evasion of tax, false claiming of welfare benefits, small scale drug dealing and a range of peripheral, though quite obviously illegal activities which accompanied their selling counterfeits. This may be taken to suggest that while many consumers ‘do not see counterfeiting as a “real” crime’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811428173">Large, 2009</xref>: 14) the inherent logic to policing and investigation of intellectual property crime as organized and professional crime is that it yields rich rewards and intersects with a range of other criminal activities in which actors may be involved. However, the links between their criminality and more traditional serious organized crime were not as self-evidently apparent as some sources suggest (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895811428173">ACG, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Des is typical of the type of individual who is often involved in trading in counterfeits. He is also typical of the type of urban entrepreneur traditionally encountered by criminologists concerned with working class enterprise crime (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811428173">Foster, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811428173">Hobbs, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895811428173">1995</xref>). Resolutely ‘working class’ in terms of his self-identity, he has cultivated a particular appearance that conveys some degree of menace. His physical size, closely shaven head and the array of tattoos on his hands and forearms, are combined with expensive designer clothing. Des would never wear fake designer items and somewhat ironically regards anyone who would with absolute contempt. His attire, offset by an array of heavy gold jewellery, gives him an aesthetic that follows many of the codes and conventions found in the local criminal subcultures in which he moves (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895811428173">Hall et al., 2008</xref>). Now in his 40s, he has previously held a range of jobs, though none of them for very long because he ‘hates working for other people’. The employment he has had previously was ‘piss poor paid and hard work’, and for that reason Des has been involved in instrumental criminality for most of his life with varying degrees of success (his failures have resulted in a number of periods of imprisonment). Recently he has reached the pinnacle of his criminal career and now operates independently, making a good profit from his ventures which include his primary source of income, selling both stolen and counterfeit property on the auction website eBay.</p>
<p>Des lists counterfeit items (mostly fashion apparel) alongside items that he buys legitimately in shops and then sells for a greater price. He works short hours and makes ‘good money’. In particular he has long been selling counterfeit merchandise (in the past at boot sales and on markets), but now he uses eBay trading as his sole source of income. He suggests that eBay trading nets him ‘easily over a grand [£1000] a month on a good month’, and during some particularly lucrative periods ‘it can be as much as that a week’ (though he notes that this is becoming more difficult because eBay has recently taken a more proactive stance against counterfeits). While his activities range from semi-legitimate to illegal, he is criminal in the sense that he avoids paying tax on the substantial revenue that he makes and continues to claim state welfare benefits while failing to declare that he is making amounts of money that would undoubtedly make him ineligible. His products are ‘good quality snide’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1748895811428173">4</xref></sup> Largely counterfeit fashion apparel imitating exclusive designer brands:</p>

<p>You can buy t-shirts for a couple of quid, then make 9.99 each of them, then there is postage on top which you put up a bit. Now I have done loads of gear like Stone Island, Armani, Paul &amp; Shark, that kind of stuff in the past, some of it really obvious knock off. People that are really into the gear are more likely to spot snides, and some of the stuff [the counterfeits on the site previously] was utterly shit, to be honest. Now I do a lot of trade on fake handbags, they can be quite fucking good quality copies some of them, you know, I’d let our missus walk around with some of the better ones of them I’ve seen, I tell you. But people are stupid though, it’s like well seriously does anyone think that they will get a grand [£1000] handbag on eBay for a ton [£100]. To be fair the only way you would is if it is fucking snide or it’s nicked. I mean, fucking hell, it isn’t rocket science is it? (Des: transcribed by author from taped interview)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Des would seem to believe that the take-up on his products is in part due to his ability to manipulate buyers. Des runs a relatively sophisticated operation in selling counterfeit products, something with which he has long been involved. Previous illegal enterprises he has been involved in have included bringing back unpaid duty alcohol and tobacco (with the products illegally sold in local pubs and clubs without paying tax (for a more general discussion of this type of illicit venture, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748895811428173">Hornsby and Hobbs, 2007</xref>), or trading counterfeit products at car boot sales and markets. He also has an extensive antecedent history, including a range of acquisitive property crimes for which he has been incarcerated on a number of occasions. Des has been involved in crime for most of his life and is known in his area’s criminal circles, but is now using his skills to re-invent himself as an internet trader, even if the commodities he trades are not legal or permitted by the sites he uses. However, he is resourceful and manages to bypass many of the attempts by websites to prevent the sale of counterfeits:</p>

It makes it look even more real, fucking sneaky eh, and then I’ll use that to sell fakes and they [eBay] don’t delete your listings. (Des: transcribed by author from tape recorded interview)</p>

<p>Mike looks less menacing than Des. He is fairly slight in terms of build, and while he likes designer fashions, he does not seem to attempt to cultivate the same proto-criminal image as Des. He is in his late 20s and holds reasonably well-paid jobs with some managerial responsibility. While arguably the internet might have ‘democratized’ the opportunity to make money through counterfeit trading online, it seems that many of the traders that I encountered were of backgrounds and experiences not dissimilar to those traditionally identified by criminologists concerned principally with criminal trading practices, in that they were largely young, male and of working class backgrounds (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811428173">Foster, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895811428173">Hall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811428173">Hobbs, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895811428173">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895811428173">Winlow, 2001</xref>). In this respect, Mike is no exception.</p>
<p>Mike’s employment requires some knowledge of information systems and information technology. He is well versed in the use of computers and has been trading on online auction sites for a number of years. When Mike was younger he sold in the traditional marketplace ‘making pocket money flogging [Playstation] games in pubs and clubs and that’. For the most part, though, it involved selling counterfeit software and DVDs online, although this has not been his only involvement in web-based trading. He has very occasionally listed stolen products for friends from the estate on which he lives. A number of his mates who work in warehouses and shops have the opportunity to ‘make some things disappear’ but lack the knowledge or means to list products themselves. Unlike Des, Mike has never been to prison, and his only real contact with the police has been for driving offences.</p>
<p>At the time of the interview Mike was selling counterfeit silver jewellery (copied products of exclusive brands such as Tiffany, and Vivienne Westwood) and counterfeit designer clothing (mostly trainers that copied high end exclusive brands such as Prada and Y3). However, he is now ‘moving away from the game’, having become more fearful of consequences, especially after ‘some lads from off the estate [where he lives] have been lifted for snide’. In other words, his knowledge of a prosecution pending for acquaintances who were illegally selling pirate copied DVDs on eBay has led him to reconsider the risks involved in trading in counterfeit products. However, in the past he has been involved extensively, and his experience of selling counterfeits and knowledge of markets is clearly well developed, and demonstrates that retail offenders, at least in some cases, have global links:</p>

<p>DVDs can tend to come from China, but mostly from Thailand, and it isn’t all this filmed from the back of a cinema on a camcorder bollocks, it’s fucking good quality a lot of it. Scene selection, multi-regional, good sound quality, good picture. Sometimes it’s studio pre-edits, sometimes it’s copies for review. The trade is done through ex-pats who export stuff, or enterprising locals, a lot of the fashion stuff is too, that can come from them like your leather items, sides and that from Bangkok, Turkey all over.

<title>From the car Boot To Booting It Up – the Transformation of the Criminal Marketplace</title>
<p>Both Des and Mike are indicative of a new trend in entrepreneurial trading which is reconfiguring traditional working class enterprise culture (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895811428173">Hall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895811428173">Winlow, 2001</xref>). Historically local trading cultures were found in working class communities, and were underpinned by notions of self-reliance and enterprise. Much of the empirical work on ‘enterprise crime’ in the UK has been concerned with working class men, who acquire and sell on stolen and counterfeit property (and more recently drugs) when ‘doing the business’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811428173">Hobbs, 1988</xref>). This male dominated, entrepreneurial intellectual property crime still often remains rooted in specific, local working class communities and networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811428173">Foster, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895811428173">Hall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811428173">Hobbs, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895811428173">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895811428173">Winlow, 2001</xref>). Both Des and Mike are products of such an environment, residing on large, former council estates on the periphery of the city in which they reside and were inducted into the trading culture of their estates by their peers:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I learned to sell knock offs from when I first did burglaries as a kid. We never really did houses; it was more shoplifting after the shop had closed, going in through the roofs and that. Get fags, booze, sell it to people what you knew well and who wouldn’t say much. Go round the pubs, down the working men’s club – ‘You want some fags?’ It was just that really … I worked on the markets as a Saturday boy, and learned a lot there too, but everyone used to trade and that. It wasn’t snides in them days it was all just nicked gear and that. (Des: transcribed by author from taped interview)</p>
<p>I always remember when I was younger lads would come to the door and sell stuff to our mom. After me dad went she never had no money so while she has always been as straight as a dice, she would buy nicked gear off the shoplifters on the estate and that. The ones in our flat [block] used to nick to order, I got all me Christmas presents that way. When I got to about 11 and I got a paper round they used to get me to run things round to people on the round, sell fags for them and things. That is how I got involved, well, that and school. I was always the kid in school selling stuff to other kids. I wouldn’t nick much stuff myself, but I’d always sell it for others – or buy it and sell it on again. Money was tight and every little helped. (Mike: transcribed by author from taped interview)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While the internet is but one factor that has begun to influence criminal activity more generally (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895811428173">Winlow, 2001</xref>), the proliferation of high-speed broadband connections, coupled with increased business connectivity and third generation mobile phones mean that ever more people are connected to the internet. Online auction websites such as eBay now transcend space and place, making for markedly different opportunities including the illegal variety. Sites such as eBay can, for example, allow the Camden shoplifter to sell their stolen wares to a buyer in Rotherham or Rotterdam (conveniently advertised with the acronym BNWT for ‘Brand New with Tags) while it matters not whether buyers and sellers even speak the same language. That might explain why eBay has become a prime site for intellectual property crime as illegitimate enterprise, and is perhaps impacting upon long held traditions in entrepreneurial trading cultures:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I ain’t going out rain or shine punting stuff anymore. That’s a mug’s game, it’s hard work. Almost all the lads I know involved in snides [selling counterfeit products] do it on the net now, on eBay and that. It’s the same with moody [stolen] gear. It all gets sold online now, eBay, eBid, Gumtree, stuff like that. (Des: transcribed by author from taped interview)</p>
<p>The day of the car boot and selling stuff in pubs, that seems to be over to me. You still see a few people trying it on market stalls or through units and that, there is one up the road in the shopping centre that sells snides, like Y3 and stoney [meaning Stone Island – both are exclusive designer labels] but he is a fucking mug, waiting to be pulled by trading standards. Anyone with any sense who does any trade in counterfeits now does it online, it’s just how it is now. (Mike: transcribed by author from taped interview)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Traditionally, ethnographies of acquisitive offenders have been at the forefront of criminology’s recognition of social change and transformation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895811428173">Hobbs, 1995</xref>). Academic work concerned with this type of enterprise crime has recognized that older criminal ‘subcultures’ which once held a monopoly have given way to ‘a series of temporary social arrangements that enables a constantly changing group of criminal actors to make money from predominantly criminal opportunities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895811428173">Lea, 2002</xref>: 149; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811428173">Hobbs, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895811428173">1995</xref>). In this respect the online world is now providing entrepreneurs with new opportunities:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I can make more money now doing stuff online than I can if I go out grafting [working] or doing more serious, naughty things [crime] and that is what it is all about basically. I can sit at home with the telly on and the money rolls in. I can spend all day in the pub or the bookies and the cash is coming in. No-one really seems to be on top of it and to be honest; selling snide gear to me seems pretty much risk free. It’s not like in the past when I have had me collar felt for it by the old bill and trading standards and that. It’s just proper easy. (Des: transcribed by author from taped interview)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Recently criminologists have come to talk of globally influenced, regionally distinct ‘glocal’ cultures as a better descriptor of the contemporary condition which underpins much crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895811428173">Winlow, 2001</xref>) where offenders look to exploit chances to capitalize on having less competition, seek out greater financial incentives or move into lucrative spheres where penalties are lower or the chances of detection are reduced (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748895811428173">Naylor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811428173">Shover et al., 2003</xref>). The internet is the perfect vehicle for such transactions and all the research participants commented on how easily the internet facilitates low risk forms of crime:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I mean it is serious stuff if you get done now with snides by trading standards and that. I know lads that have done time, got major fines and that, lost a lot of money, it’s serious, but online it’s different, no one seems to care at all. (Mike: transcribed by author from taped interview)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This sentiment was one that was generally expressed by all 10 of those interviewed, with the most frequent recurring theme being the moral legitimacy of counterfeit trading coupled with a low risk of detection:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I can make a lot of money out of the net. I know how to make dollars I tell you. I ain’t a criminal, I just give people stuff that they like at a good price, and I couldn’t give a fuck about ripping off the companies cos they are the biggest fucking thieves going. Obviously though you couldn’t just sell it out there on the street, cos if you get done [prosecuted] it can get heavy. But online it’s simple really. (Allan: from handwritten interview notes)</p>
<p>Basically selling counterfeits and stuff like that on eBay and sites like it is simple really, it’s easy money and there aren’t any risks. (Phil: from handwritten interview notes)</p>
<p>Why I do it? Fucking easy money isn’t it – easy money with no comeback. (Ray: transcribed by author from taped interview)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The rationale for counterfeit offending then feeds off its status and perception as a less serious form of offending that is to regulate at the micro level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895811428173">Patent Office, 2004</xref>). It has long been noted that opportunistic criminal entrepreneurs are alert to less regulated sites, or ‘zones of ambiguity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748895811428173">Hornsby and Hobbs, 2007</xref>), and the internet provides a space where illicit and ambiguous trading, such as intellectual property crime and trade in counterfeit products may be easily conducted. Not only are internet auction sites little concerned with detecting and preventing the sale of illicit and counterfeit goods, so too they may provide a setting where taxation revenues are avoided and national boundaries are easily breached, and where the opportunity for profit is maximized, while minimizing risk of detection and prosecution. This is especially the case when those responsible for oversight and regulation of the market also have the imperative to maximize transactions. Indeed, many of those interviewed used existing auction websites which, they suggested were unconcerned about much of the illicit trading that took place on their sites:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The companies that run sites, they have rules and they say no snides, but they don’t look too carefully really. I mean why the fuck would they, they make commission on all sales so it can’t be like they are really bothered. (Des: transcribed by author from taped interview)</p>
<p>I can’t believe that there is much of an effort to monitor stuff. I have had listings on auction sites deleted, but I just put them back up on the site. Most auction sites are just full of moody products. (Jon: transcribed by author from taped interview)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such factors may explain why traders such as Des, formerly reliant on selling counterfeit items in a nexus of working class settings (such as in pubs and at car boot markets), have readily embraced the opportunity and removed much of the risk of detection and prosecution by using the internet:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I was market trading and that, when you sold knock off, some people would ask you, is this above board, well you never say ‘no’ do you, I wasn’t going to say, ‘it came off the back of a lorry this morning love’, but on the net, people just don’t ask them kind of things. I reckon there are some fucking posh types out there that would go fucking bonkers if they knew where stuff came from, but because it’s off eBay, they don’t suspect fuck all. Now you have to be careful with anything nicked in bulk, keep it away from the house, never list it under the same account, move about, be careful and that. (Des: transcribed by author from taped interview)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Most of those I spoke to who used eBay to trade counterfeit items told me that it was relatively ‘risk free’. Another suggested to me ‘I wouldn’t go hawking stuff around in pubs, selling fakes out of bags like you see the Chinese do in town, but on eBay, well that is different.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1748895811428173">5</xref></sup> In part eBay offers a means of avoiding the gaze of social control agencies that would otherwise be interested in the trader’s activities. As Des suggested, eBay is ‘not like [being] out on the street waiting to have me collar felt by trading standards and that’.</p>
<p>In addition the anonymity of the third space allows those using sites like eBay to take precautions when selling stolen or counterfeit items. For example Mike suggests that when he was selling criminally acquired merchandise, in this case expensive electrical equipment (stolen by a friend from his place of employment) he could take additional measures to avoid detection:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You have to use your head a bit and avoid suspicion … Knowing a bit about the technology helps, but you don’t need to be too paranoid, just set it [the eBay account] up as if you are 50 miles away and never give out your address and that. I reckon that there is loads of nicked gear on eBay, and no one really seems to give a fuck, but I’ve been a bit careful and know how to keep myself out of the frame. My biggest concern is I don’t want to end up getting caught for tax at some point in the future. I wanna be able to deny all knowledge if it comes on top, you know, so I am careful. The best bit is I haven’t even put payments into my own account. I used to work with this South African lad, and when he went (back home) he sold me his bank account and card. I used that for a while till the card expired so none of the money is ever going to be linked with me. It’s all just being a bit clever, that is all it is. (Mike: transcribed by author from taped interview)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other interviewees suggested that they actively attempted to stay up-to-date and remain knowledgeable of regulations, not because they fear ‘policing’ by the site, but because of the potential implications should their trading be recognized as generating their true level of income, or because of the risk of detection by those responsible for paying statutory welfare benefits. Others, such as Mike and Des, occasionally sold stolen items, which brought with it a risk of criminal sanctions. For those reasons, most interviewees some took precautions when using the site to avoid detection:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I got a laptop that I used and did all me early trading in an Internet café using that, so it wasn’t linked to me. Same goes with me mobile, pay as you go effort because I wasn’t going to give my number out on the net. I learnt quickly, read computer mags, even took a short course so I know quite well how to stay hidden. I’ve done everything I can to make sure I’m untraceable, because I’ve always been a bit concerned about the benefits and the taxman. I’ve never paid a penny in tax on the trading I’ve done and I’d owe them thousands now, but the fuckers haven’t caught me yet, and they ain’t going to. (Des: transcribed by author from taped interview)</p>
<p>Don’t do anything from your home PC is my rule. I listed stuff on their web through internet cafes, stuff like that. It’s not like I make myself easy to trace, but at the same time, I don’t worry too much. No one seems to care what goes on. (Allan: from handwritten interview notes)</p>

<title>Conclusion: The Criminal Marketplace as (Cyber)Bazaar</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The internet can make anonymous the human actor, placing a new world of possibility at their fingertips. It can afford users the opportunities to ‘feel daring, liberated, infallible’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748895811428173">Jewkes and Sharp, 2003</xref>: 2)</p>
<p>Two types of crime are likely to feature in the future: the traditional physical crime on the one hand – burglary, vehicle theft, personal attack, fraud, etc – and the new electronic crime on the other – internet fraud, copyright fraud, computer hacking, information misappropriation, etc. Mutually compatible, criminals will enjoy both operating environments conducting old forms of crime (e.g. fraud) through new mediums (e.g. the Internet). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748895811428173">Association of British Insurers, 2000</xref>: v)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It has been recognized for some time that there is the potential for new advances in technology to equip offenders with new means of making profit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748895811428173">Naylor, 2000</xref>). For example, in their discussion of telemarketing offenders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811428173">Shover et al. (2003</xref>: 489) note that while there are continuities between this new offender population and bygone generations of professional thieves (such as both groups’ concerns with lifestyle consumption and hedonism) this new form of offender was reflective of wider socio-economic and cultural changes, incorporating those who had acquired the skills to succeed, and in contrast to the mainstream offender population, they noted that: ‘telemarketing criminals disproportionately are drawn from middleclass, entrepreneurial backgrounds … their work organizations are more permanent and conventional in outward appearance than the criminal organizations created by blue-collar offenders, which were grounded in the culture of the industrial proletariat’.</p>
<p>However, the notion of change in professional crime per se might not be sustainable across the full spectrum of professional criminality, a point which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811428173">Shover and colleagues (2003</xref>: 489) note when they observe that like the markets that they seek to manipulate and plunder, ‘the enacted environments … professional criminals embrace infinite variations, and are largely indistinguishable from the arenas that capacitate legitimate entrepreneurial pursuits’. This is also the reality of the internet where the ‘third space’ and the online world has not only forged some specific new offences, but has transformed the setting for ‘old’ crimes and provides new means of exploiting long established entrepreneurial instincts. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748895811428173">Naylor (2000</xref>: 4) notes, while computer crime may be ‘singled out as a prime new area of concern’ in reality,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>it boils down to a series of traditional criminal acts (e.g. extortion, counterfeiting or fraud) that happen today to be assisted by the use of computers. The crimes remain the same. The only difference is the technique used to commit them, and the ability to do them from much further away than was commonly the case.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Therefore expectation that criminals who utilize such methods will be markedly different in character from criminals of a bygone era may simply be naïve.</p>
<p>It seems that some online spaces, such as auction websites like eBay are a trading sphere that is easily exploited by some criminally connected and minded individuals who have the knowledge to make best use of current ‘light touch’ regulation (and in this respect there is a commonality with the global banking system and those who have exploited the digital transactions that typify contemporary money markets). The fact that auction websites are largely self-policed means that they are places highly conducive to intellectual property crime, as has recently been demonstrated by eBay being fined for failure to counteract counterfeit trading on the site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895811428173">Chrafis, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In his work on the contemporary nature of organized crime, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748895811428173">Ruggiero (2000</xref>: 29) avers that the contemporary criminal marketplace can be conceived of as a bazaar, as ‘the metaphor of the bizarre intends to convey the image of the city as a market-place’. However Ruggiero suggests that the term captures the, ‘incessant bargaining, trade and manoeuvre’ that is found therein. For him, the bazaar ‘is constituted by a network of retailers, ambulatory vendors, distributors and wholesalers, seasonal workers, casual assistants and apprentices’ and ‘performs the role of employment agency’ where demands are identified and new ones created, legal and otherwise. The bazaar ‘unites diverse commodities and services located on a continuum where, most significantly, the distinction between legally acceptable practices and criminal behaviour is blurred’ (2000: 27–43). In it are found incessant flexibility, electrifying movement and exhilarating temporariness. Therefore borrowing from Clifford Geertz and colleagues (1979, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748895811428173">Ruggiero, 2000</xref>: 42) to denote the character of the bazaar, Ruggiero notes the proverb: ‘Move and you will confound your enemies, sit, and they will confound you.’ While Ruggiero’s concept of the bazaar regards ‘crime’ as predicated on interaction that is ultimately human, interpersonal and physically conducted in the social realm; the online world now functions in many ways as a similar, though disembodied bazaar. While underground networks and ‘who you know’ are important for criminals, opportunities for detachment and movement are hallmarks of the third space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811428173">Aas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748895811428173">Jewkes and Sharp, 2003</xref>):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>you look at where moody gear used to be sold, the places you went to shift it were not prime sites for selling things a lot of the time cos of the people you came across, they where the type of tight fuckers that squeaked when they walked. A lot of people, they didn’t have the money you know, so like at boot sales and stuff like that you would get some cheeky cunt trying to haggle with you when you were already giving them a steal. You would get old bill, benefits and trading standards about. Now eBay, it’s used by a whole load of people, you know including those with money, so while they like a bargain, they are a bit less likely to take the absolute piss when it comes to what they will pay. I’m doing what I used to do, but it’s just got so much better for me. (Des: transcribed by author from taped interview)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This research illustrates that the internet is altering the criminal marketplace and superseding more established local trading cultures (in a manner not dissimilar to that suggested by some previous studies of changing nature of professional crime; see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811428173">Shover et al., 2003</xref>). Yet in contrast to the criminal telemarketers interviewed by Shover and colleagues the participants were not the ‘borgoise … with education or ideological flexibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811428173">Shover et al., 2003</xref>: 502). Rather, those interviewed here were typical of research participants in traditional writing on enterprise crime; they were largely male, working class entrepreneurs who noticed opportunities to make money illicitly through intellectual property crime and the selling of counterfeits and who were inclined to accept the opportunity, especially when rewards were high and risks were low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811428173">Hobbs, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895811428173">1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet while the individuals documented here were involved in criminality that can rightly be considered under the headers organized and professional crime, to do so also risks conferring upon them a degree of sophistication that is overstated. Their counterfeit trading yielded large rewards, especially as they had embraced opportunities to maximize exposure to consumers through using the internet. Yet as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748895811428173">Naylor (2000</xref>: 4) has noted ‘the bulk of criminals are scarcely techno-wizards … [and] most crimes are committed using old fashioned techniques’. Perhaps then it is also to these groups, and too long established qualitative methods that criminologists should return if they really wish to get a grip on the seemingly ‘new’, ‘sophisticated’ and ‘emergent’ forms of crime taking place in the online world. Yet we also need to move beyond a binary position that separates real and physical from virtual crime because ‘Old forms of crime (e.g. fraud) will be conducted through new mediums (e.g. the Internet)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748895811428173">Association of British Insurers, 2000</xref>: 31). It may be that the internet has radically altered criminal conduct and criminal activities, and the boundaries that separate ‘old’ physical offending from ‘new’ technological and electronic opportunities are too rigid a conception to persist with.</p>
<p>Perhaps the internet has the potential to alter radically crime and criminal conduct, but in a much more nuanced and complex way, and at a much more micro level than has hitherto been recognized. It is certainly true that career criminals and new, lawbreaking entrepreneurs have been tempted by the opportunity the third space affords and by new forms of offending such as counterfeit trading, though the continuing benefits of third space criminality in the long term are unpredictable. Given the limited empirical engagement with practising intellectual property infringing (and cyber) criminals to date, more empirical research is necessary. As increasing numbers of people globally gain access to the internet, the trend for relocation and alteration of criminal practices may well spread. The real message here, then, is that the voices of those who use the opportunities emanating from these new online marketplaces have been the subject of perplexingly little comment, and at the very least, I hope this article is a contribution towards rectifying that. After all, while criminologists might fail to see the third space and new under-regulated online spaces as a prime conduit for criminality, it seems that some offenders at least, have not been so blind to their transformative, and often very lucrative, potential.</p>

<p>While I regard the activity here as professional crime, I recognize the use of the very terms professional and organized crime can be ill defined and illusive. However, I agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895811428173">Hobbs (1995</xref>: 1), who notes that where professional crime is concerned ‘definitional ambiguity should not detract from the centrality of the concept … nor its essential vitality’. The UK’s Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA) for example, considers intellectual property crime as a threat under its remit, and the individuals here documented certainly accord with their view of the sort of organized criminal entrepreneurs reaping the rewards of this profitable form of illegitimate enterprise.</p>
