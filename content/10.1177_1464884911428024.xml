<p><italic>Radio Utopia</italic> begins with an apocryphal anecdote about legendary newsman Edward R. Murrow, who allegedly said to his colleagues at the end of the Second World War, ‘We’ve seen what radio can do for the nation in war. Now let’s go back to see what she can do in <italic>peace</italic>!’ (p. 2). This book chronicles the efforts that followed, when journalists and writers, emboldened by the effective use of radio for wartime news, produced a series of documentaries about such issues as poverty, juvenile delinquency, racism, atomic energy, communism, and even the scourge of venereal disease. This rejuvenated interest in public interest programming yielded series on the NBC, CBS, and ABC networks. Spot news coverage and local programming are explicitly omitted from the study – a methodological choice perhaps inspired by the availability of the archival record.</p>
<p>After a [not an] perceptive introduction, subsequent chapters focus on particular series, including <italic>The March of Time</italic> (the pre-war blueprint for the genre), <italic>One World Flight</italic> (from famed dramatist Norman Corwin), <italic>The Eagle’s Brood</italic> (about juvenile delinquency), <italic>The Quick and The Dead</italic> (Fred Friendly’s take on atomic energy), and <italic>Hear It Now</italic> (Murrow’s aural precursor to <italic>See It Now</italic>). Perhaps the most unusual program discussed is a musical from ABC, the struggling third-place and thus most adventurous network, which was ostensibly a report on America’s economic future as well as promotion for an upcoming Disney film. These radio documentaries flourished for only a few years, as the networks soon allocated their resources to television. Another blow to the genre came from conservatives who attacked many of the writers, particularly Norman Corwin and Robert Shayon, for their populist tendencies and suspected socialist leanings.</p>
<p>Many of these documentaries featured studio recreations of live events, with actors portraying real individuals. Such artifice was necessary because the major networks banned the use of recordings, with NBC enforcing the most rigid policy. Technical issues also worked against the use of natural sound, as ‘portable’ recording devices of the time were actually quite cumbersome. (Current journalism students might be less likely to complain about faulty memory cards or dead batteries after reading about the technical difficulties faced by their predecessors.) Recordings of real events, and average citizens, eventually worked their way into the documentaries thanks to relaxed network policies and the development of magnetic tape recorders.</p>
<p>Author Matthew Ehrlich states that his book should not be read as a romanticized celebration of this moment in radio history, and he notes that the title can be read as a sarcastic jibe. And, while there is definitely an undercurrent of appreciation behind the work, Ehrlich does not shy away from criticizing the post-war radio documentaries. Female writers were scarce, and African-Americans completely absent (even in a program about race relations). As with other forms of journalism, these radio shows were products of their time, with the dominant views of the day influencing their content. Writers also had to navigate demands from network executives; a program on juvenile delinquency, for example, was forbidden from even mentioning the possibility that anti-social behavior might be inspired by the media (p. 53). Another critical perspective on these radio documentaries is that they were merely token gestures to demonstrate a commitment to the ‘public interest’ to the Federal Communications Commission. The poor time-slots given to many of the shows, such as CBS’s placement of <italic>One World Flight</italic> in direct competition to the juggernaut of Bob Hope’s variety show, also suggest that support for this genre was somewhat tepid.</p>
<p>To research this work, Ehrlich mined the archives of several institutions and listened to a great many surviving recordings. Despite this level of research, many passages have a perfunctory, formulaic feel. When recounting specific episodes of some of the series, for example, Ehrlich falls into a pattern of offering many descriptive details interspersed with quotes from <italic>Variety</italic>, the <italic>New York Times</italic>, and citations to previous works. The value of this work is not the intense level of original, archival research that Ehrlich brings to the table, but rather in the recognition that this radio genre was distinct and worthy of analysis. While a great deal has been written about some of the central figures in this book, including Corwin, Murrow, and Friendly, Ehrlich is the first to synthesize the prior scholarship into a sustained exploration of this particular radio genre.</p>
<p>Anyone with an interest in radio history or radio journalism will find this book valuable. The book could also make useful reading in an upper-division journalism class, with students asked to evaluate the decisions made by journalists in the late 1940s. The technology and politics of today differ from those of several decades ago, although producing journalism in a commercial media environment still involves striking the right balance between authenticity and aesthetics, the same dilemma negotiated by these post-war radio documentaries.</p>
