<p>Harking back to what many collectors and some scholars see as a “golden age,” this new study describes the very different world of radio back before (and just after) World War II.</p>
<p>A history professor at Concordia University in Montreal, the author returns to American radio’s pre-television age (plus a final chapter on local radio in the immediate post-war era) to assess how listener response (letters, stories in fan magazines, calls, and telegrams) helped to shape what people heard on network radio. She argues that a “participatory ethic” pervaded the field long before modern social media made it all so much easier (and more confusing).</p>
<p>All of this is based on extensive digging in a variety of archive collections, the results illustrating the book in period photos as well as with countless examples to support her basic point. Her trolling through pages of period radio fan magazines for listener mail (what a deadly process that must have been by the end!) opens a door to what so-called ordinary folks thought about radio.</p>
<p>We also see the beginnings of “scientific” audience research (over and above the development of ratings) as the medium grew larger, making individual inputs harder to track. Razlogova’s book adds to the growing collection of first-rate scholarly books on radio’s history. We’ve come a long way since Erik Barnouw’s pioneering work decades ago.</p>
