<abstract>
<p>Margo Wilson has been crucial to the development of the Chicago Homicide Data Set (CHD) beginning in 1987, when she and Martin Daly joined the project. She spent 2 years collecting detailed information on intimate partner homicides, and inspired the addition of variables, such as whether the victim and offender resided together, the offender’s sexual jealousy, the offender’s sexual rivalry, and whether the offender was motivated by the victim’s estrangement or attempted desertion. This article reviews Margo Wilson’s many contributions and presents analyses showing the importance of differentiating between sexual jealousy and sexual rivalry in research on intimate partner homicide.</p>

<title>Margo Wilson and the Chicago Homicide Dataset</title>
<p>The long collaboration between Margo Wilson and Martin Daly and the Chicago Homicide Dataset Project began with a chance meeting at the American Society of Criminology (ASC) in 1987. One of us was presenting a paper about the intimate partner homicides in the Chicago Homicide Dataset (CHD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1088767912461142">Block, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1088767912461142">Block &amp; Christakos, 1995</xref>), while Margo and Martin were presenting an analysis that would soon be published in their book, <italic>Homicide</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088767912461142">Daly &amp; Wilson, 1988</xref>). Margo and Martin caught our excitement about the potential of the CHD, and wrote a proposal for a Harry Frank Guggenheim (HFG) Foundation grant that supported data collection from 1982 through 1989 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1088767912461142">Wilson, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The CHD includes all homicides known to the police in Chicago from 1965 to 2000, not only those where an offender was apprehended and convicted, but also homicides that never ended in arrest (for example, homicide-suicides), homicides that are later determined to have been justifiable at the prosecutorial or court level, and homicides where the offender was eventually found not guilty. People killed by police (but not security officers) in the line of duty are generally not included in the CHD. Because the CHD includes murders known to the police, it does not contain cases of concealed death unless the death was later discovered. However, when such cases are discovered, even years after the death, they are added to the CHD.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1088767912461142">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>There were (and still are) many limitations in the CHD.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1088767912461142">2</xref></sup> Instead of simply pointing out its faults, however, Margo Wilson was willing to “put her money where her mouth was” and devote tremendous effort to making substantial improvements in the dataset. After receiving the HFG grant, for 2 years she traveled several times a year from Hamilton, Ontario, to Chicago while she herself collected CHD data. She arranged with the Chicago Police Department (CPD) to have access to the complete and often huge master file for each homicide, not just to the one-page Murder Analysis Report (MAR), something that we had never done before or since. Focusing on the intimate partner cases, she energetically searched through these large files, comparing the information there to the information in the CHD, and recommending expansions of variables and codes to reflect the more detailed information in the larger files. This became a wonderful test of the construct validity of the CHD, and resulted in considerable improvement in the dataset. As a result, of course, Margo and Martin gained a dataset that could provide the basis for answering many of the questions that they were asking in Evolutionary Psychology (see Publications by Margo Wilson using the Chicago Homicide Dataset, below). More importantly, through her work, researchers in homicide and the prevention of homicide gained an irreplaceable tool for looking at lethal violence as it really is.</p>
<sec id="section2-1088767912461142">
<title>Homicide From the Point of View of Evolutionary Psychology</title>
<p>Margo Wilson’s evolutionary psychological perspective on homicide was far different from our own primarily sociological perspective, but seldom contradicted it (Daly &amp; Wilson, 1997). Evolutionary psychologists treat human motives and emotions as products of a history of natural selection, and expect them to have contributed to reproductive success in ancestral environments. At least in earlier times, the zero sum game for male reproduction necessitated greater levels of violence than did female reproductive competition. Although the relationship between violence and male reproductive success has become weaker over time, we still carry the remnants of our evolutionary past. While there are obvious social and demographic variations in the level of homicide, basic characteristics of animal reproduction (especially male) cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The analysis of homicide from an evolutionary psychological point of view required much more detail than was available from any data source at the time. Limited by the availability of police data, research typically had differentiated relationships into only three or four categories: Relatives, acquaintances, strangers, and unknown relationship; “lover’s triangle” was one of the few coded motives available. Therefore, Margo was excited to discover that the Chicago Homicide Dataset Project included about eighty detailed variables at the time, consistently collected from 1965 through 1981 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1088767912461142">Block, 1993</xref>). For example, instead of lumping together all parent/child relationships, the relationship category was differentiated by gender and by whether the parent or child was a victim or an offender. In homicides with more than one victim or offender, the relationship for each victim/offender dyad was coded separately. There were separate categories for situations where a daughter was the victim of a father and a father was the victim of a daughter.</p>
<p>However, the data still presented challenges to the analysis we all wanted to do. The funding from the HFG grant that Margo secured permitted the expansion of the CHD in a number of new directions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1088767912461142">
<title>Cleaning, Detailed Coding, Additional Variables</title>
<p>Serendipitously, Margo and Martin joined the CHD Project at an exciting time for the project. Computer capabilities were rapidly expanding. The demise of punch cards allowed for the coding of almost unlimited categories within variables. Computer mapping permitted the spatial analysis of homicide patterns. We had begun to use this technology to improve the CHD (for more detail, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1088767912461142">Block, 1993</xref>). The ease of computer analysis supported basic data cleaning; for example, we noticed that many people who were obviously not infants (for example, the relationship was father) were coded age “0,” and discovered that, in some years, “age missing” was coded as “0”; we also noticed that many relationships coded “unknown” or “missing” in the CHD were actually strangers in the MAR (Murder Analysis Report) narrative. When we discovered such systematic errors, we checked each relevant CHD case back to 1965 and made corrections as indicated.</p>
<p>Expanded computer capability also made it possible to add to the CHD details that existed in the MAR but had not yet been coded. For example, the code “victim precipitation” was separated into “victim resistance,” “victim intervening to help another,” “police officer intervening in a crime,” “passive bystander,” “victim committing a crime,” and “victim initiating violence in an argument.” “Drug related” was specified into “a fight over drugs,” “the offender or victim being high in the incident,” and “the business of drugs.”</p>
<p>Margo Wilson suggested additional enhancements for the CHD. In most homicide datasets, then and now, only the street address of the incident is collected, and possibly the home address of the victim or offender. Margo saw the importance of collecting specific information about whether or not the victim and offender were living together at the time of the lethal incident, as well as information about whether the “home” location was the home of the victim. This information forms the basis for many analyses, such as those about stepchildren living in the home, or the estrangement or separation of intimate partners. In addition, though we had already begun the process of adding detail about “mother’s boyfriend” to the relationship variables, the collaborative discussions with Margo and Martin encouraged us to include further detail about step relationships. We have since created a set of “Caretaker” variables for child victims and for elderly or disabled victims, depicting whether the offender was a caretaker and the type of caretaker (“babysitter,” “mother’s boyfriend,” etc.). There are also codes in the “Caretaker” variables for situations in which the caretaker is killed by the person being cared for.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1088767912461142">
<title>Sexual Rivalry and Sexual Jealousy</title>
<p>When Margo Wilson and Martin Daly joined us as partners on the Chicago Homicide Data Project, they saw the CHD as a tool for research on evolutionary psychology, where a male’s desire for reproductive dominance over his sexual mate derives from his human evolutionary heritage. From this perspective, it is important to distinguish between sexual rivalry, in which a male contends with another male over the reproductive capacity of a female, versus sexual jealousy, in which a male attempts to corral all of a female’s sexual favors for himself alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912461142">Wilson &amp; Daly, 1993</xref>). Like the Federal Bureau of Investigation and most cities in the eighties (and many still today), the CPD used “lover’s triangle” as one category of motive (causative factor). Lover’s triangle covers a wide variety of situations, including situations that could be categorized as sexual rivalry or sexual jealousy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1088767912461142">3</xref></sup> Margo and Martin insisted that the meaning of “lover’s triangle” is vague and can lead to misleading research results (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088767912461142">Daly &amp; Wilson, 1998a</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, Margo searched through the large master files for each homicide from 1982 through 1989 to determine whether the motive of each offender in the incident exhibited sexual rivalry or sexual jealousy, using the following operational definitions:</p>
<sec id="section5-1088767912461142">
<title>Sexual Rivalry</title>
<p>An offender exhibits sexual rivalry when competing with the victim for the affections of a third person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088767912461142">Wilson &amp; Daly, 1992</xref>). The motive is from the offender’s perspective; the target may or may not be an active participant. For example, a man sees his girlfriend sitting with another man in a bar and shoots the other man in the back, or an ex-boyfriend invades the home of his ex-girlfriend and kills her current boyfriend. Sexual rivalry is a possible motive regardless of gender; a woman may see herself as a sexual rival with another woman for the affections of a man, a gay man may see himself as a sexual rival with another man, and so forth. A teenage girl who recruits a group of friends to assault and kill another teenage girl who has “stolen” her boyfriend would be exhibiting “sexual rivalry.” A man who wants to capture the heart of a woman at work, and who then stalks and kills her boyfriend, would be exhibiting “sexual rivalry.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1088767912461142">
<title>Sexual Jealousy</title>
<p>An offender exhibits sexual jealousy when trying to maintain exclusive sexual rights to the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1088767912461142">Wilson &amp; Daly, 1992</xref>). For example, an ex-husband may be jealous of his wife’s relationship with her current husband, accuse her of infidelity and kill her. Intimate partners are relaxing in a bar when the man thinks that the woman has shown too much familiarity to another customer; if he kills her when they get home, this would be “sexual jealousy.” A man who kills his partner in a long-term gay relationship after the partner announces that he plans to move out to live with another man would be a case of “sexual jealousy.”</p>
<p>Using Margo’s work with 1982-1989 homicides as a template, we added detailed codes to the “causative factor” motivation variable distinguishing sexual rivalry and sexual jealousy, motives that had previously been lumped together under the “lover’s triangle” category. We then consistently coded all cases from 1965 through 2000, based on information from the MAR. As cases began to arise suggesting that a particular variable needed more detail or expansion, we added additional codes and then recoded the entire dataset to reflect the changes. For example, based on the “stories” of the homicides as reflected in the brief MAR narratives and on analyses showing that some sexual jealousy cases tended to follow different patterns than others, we added a category, “sexual jealousy—victim accusing offender,” to describe situations in which the victim is killed after accusing the offender of infidelity.</p>
<p>The following analysis, based on the CHD data from 1965 to 2000, is intended to give the reader a taste of the far-ranging consequences of Margo’s contributions.</p>
</sec></sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1088767912461142">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>In this analysis, we lay out the specific characteristics of two motives that Margo Wilson caused to be added to the CHD, “sexual jealousy” and “sexual rivalry,” with sexual jealousy divided into whether the offender was accusing the victim or the victim was accusing the offender of real or imagined sexual impropriety.</p>
<p>The “sexual jealousy versus sexual rivalry” variable analyzed here, then, includes four categories: “Sexual jealousy—offender accusing victim,” “sexual jealousy—victim accusing offender,” “sexual rivalry,” and “not indicated,” which includes all other cases in which the CPD investigation had determined a motive (thus, it does not include cases in which the offender’s motive is not known to the police).</p>
<p>This analysis uses the victim-based CHD or the offender-based CHD, as appropriate. The victim-based CHD includes one record for each homicide victim known to the police and occurring in Chicago from 1965 through 2000. The offender-based CHD includes one record for each person identified by police investigation as an offender in the homicides of these victims, which means that there may be more than one offender per victim. The number of known offenders in CHD incidents ranges from 1 to 12. Also, in homicide incidents with more than one victim, the offender-based CHD includes only one record for each offender in the incident. Victims for whom no offender has been identified (4,669 of the 27,345; 17%) are not represented in the offender-based CHD.</p>
<p>In coding “sexual jealousy” versus “sexual rivalry,” we looked at the MAR narrative and all available information for each individual offender–victim relationship dyad, and coded accordingly. Each offender in the offender-level file has primary and secondary motive (causative factor) codes, either of which allows a code of sexual jealousy or sexual rivalry. In the case of multiple victims, an offender’s motive could be sexual jealousy for one victim (for example, the partner or ex-partner) and sexual rivalry for another victim (for example, the ex-partner’s new partner). Similarly, each victim (in the victim-level file) has primary and secondary motive (causative factor) codes. If an offender killed his partner and her new partner, sexual jealousy would be the offender’s primary motive and sexual rivalry the secondary motive for killing his partner, and sexual rivalry would be the offender’s primary motive and sexual jealousy the secondary motive for killing her new partner. In the analysis here, to avoid double-counting, we looked individually at each case that seemed to exhibit both sexual rivalry and sexual jealousy, and categorized the case as to the most salient motive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1088767912461142">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of the 27,345 victims in the victim-based CHD, 4,669 (17%) had no information on offender motive. Of the 28,708 offenders in the offender-based CHD, 1,883 (7%) had no information on motive. These unknown-motive cases are not included in the following analysis.</p>

<title>Gender Differences in Sexual Jealousy Versus Sexual Rivalry</title>
<sec id="section9-1088767912461142">
<title>Victim-based analysis</title>
<p>Together, sexual jealousy and sexual rivalry accounted for 1,313 (5.8%) of the 22,676 CHD victims from 1965 to 2000 with information on motive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088767912461142">Table 1a</xref>). Of the 1,313, 407 (31.9%) were sexual jealousy with the offender accusing the victim, 91 (6.9%) were sexual jealousy with the victim accusing the offender, and 814 (62.1%) were sexual rivalry. Sexual jealousy plus sexual rivalry motives accounted for 970 (5.3%) of the 18,440 male homicide victims, compared to 342 (8.1%) of the 4,236 female homicide victims. However, gender is associated with sexual jealousy homicides and sexual rivalry homicides in opposite directions. Over 90% of sexual rivalry victims were men, even more than the high proportion of men among CHD victim cases generally (81.3%). In both kinds of sexual jealousy, women constituted much higher proportions than they did among CHD victims generally. The proportion of women victims in sexual jealousy situations in which the offender accused the victim of infidelity was especially high—60% compared to only 19% of women among all CHD victims.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1088767912461142">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>It is important not to assume that all sexual jealousy cases with women victims had a male offender or vice versa, though the great majority do fit that pattern—269 of the 275 (97.8%) women victims of sexual jealousy homicide were killed by a man and 187 of the 222 (84.2%) men victims of sexual jealousy homicide were killed by a woman. Specifically, among the 406 victims killed in sexual jealousy situations where the offender accused the victim, one to three men killed a woman in 240 cases, a woman killed a man in 133 cases, and one or two men killed a man in 28 cases. Only five were some other gender combination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1088767912461142">6</xref></sup> Among the 91 victims killed in sexual jealousy situations where the victim accused the offender, one or two men killed a woman in 29, and one or two women killed a man in 54. Only eight were some other gender combination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1088767912461142">7</xref></sup> Similarly, it would be a mistake to assume that all sexual rivalry cases were male-on-male, though male-on-male does account for the majority—713 (88.5%) of 806 cases with a known offender. Still, 58 sexual rivalry homicides (7.2%) were female-on-female and 35 (4.3%) were some other gender combination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1088767912461142">8</xref></sup> Thus, in death, as in life, relationships are complex.</p>
<p>Most of the offenders killing the 91 victims who died after they had accused the offender of infidelity were women. Of the 91 victims, 56 were killed by women and only 33 by men.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1088767912461142">9</xref></sup> In 23 (41%) of the 56 cases of victims killed by women, the prosecutor refused to press charges or the court decision was justifiable homicide. In two of the 33 cases of victims killed by men, the offender committed suicide at the scene; in 6 (19.4%) of the remaining 31 cases, the prosecutor refused to press charges or the court decision was justifiable homicide. In a typical “justifiable” case with a woman offender, a 52-year-old husband accused his 34-year-old wife of seeing other men and proceeded to beat her. He chased her into the kitchen, hit her over the head with a plate and, when he picked up a meat cleaver, she picked up a butcher knife and stabbed him. In a typical “justifiable” case with a male offender, an 18-year-old girlfriend called her 31-year-old boyfriend, but another woman answered the phone. The boyfriend was also dating this other woman. The girlfriend armed herself, went to confront the other woman, met up with her boyfriend and an argument ensued. She pulled a gun out, reached inside his shirt and pulled out bag of cocaine. He got control of the gun and ordered her to return the dope or he would shoot her. The victim refused. He shot her and ran away. He stated that the gun discharged while he was trying to disarm her.</p>

<sec id="section10-1088767912461142">
<title>Offender-based analysis</title>
<p>To examine offenders’ motives, the more appropriate database would be offender-level. In total, 1,245 (4.6%) of the 26,825 offenders with a known motive were motivated by sexual jealousy or sexual rivalry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1088767912461142">Table 1b</xref>). Of the 1,245, 398 (32.0%) were sexual jealousy with the offender accusing the victim, 73 (5.9%) were sexual jealousy with the victim accusing the offender, and 774 (62.2%) were sexual rivalry. Taken together, sexual jealousy and sexual rivalry were a motive for 989 (4.1%) of the 23,857 male offenders, compared to 256 (8.6%) of the 2,968 female offenders. However, as with the victim-level analysis, we again see that gender is associated in opposite directions with sexual jealousy homicide motives and sexual rivalry homicide motives.</p>

<p>Over 90% of the offenders with a sexual rivalry motive were men, a little higher than the high proportion of men among CHD offenders generally (88.9%).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1088767912461142">10</xref></sup> In both kinds of sexual jealousy motives, women offenders constituted much higher proportions than they did among CHD offenders generally (11.1%). At first glance, there may seem to be a difference compared to the victim-based analysis seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088767912461142">Table 1a</xref>. The proportion of women offenders among those offenders with a sexual jealousy motive in which the offender accused the victim of infidelity was a little over a third (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1088767912461142">Table 1b</xref>), but the proportion of women victims killed by an offender with a sexual jealousy motive in which the offender accused the victim of infidelity was 60% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088767912461142">Table 1a</xref>). Conversely, the proportion of women offenders among those offenders with a sexual jealousy motive in which the victim accused the offender was almost 70% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1088767912461142">Table 1b</xref>), while the proportion of women victims killed by an offender with a sexual jealousy motive in which the offender accused the victim of infidelity was about 35% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088767912461142">Table 1a</xref>).</p>
<p>However, this is not a difference at all. In fact, the two tables almost mirror each other when the gender of the victim is taken into account as well as the gender of the offender. Combining <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088767912461142">Tables 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1088767912461142">1b</xref>, of the 398 offenders motivated by accusing the victim of sexual impropriety, 223 killed one or two women, 166 killed a man, and 9 killed both women and men. Of the 223 offenders who killed a woman, only 4 (1.8%) were themselves women. In contrast, of the 166 who killed a man, 136 (81.9%) were women. Of the 73 offenders motivated by the victim accusing them of sexual impropriety, 21 killed one to three woman and 52 killed a man. Fifty (96.2%) of the 52 who killed a man were women. Thus, 98% of the 223 offenders in sexual jealousy homicide where the offender was accusing a woman of sexual impropriety were men, and 95% of the 20 offenders where a female victim was accusing the offender of sexual impropriety were men. Eighty-two percent of the 166 offenders in sexual jealousy homicide where the offender was accusing a man of sexual impropriety were women, and 96% of the 50 offenders where a male victim was accusing the offender of sexual impropriety were women. In short, the predominant offender in sexual jealousy homicide of a male victim is a woman, regardless of who is accusing whom. Similarly, the predominant offender in sexual jealousy homicide of a woman victim is a man, regardless of who is accusing whom.</p>
<p>A similar pattern is true of sexual rivalry homicide. Of the 774 offenders motivated by sexual rivalry, 697 killed one or two men, 65 killed a woman and 12 killed both women and men. Of the 65 who killed a woman, 61 (93.8%) were women themselves. In contrast, only 2 (0.3%) of the 697 offenders motivated by sexual rivalry who killed a man were women.</p>

<title>Gender Differences in Sexual Jealousy Versus Sexual Rivalry, Controlling for Coresidence</title>
<p>Following Margo’s suggestion, we added a variable to the CHD that indicated whether or not the victim had been living with the offender at the time of the homicide. Initially, this variable was present in the CHD only in those years that Margo herself had coded, using the complete homicide files. More recently, we expanded the variable to include all years back to 1965 and forward to 2000. Since for those years we did not have access to the complete homicide file, but only to the MAR, coresidence was often difficult to determine, and there remain many missing cases. Coresidence has not been coded for 4,623 (17%) victims of all 27,345 in the CHD. In addition, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1088767912461142">Table 2</xref> does not reflect 3,244 victims for whom coresidence was missing or the type of coresidence accounted for a small number.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1088767912461142">11</xref></sup> This totals 7,867 victims (29%) who are not included in the analysis here. In addition, some victims with information about coresidence were missing information on motive, leaving 19,478 (71%) who are represented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1088767912461142">Table 2</xref>. Therefore, these results must be considered preliminary.</p>

<p>Generally, the relationships between victim’s gender and sexual jealousy/sexual rivalry seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1088767912461142">Table 1a</xref> remain robust when controlling for coresidence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1088767912461142">Table 2</xref>). Overall, the victim is more likely to be a woman when the victim and offender were living together at the time of the homicide (41%) than when they were not (14%), certainly what we would expect from the large literature showing that women victims are most likely to be killed in their home. However, even though the proportion of women victims is generally low when the victim is not living with the offender, it is much higher for situations of sexual jealousy (59% when the offender is accusing the victim and 48% when the victim is accusing the offender, compared to 14% in general). For incidents where the offender is accusing the victim, the percentage of female victims is nearly identical (59%) where offender and victim were living together and where they had never lived together. In sexual jealousy situations where the victim is accusing the offender, the percentage of male victims (68%) was somewhat higher if the victim and offender lived together (68%) than if they had never lived together (52%). The great majority of victims in sexual rivalry situations were men, and very few were living with the offender. Victim cases that were coded “Possibly but unclear” show no relationship, as might be expected in a category composed of unclear situations.</p>
<p>Patterns within the category “Formerly lived together” may be the most interesting from the point of view of Margo Wilson’s theoretical perspective. These situations in which the victim had lived with the offender but was living separately at the time of the homicide include such scenarios as a woman had fled the relationship and the man pursued her and killed her (sexual jealousy, offender accusing victim) or he pursued and attacked her but she killed him (sexual jealousy, victim accusing offender). Based on evolutionary psychology, Wilson and Daly would expect that it would be more common for estranged men than estranged women to jealously pursue their ex. Chicago Homicide Data show this expectation to be valid—of the 54 incidents where the victim had formerly lived with the offender and the offender was accusing the victim of sexual impropriety, 89% of the victims were women;</p>
<p>Since the evolutionary psychology theory is based on differing homicide motives of estranged men and women, it is instructive to look at the offender’s motive and the specific location in the 60 homicides in which the couple had formerly lived together. For 36 of the 48 women victims where the offender was accusing her of infidelity, the first or second causative factor was “altercation over desertion or termination of the relationship”; other causative factors were “child support, custody or visitation,” home invasion, and ambush. Of the six victims of sexual jealousy homicide where the victim was accusing the offender, “altercation over desertion or termination” was a causative factor for all six. Of the six male victims, the first or second causative factor was “altercation over desertion or termination” for four and home invasion for one. These patterns coincide with the theory that the man was more likely than the woman to violently pursue an intimate partner after they had separated. In addition, 29 of the 48 women victims who had formerly lived with the offender were killed in their own homes, two in their cars, seven on the street, one at her workplace, three in the offenders’ homes, and six in homes but it was unclear whose homes. Of the six men, two were killed in their own homes, three on the street and one in a car though it was unclear whose car. These patterns, again, coincide with the theory that the man in an estranged relationship was more likely to pursue the woman.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1088767912461142">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Gender Differences in Sexual Jealousy Versus Sexual Rivalry, by Offender Suicide</title>
<p>In the growing body of research on homicide followed by suicide (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088767912461142">Koziol et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1088767912461142">Liem, Hengeveld, &amp; Koenraadt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1088767912461142">Logan et al., 2008</xref>), pioneered by Margo and Martin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088767912461142">Daly &amp; Wilson, 1988</xref>, p. 217), there is extensive and consistent evidence that male homicide offenders are more likely to commit suicide than are female homicide offenders, and that suicide is more likely when the homicide victim(s) are intimate partners or other family members. These findings are borne out in analysis of the offender-based CHD.</p>
<p>Offender’s suicide is rare. Of the 28,629 offenders in the offender-based CHD for whom gender is known, 275 committed suicide at the scene, less than 1%.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1088767912461142">13</xref></sup> Almost all of these 275 were men (96%). Only 11 of those offenders who committed suicide at the scene were women (4%). Was the offender’s suicide related to gender and motive?</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1088767912461142">Table 3a</xref> includes the 26,825 offenders with a known motive, 23,857 men and 2,968 women.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1088767912461142">14</xref></sup> It shows that offender’s suicide remains relatively rare, even among men. Only 256 (1.1%) of the 23,857 men who had committed homicide committed suicide at the scene. However, all of the 27 offenders who were motivated by sexual jealousy or sexual rivalry and committed suicide were men. In contrast, none of the eleven women who committed suicide was motivated by sexual jealousy or sexual rivalry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1088767912461142">15</xref></sup> Was a male offender’s suicide related to whether he had been motivated by sexual jealousy or sexual rivalry in the homicide, and to whether his homicide target had been an intimate partner?</p>

<title>Gender Differences in Sexual Jealousy Versus Sexual Rivalry, by Strangulation or Suffocation</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1088767912461142">Glass et al. (2008)</xref> and others have found that attempted strangulation by an intimate partner is a risk factor for later homicide. Is strangulation or suffocation a more common cause of death when the offender is motivated by sexual jealousy? The CHD contains information for primary and secondary causes of death, based on information from MAR codes for weapon, the MAR narrative, and the Medical Examiner’s determination, when available. The primary or proximate cause of death is the wound or injury most directly responsible for the victim’s death; a secondary cause of death is an additional wound or injury that contributed to the victim’s death.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1088767912461142">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cause of death is appropriately analyzed at the victim level. Strangulation or suffocation was the primary cause of death for 868 of the 27,345 victims in the victim-level CHD, and a secondary cause of death for an additional 54.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1088767912461142">18</xref></sup> Thus, only 922 victims (3.4%) of CHD victims from 1965 through 2000 were killed by strangulation or suffocation as a primary or secondary cause of death. This proportion, however, is much higher for specific population groups and for specific motivations.</p>
<p>Strangulation or suffocation as a cause of death was significantly related to the victim’s age (Chi square = 354.4; DF = 18; Sig. &lt; .0001); it was more common for the very young and the very old. Of the 228 victims aged 80 or older, 32 (14.0%) were killed by strangulation or suffocation; of the 249 infants under a year old, 38 (15.3%) were killed by strangulation or suffocation. Strangulation or suffocation was also significantly (Chi square = 1550.6; DF = 1; Sig. &lt; .0001) more likely to be a cause of death for women and girls (12.5%) than for men and boys (1.3%). In addition, it was especially likely for the 61 victims killed by a casual sex partner (36.1%), for the 20 women victims killed by a man in sexual pursuit (14.3%), for the 172 victims who were abducted (14.5%), for the ten victims who were pregnant by the offender (20%), for the 398 victims who were sexually assaulted in the incident (38.7%), and for the 684 victims killed in a home invasion (12.3%).</p>
<p>Was the victim more likely to be killed by strangulation or suffocation in a homicide motivated by sexual jealousy or sexual rivalry compared to other homicides? For male victims, the answer is “no” (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1088767912461142">Table 4</xref>); the relationship is not significant. For female victims, the answer is a qualified “yes.” Of the 3,891 women victims for whom neither sexual jealousy nor sexual rivalry was indicated, 452 (11.6%) died by suffocation or strangulation, compared to 1 (1.5%) of the 68 victims of a sexual rivalry homicide, 19 (7.8%) of the sexual jealousy homicides where she was being accused, and 6 (19.4%) of the 31 sexual jealousy homicides where she was accusing the offender.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1088767912461142">19</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As Margo Wilson and Martin Daly found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1088767912461142">Wilson &amp; Daly, 1998a</xref>), homicides exhibiting sexual jealousy differ from homicides exhibiting sexual rivalry. In the CHD, sexual jealousy is a common motive in femicide, while sexual rivalry homicide victims are almost always men. This, again, agrees with Margo and Martin’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912461142">Wilson &amp; Daly, 1993</xref>). The analysis here went a step further, differentiating between two types of sexual jealousy homicides. That is, there are situations in which the offender accused the victim of infidelity versus situations in which the victim accused the offender of infidelity. Women and girls were the predominant victims (60% of 407) in sexual jealousy homicides in which the offender accused her of infidelity; they were the predominant offender (71% of 72) in sexual jealousy homicides in which the victim had accused her (the offender) of infidelity. Men and boys were the predominant victims (66% of 91) in sexual jealousy homicides in which he (the victim) had accused the offender of infidelity; they were the predominant offender (65% of 390) in sexual jealousy homicides in which he had accused the victim of infidelity. This means that, whoever dies, the predominant offender in sexual jealousy homicide of a male victim is a woman, regardless of who is accusing whom. Similarly, the predominant offender in sexual jealousy homicide of a woman victim is a man, regardless of who is accusing whom.</p>
<p>This analysis found that sexual rivalry and the two types of sexual jealousy demonstrated differing relationships with several variables: whether or not the victim and offender were living together at the time of the homicide, whether or not the offender committed suicide at the scene, and whether or not the victim was killed by strangulation or suffocation. Women seem to be particularly at risk, both of becoming a homicide victim (89%) and of becoming a homicide offender (83%), when she and the person who becomes the victim or offender had formerly been living together but were not living together at the time of the homicide. This is one indication of estrangement, a risk factor cited by Margo and Martin (1993) as well as many others.</p>
<p>All 25 offenders who killed an intimate partner in a situation of sexual jealousy (regardless of who was accusing whom) and then committed suicide at the scene were men. Margo and Martin argue that in cases of sexual jealousy a man may feel that he owns his intimate partner; he may believe he cannot separate himself and his existence from her. Although she must be punished for her (perceived) infidelity, he cannot live without her. Consequently, after he kills her, he commits suicide. Research (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1088767912461142">Koziol et al., 2006</xref>) has found that a man’s suicidal thoughts or attempts are a risk factor for lethal violence in the relationship. When we see a combination of the man having suicidal thoughts with his being extremely jealous, the risk may be greater.</p>
<p>In addition, analysis of strangulation or suffocation as a cause of death seems to indicate that women who accuse the offender of sexual impropriety are significantly more likely to be strangled or suffocated. However, this finding should be confirmed in future research, since the numbers involved are very small.</p>
<p>The two types of sexual jealousy differ from each other in many ways but still share a commonality. Margo Wilson might argue that, when the offender is a man, the two types of sexual jealousy are mostly about male exclusivity, the tendency of men to demand the sole reproductive proprietorship of their woman. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1088767912461142">Daly and Wilson (1988)</xref> argue that sexual exclusivity is more salient for reproduction for men than for women. A man is faced with two exclusivity problems; first, he cannot be certain that he is the biological father of a child and, second, he cannot afford to squander resources on a child that is not his own. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1088767912461142">Daly and Wilson (1998b)</xref> called this the “Cinderella effect,” resulting in an increased risk of becoming a homicide victim for a man’s stepchildren compared to his biological children, and also an increased risk for a man’s intimate partner who has children by another man compared to a partner who does not.</p>
<p>Women are also jealous, and sometimes this jealousy can become lethal. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1088767912461142">Daly, Wilson and Weghorst (1982)</xref> argue that women’s jealousy of an intimate partner is more likely to be based on concerns about the assurance of emotional and material support, rather than on control of their partner’s sexuality. There is some evidence for this in the current study in the analysis of coresidence. Almost all of the victims in situations where the victim had formerly lived with the offender and the offender was accusing the victim of sexual impropriety were women. From Wilson and Daly’s perspective, the jealous man attempts to maintain exclusive ownership of a woman’s reproductive capacity even when they no longer live together. Very seldom does a woman do the same.</p>
<p>Male-on-male sexual rivalry homicide demonstrates a contest between men for the same woman and is by far the predominant type of sexual rivalry homicide, agreeing with Margo and Martin’s expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1088767912461142">Wilson &amp; Daly, 1993</xref>). Often, the characteristics of sexual rivalry homicides are similar to the characteristics of other homicides. Why should this be so? Margo believed that many male-on-male homicides without an overt sexual motive are motivated by an attempt to acquire resources that would attract reproductive partners. However, sexual rivalry also exists in other gender combinations: woman-on-woman (8.4% of the 774 offenders), in which two women contend for the same man, and situations in which all three of the parties are the same sex. What do these cases look like? Most of them seem to follow a pattern that is not dissimilar from man-on-man sexual rivalry homicides—an argument gets physical, and one of the parties produces a weapon. In one case a woman, age 18, recruited a girlfriend, age 22, when she went to confront the victim with the news that the victim’s boyfriend was the father of her (the 18-year-old’s) new baby. The victim was stabbed to death in the ensuing fight.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the male offender, it is fairly straightforward to see the relationship between men’s sexual proprietariness and two of the three types of homicide analyzed here. In male-on-male sexual rivalry, the predominant type, the man is competing with another man for a woman’s exclusive sexual favors. In male-on-female sexual jealousy where the man accuses the woman of sexual impropriety, the man is again attempting to keep her sexual favors for himself. This pattern is exemplified by the high percentage of women victims in homicides in which the offender was accusing her of sexual impropriety, and where victim and offender formerly lived together but were not living together at the time of the homicide.</p>
<p>However, how do sexual jealousy situations in which the victim has accused the male offender of sexual impropriety fit into Margo and Martin’s schema? Though sexual proprietariness dictates that a woman is expected to be sexually loyal to her man, there may be a sexual power and control dynamic in the relationship in which the man feels he may do as he likes while the woman does not have the power to complain. If she does complain, she places herself in jeopardy because she is challenging the power in the relationship. Thus, the man may attack and kill her not so much to defend himself against her accusation, but to re-establish power and control (see Johnson, elsewhere in this issue). This perspective is supported by the high proportion of women victims in this analysis who had accused the offender of infidelity and who were then killed by the in-your-face method of strangulation or suffocation—her attacker was extremely angry.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The distinction between sexual rivalry and sexual jealousy clarifies our understanding of what is often called, even today, “lover’s triangle” homicide. As Margo Wilson and Martin Daly insisted, the circumstances and people most at risk are different when the offender is trying to eliminate a rival or a perceived rival (“sexual rivalry”) versus when the offender is angry at his or her intimate partner because of a real or suspected infidelity (“sexual jealousy”). Gender works differently in sexual jealousy homicides versus sexual rivalry homicides. It is important, therefore, to differentiate the two in analyses, and not lump them together as lover’s triangles. Because they differ in their characteristics, we would expect that possible prevention strategies might also differ.</p>
<p>Even though in 1987 we had just begun to recognize the importance of gender differences in the risk of victimization or offending in different types of homicide, it was exactly this that so excited Margo—the potential of the CHD as a tool for the study of types of lethal violence that carry particular risks for men versus women, boys versus girls. Prior to our collaboration, the perspective of the CHD had been almost entirely gender-neutral; after our collaboration began, we looked more carefully at types of homicide that might be rare overall but that were common for women or other specific victim groups.</p>
<p>Margo Wilson’s psychological perspective augmented the legal and sociological foundations of the Chicago Homicide Dataset. Her insight led to the inclusion of variables that previously had not existed either in the CHD or in most homicide datasets, such as coresidence, sexual jealousy, sexual rivalry, and estrangement or desertion. Margo Wilson was a great colleague and a tireless collaborator in the study of the dynamics of homicide. Her insights had an indelible and hugely important effect on the Chicago Homicide Dataset. She was a friend who will be sorely missed.</p>

<p>The CHD from 1965 to 1995 has been archived in the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data. The archived CHD is available in three “perspectives”: victim level (one record per victim), offender level (one record per known offender) and case level (one record per homicide incident). The MAR narrative and all victim identifiers, including the street address, have been removed from the archived CHD. However, all the data have been geocoded to Census tract, and the geocoded information is included. See Block, Block, &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1088767912461142">Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (2005)</xref>.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-1088767912461142">
<label>2.</label>
<p>The CHD is based on information recorded by homicide detectives in the Murder Analysis Report (MAR), which stresses information that is important for police investigation. Other information, such as social class indicators, is not present in the CHD. Variables such as “mental illness” or “liquor use” are not based on medical examination, but on the detective’s judgment (although the detective may cite a diagnosis or medical examiner finding in the narrative). Although the MAR contains room for the detective to include a narrative, the information in some years is much greater than the information in other years, depending on the homicide detective and on the crush of investigatory work in that year. Also, the degree to which the MAR contains updated information varies. Thus, information about court outcomes is sporadic. When a case requires lengthy investigation, such as an arson case or a known offender who has fled the country, the MAR information is not always updated when the case is cleared.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-1088767912461142">
<label>3.</label>
<p>Cases originally coded as “lover’s triangle” in CPD data exhibit other situations in addition to “sexual rivalry” and “sexual jealousy.” These include the killing of a person (for example, a mother or a teenage son) defending someone being beaten by an intimate partner, the killing of someone caught in the crossfire of an attempt to kill an intimate partner, and the killing of someone the offender thought was standing in the way of the relationship (for example, the victim’s parents or children). These situations are now coded under other, more appropriate, categories in the CHD.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-1088767912461142">
<label>4.</label>
<p>For example, a man found his wife at home with another man, shot at the man, the wife jumped out of the window and died, while the “other man” lived. In the CHD, the primary causative factor for this victim is “sexual jealousy” and the secondary causative factor is “sexual rivalry.” For this analysis, we categorized the case under “sexual jealousy” only.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-1088767912461142">

<p>Also, a woman killed a woman in 3 cases, both male and female offenders killed a man in one case, and male and female offenders killed a woman in one case.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-1088767912461142">
<label>7.</label>
<p>A woman killed a woman in two cases, one or two men killed a man in four cases, and a woman and a man killed a man in two cases.</p></fn>

<p>Specifically, among the 816 victims killed in sexual rivalry situations, the offender’s gender was unknown in 10 (the case was not cleared). In the remaining 806, a man killed a woman in 5, a woman killed a man in 4, one to three women killed a woman in 58, and one to five men killed a man in 713. In 21 cases male and female offenders killed a man, and in 5 cases male and female offenders killed a woman.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-1088767912461142">
<label>9.</label>
<p>Two of the 91 victims were killed by both women and men offenders. Of the 56 victims killed by women, one was killed by two women. Of the 33 victims killed by men, two were killed by two men.</p></fn>

<p>These “other” categories of coresidence include the following: “sometimes, on and off” (23 victims), “living in the same group home, hotel or motel” (51), “moving in together the day of the homicide” (1), “cell mates or fellow patients” (45), “homeless, living together on the street” (4), “unsolved but probably not” (131), “victim determined to have died of natural causes” (1), “unsolved, no information about offender” (2,948), and “case solved but offender information missing” (40).</p></fn>

<label>12.</label>
<p>Suicide patterns are also instructive in situations in which the couple had formerly lived together. Of the 44 women victims with information, six of the offenders committed suicide at the scene; of the six men victims, none of the offenders committed suicide.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn13-1088767912461142">
<label>13.</label>
<p>Another 35 attempted suicide at the scene, 53 committed suicide later, and 4 were known to have attempted suicide later. In addition, 130 were killed at the scene, 42 were killed later as a result of the homicide, 77 were killed later not as a result of the homicide, 4 died of natural causes at the scene, 17 died afterwards of unrelated causes, 208 died afterwards of an unknown cause, 35 died after arrest, and 16 were offenders in a multiple-offender homicide in which one of the offenders died but the MAR does not identify the offender who died. This analysis includes only those offenders who committed suicide at the scene (the self-attack was at the scene, even though they may have died later).</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn14-1088767912461142">
<label>14.</label>
<p>Of the 275 offenders who committed suicide at the scene, 8 (2.9%) cases had missing information on offender motive; of the 28,433 offenders who did not commit suicide, 1,877 (6.6%) cases were missing motive. All of the 8 offenders missing motive information who committed suicide were men; seven of them killed a woman, three of whom were intimate partners, three “friends” and one a prostitute. Of the 1,877 offenders who did not commit suicide, gender was missing for 79 (4.2%); of the remaining 1,798, 1,738 (97%) were men: 1,534 male offenders killed one to three male victims, 175 male offenders killed one or two female victims, 53 female offenders killed one or three male victims, 6 female offenders killed a female victim, 29 male offenders killed male and female victims, and 1 female offender killed male and female victims.</p></fn>

<p>Of the 11 women, two were apparently the caretaker of her elderly mother or mother-in-law, the homicide victim; a woman being treated for mental illness “decided it was time for both of us to die” and shot her elderly mother and herself; another woman being treated for mental illness drove her car into the lake killing herself and her two children; another woman who was “apparently mentally disturbed” left a suicide note before she administered a drug overdose to her two young children and herself; one was a murder-suicide pact between two elderly women roommates, recorded by a pact left in the room (only one victim-offender appears in the CHD); a woman’s estranged husband found the bodies of her young son and herself; a woman killed her child and herself when a court order refused to allow her to move out of the country with her son; a woman shot her husband and herself after a 9-day argument; a 38-year-old woman left a suicide note and shot her 70-year-old common-law husband and herself; and a woman shot her common-law husband and herself when their families refused to allow them to get married.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn16-1088767912461142">
<label>16.</label>
<p>Of the 202, 5 had killed a woman they were sexually pursuing and 197 had killed an intimate or an ex-intimate partner. In sexual pursuit, the victim and offender have not been intimate, but one of them is pursuing the other in the hope of intimacy.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn17-1088767912461142">
<label>17.</label>
<p>For example, for a victim who was “suffocated with a pillow and stabbed in the heart,” the police investigation found that suffocation was the primary cause of death; we coded stabbing as a secondary cause of death. For a victim who was “shot, beat, stomped and stabbed,” the police investigation considered that the gunshot was the primary cause of death; we coded beating, being kicked, and stabbing as secondary causes of death. In addition to numeric codes, we recorded details of the injury in a narrative variable; for example, “V (age 16), girlfriend of O3, beaten, strangled &amp; shot four times by her boyfriend &amp; his friends, O1 &amp; O2, because V’s new boyfriend was threatening the old boyfriend.” Causes of death for this case were .32 caliber gunshot, primary; manual strangulation and beating, both secondary. Note that cause of death is not the same variable as weapon used or brandished.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn18-1088767912461142">
<label>18.</label>
<p>This includes “strangulation with an instrument” (247 victims), “manual strangulation” (568 victims), “both strangulation with an instrument and manual strangulation” (5 victims), “suffocation either manual or with an instrument” (98 victims) and “both suffocation and strangulation” (4 victims).</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn19-1088767912461142">
<label>19.</label>
<p>Note that most of the women killed in a sexual rivalry homicide were killed by women offenders. This probably explains the low rate of strangulation (1.5%) for these homicides.</p></fn>
