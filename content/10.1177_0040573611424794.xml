<abstract>
<p>When the Pentecostal movement emerged at the beginning of the twentieth century, its emphasis on the restoration of apostolic Christianity, including Spirit-inspired prophecy, provided a rationale for women ministers. Yet this position did not change the common belief that women and men are ontologically different, and thus have different ministerial functions. This article uses the testimony of a female evangelist in the Church of God to explore these positions and the particular ways the Church of God discussed women ministers.</p>

<p>In May 1910, the newly established <italic>Evening Light and Church of God Evangel</italic> published the testimony of Evangelist Ella Simmons. Writing from Boyett, Florida, Simmons reported to her readers, “The second day of July, 1907, I received my Pentecostal baptism, the blessed Holy Ghost, the Comforter that Jesus said he would send, with the Bible evidence of speaking in other tongues as the Sprit gave utterance.” She continued,
<disp-quote>
<p>When I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost I saw the lost of this world in their sinful condition without God; and Jesus said to me, “Will you tell them about Me and My power to save?” I told Him I would. Since that time, I have done the best I could, with the opportunities that I have had. Sometimes I look on the world of sin, and see so many going down, I just want to rush and tell them of Jesus, His great love and power to save.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573611424794">1</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Simmons’s testimony serves as a lens through which we can understand much about the historical and theological development of the role of women in the Pentecostal movement. Her report vividly describes a commitment to ministry while also acknowledging certain limitations that existed then and continue to exist for Pentecostal women clergy. Now one of the largest Christian movements in the world, Pentecostalism has benefited from a dynamic spirituality that emphasizes the inclusion of all people in mission. Yet the movement’s reading of the biblical texts has also generated tension regarding the ontological place of female participants. Such tension was particularly present in the Church of God, which granted an evangelist’s license to Simmons. The Church of God encouraged women to preach and prophesy and the pages of its publications are filled with arguments in favor of women preaching. At the same time, the denomination’s reading of Scripture fostered a particular understanding of women and ministry that served both to empower and limit women ministers.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0040573611424794"><title>“I Received My Pentecostal Baptism”</title>
<p>By the time of Simmons’s Spirit baptism experience in 1907, the Pentecostal Movement was spreading quickly throughout the United States and beyond. From 1901, holiness evangelist Charles Fox Parham had promulgated the doctrine that God was restoring apostolic Christianity as revealed in the biblical events of Acts 2. Central to this restoration was a Spirit baptism experience subsequent to sanctification and with the accompanying sign of speaking in tongues. Although Pentecostalism later modified Parham’s theology in some important ways, he taught that speaking in tongues was the supernatural impartation of unlearned human languages for the purpose of reaching the whole world with the gospel of Jesus Christ in the “last days.” When Parham’s disciple William J. Seymour preached this doctrine in Los Angles in 1906, pilgrims to the resulting three-year revival at 312 Azusa Street spread this teaching so quickly that a new Christian movement emerged. New denominations formed and numerous existing denominations adopted the new theology. Although there is evidence of speaking in tongues in other times and places in Christian history, the revival at the Azusa Street Mission is considered the beginning of the Pentecostal Movement.</p>
<p>The Church of God, with international offices in Cleveland, Tennessee, was one of the existing denominations swept into the Pentecostal movement. The denomination began in 1886 in southeast Tennessee among Baptists protesting the exclusive ecclesiology of the Landmark Movement. R.G. Spurling, his father Richard, and others rejected the adherence to human creeds as a means of determining God’s church. They formed the Christian Union as an effort to restore God’s church on the basis of the New Testament and “the law of Love.” Ten years later, many along the border of southeast Tennessee and southwest North Carolina adopted the holiness doctrine of sanctification and some began speaking in tongues. The denomination adopted the name “Church of God” in 1907 and was fully implanted in the Pentecostal movement by 1908.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040573611424794"><title>“I Just Want to Rush and Tell Them”</title>
<p>At the heart of Ella Simmons’s testimony was the sense of urgency she felt as she “saw the lost” and desired to “rush and tell them of Jesus.” Foundational to arguments for women ministers among early Pentecostals was their experience of a Spirit-inspired urgency to preach the gospel because Jesus’ return to earth was imminent. Pentecostals located their experiences in the biblical narrative of Acts 2, which included daughters as well as sons prophesying, and handmaidens as well as servants being recipients of the Spirit in the last days. General Overseer A.J. Tomlinson proclaimed in his book, <italic>The Last Great Conflict</italic>,
<disp-quote>
<p>The world must be evangelized … We must not shift this responsibility to a future generation as all other generations have done. There is enough latent power now in men and women, if brought into use, to evangelize this world in five years and usher in the coming of our King … Oh for a million men and women to burst forth, with such holy ambition, with every unused power in full use, like mad-men to strike terror and fear to all the halfhearted religionists of the day!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040573611424794">2</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This theology of the “last days” was often expressed in the biblical terminology of the “latter rain” and “evening light.” D. Wesley Myland offered a detailed presentation of the “latter rain” apology in his <italic>The Latter Rain Covenant and Pentecostal Power</italic>. Myland argued that just as Israel experienced an early rain for planting and a latter rain for harvesting, Christ’s church experienced an early rain on the day of Pentecost and was experiencing a latter rain at the dawn of the twentieth century. Using the natural to illustrate the spiritual, Myland developed a chart depicting a corresponding increase in rainfall in Palestine with the growth of the Pentecostal movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040573611424794">3</xref></sup> The biblical references of “evening light” were particularly prominent in the Church of God. Although later shortened to <italic>Church of God Evangel</italic>, the original name of the denomination’s journal was <italic>The Evening Light and Church of God Evangel</italic>. In the lead article of the inaugural issue, editor Tomlinson explained the publication’s name using Zech 14:6–7, “And it shall come to pass in that day, that light shall not be clear nor dark … But is shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light.” According to Tomlinson, the world was in the evening of the gospel age, and the new Pentecostal movement was that evening light sent by God to illuminate the final harvest. Just as the New Testament church was given the Holy Spirit in order to plant the gospel, the twentieth-century church had the evening light to reap the final harvest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040573611424794">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scholars such as Grant Wacker have suggested that this interpretation of human history was compelling to Pentecostals because of events such as an increase in the number of Jews returning to Palestine and natural calamities like the San Francisco earthquake in 1906. Even more important in the thinking of Pentecostals was the increase in spiritual manifestations such as healings, speaking in tongues, and prophecies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040573611424794">5</xref></sup> Chief among these was the perceived restoration of Spirit baptism accompanied by speaking in tongues.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0040573611424794"><title>“Will You Tell Them?”</title>
<p>Simmons’s report that Jesus directly asked her, “Will you tell them about Me and My power to save?” was not unique nor original among Pentecostals. Their belief in the shortness of time, their emphasis on the biblical narrative in Acts 2, and their receptivity of women preaching the gospel was already well established in the nineteenth-century holiness movement. Yet these beliefs were heightened with the addition of speaking in tongues as a physical sign of Spirit baptism. Parham founded his Bethel Bible College “to fit men and women to go to the ends of the earth to preach,” he commissioned women to minister, he included women in his evangelistic campaigns, and he sometimes left women to pastor the congregations that his Apostolic Faith ministry planted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040573611424794">6</xref></sup> Agnes N. Ozman, the first recorded person to speak in tongues at Parham’s school in Kansas had enrolled as an evangelist and would-be missionary. Women were also active in the ministries of the Azusa Street Mission. Issues of <italic>The Apostolic Faith</italic> [Los Angeles] reported women serving as workers (helpers), evangelists, pastors, and missionaries. Seven of the twelve-member committee that examined ministers for credentials at the Azusa Mission were women.</p>
<p>As within the broader Pentecostal movement, women’s roles were very diverse in the Church of God, and Ella Simmons would have heard testimonies from other women of the call of God to preach the gospel. The denomination’s founder R.G. Spurling likely issued ministerial credentials to women, the second General Assembly in 1907 made “special mention” of “important positions occupied by women in the time of Christ and his apostles,” the third General Assembly in 1908 agreed to recognized deaconesses, and the fourth Assembly in 1909 decided to supply a license to “women who engage in the ministry of the Word.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040573611424794">7</xref></sup> This action made it possible for Tomlinson to issue an “Evangelist License or Certificate” to Ella Simmons on May 30, 1909.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040573611424794">8</xref></sup> Numerous women responded to the opportunity to be credentialed, and by 1914 women comprised 14 percent of the denomination’s clergy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040573611424794">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Women with an evangelist’s license served the Church of God in many capacities including as workers (or helpers of other ministers), deaconesses, evangelists, assistant pastors, pastors, exhorters, music ministers, educational ministers, teachers, editors and missionaries. Although the preference was for pastors to be men, a shortage of male clergy made it necessary to appoint women as pastors of some congregations. This was especially true when a congregation developed out of a female evangelist’s ministry, and she remained to continue as pastor. As an example, Lula Jones received her evangelist’s credentials in 1916. By the time of her application for disability in 1942 she had served as pastor of nine congregations and was responsible for the foundational work of nine others. She also served as supply pastor to several congregations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040573611424794">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Not only did women serve as ministers, but they also helped train ministers. Nora Chambers and Avis Swiger were the best-known examples of such women. Chambers was the first teacher at the Church of God Bible Training School (now Lee University), which was established in 1918. Avis Swiger taught at the college from 1933 to 1974. She taught almost all of the courses in the Bible School but most frequently taught homiletics, personal evangelism, and missions. In the classroom and by example she was one of the primary shapers of Church of God clergy during her teaching ministry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040573611424794">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to ministering in the United States, women served around the world as missionaries. Although most early missionaries went without formal appointment, denominational periodicals reported their activities and urged readers to send support. Floridian Rebecca Barr accompanied her Bahamian husband Edmond to the Bahamas in November 1909, and <italic>The Evening Light and Church of God Evangel</italic> frequently reported her ministerial activities. Among others the denomination also supported Sarah A. Smith and Lillian Trasher in Egypt, Jennie B. Rushin in China, Lucy M. Leatherman in Latin America, Maria Atkinson in Mexico, and Margaret Gaines in Tunisia and Palestine—to name just a few.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040573611424794">12</xref></sup></p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040573611424794"><title>“The Opportunities That I Have Had”</title>
<p>While many women were active in ministry alongside Simmons, her testimony indicates recognition that her opportunities were limited. Although we know very little about her particular circumstances and what specific limitations she experienced, we do know that women clergy in the Pentecostal movement including the Church of God did not have the same opportunities as men. Women frequently were encouraged to preach, but the Pentecostal reading of Scripture also circumscribed women’s rights and responsibilities as ministers of the gospel.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0040573611424794"><title>“Bible Evidence”</title>
<p>Simmons’s reference to the “Bible evidence” of Spirit baptism points to a style of biblical hermeneutics common to Pentecostals. One key element was the restorationist conviction that because they were experiencing the latter rain, they should also expect the same spiritual manifestations as existed among the apostles and recorded in the Bible. They observed that the act of speaking in tongues was present on the day of Pentecost as well as some other occasions when the biblical writers described the imparting of the Holy Spirit. Even those occasions that did not specifically mention tongues seemed to include unusual spiritual manifestations. Therefore, Pentecostals determined that one should expect speaking in tongues to accompany the baptism of the Holy Spirit just as it occurred in the biblical record. Further, they concluded that the spiritual manifestations they were experiencing must be the same as those described in the biblical record.</p>
<p>This hermeneutic is particularly evident in the most prominent narrative of Church of God history. Although there is no contemporaneous record of the events, popular Church of God history includes about one hundred people speaking in tongues in the North Carolina community of Camp Creek following an 1896 revival of holiness in that community’s Shearer Schoolhouse. Church of God Historian Charles Conn surmised how those in the isolated mountain community must have come to understand their experience of speaking in tongues. He wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>How long it was before realization of what had happened came to the group is not certain … Searching of the Scriptures revealed to the exhilarated group that the disciples on the day of Pentecost had spoken in tongues; the household of Cornelius had spoken in tongues; and the believers in Ephesus had spoken in tongues. In each instance those exercised with the phenomenon were said to have received the Holy Ghost.</p></disp-quote>Conn concluded, “So parallel were the Biblical accounts to the experience of these people that recognition of what had happened became crystal clear. A new outpouring of the Holy Ghost had occurred upon the earth.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040573611424794">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>This approach to the biblical text influenced both opportunities and limitations for women. While the Church of God saw that God was calling and using women in ministry, the fourth General Assembly acknowledged what they considered to be a problem in their practice of approving ministers. The previous Assembly in 1908 had recognized women deacons. But the fourth Assembly in 1909 considered ordination necessary to serve in the diaconate ministry, and delegates could not find an example in the New Testament of the ordination of a woman. Desiring for their practice to be in line with their reading of the New Testament, delegates advised
<disp-quote>
<p>for the present, that the wives of the deacons be considered and appointed deaconesses by virtue of the position and ordination of their husbands. The Assembly advises further that women who engage in the ministry of the Word be acknowledged by the church and supplied with a certificate of license showing the date of appointment and by what church.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040573611424794">14</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>This decision sanctioned the practice of women preaching, but it also limited possibilities for women. The exclusion of women from “ordination” remained in place until 2000 when the International General Assembly agreed to use the title “ordained minister” for women. This change was made in order to secure the rights of women ministers in situations where use of the word “ordination” was necessary to practice as a minister including the military chaplaincy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040573611424794">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The 1909 decision prohibiting ordination resulted in the exclusion of women from the sacerdotal functions of ministry. The Church of God understood that only ordained clergy could preside over the Lord’s Supper, water baptisms, marriages and other “priestly” ministerial duties. A review of extant copies of ministerial credentials shows that the same evangelist’s certificate was issued to both men and women between 1909 and 1914. This certificate included language granting the authority “to publish, preach and defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to baptize, to administer the Lord’s Supper and the washing of the Saints feet.” Although one must be cautious in arguing from silence, I do not know of any reports of Church of God women performing water baptisms, administering communion, or officiating at weddings during this period of time, however. Some extant copies of the licenses of female evangelists reveal various authorities crossed out, indicating that the bearer did not have those authorities. By 1914, the denomination solved this problem by developing differing forms of the evangelist’s certificate for men and women. The license for men remained the same, while the new women’s certificate granted the bearer the authority to “publish, preach, and defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ; and do all the work that may devolve on her as a prophetess or female minister of the Gospel.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040573611424794">16</xref></sup> Although the denomination modified the language of the license on occasion, the Church of God continued to use distinct credentials for men and women until 1990 when the General Assembly reversed its position and granted women the same authorities as their male counterparts at the “licensed” level of ministry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040573611424794">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even with these limitations, Pentecostals were frequently criticized for allowing women clergy. Detractors contended that the Bible specifically forbade women to preach in 1 Cor 14:34–35 and 1 Tim 2:11–15. These criticisms provided opportunities for Pentecostals to articulate their understanding of ministry and of gender differences.</p>
<p>Perhaps the earliest published defense of women ministers in the Church of God came from R.M. Evans in 1910. Evans was a missionary to the Bahamas who wrote a letter to the editor of the Nassau <italic>Tribune</italic> in defense of women ministers. Tomlinson then reprinted the letter in the <italic>Evening Light and Church of God Evangel</italic> along with a comment that the teaching was good for the United States as well. Evans was replying to criticism that the Church of God ignored Paul’s admonition for women to keep silent in the church in 1 Cor 14:34. In his response, Evans suggested that in 1 Cor 14 and 1 Tim 2:11–12, Paul was attempting “to restrain coarse females from using authority, and pressing into undue display.” He then referred to Joel’s prophecy (Joel 2:28–29) and Peter’s affirmation that the Spirit poured out on all flesh will result in daughters prophesying (Acts 2:17). Evans also called attention to New Testament references to women such as Phillip’s prophesying daughters (Acts 21:9), Paul’s instructions for women to pray and prophesy with their heads covered (1 Cor 11:5), Paul’s commendation of Phoebe (Rom 16:1), and Paul’s mention of Priscilla as a helper along with other women who labored with him (Phil 4:3). For help in harmonizing these biblical texts, Evans, a former Methodist minister, turned to John Wesley whom he stated understood the 1 Cor 14 as saying, “‘Unless they are under an extraordinary impulse of the Spirit,’ they are not permitted to teach in public assemblies.” Evans assured readers that the Church of God did not ordain women or allow them to have a role in church business, “but when God puts His Spirit upon them for His glory, we dare not presumptuously put our hands upon the Ark, or throttle the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040573611424794">18</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0040573611424794"><title>“As the Spirit Gave Utterance”</title>
<p>Evans’s reference to “an extraordinary impulse of the Spirit” reveals how the Church of God navigated between the advancement of women in ministry and their stated adherence to the Pauline limitations. The fact that Pentecostals focused on the “last days” restoration of Spirit baptism as the primary rationale for women in ministry cannot be over-emphasized. Ella Simmons’s affirmation that she spoke in tongues “as the Spirit gave utterance” was a common appropriation of the Acts 2:4 account, “And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance” (<sc>kjv</sc>). For many Pentecostals, speaking in tongues along with the exercise of some other spiritual gifts was a manifestation of the Holy Spirit in the individual rather than a demonstration of one’s personal volition and abilities. The <italic>Houston Chronicle</italic> reported Parham’s description of speaking in tongues: “He says he knows not the language he speaks while he is addressing his audience, but he is as if he were not and knew not, being merely an instrument in other hands, and his body and vocal organs working under the dictation of an inspiration.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0040573611424794">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>This inspiration and control by the Holy Spirit allowed Pentecostals to ignore traditional qualifications for ministry such as education, gender, and age. Instead of these traditional qualifications, they placed the authority for ministry in the manifestation of the Holy Spirit rather than in their personal authority and abilities. Women could be licensed to perform the work of an evangelist, without imputing to them the authority of an office. One article in William Seymour’s periodical, <italic>The Apostolic Faith</italic>, illustrates this point. The author referenced Joel’s statement about daughters prophesying and affirmed, “It is the privilege of all members of the bride of Christ to prophesy, which means testify or preach.” The unknown author continued,
<disp-quote>
<p>Before Pentecost, the woman could only go into the “court of women” and not into the inner court. The anointing oil was never poured on a woman’s head, but only on the heads of kings, prophets and priests. But when our Lord poured out Pentecost, He brought all those faithful women with the other disciples into the upper room … All the women received the anointed oil of the Holy Ghost and were able to preach the same as men.</p></disp-quote>Yet along with this affirmation also came an assertion of ontological difference. The article concluded, “The woman is the weaker vessel and represents the tenderness of Christ, while the man represents the firmness of Christ … No woman that has the Spirit of Jesus wants to usurp authority over the man.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0040573611424794">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>By 1910, Tomlinson furthered the discussion by proposing a definition of “church” that permitted women to preach while at the same time honoring the Pauline admonition for women to keep silent in the churches. In making his case, Tomlinson turned to the example of the council of apostles meeting in Jerusalem described in Acts 15. He suggested that the biblical text reveals that no women were present in the council. Thus, just as the lack of an example of female ordination in the New Testament set precedence for not ordaining women, so too did the lack of women at the Jerusalem council set precedence. Tomlinson further argued that biblical occurrences of the word “church” referred to governmental functions. Therefore, the command for women to keep silent in the churches was a specific command for women to refrain from participation in church government. He summarized, “Church then means government. Christ’s government. His Church. Here then is where women are to keep silence. 1 Cor 14:34.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0040573611424794">21</xref></sup> Arguing for the ministry of women five years later, Tomlinson insisted, “Let the good sisters feel at perfect liberty to preach the gospel, pray for the sick or well, testify, exhort, etc., but humbly hold themselves aloof from taking charge of the governmental affairs.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0040573611424794">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Tomlinson’s exclusion of women from any area of congregational or denominational life related to church government held for many years in the Church of God, but has been reversed in some significant aspects. Most importantly, in 1992 the denomination granted voice and vote to women in General Assembly business sessions. Still, women’s participation in certain areas of church government remains controversial. At the 2010 International General Assembly, the prohibition of women serving on a local church and pastor’s council was overturned by a narrow vote of 51 to 49 percent of delegates after very heated debate.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0040573611424794" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>When Ella Simmons received Spirit baptism in 1907, she joined the many Pentecostal women who were at work prophesying about the imminent return of Jesus. Like others she sought and received credentials as an evangelist in the Church of God. Although those credentials authorized her to preach, they did not grant her full equality with male ministers in the denomination. Like most other Pentecostal denominations, the Church of God taught that women are ontologically different from men and as such can be used by the Holy Spirit to perform Spirit-inspired ministry but cannot fill governmental offices in the church. Now more than one hundred years later, the Church of God continues to struggle with how to reconcile a lack of agreement on the interpretation of some biblical texts and the testimonies of daughters who claim “Jesus said to me, ‘Will you tell them about Me and My power to save?’” With these ongoing tensions, the role of women ministers in the Church of God will likely be debated for many years to come.</p></sec>
