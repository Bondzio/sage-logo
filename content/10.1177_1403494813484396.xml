<abstract>
<p><italic>Aims</italic>: To analyse whether transitions between care settings differ between municipalities in the last 2 years of life among older people in Finland. <italic>Methods</italic>: Data were derived from Finnish national registers, and include all those who died in 2002 and 2003 at the age of 70 or older except those living in very small municipalities (<italic>n</italic>=67,027). Data include admissions and discharges from health and social care facilities (university hospitals, general hospitals, health centres, residential care facilities) and time spent outside care facilities for 730 days prior to death. Three-level negative binomial regression analyses were performed to study the effect of municipal factors on (1) the total number of all care transitions, (2) the number of transitions between home and different care facilities, and (3) transitions between different care facilities. <italic>Results</italic>: The municipality of residence had only a minor effect on the total number of care transitions, but greater variation between municipalities was found when different types of care transition were examined separately. Largest differences were found in care transitions involving specialised care. Age structure, urbanity, and economic situation of the municipality had an impact on several different care transitions. <bold><italic>Conclusion</italic>: The total number of care transitions in 2 final years of life was approximately similar irrespective of the municipality of residence, but the findings imply differences in transitioning specialised care. Potentially, this may suggest inequality between the municipalities, but more detailed studies are needed to confirm the factors underlying these differences.</bold></p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>People use more care services at the end of life than in earlier phases of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813484396">1</xref>]. They also make more transitions between care facilities, or between care facilities and home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813484396">2</xref>]. In Finland at least, the pathways of care, i.e. the care facilities to which older people move and the frequency of transitions in the last 2 years of life, vary between older individuals. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813484396">3</xref>]. Individual characteristics such as age, gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813484396">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813484396">4</xref>], and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813484396">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813484396"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813484396">7</xref>] have an impact on care transitions. If individual health needs are expected to determine admissions to and discharges from care and also to determine the appropriate care facility, the role of municipality factors in such transitions should be minor. Hence research on transitions between care settings can also help to clarify whether health and social services are appropriate and equally accessible to all. From an individual perspective care transitions between home and different care facilities may adversely impact the continuum and outcome of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813484396">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813484396"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813484396">10</xref>], and therefore it is important to study the factors affecting these transitions.</p>
<p>It is plausible that regional characteristics affect care transitions. In Finland the municipalities enjoy significant autonomy over the planning and organisation of health and social services for local residents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813484396">11</xref>], and therefore the availability and use of these services vary across municipalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813484396">12</xref>]. Municipalities are responsible for providing health and social services to residents but they may do so together with other municipalities or may purchase services from NGOs, private companies, or other municipalities. Public primary health care is provided by municipal health centres, which offer both outpatient and inpatient care. Finland is divided into 20 hospital districts, and every municipality is assigned to one hospital district. Each hospital district has a central hospital that offers specialised secondary care to the district residents. In addition there may also be district and private hospitals, depending on the size of the hospital district. Five of the central hospitals are university hospitals which are located in the country’s largest cities. As well as offering secondary care to the residents of their own hospital district, they provide advanced tertiary care to several hospital districts. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813484396">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813484396">13</xref>]. Institutional long-term care including nursing homes and other residential care facilities is provided by municipal social care services, as well as by private facilities. Long-term care facilities also provide short-term respite care for older people who live permanently in their own home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813484396">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813484396">14</xref>].</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to ascertain to what extent care transitions differ between municipalities in last 2 years of life among older people in Finland. The reason we chose to focus on the last 2 years of life was that our previous study implied that among older people, the use of care, and long-term care in particular, begins to increase 2 years before death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813484396">15</xref>]. Thus our focus is not restricted to the very final stages of life but we consider a longer period of time that is still characterised by a higher need for services. In more detail, we will investigate to what extent: (1) the number of transitions in the last 2 years of life varies between municipalities; and (2) municipal and hospital district factors affect the number of transitions between care facilities, or between care facilities and home.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>This study is based on register data which include individual information on the use of health and social services in the whole country of Finland. The study is part of a research project entitled New Dynamics of Longevity and the Changing Needs for Services (COCTEL II). The study sample was identified from the Causes of Death Register (Statistics Finland) and was linked with data from the Care Register for Health Care and the Care Register for Social Welfare (National Institute for Health and Welfare) using unique personal identity codes. The study population consists of all persons who died in Finland in 2002–03 at the age of 70 or older. The municipal level information was collected from the SOTKAnet database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813484396">16</xref>]. Following a succession of municipal mergers, the number of municipalities in Finland fell from 448 in 2002 to 416 in 2007. For the purposes of this study we have used the municipality numbers valid at the beginning of 2007 and coded individuals accordingly. The Åland Islands (16 municipalities) and municipalities with 2500 inhabitants or less were excluded because of the small numbers of annual deaths and because of the risk of individuals being identified from the data. Altogether 315 municipalities are included in our analyses covering 95% of persons aged 70 or over who died in Finland in 2002 and 2003 (<italic>n</italic>=67,027). Their use of services and moving between different care settings was monitored retrospectively for 730 days prior to death.</p>
<p>Data include figures for the use of hospitals providing specialised medical care (university hospitals and general hospitals including central, district, and private hospitals) and primary health care services (inpatient wards in public health centres), both private and public residential care facilities providing long-term care (inpatient wards in nursing homes and sheltered accommodation with 24-hour assistance). These data allowed us to monitor admissions to and discharges from health or social care facilities, the duration of stays and periods of time spent outside care facilities. In this study, transition refers to a situation where a person physically moves from one care facility to another, or to or from his/her own home, and stays there at least one night. Outpatient care or moving between wards in the same care facility are not included here as care transitions. The ethics committee of the Pirkanmaa hospital district raised no objections to the study. All registry data were handled in conformity with the principles of ethical research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494813484396">
<title>Outcome variables</title>
<p>The outcome variables are (1) the total number of transitions (all care transitions between any care settings, including own home), (2) the number of transitions between own home and different care facilities, and (3) transitions between different care facilities, in the last 2 years of life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494813484396">
<title>Explanatory variables</title>
<p>The models include explanatory variables at three levels. Individual level (level I) factors include age, gender, and diagnoses. The municipal level (level II) includes factors describing the population in the municipality (proportion of inhabitants ≥65 years, proportion of those aged ≥75 living alone, and the total number of inhabitants), factors describing municipal finances (annual contribution margin, tax revenue, health and social care expenditure, and urbanity) and the proportion of people receiving financial support for informal care. These factors describe the situation in 2003. The hospital district level (level III) has one factor, i.e. the existence of a university hospital in the hospital district. The explanatory variables and data sources are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813484396">Table I</xref>.</p>

<title>Modelling strategy</title>
<p>The data have a hierarchical structure: individuals (level I) who live in municipalities (level II) which are nested in different hospital districts (level III) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494813484396">17</xref>]. All outcome variables are strongly skewed continuous variables and display overdispersion (variance exceeds the mean). Therefore, negative binomial regression analysis was used in multilevel modelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494813484396">18</xref>]. The number of different care transitions was analysed in random intercept models adding the variables listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813484396">Table I</xref> sequentially to the models as explanatory variables. Three-level analyses, estimated with second-order penalised quasi-likelihood (PQL), were performed to study the significance of explanatory variables at each level and unexplained variances in levels II and III: (1) Null model (intercept only model); (2) Model 1: municipal level factors; (3) Model 2: model 1 + hospital district level factors; and (4) Final model: model 2 + individual level factors.</p>
<p>To describe the unexplained variation at municipal level (level II, variance between municipalities in the same hospital district) and at hospital district level (level III, variance between hospital districts) in the null model and after the inclusion of different explanatory factors in the models, we represent the random-effects parameters separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494813484396">19</xref>]. Median rate ratios (MRRs) are also represented to clarify the interpretation of variations. MRR gives the total variance between all municipalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813484396">20</xref>]. MRR was calculated as exp(0.954*√(σ<sup>2</sup><sub>hd</sub> + σ<sup>2</sup><sub>m</sub>)) where hd=hospital district, m=municipality. It is equivalent to the median odds ratio and, as such, is the median of the rate ratios between two randomly chosen individuals with identical characteristics taken from two different randomly chosen areas; it is the median of all possible pairwise comparisons between municipalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494813484396">20</xref>]. MRR value 1 indicates no variation and a high MRR value large variation between areas. Here it describes the increased relative risk of having more transitions in a municipality with high number of care transitions compared to a municipality with low number of care transitions. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494813484396">21</xref>].</p>
<p>First, the outcome variable in the fixed part of the analyses was the total number of care transitions. Then, in order to investigate which types of care transitions are influenced by municipality of residence, different types of care transitions were analysed separately. Since the main interest in this research is the effect of municipal factors, these were the first to be included in the models after the null model. Level II and III fixed-part parameter estimates were transformed into rate ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494813484396">17</xref>]. Individual-level results are represented only in the model concerning the total number of transitions in the last 2 years; other individual-level results are discussed in the text. The multilevel package MLwiN 2.19 was used.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Out of all individuals, 83.6% had one or more care transitions during the last 2 years of life. The median was 5 (quartiles 2, 11) and mean±SD was 7.7±8.6. The mean number of all transitions per municipality varied from 5.17 to 15.4, the mean of all municipality means was 8.3±1.7 and the median was 8.1 (quartiles 7.2, 9.3). The frequency of care transitions increased with the increasing proximity to death: from 24 to 13 months before death 51% had at least one transition and during the last 3 months of life 67% had at least one transition.</p>
<p>The most frequent transitions between home and a care facility were moves from home to a health centre (48% had at least one such transition), to general hospital (39%), to university hospital (21%), to residential care (16%); and own home from health centre (43%), from general hospital (25%), from university hospital (12%), from residential care (19%). Upon closer examination of different types of transitions between own home and care facilities, the highest mean at the individual level was recorded for transitions from own home to health centre (1.35±2.67) and the lowest for transitions from university hospital to own home (0.29±1.11). At the municipal level, the highest mean (from own home to health centre 1.58) and the lowest mean (university hospital to own home 0.22) were almost the same as at the individual level.</p>
<p>The most frequent transitions between different care facilities were moves to a health centre from a general hospital (26%), from a university hospital (13%), and from residential care (14%), from a health centre to a general hospital (13%), to a university hospital (6%), and to residential care (17%). Altogether, 6% moved from a general hospital to residential care and 8% from residential care to a general hospital. Among different types of transitions between care facilities, the highest mean at the individual level was recorded for transitions from a general hospital to a health centre (0.40±0.82), and the lowest for transitions from a health centre to a university hospital (0.07±0.34). At the municipal level, the highest mean (from a general hospital to a health centre 0.49) and the lowest mean (from a health centre to a university hospital 0.08) were again almost the same as at the individual level.</p>

<title>Variation in care transitions at municipal level and hospital district level</title>
<p>The MMR of 1.16 in the null model suggests that the municipality of residence had only a minor impact on the total number of care transitions in the last 2 years of life even before any explanatory variables were added to the models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813484396">Table II</xref>). In the final model which included municipal, hospital district, and individual explanatory variables, the MMR decreased to 1.13, indicating a very small effect of municipality of residence on the total number of transitions.</p>

<p>Greater variation was observed between municipalities when different types of care transitions were examined separately. In transitions involving a general hospital, MMRs were high and varied between 2.51 and 4.08 in null models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813484396">Table II</xref>). In transitions between a general hospital and own home, a general hospital, and a health centre, and also between a general hospital and residential care, the highest variation was seen at the municipal level, indicating variation between municipalities in the same hospital district. The inclusion of hospital district or individual level factors acted to decrease the municipal variance only slightly, or not at all. Thus, the variance in transitions involving a general hospital was not explained by the availability of a university hospital.</p>
<p>The MMRs were also high, varying between 3.85 and 7.42 in null models in transitions between own home and a university hospital and between a university hospital and a health centre. However, the very high variance existed at the hospital district level, not at the municipal level, and after the hospital district level factor was included the MMRs decreased notably. However, municipal level variances decreased only slightly, if at all, after all explanatory variables were included in models.</p>
<p>The lowest MMRs were recorded for transitions between own home and a health centre, between own home and residential care facilities and between a health centre and residential care facilities, varying between 1.82 and 2.07 in null models. The variances were higher at the municipal level than at the hospital district level, and municipality variances fell only slightly after all explanatory variables were included in the models.</p>

<title>Effect of municipality factors on the total number of transitions between care settings, and between care settings and own home</title>
<p>When all municipality, hospital district and individual factors were included in models 1–3, the municipality factors emerging as statistically significant were urbanity, annual contribution margin and support for informal care (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494813484396">Table III</xref>). Living in semi-urban areas increased the number of care transitions (RR 1.09) compared to urban areas. A positive annual contribution margin in the municipality increased the number of transitions (RR 1.06) when compared to municipalities with a negative annual contribution margin. Increased support for informal care in the municipality brought a slight increase in the number of transitions (RR 1.02).</p>

<p>Municipalities with a higher proportion of persons aged 65 or over showed an increased number of transitions between own home and a health centre and own home and a general hospital, but a reduced number of transitions between own home and a university hospital (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1403494813484396">Table IV</xref>). As regards transitions between different care facilities, a higher proportion of older people in the municipality increased the number of transitions between a health centre and a general hospital, and between a general hospital and residential care, and decreased the number of transitions between a university hospital and a health centre (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1403494813484396">Table V</xref>).</p>

<p>Living in a semi-urban instead of an urban area and living in a municipality with a positive annual contribution margin served to increase the number of transitions between own home and a health centre. Living in a semi-urban area increased the number of moves from a health centre to a university hospital. Municipalities where more than half of the residents over 75 lived alone had a lower number of transitions from residential care to a general hospital. An increase in the proportion of people receiving support for informal care also increased the number of transitions between a health centre and residential care.</p>
<p>Almost all individual factors at level I and level III factors had a statistically significant effect on the number of transitions. Being female and 80 years or older increased transitions between own home and a health centre, own home and residential care, a health centre and residential care, and residential care and a general hospital. Almost all diagnoses increased the probability of all transitions. A dementia diagnosis decreased the likelihood of moving between own home and a general hospital or university hospital, and between a health centre and a general hospital or university hospital. Also, having a stroke decreased the number of moves from a general or university hospital to own home. The existence of a university hospital in the hospital district (level III) greatly increased the number of transitions between own home and the university hospital and between the university hospital and a health centre, while the number of transitions from and to general hospital decreased.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study showed that municipality of residence had only a minor impact on the total number of all care transitions, as indicated by the low MRRs of care transitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494813484396">21</xref>]. However, municipality of residence did have a distinct impact on certain types of transitions.</p>
<p>Differences between municipalities were greatest in care transitions involving hospitals providing specialised care. The variance in transitions to or from university hospital was mainly explained by the hospital district level factor: if there was a university hospital in the hospital district, that increased the number of transitions involving the university hospital. This is due to the double role of university hospitals in Finland. For the municipalities in which they are located and those nearby, the university hospital often also serves as a central hospital and provides secondary care. Unfortunately we have no data to make a distinction between secondary and tertiary care needs and therefore we do not know whether transitions to tertiary care vary between municipalities. However, after the inclusion of the hospital district factor in the model there still remains some unexplained municipal variation, especially in transitions between the university hospital and a health centre. The importance of the local service supply was again demonstrated by the low variances in transitions between own home and a health centre, own home and residential care, and a health centre and residential care. Health centres and residential care facilities are widely available care services in all municipalities, and in small municipalities health centres are the only local facilities offering health care.</p>
<p>The greatest variation between municipalities was observed for transitions involving general hospital; transitions between a general hospital and own home, between a general hospital and a health centre, and between a general hospital and residential care. These findings suggest that differences between municipalities within the same hospital district differ in the frequency of admissions of older people to specialised secondary care, either from own home or from some other care facility. The inclusion of explanatory factors in the models, even access to a university hospital, did not decrease the high unexplained variances. This is probably due in part to municipal differences in care organisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813484396">12</xref>] and practices; the underlying factors are often historical and based on local policies rather than rigorous analysis of needs. The capability to provide advanced outpatient or inpatient care may vary between general hospitals. The adequacy of home care and rehabilitation may also affect discharge practices and the decision whether people are discharged to their own homes or to another care facility. Local diagnostic practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494813484396">22</xref>] and factors related to physicians’ decision making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494813484396">23</xref>] in different areas have been found to have an effect on care use, and it is possible that these factors vary between municipalities, thereby influencing the frequency of admissions and discharge practices.</p>
<p>Finnish municipalities can be roughly divided into two categories, i.e. urban areas with a growing working age population, and more rural areas with fewer people of working age and with stagnating tax revenue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813484396">12</xref>]. An older age structure was reflected in most types of transitions: it increased the number of almost all types of transitions, but decreased transitions involving university hospitals located in five of the most urban municipalities. In Finland, official policy has preferred home care to institutionalisation in old age, at least during the past decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494813484396">24</xref>], and has recommended the reallocation of resources from institutional care to outpatient care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813484396">11</xref>]. It is possible, although it cannot be confirmed here, that limited health and social service supply in municipalities with an older age structure may put pressure on hospitals to discharge people too early which may lead to readmissions. As for the other municipality level factors, a positive annual contribution margin suggests a better financial situation in the municipality, which may serve to increase inpatient admissions when compared to municipalities in less favourable financial situations, because inpatient care is considered more expensive than outpatient care. Respite care, offered as an aid to informal caregivers, can partly explain the higher number of care transitions in municipalities with more people receiving support for informal care.</p>
<p>Earlier research has shown that the use of care services varies between municipalities in Finland, but the underlying reasons for this are not clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494813484396">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494813484396">26</xref>]. In some parts of Finland the geographical distances to the nearest general or university hospital are long, complicating both transfers to inpatient care and use of outpatient care. However, the differences seen between municipalities in the same hospital district, especially in moves to a general hospital, imply that not all of the variation is due to distances, but also to differences in care practices between municipalities. We are not in position to investigate the underlying factors in this study, but it is possible that the findings reflect municipal differences, and even inequalities, in access to general hospital or to tertiary care provided by university hospitals. Equal access to care is presented as one of the major motivations behind the Finnish government’s current plans for municipal merges. Equity in care, however, is a complex question and cannot be determined without detailed analysis. Basically, differences in care practices do not necessarily indicate unequal delivery of care.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effect of municipality factors on transitions between care settings in the last years of life. Earlier research concerning the regional differences from the USA has reported rural–urban differences in hospitalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494813484396">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494813484396">28</xref>], discharges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494813484396">27</xref>], and overall visits to care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494813484396">29</xref>]. However, the comparisons with earlier research are difficult because of differences in data. The register data used here provide exhaustive and reliable information on transitions in care in the whole of Finland. The personal identity code used in Finnish registers remains unchanged throughout a person’s life, and therefore we were able to monitor personal data and individual use of care services from different registers. The accuracy, coverage, and reliability of the data in Finnish care registers are considered good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813484396">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494813484396">30</xref>]. Further research could concentrate on differences in care transitions in imminent death and how the care transitions in different care services vary between municipalities in the last months of life, when care transitions are most frequent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813484396">5</xref>].</p>
<p>There are also limitations in this study. First, the inclusion in the models of the municipality factors available decreased variation at the municipal level only slightly, if at all, which suggests that there are significant underlying municipality level factors that are not included in our data. Second, our data originates from the past decade. Since the years under study, the priority focus in long-term care has shifted from nursing home care to housing services, and the mean length of stay in hospital care has decreased. However, the basic structures of health and social services have remained unchanged. It is plausible to believe that the municipal patterns found in this study still exist. Third, research on multilevel negative binomial regression models is fairly recent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494813484396">18</xref>], and in our negative binomial regression analysis including three levels and conducted using MLwiN, the intraclass correlation and random part variance at the individual level cannot be estimated. Due to the lack of information about individual variance, it is impossible to say which have the most significant effect on the variation in the number of care transitions, individual characteristics, or area level characteristics. Yet the statistical significance of almost all individual level explanatory variables suggests that individual factors do indeed have a notable effect on care transitions.</p>
<p>At the end of life, people use more care services than in earlier phases of life and also have more care transitions. Transitions are indeed often an adequate response to care needs, but they may also reflect the difficulties that long-term care units have in meeting the care needs of old people. The number of care transitions in the last 2 years of life among people aged 70+ varies considerably, but findings of this study showed that the municipality of residence had only a minor impact on the total number of care transitions. It did, however, have an impact on certain specific types of transitions. In this study, it remains open whether local care practices or service supply, or municipal factors such as annual contribution margin or age structure, increase the number of unnecessary transitions, or whether problems in service supply in an area can reduce admissions to specialised care even if justified by individual need.</p>
