<abstract>
<p>Diagnostic flexible cysto-urethroscopy (FC) is widely performed to investigate a variety of symptoms, including haematuria, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and urinary tract infections (UTIs). The purpose of this study was to examine if FC provides useful diagnostic information in young patients investigated for urological symptoms. All patients under the age of 40 years who underwent FC in a single institution over a 12-month period from April 2009 were identified. Electronic records and case notes were then examined. A total of 270 procedures were performed in the study period. Sixty were excluded and data were unavailable in 28. Of the remaining 182, the median age was 31 and 53.8% were male. UTI was the most common indication for the procedure. Abnormalities were found at FC in only seven patients (3.8%), comprising strictures in three and inflammation in four. Of the 63 patients in whom UTI was the sole indication for performing an FC, a single stricture was the only abnormal finding. One hundred and forty (76.9%) patients underwent upper urinary tract imaging, with abnormalities present in 7.9%. This study has demonstrated a very low detection rate of clinically significant disease in patients under the age of 40 years undergoing FC for the investigation of haematuria, LUTS and UTI. We propose that before FC is used in younger patients, careful thought be given to whether it is absolutely necessary and to whether non-invasive tests may allow FC to be avoided altogether.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the introduction of the flexible cystoscope in 1984,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2051415813476702">1</xref></sup> the use of flexible cysto-urethroscopy (FC) has become firmly incorporated into the outpatient investigation of urological disease. Diagnostic FC is widely performed to investigate a variety of symptoms, including haematuria, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and urinary tract infections (UTIs). FC also forms the basis of bladder surveillance in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer following endoscopic tumour resection and following radical bladder radiation therapy. Commonly used guideline resources including The British Association of Urological Surgeons, The European Association of Urology and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) do not generally provide any guidance on the use of FC outside of the investigation of haematuria. The only exception is the recommendation by NICE that FC be offered to men with either recurrent UTI, sterile pyuria or profound LUTS or pain, although this guidance is based on level 4 evidence (expert opinion).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2051415813476702">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>This current study examines the diagnostic FC findings in all patients under the age of 40 years in a United Kingdom (UK) teaching hospital over a 12-month period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2051415813476702" sec-type="methods">
<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>All patients under the age of 40 years who underwent an FC with lidocaine local anaesthesia at the Royal Preston Hospital, UK, between April 2009 and March 2010, were identified retrospectively. Electronic records were reviewed systematically to obtain data on demographics, the indications for investigation, FC findings, additional radiological examination findings and other investigations performed. Where relevant data were missing from the electronic records, the paper case notes were obtained and systematically reviewed.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 270 patients less than 40 years of age underwent FC during the study period. Incomplete data were available in 28 patients, who were excluded from further analysis. A further 60 patients were excluded from the final analysis as the procedure was performed for either removal of a ureteric stent, cystoscopic-assisted change of a urethral catheter or bladder surveillance following previous augmentation cystoplasty. Of the remaining 182 cases, the median age was 31 years (range 15–39), of whom 53.8% were male. The indications for performing FC are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2051415813476702">Table 1</xref>, with UTI the most common indication, accounting for 34.6% of all cases.</p>

<p>All FC procedures were undertaken within an endoscopy suite as part of a dedicated FC list. No ‘one-stop’ clinics were running within our institution at the time of the study. Patients were listed for FC in a number of settings within the trust, including general urology outpatient clinics, haematuria clinics and prostate assessment clinics. No urological investigation pathways or algorithms for LUTS existed at the time of the study. The decision to list a patient for FC was undertaken by a doctor or specialist nurse in response to the patient’s clinical history and examination.</p>
<p>Abnormalities were found at FC in only seven patients (3.8%), comprising three male patients with urethral strictures, and urothelial inflammation in one male and three female patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2051415813476702">Table 2</xref>). Of those with urothelial inflammation, two of the females subsequently underwent rigid cystoscopy under general anaesthesia. In the first patient the bladder appeared entirely normal; in the second patient bladder biopsies were taken that revealed only urothelial inflammation on histopathological analysis. Of the 63 patients in whom UTI was the indication for performing an FC, a single stricture was the only abnormal finding.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>These results indicate that FC is over-utilised in the investigation of urological symptoms and disease in young patients, with a clinically important disease detection rate of only 1.6%, in the form of three urethral strictures. This low probability of finding significant disease in this age group must be considered in the context of the associated morbidity, as despite continuing advances in technology, visualisation of the urothelium remains an invasive and unpleasant procedure.</p>
<p>FC performed in the outpatient setting carries a risk of post-procedure UTI of between 2.7% and 4.5%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2051415813476702">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051415813476702">4</xref></sup> Despite this relatively low rate of UTI, there remain a number of patients who develop complicated UTI requiring hospitalisation for parenteral antibiotics. There is also the risk of outbreaks of infection due to organisms including <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, secondary to scope contamination and processing failures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051415813476702">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Studies investigating the pain experienced during FC report median pain scores of around 1 for men and women (scale of 1–10), although within these studies exists a group of men who experience much higher scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051415813476702">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2051415813476702">6</xref></sup> Such studies have not specifically examined pain scores in younger patients, who in the authors’ experience often tolerate the procedure less well than older patients. The individual components of the pain experienced have been studied in more detail,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051415813476702">7</xref></sup> with instrumentation of the membranous urethra scoring the highest with a median pain score of 2.84 (scale of 1–10). This finding was confirmed in a further study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051415813476702">8</xref></sup> demonstrating a reduction in median pain scores during instrumentation of the membranous urethra from 3 to 1.38 with the use of an increase in hydrostatic pressure, using the ‘bag squeeze’ technique. Although these overall pain scores during FC are reported to be low, the incidence of morbidity is much higher with rates of post-procedure new LUTS, including urinary urgency, frequency, dysuria or visible haematuria, ranging from 10% to 50% in the days following the procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2051415813476702">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051415813476702">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2051415813476702">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two large studies by Edwards et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2051415813476702">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051415813476702">10</xref></sup> and Khadra et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2051415813476702">11</xref></sup> have reported on the diagnostic findings in a haematuria clinic setting that included FC in the investigation algorithm. These two studies included 5950 patients collectively, reporting an overall incidence of bladder cancer of 11.9% and 10.3%, reducing to 2.5% and 2.4% in those less than 40 years of age, respectively. Of the 4020 cases in the series published by Edwards et al., 328 were younger than 40 years of age (35% female). Bladder tumours were detected in eight men, at least seven of whom presented with visible haematuria; no women had bladder tumours detected. In the prior study by Khadra et al. that included 1930 patients, of whom 277 were under the age of 40 (35% female), bladder tumours were identified in seven patients. All of these bladder cancer cases were male, one presenting with non-visible haematuria and the remaining six with visible haematuria.</p>
<p>In contrast to both of these studies, no cases of bladder cancer were identified in this study, although it is acknowledged that this study investigated a different patient group and included a smaller number of patients presenting with visible and non-visible haematuria. There remains a lack of evidence to date to support the use of FC in the investigation of female patients under the age of 40 years with haematuria, as neither of the two published studies discussed, or this study, identified bladder cancer in this female age group.</p>
<p>The detection rate of clinically important disease with FC in this study of 1.6%, three strictures, is much lower than that reported in a recent series by Howles et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2051415813476702">12</xref></sup> who described strictures in nine (8%) of 117 adults investigated by FC for either LUTS, recurrent UTI or pain, excluding patients with haematuria. If the same exclusion is applied to the current study, then the clinically important disease rate detected by FC falls to 0.8%. The study by Howles et al. included all patients over the age of 16 years and did not specifically analyse the data based on age, possibly explaining the much higher overall rates when compared to the current study.</p>
<p>The urethral strictures identified could potentially have been identified by non-invasive uroflowmetry; unfortunately, these data were not available as uroflowmetry was not routinely performed prior to FC. All three cases subsequently underwent rigid urethroscopy and optical urethrotomy under general anaesthesia. The ability to diagnose strictures by non-invasive uroflowmetry has the potential to inform decision-making regarding further investigation and management, avoiding FC and the associated morbidity in some patients.</p>
<p>The overall abnormality detection rate of 3.8% for FC, in the current study, is notably lower than the detection rate of 7.9% for UT imaging. A 6% rate of clinically important UT abnormalities, compared with 1.6% for FC, indicates that in this patient group the appropriate use of UT imaging may be of greater importance than FC.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study has demonstrated a very low detection rate of clinically significant disease in patients under the age of 40 years undergoing FC for the investigation of haematuria, LUTS and UTI. In patients with haematuria, published and widely adopted guidelines exist advocating the use of FC. This study is not of sufficient power to advocate a change in practice with respect to the investigation of haematuria; however, it should be noted that neither Edwards et al. nor Khadra et al. demonstrated a role for FC in women under the age of 40 years. This study also fails to support the guidance from NICE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2051415813476702">2</xref></sup> with respect to the investigation of men under the age of 40 years. The guiding principle of medicine is <italic>primum non nocere</italic>. We propose that before FC is used in younger patients, careful thought be given to whether it is absolutely necessary and to whether non-invasive tests (notably uroflowmetry testing) may allow FC to be avoided altogether. Larger prospective studies are required to produce clearer guidelines on the use of FC in younger patients.</p>
