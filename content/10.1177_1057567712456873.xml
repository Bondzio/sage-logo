<abstract>
<p>While there is a growing body of research on people’s views of community policing, there have been a very few cross-national studies, especially concerning nonwestern countries. In order to compare and contrast students’ views on community policing partnerships, 274 Nigerian and 484 U.S. college students were surveyed. Ordinary least squares regression analysis of the data revealed that the majority of respondents supported a partnership between the community and the police, with the Nigerian students reporting slightly higher levels of support than their U.S. counterparts. Both attachment to conventional society and general confidence in the police were positively related to students’ support for community policing partnerships in both nations. A belief that the police should be civil, a perception that the police were effective, and support for community oversight of the police were significant predictors of support for community policing partnerships among the U.S. students but not the Nigerian students. A perception that crime was a problem, a view that the public should support the police, and academic level had nonsignificant associations with community policing partnership support for both groups of students. Gender had a significant relationship with support for community policing partnerships among the Nigerian students (men were higher in their support), while age had a positive association among the U.S. students. Punitive orientation had a significant negative association with attitudes toward community policing among the U.S. students but was not a significant predictor among the Nigerian students.</p>

<body>
<p>Without a dramatic bang but slowly over the past several decades, community policing has been emerging as the dominant philosophy of policing in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1057567712456873">Miller &amp; Hess, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1057567712456873">Skogan, 2006</xref>). Considerable research has been conducted on numerous aspects of community policing, including exploring the correlates for its support from the general public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1057567712456873">Skogan &amp; Hartnett, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1057567712456873">Wu, Jiang, &amp; Lambert, 2011</xref>). One of the reasons for exploring the public’s views of community policing partnerships is because civilian support is important for the police to be effective. Often the police rely on a partnership with the public to resolve crime and social order issues successfully. Support for community policing can arguably lead to a stronger partnership between the police and the community, which in the long run can boost the effectiveness of the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1057567712456873">Brown &amp; Benedict, 2002</xref>). As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1057567712456873">Wu et al. (2011</xref>), “the community side of community policing is important because the extent to which community members are willing to render support in solving problems, provide input in policymaking, and participate in various crime prevention programs can significantly affect the establishment, sustenance, and effectiveness of community policing programs” (p. 286). Research on the public’s views of community policing and the variables associated with support for community policing partnerships is needed.</p>
<p>While there is a growing body of research on community policing, the vast majority of the research has focused on the views of people living in Western countries, especially the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1057567712456873">Brown, Benedict, &amp; Wilkinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1057567712456873">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). There is a dearth of research on the community policing partnership views of residents of nonwestern nations. Expanding cross-national research on community policing broadens the knowledge base and captures the perceptions of much more of the world’s population than focusing on a few selected Western nations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1057567712456873">Khan and Unnithan (2009</xref>) contended that focusing research on criminal justice topics solely on developed Western nations can lead to a myopic world view of insularity and ethnocentrism. Cross-national research can reveal cultural differences and similarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1057567712456873">Cao &amp; Dai, 2006</xref>) and can also help narrow the gap of information and build information bridges between different cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1057567712456873">Cao &amp; Cullen, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1057567712456873">Jowell (1998</xref>) argued that “the importance and utility to social science of rigorous cross-national measures is incontestable. They help to reveal not only intriguing differences between countries and cultures, but also aspects of one’s own country and culture that would be difficult or impossible to detect from domestic data alone” (p. 168). For theoretical and practical reasons, comparing and contrasting community policing partnership views in different nations is important.</p>
<p>This exploratory study compared and contrasted the variables associated with support for community policing among citizens of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (henceforth, Nigeria) and the United States of America (henceforth, the U.S.). Nigeria was selected because it is a large, growing, and important African nation. Nigeria has a significant influence on other African nations due to its size and economic resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1057567712456873">Bratton, 2004</xref>). There are, however, only a handful of published articles on Nigerian policing issues in Western journals, and almost none on community policing partnership views. There is, therefore, a need to explore the community policing views in Nigeria. The U.S. was selected as the reference nation to compare and contrast the Nigerian views. Because this was an exploratory study with limited financial resources, Nigerian and U.S. college students were surveyed.</p>
<p>Specifically, the relationships among four sets of variables with support for community policing partnerships were explored among the Nigerian and U.S. students. The four sets of variables were demographic characteristics (age, educational level, and gender), perceptions of crime and punishment (concern about crime and holding a punitive orientation), attachment to conventional society, and policing perceptions (confidence in the police, views that the police should be civil, views on police effectiveness, views that community oversight of the police is needed, and a belief that the public should support the police). Understanding factors that influence public support for community policing can provide useful references for the police to develop policies and practices that enhance the likelihood of successful police reform. As the experience with the community policing movement in the U.S. has indicated, the success of community policing is conditioned upon sustainable public support in both attitudinal and behavioral dimensions. For the public to cooperate voluntarily with the police and engage in police-initiated crime prevention and partnership programs, a positive view of community policing is a must (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1057567712456873">Braga &amp; Weisburd, 2006</xref>). It has been suggested not only has community policing improved perceptions of the police and increased willingness of citizens to interact with the police, but it may also be a factor in the recent decline in crime in the U.S. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1057567712456873">Zhao, Scheider, &amp; Thurman, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Past Cross-National Research on Views of the Police</title>
<p>Many past studies have used the World Values Survey and the International Crime Victimization Survey to explore the level of confidence in police across a wide array of nations. The World Values Survey asked a single question of the level of confidence a person has in the police in their country. U.S. respondents were found more confident in the police than respondents from Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1057567712456873">Cao &amp; Stack, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1057567712456873">Cao, Stack, &amp; Sun, 1998</xref>), Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1057567712456873">Cao, 2001</xref>), China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1057567712456873">Cao &amp; Hou, 2001</xref>), Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1057567712456873">Cao &amp; Zhao, 2005</xref>). In another study, respondents from Canada reported the highest level of confidence in the police, followed by the U.S., Zimbabwe, Philippines, Spain, Chile, Indonesia, Macedonia, Japan, Venezuela, Moldova, Pakistan, Mexico, Argentina, and Kyrgyzstan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1057567712456873">Jang, Joo, &amp; Zhao, 2010</xref>). Using data from the International Crime Victimization Survey, which asked if a person feels the police in his or her country do a good job at controlling crime, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1057567712456873">Van Kesteren, Mayhew, and Nieuwbeerta (2000</xref>) reported that perceptions of the police doing a good job in dealing with crime were highest in Canada and the U.S. as compared to various European nations. Finally, using data from both the International Crime Victimization Survey and the World Values Survey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1057567712456873">Ivkovic (2008</xref>) found that confidence in the police and views that the police are able to control crime varied among the 28 European and North American countries and age and gender were significant predictors of level of confidence in the police and views that the police are able to control crime, with men and younger respondents reporting lower levels of confidence in the police and less faith that the police are able to control crime.</p>
<p>There have been other cross-national studies on views on police comparing the U.S. to other nations. In a comparison of residents of New York City and St. Petersburg (Russia), New Yorkers perceived the police as more effective in combating crime, and St. Petersburg residents were more likely to feel that police stopped people without a good cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1057567712456873">Davis, Ortiz, Gilinskiy, Ylesseva, &amp; Briller, 2003</xref>). In a study of Chinese and U.S. college students, the U.S. students had a higher level of satisfaction with the police and viewed the police as having more integrity than their Chinese counterparts, even after taking into account age, gender, and academic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1057567712456873">Wu, 2010</xref>). U.S. college students were also observed to have higher levels of trust and stronger views of the police being civil as compared to students from Bangladesh, Canada, and Nigeria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1057567712456873">Lambert et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings of past cross-national studies indicate that views of the police vary considerably across nations. This past research has been limited in that views of the police have only been conducted in a handful of the world’s countries. Furthermore, most of the past research has focused on confidence and trust in the police. There has been very limited cross-national research, especially of nonwestern countries, on the correlates of support for community policing. In fact, only one published study on the correlates of public support for community policing partnerships based on respondents from a nonwestern nation could be found. A survey of Chinese college students found that attachment to significant others, concern about crime, overall confidence in the police, support for police accountability, support for aggressive policing, and a perception that the police were involved in the community were all positively linked with support for community policing partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1057567712456873">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). This study, however, did not include U.S. citizens to determine whether the same correlates were linked to support for community policing partnerships among U.S. residents. There is a need for additional studies on the correlates of community policing support in other nonwestern nations, including Nigeria, a populous and important African nation.</p>
<p>So far, only three studies on policing views among Nigerian residents could be found in Western journals and none of the three focused on attitudes toward community policing partnerships. Based on a survey of 60 Nigerian college students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1057567712456873">Alemika (1988</xref>) reported that the police were viewed as too quick to act, uncivil, abusive, and corrupt. In a convenience sample of 116 Nigerian residents from six major cities, the vast majority (91%) viewed the police as an arm of the government rather than serving the public, 95% felt that the police protected only the rich, 95% felt that the police were too quick to use deadly force, and 68% saw the police as an adversary rather than a friend or fellow citizen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1057567712456873">Okereke, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1057567712456873">Lambert et al. (2010</xref>) reported that the Nigerian respondents in their study had much lower levels of trust in the police and saw the police as being less civil as compared to the U.S. respondents.</p>

<title>Brief Overview of the Nigerian Police</title>
<p>Formerly a British colony, Nigeria gained independence on October 1, 1960. While the military has dominated its politics for over 30 of its 50 years as an independent nation, it has had civilian rule since 1998. Presently, Nigeria is a democratic federal government comprised of 36 states and the federal capital territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1057567712456873">World Factbook, 2011</xref>). With a population of more than 150 million, Nigeria is the seventh most populous nation in the world and the most populous African country, making it the largest population of Black citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1057567712456873">United States Department of State, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1057567712456873">World Factbook, 2011</xref>). Its population is young, with 40% under the age of 20. Approximately 48% of Nigerians are Muslims, 47% Christians, and the remaining 5% other religious faiths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1057567712456873">BBC News, 2007</xref>). While many people reside in rural areas, there has been a migration to urban areas over the past 40 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1057567712456873">World Factbook, 2011</xref>). The population of Nigeria is comprised of more than 250 ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1057567712456873">World Factbook, 2011</xref>). The U.S. is one of Nigeria’s largest trading partners (U.S. Department of State, 2011). While Nigeria is a major oil producing nation and one of the most economically vibrant nations in western Africa, the majority of Nigerians remain poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057567712456873">Economy Watch, 2011</xref>), and there is a high level of unemployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1057567712456873">Economy Watch, 2011</xref>; U.S. Department of State, 2011). It has been contended that corruption and mismanagement of the economy by Nigerian leaders have led to Nigeria’s current economic and social problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1057567712456873">Alemika &amp; Chukwuma, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>While there is a long history of various law enforcement functions, Western-style policing in Nigeria was started in 1861 by the British (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057567712456873">Alemika &amp; Chukwuma, 2004</xref>). During colonial times, the police were used to control the native population who were opposed to the colonial administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1057567712456873">Onyeozili, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1057567712456873">Otu, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057567712456873">Alemika and Chukwuma (2004</xref>) pointed out that the “colonial police forces behaved as an army of occupation, killing and maiming, and looting. These three features of colonialism led the public to regard colonial forces as their enemy, as instruments of violence and subjugation, and as extortionists and harbingers of bad news and trouble” (p. 8). After Nigeria gained its independence, the police were still often used to control the public, particularly during the periods of military rule. In the revision of the Constitution in 1999, the Nigeria Police Force was made the agency for law enforcement functions in Nigeria. Currently, there are over 360,000 officers in the Nigeria Police Force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1057567712456873">Nigeria Police Force, 2007</xref>), which equates to approximately 240 police officers per 100,000 Nigeria citizen. This ratio is similar to the average found in the U.S. (233 per 100,000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1057567712456873">NationMaster, 2011</xref>). This figure, however, is misleading. About 100,000 police officers are deployed to protect rich Nigerians. Parry Osayande, Chairman of the Nigeria Police Service Commission, “lamented the inappropriate deployment of policemen, noting that out of a staff strength of 321,250 officers, 100,000 policemen were attached to private individuals, thus leaving the larger part of the Nigerian population unprotected” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1057567712456873">Adepegba, 2011</xref>, p. 1). Based on the 220,000 officers that may actually serve the public, the ratio of police officers per 100,000 citizens is lower than 147.</p>
<p>The media often paint the Nigerian police in a negative light, as ineffective, uncivil, abusive, and corrupt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1057567712456873">Ikuteyijo, 2009</xref>). Sir Mike Mbama Okiro, a past Inspector-General of the Nigeria Police Force, wrote that “our focus shall be to reverse the disdain and contempt with which Policemen are held within the Nigerian society. . .. There is no gainsaying the fact that Police public image is now at a low ebb” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1057567712456873">Nigeria Police Force, 2007</xref>, p. 1). The Nigerian police have been unable to respond to crime effectively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1057567712456873">Onyeozili (2005</xref>) contended that “it is no longer safe to walk alone even during the day. Robberies, assassination, arson, looting of the public treasury, and child-theft amongst other vices, have become the rule rather than the exception” (p. 45). Part of the problem may be that the police are poorly equipped and under trained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1057567712456873">Oluwaniyi, 2011</xref>). In a survey, many officers reported that they felt that criminals were better armed than they were (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1057567712456873">Okereke, 1995</xref>). Some communities have hired vigilante groups to deal with criminals through threats and physical force, including death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1057567712456873">Baker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1057567712456873">Harnischfeger, 2003</xref>). The Nigerian police also suffer from an image of being uncivil to the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1057567712456873">Elechi, Lambert, &amp; Ventura, 2006</xref>). Abuse by the police also appears to be a problem. Police have been described as hitting first and asking questions later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1057567712456873">Igbinovia, 1985</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057567712456873">Alemika and Chukwuma (2000</xref>) reported that 43% of the police they surveyed indicated that they had insulted, slapped, or beaten a citizen, and the police have been found to have engaged in extrajudicial killings of criminals (Aremu, Pakes, &amp; Johnson, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1057567712456873">Elechi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1057567712456873">Oluwaniyi, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Corruption is another common accusation with the Nigerian police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1057567712456873">Ikuteyijo, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1057567712456873">Aremu et al. (2011</xref>) indicated that “it is commonplace to observe police officers extorting money forcefully from motorists, falsifying statements and documents, or extorting money from the public under threat of firearms. It occurs on a daily basis and it reinforces negative public perceptions of the police” (p. 196). In a survey of 500 residents of the state of Lagos, the police were ranked as the most corrupt public institution in Nigeria, and 70% indicated that they had experiences of being extorted by the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1057567712456873">Oluwaniyi, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1057567712456873">Elechi (2006</xref>) contended that the corruption and lack of concern by the police have led to an unfair situation where crime victims felt victimized twice, once by the offender and again by the justice system. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1057567712456873">Oluwaniyi (2011</xref>) contended that “police stations are meant to be the first place of contact for victimized citizens, yet, it is the worst place to seek justice, especially for poor victims” (p. 78). There are allegations that the police show favoritism to those with power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1057567712456873">Alemika &amp; Chukwuma, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1057567712456873">2004</xref>). The police are often seen as protecting the interests of the government and the rich, which often go hand in hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1057567712456873">Oluwaniyi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1057567712456873">Onyeozili, 2005</xref>). It has been alleged that the police have engaged in intimidation of opposition supporters, to the point of accusations that they have even doused opposition candidates and supporters with gasoline and set them on fire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1057567712456873">Onyeozili, 2005</xref>). Additionally, police officers have been alleged to give support to criminals; there are reports that weapons and ammunition used by criminals were obtained from police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1057567712456873">Oluwaniyi, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the 1999 constitutional revisions that reinvented of the Nigeria Police Force, there have been several major new initiatives to improve the quality of policing in Nigeria, including community policing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1057567712456873">Ikuteyijo, 2009</xref>). In 1999, a 6-point plan was launched to improve police–community relations and to increase the welfare of police officers. Included in this initiative was assistance from Britain and the U.S. in creating the Network on Police Reform in Nigeria. With support from the British Department of International Development, Nigerian officers were sent to England to learn about community policing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1057567712456873">Ikuteyijo &amp; Rotimi, 2011</xref>). This effort was haphazardly instituted, never fully developed, and ended shortly after it began (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1057567712456873">Hills, 2008</xref>). In 2005, a 10-point plan with the slogan of “To Protect and Serve with Integrity” was launched, but it also failed to meet its objectives of increasing community policing in Nigeria because of a lack of real push for reform by the federal government. In 2007, a new, 9-point plan was launched, which was replaced in 2009 with a 3-point plan to shift the police role from a traditional one to a community-oriented one. Like the previous efforts, this one failed as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1057567712456873">Ikuteyijo &amp; Rotimi, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1057567712456873">Hills (2008</xref>) contended that the efforts failed because they were simple superficial changes launched with much political fanfare but little real effort for resulting long-term change. Indeed, without “winning the hearts and minds of police officers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1057567712456873">Lurigio &amp; Skogan, 1994</xref>) and changing line officers’ mentality, any community policing initiative is unlikely to succeed. An early survey of Nigerian police officers showed that 96% of the responding officers indicated that there was no need to reach out to local community leaders to develop responses to crime because they were federal government employees, and 78% indicated that they should never be concerned with the rights of those in police custody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1057567712456873">Okereke, 1995</xref>). It is likely that such indifferent and negative attitudes of the police toward the public still prevail today. Indeed, community–police relations have been described as frosty and characterized by suspicion and distrust by both sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1057567712456873">Ikuteyijo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1057567712456873">Ikuteyijo &amp; Rotimi, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Research Objectives</title>
<p>One of the two primary objectives of this study was to explore the level of support for community policing partnerships and the variables associated with the support for community policing in Nigeria. While college students are only a small segment of the Nigerian population, they represent a segment with potentially more influence in government affairs than other poorer and more disenfranchised segments. In addition, college students can provide a springboard for exploratory research that will hopefully lead to further study of community policing views of other Nigerian citizens. Furthermore, in order for community policing to gain a greater foothold in Nigeria, understanding the variables associated with support for community policing partnerships is important. The public’s views on community policing partnerships are important. Without this knowledge, community policing initiatives are likely to continue to fail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1057567712456873">Nalla &amp; Madan, 2011</xref>). This information can be useful for scholars and police administrators who are interested in increasing support for community policing partnerships.</p>
<p>The model to predict support for community policing partnership views included four sets of variables (demographic characteristics, perceptions of crime and punishment, attachment to conventional society, and policing perceptions). Demographic variables, such as age, gender, and educational level, have been found to be associated with policing views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1057567712456873">Brown &amp; Benedict, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1057567712456873">Lai &amp; Zhao, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1057567712456873">Nofziger &amp; Williams, 2005</xref>). There are some previous studies that report that women tend to be more supportive of the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1057567712456873">Lai &amp; Zhao, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1057567712456873">Reisig &amp; Giacomazzi, 1998</xref>). While this research has not directly explored how gender might be related to support for community policing partnerships, men were hypothesized to be more supportive of community policing than their female counterparts because women generally hold more favorable views of the police in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1057567712456873">Correia, Reisig, &amp; Lovrich, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1057567712456873">Hurst &amp; Frank, 2000</xref>). Both age and educational level have been observed to be positively associated with trust and confidence in the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1057567712456873">Cao, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1057567712456873">Lai, Cao, &amp; Zhao, 2010</xref>). Younger people are more freedom-oriented instead of safety-oriented and are more likely to engage in risky behaviors that may result in negative encounters with the police. Thus, they may render less support to the police than older people. Age was hypothesized to be positively associated with support for a partnership between the community and the police. Education has long been argued to have a liberalizing effect. Better educated individuals may have a stronger desire for police reform than their less educated counterparts, and thus support community policing partnerships more. As this study is based on college students, academic standing (i.e., lower or upper level) was used, and upper level students were hypothesized to be more supportive of community policing partnerships.</p>
<p>The second set of variables in the model dealt with perceptions of crime and punishment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1057567712456873">Wu et al. (2011</xref>) postulated that individuals who view crime as a serious problem are less likely to advocate for community policing partnerships because they typically want a more aggressive form of policing to deal with the perceived crime problem. In this study, perceptions that crime was a pressing social issue were hypothesized to be negatively related to support for community policing partnerships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1057567712456873">Wu et al. (2011</xref>) also postulated that those who held punitive views for dealing with criminals would be less likely to support community policing because such programs may be seen as being soft on crime. In this study, therefore, holding a punitive orientation to the punishment of offenders was predicted to be negatively associated with support for community policing partnerships.</p>
<p>The third set of variables used to explore support for community policing partnerships was attachment to conventional society. Attachment to conventional order, such as significant others, may be related to support for police because police are usually viewed as a conventional institution. A small number of studies have started to make the connection between social bonds and public perceptions of the police, indicating that attachment to parents, commitment to school, and prosocial values exert significant effects on juvenile perceptions of the police and the willingness of juveniles to assist the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1057567712456873">Flexon, Lurigio, &amp; Greenleaf, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1057567712456873">Levy 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1057567712456873">Lurigio, Greenleaf, &amp; Flexon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1057567712456873">Nihart, Lersch, Sellers, &amp; Mieczkowski, 2005</xref>). Attachment to significant others may signify support for police among the adult population as well. Such bonds can insulate individuals from the influence of antisocial forces and behaviors, keep them away from deviant values and subculture, and nurture positive sentiments toward conventional institutions, including the police.</p>
<p>The fourth and final set of variables in the model was perceptions of the police. Because perceptions of the police are complex and multidimensional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1057567712456873">Stoutland, 2001</xref>), it is important to disaggregate such perceptions and examine the impact of different aspects of police perceptions on support for a partnership between the community and the police. Thus, confidence in the police, the opinion that the police should be civil, views that police are effective, belief that community oversight of the police is needed, and a view that the police should be supported were included in the model. These aspects cover both evaluations and expectations of the police. The following specific hypotheses were formulated. As people who have confidence in the police generally hold more favorable views of the police, which may translate to greater willingness to assist the police in reform initiatives, confidence in the police was hypothesized to be positively linked with support for community policing partnerships. Opinions that the police should be civil in their interactions with the public reflect a desire for the police to treat citizens with manners and courteousness, which is a baseline requirement for establishing a positive community partnership; therefore, police civility was predicted to be positively associated with community policing support. Views that the police are effective in dealing with crime will likely improve the image of the police in the eye of the public, and this, in turn, may increase the willingness of people to assist the police and have the police engage more frequently in community life and activities. As such, perceptions that the police are effective were hypothesized to be positively related with support for community policing partnerships. A key aspect of community policing partnerships involves greater police accountability to the community than traditionalpolicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1057567712456873">Kelling, Wasserman, &amp; Williams, 1988</xref>); thus the view that the police need community oversight was hypothesized to be positively linked with support for community policing partnerships. Finally, it is rather self-explanatory that a view that the public should support the police is likely to increase the level of support for community policing partnerships.</p>
<p>The other research objective of this study was to compare and contrast the views on community policing partnerships among the Nigerian and U.S. students. While past research indicates that views of the police vary across nations, little cross-national research has been done on community policing partnership views. The literature also suggests that social group membership influences individuals’ views, attitudes, and perceptions, and distinct social groups have their own values, views, and norms, which suggests that views will differ both within a nation and across nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1057567712456873">Chung &amp; Bagozzi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1057567712456873">Yick, 2000</xref>). While both are former British colonies, Nigeria and the U.S. have developed their own unique cultures which probably have led to differences on views on community policing partnerships and the variables that may help shape these views. The U.S. is a more developed nation, while Nigeria is still an economically developing country. In many developing nations, the police help ensure stability, but can also be linked to practices not favored by the public, such as overt abuse and corruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1057567712456873">Lambert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1057567712456873">Salifu, 2008</xref>). The U.S. has a longer history of stable policing compared to Nigeria. Additionally, the U.S. has a much more decentralized form of policing and more professional police force than the one found in Nigeria. These and other differences probably influence the community policing partnership views in both nations. Simply put, there are probably both intranational and international differences in community policing partnership views and the variables associated with it among the Nigerian and the U.S. students.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-1057567712456873">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A convenience sample of students at two Nigerian universities and a single U.S. university was undertaken. Because convenience sampling was used, the results apply only to those surveyed. The two Nigerian universities were metropolitan public universities offering undergraduate, master, and terminal degrees, had enrollments of about 16,000 students each, and were located in the states of Ebonyi and Abia. The U.S. university was a public institution located in the Midwest of the U.S., which offered undergraduate, master, and terminal degrees. Its enrollment at the time of the survey was approximately 20,000. At all three universities, the surveys were administered in undergraduate classes that represented a wide array of majors and included classes required by all majors. In both countries, the survey was written in English, which was the language spoken at all three universities. The survey, which was completed during class time, was first explained to the students both verbally and in writing that it was voluntary and the survey results would be anonymous. In order to avoid duplication, students were asked not to complete the survey if they had done so in another class. It was estimated over 95% of the students in the selected classes completed the survey. For the Nigerian universities, a total of 274 usable surveys were returned. For the U.S. university, a total of 484 usable surveys were returned. Thus, a grand total of 758 surveys were used in this study.</p>
<p>In terms of gender for the overall group of respondents, 54% were women and 46% were men. There were slightly more women in the group of students from the U.S. (56% vs. 49% from Nigeria). The median age of the respondents was 22. The mean age was 23.14, with a standard deviation of 5.63. The U.S. respondents were slightly younger and had a broader range than the Nigerian respondents (mean U.S. age of 21.96 vs. a Nigerian mean of 25.99; age range of the U.S. students was from 18 to 63, while the age of the Nigerian students ranged from 18 to 47). For the entire group, 14% were freshmen, 16% were sophomores, 33% were juniors, and 37% were seniors. U.S. students were distributed across the four academic levels, while the majority of the Nigerian students were junior- and senior-level students. For the U.S. university, the overall student population was 49% male, the average age was 22 years old, and about a quarter were freshmen. At the Nigerian universities, the overall student population was 53% male, the average age was 24, and slightly more than a quarter were freshmen. While the convenience sample of students was similar to that of the overall student population for gender and age, it differed for academic level, as the Nigerian respondents were more likely to be junior and senior level.</p>

<title>Variables</title>
<sec id="section8-1057567712456873">
<title>Dependent variable</title>
<p>Support for a partnership between the community and the police was the dependent variable and was measured using a summed index comprised of 5 items. The 5 items were: “Cooperation between the police and the community is important to prevent crime,” “In order to prevent crime, there must be a partnership between the community and the police,” “Police working with neighborhoods or communities is an effective deterrent to crime,” “The flow of information from citizens to the police about crime and criminals increases police effectiveness at crime prevention,” and “The flow of information about crime back to citizens improves the ability of citizens to protect themselves.” These items were answered using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from<italic> strongly disagree</italic> (coded 1) to <italic>strongly agree</italic> (coded 5). Higher scores on the index indicated greater support for community policing partnerships as compared to lower scores. Factor analysis was conducted and the 5 items loaded on one factor with loading scores of .44 or higher. This variable was labeled in this study as Support for Community Policing. Nigerian society is diverse—made up of different ethnicities, cultures, and social classes; therefore, Nigerian respondents were expected to understand community policing from different perspectives. Even in the U.S., there is no consensus on the definition of community policing and different people, including police officers, have different understandings of what community policing entails, and what counts as community policing programs. Not without its limitations, support for community policing in this study reflects the respondents’ support for the general principles and philosophy of community policing. It pertains to the respondents’ opinion of what is important in policing or what good policing should do, instead of evaluating a specific community policing program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1057567712456873">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>The demographic characteristics of academic level, age, and gender were included. In light of the fact that the majority of the Nigerian students were seniors, academic level was coded as a dichotomous variable where 0 = freshman, sophomore, and junior, and 1 = senior. Age was measured in continuous years. Gender was coded as women = 0 and men = 1.</p>
<p>Two variables for views on crime and punishment were included. A variable measuring concern about crime used the following 2 items: “Crime is one of the most serious problems facing society today” and “Nigeria/the U.S. [depending on nation] has a great deal of crime.” Factor analysis was conducted and the 2 items loaded on one factor with loading scores of .71. The responses to the 2 items were summed together to form an additive index which was labeled as Crime Concern.</p>
<p>A variable measuring a punitive orientation was created by adding the responses to the following 4 items: “Courts are generally not harsh enough with criminals,” “Society has a right to seek revenge on violent criminals,” “A criminal will only “go straight” if the punishment is harsh,” and “Criminals need to be punished, not coddled.” Factor analysis was conducted and the 4 items loaded on one factor with loading scores of .67 or higher. This variable was labeled as Punitive Orientation. The response options for the views of crime and punishment were 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to <italic>strongly agree</italic>.</p>
<p>Attachment to conventional society was measured by a single item: “My behavior is strongly influenced by significant others, such as my parents, family members, peers, and friends.” The item was also answered using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. This variable was labeled as Attachment to Significant Others.</p>
<p>Five different areas of views of the police were measured and, like the other index variables, all were answered using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree.</p>
<p>Confidence in the police (labeled as Confidence in the Police) was measured using the following 4 items: “The police know what is best for my community,” “I trust the police,” “Police know what is best for people,” and “Police know how to best respond to crime.” Factor analysis was conducted and the 4 items loaded on one factor with loading scores of .67 or higher.</p>
<p>The opinion that the police should be civil to those they encounter was measured by a single item: “The police should show respect to those they meet,” and was labeled as Police Should Be Civil.</p>
<p>Perceptions of police effectiveness were measured using the 3 items of: “Police have little impact on the amount of crime in my community” (reverse coded), “Criminals have little to fear of the police” (reverse coded), and “Police in my community work hard.” Factor analysis was conducted and the 3 items loaded on one factor with loading scores of .63 or higher. The index that was created by summing the responses to these items was labeled as Police Effective.</p>
<p>An additive index measuring perceived need for community control of the police (labeled as Community Oversight Needed) was formed using the responses from the following 3 items: “Police should be accountable for their actions,” “There should be greater control of the police by community citizens,” and “The community should have input on how the police operate.” Factor analysis was conducted and the 4 items loaded on one factor with loading scores of .62 or higher.</p>
<p>Finally, a variable of the level of support that the public should render to the police was measured using the single item of “People in the community should always support the police.” This variable was labeled as Public Should Support Police.</p>

<p>The correlation matrix for the Nigerian students is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1057567712456873">Table 3</xref>. Among the demographic variables, academic level had a nonsignificant correlation with support for a community–police partnership, while both age and gender had significant correlations. As age increased, the level of support for community policing partnerships increased. In general, men were more supportive of community policing than women. Neither views on crime nor punishment had significant correlations. Attachment to significant others had a significant positive correlation with community policing partnership support. Among the five views of the police, only two had a significant correlation. Higher levels of confidence in the police were associated with greater levels of support for a partnership between the community and the police. Likewise, those who felt the public should support the police typically expressed higher levels of support for community policing partnerships.</p>

<p>Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression was utilized with the index measuring support for community policing partnerships as the dependent variable and the demographics, perceptions of crime and punishment, attachment to conventional society, and views of the police as the independent variables. One regression equation was estimated for Nigerian students and a separate regression equation was run for the U.S. students. The results are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1057567712456873">Table 5</xref>. For the Nigerian students, the independent variables accounted for approximately 38% of the variance observed in the dependant variable of support for community policing partnerships. Of the three demographic characteristics, only gender had a significant association, with Nigerian men being more supportive of community policing partnerships than Nigerian women, as was hypothesized, and this was the same relationship found in the correlational analysis. Contrary to what was predicted, academic level for Nigerian students had no significant association with the dependent variable in either the bivariate or multivariate analyses. While age had a significant bivariate correlation, it was not a significant predictor in the regression equation. Contrary to our hypothesis, neither perceptions of crime nor punishment orientation had a significant relationship with community policing partnership support in either the bivariate or multivariate analyses. Students who reported greater attachment to significant others reported higher levels of support for a partnership between the police and the community, as was also the case in the correlational analysis. Of the five variables measuring views of the police, only one had a significant association in the multivariate analysis. As was predicted and also found in the bivariate analysis, confidence in police was linked with increased support for community policing partnerships in the regression equation. Contrary to our hypothesis, the variables for police should civil, police effectiveness, and community oversight is needed had nonsignificant associations in both the bivariate and multivariate analyses. Finally, even though there was a significant correlation, the view that the public should support the police was not a significant predictor in the regression equation once other variables were taken into account.</p>

<p>For the U.S., the independent variables explained approximately 23% of the variance observed in the dependant variable of support for community policing partnerships. Contrary to our hypothesis, among the three demographic characteristics, only age had a significant association, with increases in age being associated with greater support for community police partnerships. This is a similar finding of that found in the correlational analysis, where age had a significant positive correlation and academic level and gender had nonsignificant associations. Perceptions that crime was a problem had a nonsignificant effect in the regression equation, which is consistent with the correlational finding. As hypothesized, increases in punitive orientation were found to result in lower levels of support for community police partnerships, which is consistent with the bivariate results. In the regression analysis (as well as the correlational findings), four of the five policing views had significant associations. As hypothesized, confidence in the police, views that the police should be civil, evaluations that the police were effective, and perceptions that community oversight of the police was needed were all related to heightened support for a partnership between the community and the police.

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>This study represents an initial empirical investigation of support for community policing principles and practices in Nigeria by surveying college students. Results of this study contribute to the existing limited literature on cross-national comparison on policing views, especially regarding community policing. As hypothesized, there were intranational and international differences in community policing partnership views. While the majority of respondents in both Nigeria and the U.S. supported the philosophy of community policing, the Nigerian respondents were higher in their level of support. This support for community policing in Nigeria suggests that there is a desire for a partnership between the police and the community to grow and spread. Community policing is based on the broader principles of empowering the communities, solving lingering neighborhood problems, and making citizens the coproducers of law and order rather than merely depending on the police to combat crime and ensure public order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1057567712456873">Trojanowicz &amp; Carter, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1057567712456873">Wong, 2001</xref>). The Nigerian students may see community policing strategies as a way to improve the Nigerian police effectiveness and increase police accountability to the community. As previously indicated, the Nigerian police are often viewed as being abusive, corrupt, and ineffective. The desire for change and greater public participation in the activities in the police may explain why the Nigerian students were higher in their level of community policing partnership support.</p>
<p>There were also similarities and differences in the correlates for community policing partnership support among the two groups. For both Nigerian and U.S. respondents, attachment to conventional society and confidence in the police were linked with increased support for community policing partnerships. As both societies rely on informal and formal social control methods to control crime, a willingness to support community policing partnerships may reflect support for both formal and informal social control crime methods. Traditional policing is more of a formal control method, while community policing is a blend of both formal and informal. It could be that respondents, regardless of nation, who are more accepting of one form of informal social control, such as those more attached to their significant others, may well be more supportive of other mechanisms of blended informal and formal social control, such as community policing. This result agrees with previous research on juveniles showing that informal social bonds had significant positive effects on juvenile attitudes toward the police and the willingness of juveniles to assist in police endeavors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1057567712456873">Flexon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1057567712456873">Levy 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1057567712456873">Lurigio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1057567712456873">Nihart et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Confidence in the police, as predicted, had a positive association with support for community policing partnerships for both groups. Community policing is based on mutual trust and cooperation between the public and the police. When there is a lack of trust, it is doubtful that community policing will work effectively. It makes sense that confidence in the police is linked with greater support for community police because community policing requires efforts, partnerships, and coordination on the part of the police. A low level of confidence in the police could reflect a view that police are ineffective, abusive, and/or corrupt, and community policing would be unlikely to be effective under these circumstances. For both Nigerian and U.S. students, academic level, a perception that crime is a pressing problem, and a view that the public should always support the police had nonsignificant effects on support for community policing partnerships.</p>
<p>There were also differences in the significant correlates of support for a partnership between the community and the police between the two groups. Gender was significant in the Nigerian model but not the U.S. model. Gender’s lack of a significant effect on the U.S. was surprising but is not without support in the literature. Some studies have found gender an insignificant factor in influencing policing views in the U.S. (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1057567712456873">Benedict, Brown, &amp; Brown, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1057567712456873">Chermak, McGarrell, &amp; Weiss, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1057567712456873">Huang &amp; Vaughn, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1057567712456873">Sampson &amp; Bartusch, 1998</xref>). Our finding that Nigerian men were more supportive of community policing than Nigerian women is similar to what a small number of U.S. studies have found—men hold more favorable attitudes toward the police than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1057567712456873">Correia et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1057567712456873">Hurst &amp; Frank, 2000</xref>). Male Nigerian students in this study could have felt that community policing is more effective in dealing with crime and restoring order in Nigeria, while women may favor another approach. As there is sparse literature on the correlates of support for community policing, and none among Nigerians, this finding needs to be replicated. For U.S. students, age was found a significant predictor. In the literature, age has often been reported to have a significant positive association with views of the police in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1057567712456873">Brown &amp; Benedict, 2002</xref>). Age, however, was not a significant predictor for the Nigerian respondents, possibly because the age variable for the Nigerian respondents has a narrower range, which may partially account for this lack of significant effect of age.</p>
<p>Regarding the effects of perception of punishment, punitive orientation only had a significant association in the U.S. regression equation. Increases in a punitive orientation were associated with lower support for community policing partnerships. It could be that some U.S. students viewed community policing as weakening the ability of the police to fight crime by transferring the responsibility of law and order to the community, and, as such, showed less support for community policing partnerships.</p>
<p>A belief that the police should be civil, a perception that the police were effective, and a desire for community oversight of the police were all significant predictors in the U.S. model but not the Nigerian model. In other words, positive evaluations of police effectiveness and high expectations of police civility and accountability contributed to support for community policing partnerships in the U.S., but not in Nigeria. It is unclear why. A speculation is that perceptions of officer demeanor, effectiveness, and accountability are more along the same dimension of the concept of attitudes toward the police in the U.S. than in Nigeria. In the U.S., community policing emphasizes police interaction with community members and that an officer’s courteous demeanor, including displaying sensitivity toward residents, is a critical enhancer of public satisfaction. Community policing is also tightly related to police effectiveness in the U.S. as one of the forces for adopting community policing was a realization that the professional-era style of policing with the passive role of citizens had resulted in strains in both police legitimacy and effectiveness. In Nigeria, the notion of community policing may be more closely related to police integrity and accountability to the public, as the police are generally perceived as more abusive and corrupt in Nigeria than in the U.S. This partially explains why the level of confidence in the police was higher in the U.S. than Nigeria. In Nigeria, police confidence was found to be a salient variable in helping shape community policing partnership views. Future research should explore these and other possible explanations. In sum, the finding that significant relationships varied between the two groups further supports the contention that there are cross-national differences in attitudes toward community policing specifically and the police in general.</p>
<p>As with most research, the current study had shortcomings. It was a single preliminary study that used a convenience sample of college students. This means that the results need to be interpreted with caution and cannot be generalized to the entire population of either nation. There may be regional effects because many of the Nigerian students are probably from South East Nigeria and many of the U.S. students are from the Midwest. Besides determining whether the results can be replicated, people in the general population should be surveyed on their views. In addition, Nigerian police officers should be surveyed to determine their views and support for community policing partnerships. Using a student sample limits some potential salient predictors, such as neighborhood conditions and socioeconomic status. Future studies should explore whether support for community policing partnerships and its correlates vary contextually. For example, the literature suggests that oftentimes the very neighborhoods that the U.S. police most need support and collaboration from are also those most difficult for the police to connect and access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1057567712456873">Skogan &amp; Hartnett, 1997</xref>). It would be interesting for future research to test whether or not similar patterns exist in Nigeria. In addition, other variables should be included to determine how they are related to community policing support. The amount of variance explained was 38% and 23% in the Nigerian and U.S. models, respectively. This means that other variables help shape the community policing partnership support. These variables need to be identified. Past research in Western nations has reported that experience with the police, including direct and indirect contact, may be an important predictor, with prior positive contact contributing to more favorable views of the police and prior negative contact contributing to negative views of the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1057567712456873">Brown &amp; Benedict, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1057567712456873">Reisig &amp; Parks, 2000</xref>). It could be that positive past interactions with the police increase support for community policing. Furthermore, in the U.S., race or ethnicity and economic status of a person has been linked with views of the police in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1057567712456873">Brown &amp; Benedict, 2002</xref>). It could be that ethnic and/or economic status of people is linked to views on community policing and such a link may vary across nations. Clearly much more research is needed to examine the intra- and international variation of policing views.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming is that limited measures were used. A more extensive and encompassing measure of support for community policing partnership should be developed and tested. In the current study, support for community policing partnerships was measured in a narrow manner with the use of a few general items indicating public perceptions of the general philosophy of community policing. In addition, none of the items actually mentioned community policing by name. Future research should use a more in-depth and direct measure of community policing. This study measured support for community policing in a limited way with the use of a few general items mainly indicating public perceptions of the general philosophy of community policing partnerships. Future research should examine public views on different, more specific elements and practices of community policing. Studies should also investigate both the perceptual and behavioral dimensions of support for community policing. It is important to know whether a strong support for the philosophy of community policing co-occurs with real supportive actions and active participation in community policing programs and activities. Furthermore, more research is needed to determine how different perceptions of policing may be linked with support for community policing. These items highlight the need for establishing community police partnerships, which are a key component of community policing yet not completely identical with the concept of community policing itself. The level of support could not only change for different aspects of community policing, but so could the predictors. Furthermore, measures on views of other areas of policing were limited and need to be expanded. Most of the views of the police used as independent variables in this study were measured using a handful of items. In addition, there are many other aspects of views of the police that may be linked to views on community policing that need to be identified and understood. Until this is completed, it will be difficult to make recommendations for increasing support for community policing partnerships in a particular society.</p>
<p>In closing, in almost every nation, the police are the primary agent of formal social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1057567712456873">Ikuteyijo, 2009</xref>). The views of the police, however, are not monolithic around the globe but likely vary both between and within nations. This study found that support for community policing partnerships and its correlates varied between Nigerian and U.S. college students. The findings are likely the result of cultural and social forces in these two nations. Nevertheless, the findings are far from conclusive, and this study may raise more questions than it answered. Much more cross-national research on community policing views is needed. Cross-national research can not only lead to knowledge about community policing views in other nations but also result in a better, clear, critical understanding of views of community policing in one’s own nation. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1057567712456873">Angel and Thoits (1987</xref>), the views of different groups are windows to the salient values of the particular group. It is hoped that this study will spur further research on community policing partnership views not only in Nigeria and the U.S., but across a wide array of nations. Future research will hopefully provide new insights into the subject for scholars and lead to changes that enhance the partnerships between the public and the police in numerous communities across the planet. Although this was only a preliminary study, it points to an important line of inquiry on public attitudes toward community policing during a period of time when many nations have started to introduce different forms of community policing. Whether or not community policing becomes a successful reform movement that changes the way contemporary police operate depends partially on whether it is supported by not only politicians, policy makers, and police practitioners, but also the general public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1057567712456873">Ikuteyijo, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Since the support for community policing variable is not a true internal/ratio-level measure, but is an ordinal level measure, ordered or ordinal logistic regression was also computed. In terms of statistical significance, the same results were observed. Specifically, for the Nigerian ordered or ordinal logistic regression equation, the following variables had a significant relationship with the support for Community Policing Index: Gender, attachment to significant others, and police confidence. The following variables had a nonsignificant association with the dependent variable: Academic level, age, crime problem, punitive orientation, police should be civil, police effective, community oversight need, and public should support police. The Cox and Snell pseudo <italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> value was .34. For the U.S. ordered or ordinal logistic regression equation, the following variables had a significant relationship with the support for community policing index: age, punitive orientation, attachment to significant others, police confidence, police should be civil, police effective, and community oversight needed. The following variables had a nonsignificant association with the dependent variable: Academic level, gender, crime problem, and public should support the police.
