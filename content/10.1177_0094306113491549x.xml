<p>This volume emerged from a cross-national research project aiming to investigate changes in education systems and their impact on the labor market and the life-course of young people in 10 postsocialist countries of Eastern and East-Central Europe (East Germany, Czech Republic, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, Hungary, Poland, Estonia, Ukraine, and Russia). All of these countries underwent a deep systemic transformation in the direction of marketization, democracy, and inclusion in global trends, although at different paces and with varying results. Some of them became members of the European Union in 2004 (with another two in 2008, and Croatia is set to join in 2013). A special case is East Germany, which was reintegrated into the common (West) German state in 1990. The book seeks to detect how large-scale institutional change and reform processes influence the interrelation between the education system and employment from the point of view of job seekers with different educational profiles and investments and how this influences their future professional careers as well as the stratification of society.</p>
<p>Clemens Noelke and Walter Mueller in their introductory chapter, point out the dynamics of the societal transformation and institutional configurations which vary among postsocialist countries. They summarize the book’s intention as follows: “In this volume, we especially focus on the changing role of education at the individual’s entry into working life and study its impact on the speed of finding employment as well as the quality and stability of first significant jobs” (p. 6). The methodological approach is mainly quantitative and based on a (sophisticated) secondary data analysis (a more detailed description is found on pages 50–51 including the information about observation period and investigated cohorts). However, other data and information relevant for understanding the country-specific developments are also presented. This enables readers to gain deeper insights into the similarities and differences regarding the education systems and labor market regulations in the mentioned countries. The accent is on a comparison of more vocational, skills-oriented secondary and post-secondary education and more general education at the secondary and tertiary levels in terms of entering the job market.</p>
<p>The main finding is that since the 1990s we have witnessed a shift away from skills and practical education to more general education and theoretical knowledge. In the majority of countries under scrutiny, university graduates (those with diplomas and especially a master’s degree) have been the most successful in the labor market in terms of the duration of finding a job as well as the quality of the job they finally land.</p>
<p>But there are also some differences among the countries. In East Germany and the Czech Republic, vocational education on the secondary and tertiary level is still important. Graduates from upper secondary schools (technical schools) in the Czech Republic have relatively good chances of entering the labor market quickly, while in East Germany those with a lower (vocational) tertiary education can obtain high status, professional jobs. However, the general trend is in favor of the university degree (master’s). While summarizing the findings of the national studies, the editors stress that the educational expansion and differentiation of tertiary education have never been more pronounced and achieved at a speed greater “than normally observed in Western countries” (p. 348). However, there is little documentation to support these trends. If we look at the Innovation Union Scoreboard 2011, we see that only Slovenia and Estonia (besides Lithuania which is not included in this volume) have a share of tertiary educated people aged from 30 to 34 years which is above the EU average. All other CEE countries (surprisingly also including Germany) have relatively lower levels of tertiary education. This does not mean that tertiary education is not expanded here, only that we should know more details about the comparison with the (old) members of the EU, where we also encounter big differences.</p>
<p>The authors explain this trend and expansion of tertiary enrollment, and the decrease in vocational education, by pointing to the decline of some industrial (manufacturing) branches and the shift in favor of the service sector. Unfortunately, the authors do not specify which segments of this sector have contributed to new employment possibilities and whether the service sector represents a stable and long-term source of employment for most educated groups. The data show that graduates from business and management schools as well as other social science disciplines can relatively easily find a job and obtain a high professional or management position. In many CEE countries we can identify the rapid expansion and to some extent also hyper-production of social science graduates. This process has been accompanied by a reduction of enrollment levels in science and engineering studies, as can be seen in another book put together by the same editors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094306113491549">1</xref></sup> What the reader misses is a comparison of the educational attainment and profile—the level of human capital in general—of CEE countries with certain old members of the EU or with other more developed countries.</p>
<p>It can be argued that the volume as a whole is well structured and that the editors performed their task very carefully and effectively. The book provides an insight into the history of the transition from school to employment during the times of socialism to the early or mid-2000s for the Czech Republic, Russia, and Estonia, and for the other countries from 1990 onward (for instance, the observation period for the Czech Republic is from 1979 to 2007, for Hungary from 1990 to 2004). The book demonstrates that the most educated groups of young people can relatively easily find their first job and then build a successful career in their own country; this is especially true for women—a surprising finding. However, we should note that the authors and editors have recognized the increasing difficulties in the youth labor market by highlighting, or at least mentioning, more precarious employment practices in the form of fixed-term contracts which are common in Slovenia and Poland, and even informal contracts in Serbia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>It should also be mentioned that the latest data used in the volume come from 2007, even though the book was published in 2011. New and more detailed research is clearly needed in order to account for new trends after 2008. The problems of the high youth unemployment rates in the old (even in Sweden or Finland) and new EU member states including the groups with tertiary education, the precarious employment regimes, the mismatch between the level of education and the much less demanding available jobs or vice-versa (here we can mention the recent World Bank’s report entitled “Skills, Not Just Diplomas,” the hyper-production of certain professional profiles, the brain-drain (and consequences for those countries with a strong outflow of well-educated people), and job mobility inside the EU labor market—all must be recognized as important challenges and research priorities within both national and EU contexts.</p>
