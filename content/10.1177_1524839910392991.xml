<abstract>
<p>Barriers encountered in implementing a physical activity intervention in primary health care settings, and ways to address them, are described in this paper. A randomized comparison trial was designed to examine the impact of health care providers’ written prescriptions for physical activity, with or without additional physical activity resources, to adult, nonpregnant patients on preventive care or chronic disease monitoring visits. Following abysmal recruitment outcomes, the research protocol was altered to make it more appealing to all the participants, i.e., health care providers, office personnel, and patients. Various barriers—financial, motivational, and executive—to the implementation of health promotion interventions in primary health care settings were experienced and identified. These barriers have been classified by the different participants in the research process, viz., healthcare providers, administrative personnel, researchers, and patients. Some of the barriers identified were lack of time and reimbursement for health promotion activities, and inadequate practice capacity, for health care providers; increased time and labor demands for administrative personnel; constrained access to participants, and limited funding, for researchers; and superseding commitments, and inaccurate comprehension of the research protocol, for patients. Solutions suggested to overcome these barriers include financial support, e.g., funding for researchers, remuneration for health care organization personnel, reimbursement for providers, payment for participants, and free or subsidized postage, and use of health facilities; motivational strategies such as inspirational leadership, and contests within health care organizations; and partnerships, with other expert technical and creative entities, to improve the quality, efficiency, and acceptability of health promotion interventions.</p>

<p>The Healthcare Provider Physical Activity Prescription Intervention was a randomized comparison trial designed to examine the impact of health care providers’ written prescriptions for physical activity, with or without additional physical activity resources, to adult, nonpregnant patients on preventive care or chronic disease monitoring visits. The prescriptions were written recommendations of physical activity, made in consultation with the patient, specifying the type, frequency, intensity, and duration of activity to be performed. Additional physical activity resources included a resistance band and a catalog of local physical activity resources.</p>
<p>The original protocol for recruitment and data collection involved the mailing of information packets, a letter from the health care organization endorsing the study, and consent forms to patients scheduled for office visits with their health care providers. This was followed by the mailing of packets of questionnaires to volunteering participants, the delivery of the prescription in the course of the visit, the collection of completed questionnaires from the providers’ offices, and the further exchange of questionnaire packets between the participants and the graduate student researcher at 1 month and 6 months postconsultation. No payment was offered for participation. However, a lucky draw, for coupons to be redeemed at local stores, at the end of the study was planned for participants. It took several months to gain the express support of health care providers at a family practice center and set the participant recruitment process into motion. Unfortunately, the net recruitment was zero, although two patients initially signed the consent forms to participate—acute sickness and an administrative error in mailing, respectively, prevented them from participating in the study.</p>
<p>Two other health care organizations were then contacted to participate in the study, and the protocol was altered to make it more appealing to all the participants—providers, the personnel in their offices, and patients. The time intervals for follow-up were changed to 1 month and 3 months postconsultation. The number of questionnaires was reduced. Payment for participation was instituted at 2 time points. The venue of solicitation of participation was shifted from the patient’s home (via mailing) to the waiting room of the health care provider’s office, reported to be a favorable venue for patient recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839910392991">Bylina et al., 2006</xref>). The shift of venue also served to obviate the lag between the introduction of the study and the consultation wherein the prescription was delivered. Following the modifications in the protocol of this study, 41 patients were recruited over 4 months: Of this number, 22 completed questionnaires at all 3 time points, and 24 completed questionnaires at baseline and final follow-up. Surveys completed at recruitment revealed no differences between patients who returned completed questionnaires and those who did not. The intervention, in particular, the written prescription with the resistance band, enhanced patients’ physical activity levels over 3 months.</p>

<title>Barriers to the Implementation of Health Promotion Interventions</title>
<p>The many months and the involved paths taken to design, garner support for, implement, revise, and reimplement this study, and the discouraging recruitment rate, yielded numerous insights into the barriers to putting health promotion interventions into practice. Barriers are of various kinds, for example, financial, motivational, and executive. Here, barriers have been categorized by the different participants in the research process, namely, health care providers, administrative personnel, researchers, and patients.</p>
<sec id="section2-1524839910392991">
<title>Barriers for Providers</title>
<p>Lack of time and reimbursement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839910392991">Ainsworth &amp; Youmans, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839910392991">Becker &amp; Janz, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839910392991">Kennedy &amp; Meeuwisse, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839910392991">Manson, Skerrett, Greenland, &amp; VanItallie, 2004</xref>) are the preeminent obstacles that health care providers face in participating in health promotion interventions. Several providers contacted for participation in this study declined, citing lack of time. There is a dearth of scientific evidence on physical activity counseling in the primary care settings as a pragmatic tool to contain health care costs. This lack of data may discourage insurance companies from supporting reimbursement for physical activity counseling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839910392991">Magan &amp; Sanner, 2002</xref>). This paucity of evidence represents, simultaneously, a challenge for providers and an opportunity for researchers. Recent cost analyses of health behavior interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839910392991">Cobiac, Vos, &amp; Barendregt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839910392991">Graves et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839910392991">Groessl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839910392991">Romé, Persson, Ekdahl, &amp; Gard, 2009</xref>) indicate cost-effectiveness of physical activity education and behavioral counseling, adding support to the value of physical activity recommendations as a disease- and disability-prevention strategy. Isolated initiatives have been implemented by insurance companies and governments that establish greater financial incentives, such as reimbursement and rebates, for providers for health promotion activities in the primary care setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839910392991">Ampt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839910392991">Freudenheim, 2008</xref>), and for patients for engaging in physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910392991">Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Other deterrents to health care providers’ routinely counseling patients on physical activity include cost, practice capacity, and availability of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839910392991">Ampt et al., 2009</xref>); inadequate knowledge of specific physical activity recommendations to make (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839910392991">Kennedy &amp; Meeuwisse, 2003</xref>), and resources to refer patients to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839910392991">Walsh, Swangard, Davis, &amp; McPhee, 1999</xref>); low self-efficacy for their ability to change patients’ participation in physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910392991">Guo, Gottlieb, Smith, Huang, &amp; Huang, 2002</xref>); and the hesitation engendered by the providers’ own failure to meet physical activity recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839910392991">Lapp, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Barriers for Administrative Personnel</title>
<p>The time and labor demands of a research project, added to the usual work that administrative personnel are required to do, are greeted with little or no enthusiasm, and indeed, often with antagonism. This is especially so if personnel in health care practices do not share the passion, of researchers and providers, for the intervention. Although it may seem that the provider’s willingness to participate in a project signifies the involvement, and guarantees the effort, of the administrative personnel, this is not always so. The intervention, despite enjoying the organization’s support on the record, may not be backed up by actual communication with, recruitment of, and data collection from patients if the administrative personnel are not committed to the project. The implementation of this study suffered greatly from the barriers faced by personnel at the health care establishments. Participant recruitment was impeded, and numerous opportunities missed, owing to the deficiency of human resources to be applied to the study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839910392991">Sims, Smith, Duffy, and Hilton (1998)</xref> listed several difficulties in recruitment, data collection, and follow-up that resonate with those encountered in this study, including the increased burden on personnel, and discrepancies in the expectations of patients and the actual study design. The burden on administrative personnel is practically impossible to eliminate owing to the heightened privacy regulations that have come into effect in the past few years, preventing direct access to patients for researchers. The funding of the study did not permit monetary compensation to be offered to the administrative personnel.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1524839910392991">
<title>Barriers for Researchers</title>
<p>The principal laments of researchers in human behavioral research are constrained access to participants and limited funding. Access to participants is rightly governed by several institutions, some of which are specially constituted to protect the rights of research participants. It is, however, close to impossible to achieve the goal of participant protection to universal satisfaction. Steps taken to ensure the adherence of research protocols to regulations invariably complicate the procedures that a researcher has to go through. A nationwide survey of epidemiologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839910392991">Ness, 2007</xref>) revealed that the majority felt that the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule had encumbered health research, adding time, effort, and cost to the process, without commensurately enhancing patient confidentiality. Respondents cited the increased burden on research personnel to engage in compliance procedures, the variability and confusion in the interpretation of HIPAA regulations by institutional review boards (IRBs) and individual researchers, and the heightened difficulty in accessing and recruiting patients for studies, leading in some cases to the abandonment of certain proposed studies.</p>
<p>The current study was in consonance with these findings, having labored under these constraints for a considerable period, with numerous iterations of institutional reviews, and approval from legal counsel for participating health care organizations and their IRBs. The design for this study went through several full committee reviews by the university IRB, entailing the expenditure of substantial resources for the various revisions and renewals. Since direct access to patients was out of the question for the researcher, mailing through health care providers’ offices had to be resorted to. This entailed applying to the administrative personnel of the offices to ensure that the information packets were dispatched accurately. It led to a time lag of a few weeks between the patient’s receipt of the solicitation for participation and the actual office visit wherein the intervention would take place, potentially weakening the salience of the study in the patient’s view. It obviated face-to-face clarification from the researcher on aspects of the study that may erroneously have appeared to be insurmountable barriers to patients. Moreover, in some cases, materials were mailed, in error, to patients of non-participating providers, or too late to enable the administration of the intervention during the consultation.</p>
<p>Mailing recruitment materials, rather than handing them over in person, also added greatly to the monetary expenditure on the study with first-class postage rates being required for a minimum of three communications between the researcher and each patient. Limited funding necessitates reliance on volunteers to administer and receive interventions and diminishes the assurance that a researcher may harbor of the participants’ embarking on the study and staying the course.</p>
<p>The administrative setup of certain health care organizations entails the routing of all communication, such as information and requests, through the administrative personnel, and inhibits direct interaction between the researcher and the health care provider. Much time was lost on various occasions in waiting to communicate with administrators, who would in turn communicate with the providers, and convey approval for a particular procedure to be implemented.</p>

<title>Barriers for Patients</title>
<p>In a world supersaturated with advertisements and marketing ploys, mostly geared to separate people from their money, any correspondence not directly related to one’s profession or social associates is likely to be perceived and treated as “junk mail”. It is highly probable that several of the mailed information packets soliciting participation in this study suffered this fate. The cover letter from the health care organization to endorse this study would presumably have lent it some credibility, but as it stopped at recommending, but did not require, the participation of patients in the study, it may have fallen short of elevating the study to a priority for patients. It is conceivable that even among patients who gave this study some consideration, superseding commitments, the reluctance to take on avoidable responsibilities, or the time lag between the invitation and the office visit prevented actual participation.</p>
<p>The incentive of a lucky draw (sweepstakes), an attempt to encourage participants to persist till the end of the study, is a rather weak one as it is gratification that is not guaranteed, for one, and delayed, even if it is realized, for another. Payment is generally welcomed, and some patients expressed verbally and in writing that they would have been more inclined to participate in the study if they were paid (at a time when no payment was being offered), or paid more than the study offered (at a time when payment was offered for participation). Against this appeal of monetary reward is set the reluctance of some individuals to divulge their social security numbers, which were compulsory information to be provided to the Internal Revenue Service. The requirement to include their social security number on the payment form dissuaded some patients from participating in the study, and resulted in three patients’ waiving payment although they graciously agreed to participate in the study (only one of these three patients actually completed the study).</p>
<p>The procedure for the conveyance of payment to the participants was not free from flaws, as complaints from a patient brought to light. To the knowledge of the researcher, five of the payment forms did not survive the chain of personnel and offices between the funding source and the patients. The lapse was remedied following an investigation by the university business office executive. This occurrence is a caveat to researchers relying unreservedly on the smooth and error-free functioning of office procedures. Prudence calls for the monitoring of every process involved in the implementation of the study to discover and correct departures from the ideal.</p>
<p>Another barrier to successful recruitment to this study was the discomfort generated by the fact that it had to do with physical activity. Despite the fact that the word “exercise” was carefully excluded from all the preliminary information regarding this study so as not to discourage potential participants, in keeping with the advice in a report on provider counseling for obesity management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839910392991">Wyatt, 2005</xref>), an early conclusion that several patients jumped to, on being presented with this study, was that if it assessed physical activity, it would require them to enroll in a program of exercise, expending time and energy. This stimulated a few and deterred many, as comments from some participants revealed. Although the idea that physical activity is beneficial on many levels is widespread, a disinclination to commit to a structured program of physical activity exists in many individuals. Lack of time and conflicting schedules and priorities were cited by many as reasons not to participate in the study. An explanation of the goals and procedures of the study succeeded in persuading some patients to participate. But such face-to-face explanations are extremely difficult to achieve in conditions of heightened privacy regulations, and in studies that aim to recruit large numbers of participants. It is very likely that the numerous patients whose participation was solicited in vain, via mailings of packets detailing the nature of the study, chose not to participate because the confusion regarding the requirement to enroll in a program could not be resolved in the absence of a conversation with the researcher.</p>
<p>The experience of receiving only 25 returned sets of questionnaires (of which only 24 could be used for analysis) following the express willingness and signed consent forms of 41 patients was disenchanting, representing, as it did, not only a considerable waste of energy and expense on recruiting the participants and mailing materials to them but also the inadvisability of pinning too much hope on seemingly successful recruitment. The initial 61% response at baseline was followed by a drop to 54% at 1 month, and then a modest rise to 59% at 3 months. The 41% drop-out observed in this study was comparable with that experienced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839910392991">Stovitz, VanWormer, Center, and Bremer (2005)</xref> and far greater than that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910392991">Kelley and Abraham (2004)</xref>. Against this dismal attrition may be placed the possibility that reminders through mail or over telephone could have redirected defaulters to the path of compliance with the requirements of the study that they had consented to participate in. However the known resistance among study participants to fielding repeated communications, and the ill-considered optimism of the researcher, precluded the execution of reminders.</p>

<title>Addressing Barriers to the Implementation of Health Promotion Interventions</title>
<p>Various solutions to the barriers detailed herein suggest themselves. The foremost support to the design and implementation of a research project would clearly be financial. Monetary compensation could possibly change the attitude and effort of administrative personnel in health promotion interventions in health care settings. Studies involving large populations of patients represent increased work of such proportions to office staff that even an apparently modest compensation per completed questionnaire collected would add up to a considerable sum for the staff, and contribute to robust data collection, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839910392991">Kreuter, Chheda, and Bull’s (2000)</xref> study design. A report on the recruitment of primary health care providers and seniors for a clinical study in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839910392991">Sellors et al., 2002</xref>) specifies remuneration to physicians and staff for participation in research as a key to success.</p>
<p>Promising institutional and political initiatives to promote physical activity counseling, besides incentives offered by insurance companies and advocacy by physician groups, include the economic and administrative health-promoting and disease-preventing strategies featured in the health care plan of the current government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839910392991">Obama for America, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Besides financial incentives, patent commitment on the part of the health care providers, leading to the sense of a health promotion ethos of the establishment, could also act as a motivator to personnel, as a top-down effect. This effect could be injected with added excitement through intrapractice and interoffice competitions in the delivery of physical activity interventions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839910392991">American College of Sports Medicine’s (2008)</xref> “Exercise is Medicine,” a movement advocating physical activity recommendations by health care providers, is an encouraging step in this direction, as is “Americans in Motion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839910392991">Lapp, 2005</xref>), a campaign promoting physical activity among family physicians.</p>
<p>The Seniors Medication Assessment Research Trial Group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839910392991">Sellors et al., 2002</xref>) emphasized the value of the involvement of a family physician in the recruitment of other family physicians and the educational role played by clinical research nurses in the training of office staff. An advocate within the health care organization, preferably an influential provider, who would inspire participation in health promotion programs and research, would further this cause immensely. The current study benefitted tremendously from the advocacy provided by certain health care providers in each organization that was approached for participation. Preliminary discussions with the primary contact in each health care organization led to introductions to the network of providers and personnel in each practice. Deliberations on the study protocol, in small groups, followed. Providers who consented to administer the interventions, and the office personnel associated with them, entered the study. Modifications as recommended by them were made to the study protocol to maximize recruitment and minimize the burden on the providers and office personnel. Negative feedback from the nonparticipating providers and staff was also taken into account in revising the protocol.</p>
<p>The most desirable scenario for the realization of the commitment to health promotion would be the establishment of dedicated health promotion resources—personnel, programs, and materials—within health care organizations. Such partnerships within the organization, besides reducing the burden on primary care providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839910392991">Ackermann, Deyo, &amp; LoGerfo, 2005</xref>), would also reinforce the salience of physical activity for the patient.</p>
<p>The providers’ barrier of insufficient knowledge of physical activity recommendations, and of specific programs and resources to direct patients to, may be addressed by enriching the providers’ basic and continuing education content with public health research information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839910392991">American Association of Retired Persons [AARP], 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839910392991">Becker &amp; Janz, 1990</xref>), and by the provision of physical activity resources to providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839910392991">Pinto, Goldstein, &amp; Marcus, 1998</xref>). This could take the shape of community collaborations, e.g., with the Parks and Recreation department, or with other local professionals and facilities, including fitness clubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839910392991">Sattler &amp; Doniek, 1997</xref>), and by publications of catalogs of resources to be disseminated to patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839910392991">AARP, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839910392991">Ackermann et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Improved access to participant populations for researchers would go a long way to encourage research, and the application of findings to enhanced public health. Public policy and institutions could render help even while maintaining the strict privacy regulations in place, by setting up postal discounts for research-related correspondence, and by making facilities such as gymnasiums and testing equipment available freely and easily for research activities.</p>
<p>Funding, for research expenses and participant compensation, holds the power to propel greater recruitment rates and improve data collection by supporting all the parties involved. Several commercial establishments that set aside funds for community development are policy bound to donate only to organizations registered as “not-for-profit.” As a researcher is not classified as such, these funds, which could take the shape of prizes and discounts for participants, are unavailable to be used for the implementation of research projects although such projects may fulfill the spirit of the requirement of benefitting the community. Raising awareness of the need for research, and the benefits that devolve to the community, could encourage a modification of commercial establishments’ policy regarding donations, to aid the implementation of small, but important, research projects.</p>
<p>In addition to financial support for health promotion interventions is the issue of enhancing the attractiveness and the quality of the intervention itself. Collaborations between physical activity researchers and the following entities have great potential: (a) health communication experts to craft the most appealing messages; (b) economics and marketing specialists to design effective incentives for all participants; (c) IRBs for the most efficient study designs that protect participants’ rights and permit research questions to be explored smoothly; (d) health and exercise science departments for systematic physical activity programs, and human resources, for example, trained students seeking hands-on experience; (e) community physical activity facilities for free access or discounted memberships; (f) biomedical engineers for improved anthropometric, physiological, and biochemical measurement devices; (g) insurance companies for reimbursement to providers and incentives to clients for health promotion; and (h) funding agencies to support research. It is hoped that the coming together of various streams of expertise and technological advances will pave the way to ever more rewarding research and practice.</p>
