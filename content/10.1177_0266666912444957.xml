<abstract>
<p>Livestock are a key asset for the global poor. However, access to relevant information is a critical issue for both livestock development practitioners and the poor themselves. Therefore, the authors describe the development of the 3D Animal Health Resource Room (AHRR), a web-based environment to disseminate educational materials on key animal health and production constraints faced by the poor in Bolivia and India. The aim of the analysis was to explore the applicability and demand for a 3D resource as a ‘lead technology' or if the technology suited ‘lead users' only. The authors tested the 3D AHRR across seven non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in India and Bolivia. The results found that users prioritized the level of interaction or the social experience in the 3D space over content and immersion</p>

<p>Poor livestock keepers have a demand for knowledge which can rapidly outstrip the ability of organizations responsible for knowledge provision.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Livestock keeping is an activity comprising the livelihoods of two-thirds of the global poor (Randolph et al. 2010). Poor livestock keepers face many challenges in securing income from their livestock. Issues range from environmental disasters such as drought and flooding to epidemic and endemic livestock disease to inaccurate information regarding livestock management and husbandry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266666912444957">International Fund for Agricultural Development 2004</xref>). Unlike some topics, the poor are very aware of their knowledge gaps in terms of animal health (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266666912444957">Tavares et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Indeed, studies in India, Kenya and Bolivia have illustrated that the poor are active seekers of livestock-related knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266666912444957">Heffernan and Misturelli 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266666912444957">Fuller 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, it is the limited sources of this knowledge that is so problematic for the communities involved.</p>
<p>For most poor farmers, livestock-related information is obtained from informal networks, i.e. friends and relatives, regardless of the country, production system or income-level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266666912444957">International Fund for Agricultural Development 2004</xref>). However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666912444957">Heeks (2010</xref>: 22) noted in relation to social capital and information: <disp-quote>
<p>“it is not the strong, close ties of your immediate family and friends that help (family and friends only know what you already know). Instead, it is the comparatively weaker ties of more distant social connections that are most advantageous. Yet the poor lack such connections.”</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Such statements have resonance with regard to livestock-related knowledge: poor farmers dependent upon closed knowledge loops can only ever access the level of knowledge of the most learned member of their group. However, at present, even these familial communication pathways of livestock knowledge are under pressure. Indeed, parents noted that as children spent more time in school their interest in and ability to draw upon customary knowledge becomes limited. As such, traditional knowledge regarding livestock management and care appears to be in decline (Heffernan et al. 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266666912444957">Lin and Heffernan 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Concurrently, formal channels for delivering livestock knowledge in southern countries have also declined. Historically, government-run extension and veterinary services provide livestock-related information to farmers. However, the structural adjustment policies of the 1980s left the veterinary services in many southern countries with insufficient manpower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266666912444957">de Haan et al. 2001</xref>). The legacy of the poorly resourced departments was, and remains, the inability to meet the needs of the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0266666912444957">Shibanda 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266666912444957">Heffernan and Misturelli 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266666912444957">Ahuja et al. 2003</xref>). In many countries non-governmental organizations have tried to fill gaps in livestock service provision. However, these institutions often lack appropriate technical knowledge.</p>
<p>From the outset, there are many low-tech means of delivering information to poor livestock keepers, ranging from traditional extension agents to farmer field schools to trainings offered from private sector information providers. And the literature on the impact and uptake of these forms of knowledge transfer is large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266666912444957">Wadsworth 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666912444957">Morton and Matthewman 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266666912444957">Morton and Wilson 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266666912444957">Sasidhar and Chandel 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266666912444957">Chapman and Tripp 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266666912444957">Groeneweg et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266666912444957">Sabvasachi and Rangnekar 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>However, in recent years, the emerging field of ICT4D has been proffered as a key means of filling knowledge gaps in southern countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266666912444957">Unwin 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666912444957">Heeks 2010</xref>), particularly in relation to agriculture (Glendinning and Ficarelli 2011). Nevertheless, while the development of electronic learning tools for crop farmers has largely piggybacked off traditional extension models (Zipj 1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266666912444957">Adupa and Asaba 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266666912444957">Glendenning and Ficarelli 2011</xref>), tools for the livestock sector lagged behind. While recently this gap has been addressed, the major focus has been technologies aimed at livestock keepers themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266666912444957">Nielsen and Heffernan 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266666912444957">Heffernan and Nielsen 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266666912444957">Nielsen et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266666912444957">Lin and Heffernan 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266666912444957">Yu and Heffernan 2011</xref>). Technologies aimed at their knowledge providers have been largely ignored.</p>
<p>Therefore, the aim of the following paper is not to compare high tech vs. low technology knowledge transfer tools, nor to extol the virtues or analyse the appropriateness of techno-centric systems. Rather, the aim is more modest: to explore the feasibility of a 3D on-line resource, the Animal Health Resource Room (AHRR), to share technical information regarding animal health and management to livestock practitioners working among poor livestock-keeping communities in India and Bolivia. At first glance, 3D may not be considered by the development community to be a ‘first fit’ technology for poor farmers in the South. However, 3D applications are already diffusing from North to South (largely as part of gaming applications). Further, given the rapid advance of broadband in southern countries (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266666912444957">Lin and Heffernan 2009</xref>), the 3D platform offered a unique opportunity to identify issues related to both present and future user demand.</p>
<p>The concept of ‘lead users’ was first described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266666912444957">Von Hippel (1986</xref>:1) as those ‘users whose present strong needs will become general in a marketplace months or years in the future.’ If 3D is likely to become ‘general in the market place’ in years to come, clearly explicating demand issues now may better inform future ICT4D applications. Intertwined with the notion of demand is the skill level of the users involved. As such, the study explored perceptions of the ‘ease of use’ and the ‘usability’ of the 3D Room as a proxy for user skill. In this manner, the use of 3D was underpinned by two questions framing the wider debate on ICT4D:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Is 3D a ‘lead technology’ drawing on wider notions of ‘lead users’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266666912444957">Patel 2010</xref>) where the technology involved responds to the needs of the ‘early adopters’ but is of little interest to the wider group of users?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Or will the use of 3D be limited by the skills of Internet users as outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666912444957">James (2011</xref>)?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The advantages of a 3D approach with regard to delivery and functionality are as follows:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Content can be visually portrayed in a single environment, rather than as a sequence of different pages as in a traditional 2D format.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The immersive elements of a 3D environment can enhance the participation of the user and thereby, support greater learning.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Drawbacks for developing country users include the high network consumption required for a 3D environment in addition to slow network speeds (defined as 56Kb/s or lower). The tool was disseminated to livestock practitioners in two countries: Bolivia and India, both of which have invested heavily in broadband infrastructure. Prior to describing the methods and results, the conceptual underpinning of the AHRR is briefly explored. Further, as the content was developed and tested prior to the creation of the 3D AHRR the design, development and results of the field-testing of the learning content are described.</p>
<sec id="section2-0266666912444957">
<title>Virtual learning and managed learning environments</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266666912444957">Pot (2004</xref>:2) noted: “a virtual learning environment is regarded as an immersive virtual reality system which shows a 3D environment.” Therefore, both ‘interaction’ and ‘immersion’ are key features of VLE’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266666912444957">Wake and Lisgarten 2003</xref>). Alternatively, some researchers refer to Managed Learning Environments or MLEs, where MLEs are defined as “the whole range of systems and processes…that contribute directly, or indirectly, to learning and the management of that learning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266666912444957">JISC 2003</xref>:2). The Animal Health Resource Room falls more comfortably under this wider rubric as the levels of interaction and immersion are aimed to support the management of learning material.</p>
<p>As such, the 3D AHRR is defined as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>An on-line resource where practitioners can access demand-led, learning materials regarding animal health and production in an ‘immersive’ environment.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Most VLE’s however, contain Reusable Learning Objects (RLOs).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0266666912444957">
<title>Reusable learning objects</title>
<p>RLOs package learning materials in small digital chunks (generally comprising 2 to 15 minutes of a learner’s time) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266666912444957">Holzinger et al. 2005</xref>). Therefore, a key part of the concept relates to size. Thus, RLOs have greater flexibility, adaptability and lower distribution costs than traditional learning material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266666912444957">Brightman 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0266666912444957">Wagner 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266666912444957">Semmens 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0266666912444957">Smith 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266666912444957">Moral and Cernea 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the context of the Animal Health Resource Room, RLOs (podcasts and pamphlets) were used. In order to support greater uptake (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266666912444957">Wiley 2000</xref>), the instructional material was divided into modules (each module was limited to a single topic or disease), and categorized by different countries, languages, species, and file formats (streaming video and PDF). All podcasts were 8 minutes or less in duration.</p>
<p>The methods utilized in the design, development and testing of the 3D AHR Room, are detailed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0266666912444957">
<title>Developing and creating demand-led content</title>
<p>In creating an appropriate on-line resource, the first step is to create the content. However, as the aim of the study was to evaluate the usability of the 3D interface and not the content per se, the demand for the content had to be assured and therefore previously tested. To assess demand, over 1200 livestock-keeping households in Bolivia (n = 514)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0266666912444957">1</xref></sup> and India (n = 714)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0266666912444957">2</xref></sup> were asked to report the incidence of livestock disease over the previous 12 months. Communities were identified via government and non-governmental institutions working with poor livestock keepers in both countries. Purposive sampling was utilized to target poor livestock-keeping households at the community level.</p>
<p>Drawing on participatory practices (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266666912444957">Tavares et al. 2011</xref>), farmers were asked, in a series of open-ended questions, to prioritize the livestock diseases with the greatest impact on their farming operation in addition to the key constraints to their farming operation. In this manner, the farmers were encouraged to describe issues in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of these diseases in their own words, which were later drawn upon in the development of the learning material.</p>
<p>From the survey, 16 pamphlets and 22 podcasts were created in the following languages: Oriya, Tamil, Spanish and Aymara (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266666912444957">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Each of the modules detailed disease diagnosis, prevention and treatment. Previous studies tested a subset of farmers (n = 275) with regard to knowledge transfer. Therefore, farmers were tested for knowledge levels before and after exposure to the media (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266666912444957">Nielsen and Heffernan 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266666912444957">Heffernan and Nielsen 2007</xref>). Pre and post-exposure responses were scored via a Likert-scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266666912444957">Nielsen and Heffernan 2006</xref>) and the learning scores were normalized and then tabulated. Therefore, prior to inclusion in the AHRR, all material was tested for appropriateness both in relation to meeting the direct knowledge needs of the farmers involved and the ability to successfully transfer knowledge.</p>

<title>Creating the 3D AHRR: design and layout</title>
<p>The authors utilized Virtools to implement the 3D platform while the models for the room were created in MAYA and 3D Studio Max. As illustrated below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266666912444957">Figure 1</xref>), the podcasts and pamphlets were presented on three walls of the AHR room. The room was 30 units long x 30 units wide x 10 units high. To mimic a traditional room in a museum or gallery, the walls were lightly textured and the floor was covered in a wood-like material, with a solid blue ceiling. To create the textures, a 128 x 128 pixel picture was applied to each model i.e. the walls, floor and ceiling.</p>

</fig>
<p>Nevertheless, a virtual room is not a static construct, rather the user must be able to interact or control the on-line environment. Avatars are generally the means by which users explore/interact with the environment and indeed, with each other. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266666912444957">Leung and Chen (2003</xref>), key features in a virtual environment to enhance multi-modal interaction between Avatars include elements such as directional sound and the creation of eye gazes, hand gestures, lip synchronization and facial expressions.</p>
<p>Within the context of the Animal Health Resource Room, the Avatar needed to be able to explore the learning material with the user. Equally importantly, since the target user group will represent a large variety of practitioners in both India and Bolivia, the Avatar itself needed to be neutral and non-offensive. Therefore, the Avatar was created to be as stylized as possible to avoid users from recognizing either distinct features or specific cultural referents.</p>

<p>As the content consisted of podcasts and pamphlets, both types of media needed to be displayed in a manner to enable the user to easily choose the desired material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0266666912444957">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>As shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0266666912444957">Figure 2</xref>, on each wall there is an easily visible flag to denote the country in which the learning material applies, i.e. India or Bolivia. Users can click on the desired podcast or pamphlet and the background script will capture the user’s input message and launch the material accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0266666912444957">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Further, the podcast playback interface has two options for the user to choose. The user can either play the FLV formatted video instantly, or download the higher quality format to further disseminate the video to other platforms. In India, users can choose between either the Tamil or Oriya language versions, while in Bolivia both Spanish and Aymara language versions of the podcasts were created.</p>
<p>The pamphlets are presented in the 3D environment similarly to posters hanging on a wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0266666912444957">Figure 4</xref>). As with the podcasts, a flag illustrated the national orientation of the learning material and users could choose the language of interest. When the user clicks on a pamphlet, a PDF file opens.</p>

<title>Instructions for users</title>
<p>A vocal instruction is played after the user enters the room, which generally introduces the content and how to navigate. As such, three ‘Wave Player’ scripts were created to link the instructions to the Avatar’s location. However, in order to prevent long vocal messages from distracting users, visual instructions were also deemed necessary to explain the content of the room.</p>
<p>For each set of learning materials, a set of visual instructions was presented to the user, prior to the Avatar reaching the screen. As user immersion was deemed critical, a 3D transparent screen was created to combine the advantages of a 2D frame with the critical features of a 3D environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0266666912444957">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In this manner, when the Avatar approaches the screen for the first time, the instructions ascend vertically. The script for the 3D instructional panel measures the distance between the Avatar and the target and when the Avatar nears, the panel will rise to its initial position in front of the Avatar for a 10-second period and then disappear.</p>

<title>The testing protocol</title>
<p>Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in the testing process in order to evaluate accessibility, compatibility, usability, as well as the functionality of the 3D AHRR. Testing was carried out by five institutions (including two satellite offices) in India and Bolivia, ranging from community-based organizations (CBOs) to national-level non-governmental organizations (NGOs). All of the organizations involved had livestock-focused projects or programmes and were involved in the provision of farmer training, at the community level. In total, 16 staff members participated in the survey.</p>
<p>To assess attitudes and perceptions towards the Animal Health Resource Room, an on-line questionnaire was created and distributed to study participants (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text1-0266666912444957">Box 1</xref>). Follow-up interviews were held with participants by phone.</p>

<sec id="section1a-0266666912444957">
<label>Box 1.</label>
<p>Q1. Did you have any difficulty accessing the room?</p>
<p>Q2. How long did it take to load?</p>
<p>Q3. How do you feel about the control of the avatar? Was it easy or hard?</p>
<p>Q4. What is your impression regarding the general layout of the environment?</p>
<p>Q5. How long did it take you find the material you were interested in?</p>
<p>Q6. Please indicate your overall opinion of this tool.</p>
</sec>
</boxed-text>
<p>The questions were derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266666912444957">Aladwani and Palvia’s (2002</xref>) standard survey to assess user-perceived web quality. For questions 3, 4 and 6, in addition to an open-ended question, respondents were also asked to choose from a multiple-choice Likert scale ranging from very poor, poor, acceptable, good and very good. With regard to Question 2, which measures download speeds, participants were requested to perform the test using their computer’s clock and mark the number of minutes involved.</p>

<p>Not surprising more remote users (in Oruro in Bolivia and Orissa in India) had greater difficulty accessing the system. Despite such issues, overall opinion of the room’s utility was positive (Q6). Equally, the content of the room was considered well presented (Q5), as on average across the institutions, users were able to find the material of interest within 3 minutes. Nevertheless, as illustrated below, comments on the Avatar and navigation were less positive (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text2-0266666912444957">Box 2</xref>).</p>

<p>From the responses, overall the 3D room was considered innovative, and the content good. However, the download time was considered problematic, as was the navigation of the Avatar. While users found the tool interesting, there was a feeling that the level of navigation required would slow down busy practitioners. Other issues included the desire to include additional material within the room and to be able to interact with other practitioners. In this manner, practitioners were interested in a more collaborative learning environment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0266666912444957">Okada 2004</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-0266666912444957">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>From the outset, two wider questions framed the study. First, if a 3D application could be considered a ‘lead technology’, what were the important elements of user demand? And second, was the level of ‘Internet skills’ a major constraint to 3D?</p>
<p>The results revealed that on both counts the answer is no. While 3D is not a common framework for the delivery of agricultural information to practitioners in the South, most of the practitioners had some experience with 3D. Therefore, from being unknown or a ‘harbinger of the future’ the practitioners involved in the study were both ready and willing to receive material in this manner. However, the results of the testing illustrated that while the 3D room was visually engaging and users enjoyed the level of interaction, the download times, with repeated use, would likely be viewed as cumbersome.</p>
<p>Interestingly, users offered a number of innovations. First, participants were keen to interact with each other and use the room as a social space. Therefore, while the initial design layout was to foster the dissemination of information, this function was only viewed as part of the overall potential utility of the room. Practitioners could see the value in sharing learning experiences with both individuals in their own organizations and those in outside institutions. Second, the movement of the Avatar was deemed unnecessary. Thus rather than an Avatar to negotiate the room, ideas emerged such as chat boxes where practitioners could negotiate and comment on the content, as themselves. Other innovations also emerged in relation to the content. In addition to the existing pamphlets and podcasts, the practitioners were also interested in user-generated content or uploading material of interest from a wider variety of sources.</p>

<sec id="section11-0266666912444957">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Poor livestock keepers have a demand for knowledge regarding the livestock in their care. This need for specialized information, however, can rapidly outstrip the ability of those organizations responsible for knowledge provision: the non-governmental and community-based organizations in the South. The creation of the Animal Health Resource Room is one such solution to this problem. By creating the Room in 3D the overall aim was to support both user choice and immersion in the learning material.</p>
<p>The content of the room was based upon an extensive participatory process with poor livestock keepers themselves. Thus, from the outset the demand for the material was assured, enabling the researchers to focus on identifying the demand for the 3D AHHR itself. However, the study illustrates that content, choice and immersion are insufficient to foster demand. Rather the practitioners appeared to prioritize interaction. All of their suggested innovations revolved around enhancing the social experience of the AHRR.</p>
<p>Therefore, the AHRR in its present format, while meeting the criteria for immersion and user-interaction, lacked key features deemed more desirable by the audience involved. As such, the results illustrate that while the content of any such VLE can be good, the vehicle in which it is disseminated is of critical importance. In this manner, good content alone is not sufficient for a viable VLE.</p>
<p>However, the study found that contrary to prevailing wisdom regarding the lack of interest or relevance of 3D virtual learning environments for institutions in the Global South, such an approach was viewed as desirable and relevant. Hence, the Animal Health Resource Room is an initial foray in the creation of a new generation of applications which strive to enable poor farmers in the South and the institutions which serve them, to engage in today’s global ‘knowledge society’.</p>
