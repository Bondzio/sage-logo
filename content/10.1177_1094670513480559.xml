<abstract>
<p>In this article, we propose an analytical tool, named the <italic>Workload Profile Diagnosis </italic>(<italic>WPD</italic>)<italic> method</italic>, to evaluate the performance and quality of incident management (IM) systems in information technology (IT) service factories. Based on the normalization of ticket assignment delay and resolution time by their respective service-level agreement, the method computes and plots the spreading of ticket data on a log-log chart. By comparing the actual and desired distribution values in specific areas, the WPD method diagnoses specific problems and issues in the performance of IM systems such as resource and skill allocation and abnormal behavior, and identifies opportunities for automated resolution or assignment of tickets, increases or decreases in the resources and skills needed, and ultimately aims to strike a better balance between productivity and service quality. In addition to an in-depth description of the WPD method, this article presents its application in the diagnostics of four service pools of a large IT service factory. An empirical study conducted in the IT service factory shows that most of the problems identified by the WPD method were indeed present in the service pools, therefore providing evidence of the validity of the WPD method. We conclude discussing how managers can use the method to detect and evaluate transformational opportunities to increase productivity and service quality in a systematic manner.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Information technology (IT) service factories are mass-scale systems set to deliver IT services using factory-like production methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1094670513480559">de Souza, Pinhanez, and Cavalcante 2011</xref>). For the last 3 years, we have been systematically studying a particular large IT service factory, we dubbed for confidentiality reasons the Big Service Factory (or simply BSF), analyzing existing process data, conducting interviews, and proposing methods and tools to improve productivity, service quality, and, ultimately, customer satisfaction. In this article, we present and validate a new method, based on incident handling timing data, to characterize the performance and identify productivity and service quality issues in IT service factories. This method is called the <italic>Workload Profile Diagnosis </italic>(<italic>WPD</italic>). It aims at diagnosing major incident management (IM) issues and challenges in terms of productivity and service quality.</p>
<p>Although in recent years the IT-related services industry has had an increasing interest in science, design, and management of service systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1094670513480559">Maglio, Kieliszzewski, and Spohrer 2010</xref>), the progress in the development and establishment of methods, best practices, and tools applicable to the complexity and scale of the modern IT service factory is limited. Some recent research work described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1094670513480559">Rouse and Basole (2010</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1094670513480559">Qiu (2009</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1094670513480559">Banavar et al. (2010</xref>) have suggested models for IT service delivery systems, but they have not proposed systematic methods of performance evaluation and characterization of problems and issues.</p>
<p>The research presented in this article focuses on suborganizations of the BSF that are assigned to handling IT-related incidents. An incident can be defined as “any event which does not form part of the standard operation of a service and which causes, or may cause, an interruption or a reduction in service quality (2000). Incidents are, by definition, unpredictable and often demand rapid allocation of skilled resources for their resolution and returning a service back to normal. Examples of typical incidents in IT services provision include the decrease in processing speed of a server, and the failure to complete a backup procedure.</p>
<p>In Service Science, there has been a significant amount of research proposing methods for dealing with issues in queue management of IM systems: A good review of such methods is provided in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1094670513480559">Fitzsimmons and Fitzsimmons (2004</xref>), and recent work has extended it to consider human patience issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1094670513480559">Mandelbaum and Zeltyn 2007</xref>). However, such methods basically focus on estimating capacity and managing queue waiting time, and these are hardly the main issues in an IT service factory scenario. More complex analyses in the context of small delivery systems have been explored in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1094670513480559">Oliva and Sterman (2001</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1094670513480559">Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1094670513480559">Puga-Leal and Pereira (2009</xref>) but with limited application in the high-volume context of IT service factories such as the BSF.</p>
<p>This article starts by describing the typical organization of IT service factories and their IM systems. We then shift to the WPD method. To this end, we start off describing the first step toward it: namely, a method to graph the performance of an IM system called <italic>Workload Profile Charts</italic> (<italic>WPC</italic>s) and discuss how different areas in the chart have different meanings. Based on those special areas of a WPC, we discuss the mathematical foundations and define the actual <italic>WPD </italic>method to diagnose problems and issues in IM systems. Next, we show the application of the method in the diagnostic of four IM systems of the BSF, yielding a list of possible productivity and service quality problems. We then provide evidence supporting the proposed method suggesting that the diagnostics resulting from its application are by and large accurate, thus providing an initial validation of it. We conclude by exploring how management can use the WPD method and discussing its limitations, as well as suggesting opportunities for future work.</p>

<title>IM Systems in IT Service Factories</title>
<p>The last decades witnessed a profound transformation in the ways that computing and data processing are provided to organizations. The model marked by in-house data centers is being gradually replaced by a scenario in which most firms outsource the management of their IT infrastructure to <italic>IT outsourcing</italic> service providers, also known in the IT service industry as <italic>strategic outsourcing</italic> providers. The IT outsourcing services industry has become a large global industry including both the traditional IT companies, such as IBM and HP, and entirely new, dedicated enterprises such as Infosys and Tata. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1094670513480559">Rouse (2009</xref>) offers a good review of the state of academic knowledge on IT outsourcing.</p>
<p>Service quality in IT outsourcing services is often regulated by a <italic>service-level agreement </italic>(<italic>SLA</italic>), establishing, among other things, the minimum capacity of the IT infrastructure; the metrics of quality of service (QoS) in the data communication infrastructure; the frequency of updates and upgrades of the infrastructure; and the minimum response times for different types of incidents that may affect the IT infrastructure availability, speed, and data capacity. Meeting the SLAs of their customers is a key objective of IT service companies not only because the violation of the SLA often incurs financial penalties but also because service quality and customer satisfaction are strongly related to meeting the SLA provisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1094670513480559">Goo et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-1094670513480559">
<title>IT Service Factories</title>
<p>The delivery of IT outsourcing services is often made through very large IT service organizations whose operations involve innumerous support teams (sometimes up to thousands of IT workers) that take care of networks of thousands of servers, routers, storage systems, firewalls, and other IT equipment from multiple firms simultaneously. We refer to those IT service organizations as <italic>IT service factories</italic> following the definition of the term proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1094670513480559">de Souza, Pinhanez, and Cavalcante (2011)</xref>. The use of the term <italic>factory</italic> is purposively chosen there, and applicable in our context, to reflect the fact that those organizations borrow a great deal of structural resemblance to traditional manufacturing factories, including some of their known problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1094670513480559">de Souza, Pinhanez, and Cavalcante 2011</xref>). IT service factories have been established in many places across the world, but especially in emerging markets such as India, Brazil, and the like. Employees from IT service factories are very specialized, focused on repetitive tasks, and often use performance metrics that resemble the days of Henry Ford. The BSF can be considered a typical example of an IT service factory and it devotes a large portion of its employees to IT outsourcing services.</p>
<p>An increasing participation of people and management costs in the total cost of provisioning IT is another driver of this work. A study by International Data Corporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1094670513480559">Bailey 2009</xref>) shows that the cost of management in IT provisioning centers has increased more than 600% from 1996 to 2012, with the participation in the total cost increasing from less than 20% in 1996 to more than 50% in 2012. In contrast, less than two decades ago, the cost of IT was dominated by the cost of hardware. One of its main implications is the shift in priority toward finding better ways to manage people in large IT service factories. Yet, traditional computer science has paid little attention to the issue, still considering computer-level problems as its great source of goals and challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1094670513480559">Brooks and Frederick 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The increased interest from the IT industry in Service Science started in the first decade of the 21st century, and has produced significant research work on people management issues in data centers, particularly in the context of IT service factories. Grounded in qualitative studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1094670513480559">Barrett et al. (2004</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1094670513480559">Haber, Kandogan, and Maglio (2011</xref>) have shown that the maintenance activities in IT service systems are complex and require sophisticated collaborative structures, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1094670513480559">de Souza, Pinhanez, and Cavalcante (2011)</xref> have shown that such activities require many sources of information and knowledge, both explicit and tacit. We have no knowledge of data-driven analytical methods to support people management issues of IT systems such as the one described in this article.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1094670513480559">
<title>IM and Ticket Servicing</title>
<p>The provisioning of IT outsourcing services in IT service factories is often organized into suborganizations or departments that handle different support and maintenance activities related to the IT infrastructures of their customers. These are the most urgent and critical tasks required to maintain customers’ IT infrastructure running. In particular, a key concern is to recover from incidents, that is, to reestablish normal operations as quickly as possible with the least possible impact on customers’ business. IM systems often operate in a 24/7 regime with multiple work shifts. The focal point of this study is in fact the IM system—a complex arrangement of people, tools, processes, work practices, and IT infrastructures—that handles incoming incidents. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1094670513480559">Figure 1</xref> shows the typical structure of an IM system.</p>

</fig>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1094670513480559">Figure 1</xref>, problems in an IT infrastructure are detected both by hardware and software sensors inside the infrastructure and by user complaints usually channeled through a service desk. It is common in IT service factories to record all the relevant information relative to one particular incident in what is often called a <italic>ticket.</italic> Tickets are managed with the help of an <italic>IM Tool</italic> that aggregates all the information about incidents and often supports the assignment and coordination of the IT workers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1094670513480559">Figure 1</xref>). As discussed before, the <italic>SLA</italic> establishes a formal instrument to regulate the quality of the service to be provided, and in particular, to determine how fast incidents have to be investigated and resolved to guarantee the least possible disruption in IT infrastructure. Typically, a ranked classification of incidents is defined by the customer organization to associate types of incidents with the impact of the unavailability of services in the functioning of a customer’s organization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1094670513480559">
<title>Service Pools</title>
<p>Aiming to improve the benefit from economies of scale, many IT service companies have structured their service delivery divisions by <italic>competencies</italic>. System administrators, a.k.a. <italic>sysadmins</italic>, working in the same department share the responsibility of supporting all customers on a particular competency. Underlying this delivery model are the <italic>Lean Service</italic> principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1094670513480559">Voehl and Elshennawy 2010</xref>), which aim at enabling a consistent, highly efficient delivery of services at competitive prices. One of the main aspects of this model is the standardization of delivery processes. The result of this model is that employees of IT service factories often work on incidents from a number of different customers. The BSF in this study is mainly organized by competencies with some exceptions of a few large customers.</p>
<p>Inside each competency, the support team is subdivided in <italic>service pools</italic> dedicated to a subset of customers, meaning that each employee handles incidents in a dedicated competency for handful of customers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1094670513480559">Figure 1</xref>). Each service pool is comprised of a group of sysadmins and a <italic>dispatcher. </italic>Currently, the performance measurement of service pools in the BSF is primarily done by monitoring the number of tickets that exceeded their maximum resolution time as determined by the SLA and the number and cost of human resources. Based on our conversations with managers, it is clear that many of them have great difficulty identifying the impact of different incident loads on the service pool performance and evaluating any transformational initiative aiming to improve productivity or quality in service pools. This difficulty in understanding the impact of different incident workload profiles in the performance of a service pool is the key driver of the methods proposed in this work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1094670513480559">
<title>Ticket Dispatching</title>
<p>Ticket dispatching in a service pool has as its primary function the management of the recurring, steady state workload of tickets associated to the incidents, which is fundamental to the maintenance of the IT infrastructure of multiple customers in an optimized fashion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1094670513480559">Figure 1</xref> also shows the typical ticket dispatching structure of the IM system of an IT service factory, where the <italic>dispatcher’</italic>s primary activity is to monitor all incoming tickets from a particular group of customers and to manage their assignment, progress, and completion, on time. Therefore, dispatchers play a key role in determining the productivity and service QoS pools.</p>
<p>In the BSF, tickets can be assigned to workers of a service pool simply by placing them into <italic>accessible queues,</italic> where the dispatcher and the sysadmins can monitor and take a work to be done. Typically, tickets are created either by customer requests or complaints, manually entered into the IM system by the customer or by a help desk agent, or automatically created by alert systems monitoring the IT infrastructure, often using automated scripts running on servers and routers. Then, based on the dispatching strategy adopted by the dispatcher, every incoming ticket is forwarded from its input queue to a sysadmin who has the appropriate skills to solve the incident. The time between the arrival of the ticket onto the IM tool and the moment a sysadmin starts working on the corresponding incident is here called the <italic>assignment delay</italic>. The total time used by the sysadmin to solve the incident raised by a ticket after its assignment is called the <italic>resolution time</italic>. The SLA commonly specifies the maximum resolution time for each type of ticket, often called the <italic>SLA total resolution time</italic>, from its generation to the end of the resolution. The key concern of the dispatcher is to keep the time, as the sum of the assignment delay and the resolution time of each ticket, below the associated SLA total resolution time, or, as often referred to in the industry, to assure that each <italic>ticket meets its SLA</italic>.</p>
<p>We are particularly interested here in how to evaluate the performance of a service pool in terms of its compliance with an established SLA as measured by its performance in those two key variables: the <italic>assignment delay</italic> and the <italic>resolution time</italic>. There is an extensive literature on multivariate statistical control methods which could be applied here, including those based on <italic>control charts</italic>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1094670513480559">Bersimis, Psarakis, and Panaretos (2007</xref>) for an overview. For example, a <italic>control ellipse chart</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1094670513480559">Bersimis, Psarakis, and Panaretos 2007</xref>) can be employed, where an ellipsoid area in the assignment resolution chart is statistically determined and all tickets occurrences outside the ellipse are deemed problematic. One key issue here is that in IM systems, we are mostly concerned in controlling the total resolution time, that is, whether the specific SLA associated to each ticket is met. As we discuss later, this would produce an area in a control ellipse chart which would not resemble an ellipsis. Moreover, we are interested in methods that help managers to determine the most likely cause of quality deviations and not simply whether the process is deviating from its metrics, the common goal of control chart methods.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section7-1094670513480559">
<title>Workload Profile Chart (WPC)</title>
<p>We propose here a data-driven method that evaluates the performance of service pools in an IT service factory based on an analysis of the assignment and resolution times of ticket data. We start by introducing a graphical representation that depicts the aggregate performance of a particular service pool which basically plots the ticket data of the service pool on a two-dimensional log-log graphic where the axes correspond to the assignment delay and resolution times, normalized by the associated SLA resolution time. The density map of this plot is called the <italic>WPC</italic> of the service pool. Our key contribution is to identify and associate different concentrations of tickets in particular areas of a WPC to a set of specific characteristics related to service quality and productivity. This is the basis of the <italic>WPC Inspection</italic> <italic>method</italic> which takes the WPC of the service pool and, by visual inspection of different areas, allows a preliminary assessment of the issues in the service pool. This section describes in detail the construction, analysis, and application of WPCs. In the next section, we describe the WPD method that systematizes numerically the WPC Inspection method described here.</p>
<sec id="section8-1094670513480559">
<title>Construction of WPCs</title>
<p>To construct the WPC of a particular set of tickets of a service pool, we start by normalizing the tickets’ assignment delays and resolution times by their respective SLA duration and plotting them on a normalized assignment delay by resolution time space (see left of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1094670513480559">Figure 2</xref>). The normalization is necessary because tickets might have different SLAs.</p>
<fig id="fig2-1094670513480559" position="float">
<label>Figure 2.</label>
<caption>
<p>A Workload Profile Chart (WPC) is the log-log of density map (right) of the distribution of tickets according to service-level agreement (SLA)-normalized assignment and resolution times (left).</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1094670513480559-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Next, we consider the logarithmic version of that space and compute its density matrix by dividing it in small bins (i.e., a grid) and counting the number of tickets within each bin. We call this the <italic>Workload Profile Density Matrix</italic> (<italic>WPDM</italic>) of the service pool. The size of each bin is determined based on the total number of tickets, not so small that few tickets fall into the most populated bins, and not so large that the WPDM is too course for analysis. The WPC simply depicts the WPDM with a gray scale associated to different ranges of ticket concentration. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1094670513480559">Figure 2</xref>, on the right, shows an example of a WPC for a service pool where the dashed line, called the <italic>SLA OK</italic> line, represents the frontier between tickets which met their SLAs (i.e., near 100% of SLA) and those that missed their SLAs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1094670513480559">
<title>The WPCs Areas of Interest</title>
<p>After analyzing dozens of WPCs, we detected that high concentrations of tickets in different areas of a WPC are related to different kinds of problems and issues in a service pool. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1094670513480559">Figure 3</xref> depicts the key insights a WPC can provide.</p>

</fig>
<p>We propose that there are eight main areas of interest in a WPC, each of them corresponding to specific issues:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Comfort zone </italic>(<italic>CZ</italic>)<italic>:</italic> this area positioned at the center of the WPC (1–10%, 1–10%) contains tickets that are quickly assigned by the dispatcher to sysadmins and resolved by these sysadmins. A high concentration of tickets in the CZ indicates that the service pool is working smoothly and comfortably, with most tickets being easily routed and solved without much work.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>False alarms </italic>(<italic>FA</italic>)<italic>:</italic> this area covering tickets whose resolution takes less than 1.0% of the SLA (0.1–1000%, 0.1–1.0%) and whose resolution is so simple that they are good candidates for automatic resolution methods; or, more commonly, they are tickets easily recognized as FA or duplicates, and therefore, easily dismissible. A high concentration of tickets in this area suggests that the performance of the service pool can be improved by increasing the number of tickets automatically solved or by the usage of better monitoring or filtering approaches.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Excess availability </italic>(<italic>EA):</italic> this area covering the left side of the SLA OK zone (0.1–1%, 1.0–100%) contains tickets which are quickly assigned but whose resolution takes some time. A high concentration of tickets in this area indicates that there are often sysadmins ready to immediately start working on tickets as soon as they arrive and are dispatched. In other words, there are often too many sysadmins available. These tickets are also good candidates for automatic dispatching, possibly using pattern recognition and machine learning methods.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Adequate resources </italic>(<italic>AR):</italic> this area covers the region to the right of CZ (10–100%, 1–10%), containing tickets that meet their SLAs and to which assignments are not immediate but quickly resolved. A high concentration of tickets in this area indicates that resources are not always immediately available, so assignment takes some time, but that does not compromise the SLA attainment. Systems with heavy concentration in this area have good levels of resource utilization.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Adequate skills </italic>(<italic>AS</italic>): this area corresponds to the region situated on the top of the CZ (1–10%, 10–100%) and comprises only tickets that meet their SLAs. Tickets in this area require a good amount of effort for their resolution and therefore AS matching is often critical. A high concentration of tickets here indicates that resolution tasks can be time consuming and that the SLAs cannot be made tighter without adding more skilled resources to the pool.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Limit zone </italic>(<italic>LZ):</italic> this area corresponds to the area situated on the top right quadrant of the CZ (10–10%, 10–100%), comprises only tickets that meet their SLAs and that take some time both to be assigned and to be solved. So a high concentration of tickets in this area often means that the system is running close to its limit and therefore, resources and skills are being optimally used but with no slack. However, heavy concentrations of tickets in this area mean high susceptibility to breakdown when unexpectedly heavy concentrations of incidents occur.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Resource issues </italic>(<italic>RI):</italic> this area covers tickets that do not meet their SLA but whose resolution takes less than 100% of the SLA time. Tickets in this area could have be met their SLAs if they were assigned earlier. A heavy concentration of tickets here often indicates that the service pool is not appropriately dimensioned or has severe dispatching problems. This is a primary area to work to improve a ticket dispatching system.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Skills Issues </italic>(<italic>SI):</italic> this area covers tickets whose resolution took more than 100% of the SLA time. Tickets here are lost either because the resource assigned does not have the right skills to complete the task on time or the task requires a resolution time beyond SLA. A heavy concentration of tickets here usually means serious resource SI or a need to renegotiate SLAs.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Note that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1094670513480559">Figure 3</xref> covers only the range of the WPC within 0.1–1000%, 0.1–1000%. This was done for presentation purposes only. In practice, the four areas at the borders of the chart should consider tickets beyond its limits. The area comprised of <italic>CZ</italic>, <italic>AS</italic>, <italic>AR</italic>, and <italic>LZ</italic> is denominated the <italic>core operative area</italic>, a region upon which a service pool operates more efficiently given the availability of skilled resources.</p>
<p>Before going forward, it is important that the choice of 1%, 10%, and 100% as the basic frontiers of our analysis of a WPC is somewhat arbitrary. Our experience shows that these frontier values seem to relate well to the normal perception of delay and difficulty in IM systems. A Method to Determine the Desired Ticket Distribution (DTD) subsection shows that possible errors in the choice of the frontier values are compensated by the statistical modeling proposed to define the WPD method.</p>

<title>The WPC Inspection Method</title>
<p>We propose here a simple method for analyzing a WPC based on visual inspection of high concentrations of tickets in the eight aforementioned areas of interest. It comprises the following steps:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>WPC Inspection Method:</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Select the group of tickets corresponding to the service pool being analyzed in a certain period of time.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Compute the associated WPDM and the WPC.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Visually (or through computational inspection of the WPDM) determine the main concentrations of tickets in the WPC.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>For each of the main concentrations of tickets, map it to one of the eight areas of interest and apply the respective characterization to the system or component.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>The WPC Inspection method may use a tool to plot the charts for human inspection or be implemented into an automatic system employing data mining and pattern recognition methods to detect the concentration of tickets in the WPDM.</p>
<p>Although the identification of characteristics of a service pool using a single instance of its associated WPC has been found to be very useful, we have also found that comparing different WPCs of the same service pool, or of similar service pools, interesting conclusions. For instance, we can apply the method to inspect service pools’ performances over time, characterizing for instance its evolution as shown in an application example later.</p>

<title>Workload Profile Diagnostic Method</title>
<p>Using the WPC Inspection method in an IM system can yield very interesting insights to managers and quality control personnel, but there is a large degree of subjectivity in the process. In this section, we propose a more systematic approach where we compute a <italic>desired ticket distribution </italic>(<italic>DTD</italic>) of the eight areas of interest, based on the target SLA and assignment and resolution statistical parameters. We then compute the actual ticket distribution for a particular time period. We next compare this distribution with the DTD and identify the areas of interest—those that deviate from a predetermined target. Possible reasons are finally assigned to these deviation areas. These are the essential steps of what we call the <italic>WPD</italic> method described in detail in this section.</p>
<sec id="section12-1094670513480559">
<title>A Method to Determine the DTD</title>
<p>In order to systematize the application of our inspection method, we need to estimate a <italic>DTD</italic> among the eight areas of interest as a function of the target SLA. We chose the Lognormal distribution because it is commonly used in literature as an event-time distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1094670513480559">Lawrence 1988</xref>). Also, its parameters (<italic>m</italic> and <italic>s</italic>
<sup>2</sup>) and statistics are easily expressed in terms of the expectation (<italic>E</italic>[<italic>X</italic>] <italic>= </italic>μ) and the variance (Var[<italic>X</italic>]<italic> = </italic>σ<sup>2</sup>), providing a meaningful way to handle the experiments by end users. Finally, it has a relationship with the <italic>Normal</italic> distribution which mirrors our use of log-log charting of tickets. There are multiple ways to use bi-lognormal models to compute target ticket distributions; here, we describe one possible method to determine the DTD. Later, we show empirical evidence that the DTD computation method, used as an input to the WPD method, yields valid diagnostics for service pools.</p>
<p>The method can be described by the following <italic>TD</italic> and <italic>DTD</italic> procedures, where μ<italic>
<sub>a</sub>
</italic> (μ<italic>
<sub>r</sub>
</italic>) and σ<italic>
<sub>a</sub>
</italic> (σ<italic>
<sub>r</sub>
</italic>) are the means (or expectation) and standard deviations of the assignment delay and resolution time, respectively. Also, the parameter <italic>sla_target</italic> states the percentage of tickets expected to miss the SLA. Procedure <italic>TD</italic> is responsible for generating ticket distributions according to a lognormal. The method <italic>DTD</italic> calls <italic>TD</italic> in a loop and performs a simple and heuristic local search aiming to identify a ticket distribution that matches a desired level of SLA attainment. Given a SLA target, the method <italic>DTD</italic> returns the desired distribution of tickets, which we denote by the tuple (<italic>fa, ea, cz, ar, as, lz, ri, si</italic>).

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1094670513480559">Figure 4</xref> shows that the two symmetric lognormals used as models of the assignment and resolution variables produce a quasicircular distribution pattern on the WPCs. However, while the distribution is centered on the <italic>CZ</italic> for the 1% SLA case, it shifts to the right and up in the case of 30% SLA target, almost centering on the <italic>LZ</italic>. In other words, in an IM system where the expectations for SLA attainment are as low as 30%, it is admissible to have most tickets being dealt with at the “edge” of the SLA OK curve. However, in such systems, it is not a good practice to have high concentrations of tickets in the <italic>FA</italic> (more than 0.6%) or <italic>EA</italic> (more than 0.6%) areas without compromising the productivity and cost of the system. In contrast, in high-quality systems such as the case of a SLA of 1%, it is expected that a certain percentage of tickets falls into the <italic>FA</italic> (15.1%) and <italic>EA</italic> (12.8%) areas—such systems are only possible in the context of very short resolution tickets (sometimes, in fact, FA) and situations where there is enough availability of resources for quasi-immediate starting of their resolution just after the tickets arrive.</p>

<p>As we can see, the WPD method is heavily dependent on the particular choice of DTD values. Yet, it is less dependent than the WPC method on the arbitrary choice of frontier values (1%, 10%, and 100%).</p>

<title>Using the WPD Method</title>
<p>In this section, we use the WPD method described in the fourth section to diagnose problems and issues of different service pools in the BSF. Here we describe the possible problems and issues of the service pools based solely on a strict analysis of their WPDs. We postpone to the sixth section the discussion as to whether the diagnostics are accurate. We also show how the WPD method can be applied to a temporal sequence of WPCs to analyze the evolution of a service pool over time.</p>
<sec id="section15-1094670513480559">
<title>Gathering and Filtering the Collected Data</title>
<p>For the experiments described in this article, we used real data from the BSF. Thus, some preprocessing filtering was required in order to remove incomplete records, where crucial information (times and durations) related to tickets was missing. The collected data came from four distinct service pools: two of them from operational system (OS) support activities related to two different operating systems (Service pools 1 and 2) and the other two from the work of support teams responsible for, respectively, backup and restore tasks (Service pool 3) and middleware applications (Service pool 4). The data collected correspond to a period ranging from March to December 2011 and from three different work shifts covering all days of the week. The typical SLA of these service pools is a maximum of 5% missed tickets. We employed the DTD computed by the methods described in A Method to Determine the Desired Ticket Distribution (DTD) subsection with a <italic>sla_target</italic> of 5%. The actual DTD values for a target SLA of 5% are depicted in the table included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1094670513480559">Figure 4</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section16-1094670513480559">
<title>Applying the WPD Method to Aggregated Data of Service Pools</title>
<p>To demonstrate the use of the WPD method, we started by considering the performance of the four service pools of the BSF using the aggregated data ranging from March to December 2011. The data were filtered as described in Gathering and Filtering the Collected Data subsection and plotted using a standard statistics and data visualization software package. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1094670513480559">Figure 5</xref> shows the WPCs of the four selected service pools. The actual distribution of tickets in the different areas of interest is shown on the center of each area of interest, together with the DTD value for a SLA of 5% (inside parenthesis).</p>

<p>For each WPC, we then followed with the WPD method as described in The WPD Method subsection, looking for areas of interest where the actual distribution of tickets was, in absolute values, more than 100% different from the DTD and marking them as <italic>problems</italic>, and identifying areas of interest where the actual distribution of tickets was, in absolute values, between 50% and 100% different from the DTD and marking them as <italic>issues</italic>. The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1094670513480559">Table 1</xref>, where the actual distribution of tickets in the four service pools is shown. To help visualizing the results, values with more than 100% absolute difference to reference 5% SLA are shown inside black boxes; values between 50% and 100% difference to reference 5% SLA are shown inside dark gray boxes; values smaller than reference values (negative difference) are underlined.</p>

<p>Service Pool 4 diagnostic:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>4.a <italic>FA problem</italic>: Excessive FA or extremely easy resolution tickets.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>4.b <italic>EA problem</italic>: Too many tickets demonstrating availability of resources.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Further examining <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1094670513480559">Table 1</xref>, one of the identified problems in Service pools 1 and 2 is a high number of FA or easy resolution tickets (FA area). This most likely indicates that serious work on improving the quality of monitoring and automatic resolution systems for simple problems can yield some degree of productivity and quality improvements and cost savings in Service pools 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Also, looking at identified problems of Service pools 3 and 4, we see extreme cases. Service pool 3 misses the largest number of tickets as indicated by the large number of tickets in <italic>RI</italic> and <italic>SI</italic> areas, 19.7% and 11.6%, respectively. Further inspection of the WPC of Service pool 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1094670513480559">Figure 5</xref> shows that many of the tickets missed in the <italic>RI</italic> area are at the bottom of the chart, that is, they are tickets that require very short resolution times. Nevertheless, those tickets are still missed due to assignment delays. In this case, the WPD method, combined with the analysis of its corresponding WPC, yields a surprising diagnostic which prompts further inquiry. At the same time, Service pool 3 also misses many demanding tickets, corresponding to the <italic>SI</italic> area. An approach to rethink or renegotiate SLAs could be of use in this case.</p>
<p>The WPD of Service pool 4 is a good example of a well-run service pool where tickets seem to require considerable amount of work (not many easily dismissible FA) and most tickets are quickly assigned and meet the deadline. However, the abnormal concentration of tickets in the <italic>EA</italic> area and the low concentration of tickets in <italic>AR</italic> area most likely indicate the possibility of reducing the number of resources without missing the SLA.</p>

<title>Time Evolution of the Service Pool WPDs</title>
<p>The previous WPD diagnostics were based on 11-month aggregate data.

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1094670513480559">Table 2</xref> shows that the studied service pools in the BSF tend to be relatively stable in terms of ticket distributions on a monthly basis. This can be partially attributed to the large number of tickets and different customers they serve. However, the temporal application of the WPD method seems to help identify important changes, in this case, mostly the deterioration of the quality of the service pools starting in July 2011.</p>

<title>Findings and Validation</title>
<p>In this section, we report an empirical validation of the WPD method based on the collection of ground-truth data about the service pools of the BSF. The goal is to verify the degree to which the diagnostic of each service pool determined by the application of the WPD method as described in the fifth section is valid. Basically, the validation study we devised sought evidences from the field to confirm the problems found through the WPD method and to help explain particular aspects of those service pools which could be responsible for the identified problems.</p>
<sec id="section19-1094670513480559">
<title>Validation Study</title>
<p>To empirically validate the diagnostics of the service pools found through the application of the WPD method, we invited more than 15 domain experts from the BSF to jointly explore, interpret, and discuss the meanings of the WPCs and WPDs from the four service pools in which they are currently working or worked in the past. These participants were either <italic>dispatchers</italic> or <italic>quality analysts</italic> (QAs) from these pools. They were senior technicians with extended experiences in service pool technology and system and with good knowledge of the customers.</p>
<p>The qualitative study was divided into two interview moments: namely, (1) we capture participants’ initial “respo-nse” to the various chart configurations: Participants are presented with the unlabeled WPCs of different service pools and, after being told how to “read” them, they are asked to identify their particular pool and explain why and (2) we debrief them with semistructured and unstructured interviews in which participants describe particular episodes as well as characteristics of the pool that could explain the characterizations found in the WPDs. We did not show them the actual ticket distribution tickets nor the areas identified by the WPD method as problems or issues. Those interview meetings took place in the BSF during working hours. As needed, we followed up with clarification questions (over the phone, instant messaging, or in person) that surfaced during the analyses of the results of the interviews.</p>

<title>Findings on the Aggregated Data of Service Pools</title>
<p>In Applying the WPD Method to Aggregated Data of Service Pools subsection, we characterized the overall performance of the four service pools from March to December 2011 according to WPD method, yielding 10 different problems and issues. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1094670513480559">Table 3</xref> summarizes the major findings of the validation study for each individual diagnosis. Of the 10 <italic>problems</italic> diagnosed by the application of the WPD method described in Applying the WPD Method to Aggregated Data of Service Pools subsection, we found evidences supporting 9 of them; for one diagnosis, we found only partial support. No case of incorrect diagnosis was found.</p>

<p>We now describe in greater details the overall findings from the interviews that support the diagnostics of the performance of the service pools based on WPD method. As shown earlier in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1094670513480559">Table 1</xref>, most of the service pools were found to have <italic>FA</italic> and <italic>SI</italic> problems. Significantly, our experts pointed out that a great number of tickets are automatically generated via threshold-based computational scripts which monitor various aspects of the computer servers. Hence, there is a possibility that inadequate alert thresholds may be causing the large number of <italic>FA</italic>. For example, one of the participants explained that a large number of short tickets are in fact typical of OS service pools (such as Service pools 1 and 2) in which CPU usage, hard-disk space, and the like are constantly monitored. Interestingly, they realized that they might have to recalibrate their metrics and monitoring rules since they may be too strict. In this respect, the WPC quickly became a tool whereby experts were able to reflect on the characteristics and behaviors of particular business processes adopted in their pool. Also, the high volume of tickets on the “edge” (see, <italic>RI</italic> and <italic>SI</italic>) was a topic of discussion with OS experts. A lack of enough and skilled personnel in Service pools 1, 2, and 3 was identified as the possible cause.</p>
<p>Service pool 3 presents a particular <italic>problem</italic>, namely, a large number of tickets in the <italic>RI</italic> area with very short resolution times. The validation process unveiled that those tickets often correspond to automation scripts detecting that a backup operation was not performed. However, long backup operations in many cases can only be scheduled for late night (or early morning) shifts because they are time-consuming tasks. In the meantime, poorly designed automation scripts throughout the day keep generating tickets detecting the lack of adequate backup. The sysadmins often ignore these tickets since they cannot be actually solved in time to meet their SLAs. Once the backup is completed, all the redundant tickets are started and immediately closed, resulting in extremely short resolution tickets, of which some may have exceeded their SLAs.</p>
<p>Another behavior unearthed by showing the WPC of Service pool 3 to the participants was the large number of tickets on the edge of the SLA OK line (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1094670513480559">Figure 5</xref>). Participants of the interviews pointed out that backup/restore operations often requiring long time to be carried out. Hence, there is a high degree of uncertainty as to the ability of the pool to respond on time in accordance with a particular SLA. To work around this problem, sysadmins informally agreed to “stop the clock,” (or as they put it, “SLA hold”) when they realize that the resolution time of a particular ticket is about to reach its SLA limit and the operation is still underway. This demonstrates a mismatch between the SLA agreed upon between the BSF and its customers and the actual technological realities—for instance, customers’ slow backup devices. Interestingly, as for the tickets orbiting the upper region of the CZ square, experts pointed out that these are more likely to be the tickets correctly timed, whereas the ones at the lower regions more likely represent those that were stopped.</p>
<p>In contrast, the ticket distribution of Service pool 4 most likely embodies the heterogeneity of its particular IT environment. As an expert from this pool pointed out, the challenges of this service pool come from the complexity of solving problems across different operating systems, applications, and infrastructures. However, we observed a large number of tickets in the <italic>EA </italic>area which could mean that this service line was quickly assigning and resolving a great number of tickets. During the interviews, we learned that this service pool had in place a well-established process not only for managing the tickets but also documenting problems, work-arounds, and solutions. This strong management discipline positions this service pool for future increases in productivity.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Our interviewees were able to unveil relevant insights at the macro-organizational level that affected the performances of different service pools over time. For Service pools 1 and 2, as soon as we showed study participants the time evolution diagrams of the pools, they brought up that in mid-2011 a new, large customer outsourced its IT infrastructure to the BSF. The sudden demand for IT resources (storage, servers, infrastructure, and the like) momentarily affected the overall operations of the BSF. Such a demand contributed to the generation of large number of tickets which then competed for the sysadmins’ attention. At this point, they became overloaded with system requests. The overall service delivery system became provisionally overloaded (i.e., tickets in the <italic>RI</italic> area became more common) and therefore the increased proportion of tickets in <italic>SI</italic> and <italic>RI</italic> areas.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we learned that Service pool 3 was affected by the lack of skilled workers for the most part of 2011. Research participants pointed out the difficulties of finding skilled workers for the particular backup/restore systems in use at the BSF. Only by the end of the year, the service pool was able to hire new employees, but mostly junior sysadmins—without prior system skills, so the impact of the new hires may not be reflected yet in the performance of the service pool in 2011. This issue was captured by the lack of change in the WPD time evolution of this service pool—as pointed out by the 3.c row in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1094670513480559">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<title>Managerial Implications</title>
<p>The main goal of the research described in this article is to create new, data-driven analytical and visualization tools to support the work of IT service pool managers, IT service QAs, capacity planners, and executives in charge of large-scale IT service factories. We are currently developing an online tool implementing the techniques herein described and planning a systematic study of the tool usage to gain insights on its effectiveness in supporting IT service delivery practices. We are also starting to study ways for the sales and marketing teams to use variations of the WPC concept and the WPD method to explore new business opportunities and to gain leverage in deals through the definition of more adequate SLA times for the different service pools.</p>
<p>We purposively have structured the WPD method to provide actionable and useful information for IM service pool managers. For instance, the method revealed a large number of tickets in this area for the Service pool 1, as observed in characterization 1.a of Applying the WPD Method to Aggregated Data of Service Pools subsection. As discussed in our validation process, the cause of such large concentration of tickets is the large number of automatic tickets generated by OS scripts which may be due to too strict thresholds. A possible action of this service pool manager in this case is to establish a task force to reevaluate the thresholds or to seek better monitoring technology than the one currently in use.</p>
<p>The WPD diagnostic of Service pool 3 also shows a high concentration of tickets in the <italic>FA </italic>area. As our validation process has shown, the root cause of those tickets are cascading effects of tickets which, while being solved, do not preclude the automatic generation of new tickets related to the same problem. Therefore, in this case, the WPD method highlighted a problem in the ticket generation process which can be fixed by giving more situation awareness to the computational scripts in the server monitoring processes.</p>
<p>Conversely, the WPD diagnostic of Service pool 4 shows that automatic resolution of tickets or reduction of FA are not likely to have a major impact on the performance of the pool as stated in the diagnostic results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1094670513480559">Table 4</xref>. We believe tools based on the WPD method will help service pool managers to focus on the most important problems by providing means to characterize and, to a certain extent, quantify the most relevant and appropriate issues for their service pools.</p>
<p>Similarly, service QAs can use the WPD method to expose the most critical quality issues in the service delivery process. For example, the characterization of Service pool 3 has shown a large number of tickets finished at the limit of SLA or lost due to inadequate skills or underestimated SLAs. This observation could trigger reviews of the established SLAs with specific customers and efforts to refine or renegotiate these agreements; or, as unveiled in the validation process, to look into the specific work procedures so as to make the SLA computation more realistic and fair.</p>
<p>Finally, we are exploring how marketing and sales people can use WPCs and the WPD method to detect business opportunities or to gain information useful for deal renewal or expansion. This could be accomplished by creating a specific mapping for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1094670513480559">Figure 3</xref> more focused on sales opportunities, based on data of particular customers. For instance, a high concentration of tickets to the left of the CZ (such as in Service pool 4) indicate that tighter SLAs can be met with existing personnel. This information may trigger a renewal proposal to a customer with higher service quality standards, possibly differentiating it from competitors. Also, the quantification of the importance of specific issues may help in the negotiation process.</p>

<sec id="section23-1094670513480559">
<title>Final Discussion</title>
<p>In this article, we present and report the validation process of the WPD method to characterize and diagnose problems and issues in service pools in IM systems of IT service factories. We detailed the method in the fourth section, applied it on the ticket data from four different service pools of the BSF as described in the fifth section, and in the sixth section, we provided ground-truth evidences that supported 12 of the 14 of the diagnoses found in the fifth section. Our conclusion from this study is that the WPD method is basically sound and thus, useful to managers of IM systems in IT service factories.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we believe further exploration, development, and validation are necessary to unveil new advantages and possible drawbacks of the WPD method. We plan to apply the method to other service pools in the BSF and to IM systems of similar IT services organizations. In parallel, we are conducting more rigorous validation studies involving a larger number of people and roles; and planning to deploy a tool so that practitioners can explore WPCs and use the WPD method by themselves. We also want to explore the tool to understand issues related to specific customers, automation of resolution and dispatching of tickets, distribution and availability of resource skills, and other key productivity and service quality issues of IT service factories.</p>
<p>So far, we have applied the method only to IT outsourcing contexts. However, many other IM systems have strict controls on how fast incidents should be handled, often subjected to due dates and penalties. We call such systems <italic>time-bounded incident management </italic>(<italic>TBIM</italic>) systems. Examples of TBIM systems include fire and ambulance management, call centers with restrictions on maximum waiting and resolution times, and electric power restoration systems. We believe the proposed method can be applied to such IM systems. As we explore these different settings, we expect to start observing patterns on WPCs characterizing types of tasks, their evolution, and their transformation. It is noticeable that in spite of the critical functions of IM systems, there are few data-driven, systematic methods to explore and characterize their performance in terms of productivity and service quality, and thus we believe the WPD method is an important contribution to the often-neglected discipline of Service Engineering, as discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1094670513480559">Metters (2010</xref>).</p>
<p>There are clearly some limitations in the applicability of the WPD method, especially in IM systems with less-defined expectations of resolution time. For those, we are starting to explore stochastic- and complex networks-based versions of the method.</p>
