<p>The International Association of Language and Social Psychology (IALSP) aims to ensure the continuity and development of biennial international conferences (ICLASPs) that serve important functions: exchange of ideas, establishing and extending contacts, facilitating collaborative research projects, and sharing experiences among colleagues from a variety of disciplines and professions from around the world. The diversity of perspectives focusing on the intersection of language and social behavior and experience has been one of the most exciting and rewarding features of the earlier conferences (in Australia, Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, the United States, and the United Kingdom).</p>
<p>The next conference, ICLASP 13, will be held from June 20 to 23, 2012, in the charming city of Ljouwert/Leeuwarden, the capital of bilingual Fryslân in The Netherlands. The conference will be held in conjunction with Mercator, the European Research Center on Multilingualism and Language Learning, which is part of the Fryske Akademy. Local host Cor van der Meer and President of IALSP Itesh Sachdev are working collaboratively to program a dynamic, multidisciplinary, and intercultural conference.</p>
<p>A number of special panels have been organized (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ialsp.org">www.ialsp.org</ext-link>), including one on “language and tourism” (the current IALSP Task Force) convened by plenary speakers Crispin Thurlow (USA) and Adam Jaworski (UK). Other plenary speakers will be Claire Kramsch (USA), Tom Holtgraves (USA), Durk Gorter (Spain), Jasone Cenoz (Spain), Donald Taylor (Canada), Anne Pauwels (UK), and the IALSP President-Elect Bernadette Watson (Australia). In addition to a number of other ICALSPs that will be awarded, John Edwards (Canada) will be presented with the IALSP Robert C. Gardner Award at the conference.</p>

<p>Ljouwert/Leeuwarden (population 90,000) is set in low-lying land that is ideal for gentle cycling, with a dense web of canals interconnecting many lakes that make it perfect for water sports, especially boating and sailing. It is a beautiful city with a village-feel as you stroll past gabled houses, on tree-lined canals and bridges lined with a diverse range of restaurants, pubs, and cafes. Conveniently located by train from Amsterdam airport, the city counts Mata Hari among its most famous offspring, has diverse architecture ranging through the ages including its very own <italic>even-more leaning-tower-than-Pisa</italic>—the 16<sup>th</sup>-century Oldehove tower. Along with Dutch, the Frisian language is taught in school, visibly present in the linguistic landscape, and has radio and TV stations broadcasting in it. All these elements make it the perfect place for you to engage in lively exchange, gentle refection, and convivial socializing that is characteristics of ICLASPs. We look forward to seeing you there!!</p>
