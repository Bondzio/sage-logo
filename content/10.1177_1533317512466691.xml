<abstract>
<p>This study examined the short-, mid-, and long-term effects of a motor and multisensory care-based approach on (i) the behavior of institutionalized residents with dementia and (ii) care practices according to staff perspective. In all, 6 residents with moderate to severe dementia (mean age 80.83 ± 10.87 years) and 6 staff members (40 ± 10.87 years old) were recruited. Motor and multisensory stimulation strategies were implemented in residents’ morning care. Data were collected with video recordings and focus-group interviews before, immediately after, at 3 months and 6 months after the intervention. The frequency and duration of each resident’s behavior were analyzed. Content analysis was also performed. Results showed short-term improvements in residents’ communication and engagement, followed by a sustained decline over time. Staff reported to change their practices; however, difficulties related to the institution organization were identified. There is a need to implement long-term strategies and involve institutions at different organizational levels to sustain the results.</p>

<p>In residential care homes, the care provided to people with dementia is commonly task oriented, focusing on the instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs) and pharmacological treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1533317512466691">6</xref></sup> Currently, good care is associated with person-centered approaches,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1533317512466691">6</xref></sup> which in the case of dementia care should include motor, social and multisensory stimulation (often neglected) tailored to each patient’s preferences and needs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1533317512466691">4</xref></sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1533317512466691">7</xref></sup> since it promotes psychosocial and physical activity, contributing to delay functional, cognitive and social decline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1533317512466691">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1533317512466691"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1533317512466691"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1533317512466691">9</xref></sup>

<p>Multisensory stimulation (MSS) consists of actively stimulating the primary senses without the involvement of higher cognition processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1533317512466691">10</xref></sup> This intervention has been found to decrease the frequency of behavioral problems and apathy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1533317512466691">11</xref></sup>

</p>
<p>These stimulation-oriented approaches (MSS and MS) have been provided to people with dementia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1533317512466691">13</xref></sup>

<p>Overall, care staff, who maintain the most direct contact with people with dementia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1533317512466691">24</xref></sup> have insufficient specialized training for providing them care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1533317512466691">25</xref></sup>

<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1533317512466691">26</xref></sup> Therefore, training care staff to meet specific competencies on dementia has been recommended to (i) improve staff knowledge and skills regarding dementia care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1533317512466691">25</xref></sup>

<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1533317512466691">26</xref></sup>; (ii) increase residents’ well-being,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1533317512466691">27</xref></sup> and (iii) create opportunities for people with dementia to use their resources and abilities in their everyday lives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1533317512466691">28</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>There are still few research studies which have trained care staff with basic skills to implement MSS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1533317512466691">29</xref></sup> or MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1533317512466691">13</xref></sup> in daily care provision to residents with dementia. Furthermore, a scarce number of studies have assessed the impacts of the interventions directly on the residents’ behaviors and on care practices considering staff’s opinions. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the short- (after the intervention), mid- (3 months), and long-term (6 months) effects of a motor and multisensory care-based approach on (i) the behavior of residents with moderate to severe dementia living in a residential care home and (ii) care practices according to staff perspective.</p>

<title>Design and Setting</title>
<p>A single-group repeated measures design was conducted in a residential care home, in the central region of Portugal. The care home met the following requirements: willingness and agreement to participate in the study, no substantial organizational changes during the study period, and no simultaneous participation in similar studies. The facility included 53 licensed beds for older people and, before the study began, there were 21 residents with a clinical diagnosis of dementia.</p>

<title>Residents with dementia</title>
<p>In all, 13 residents with dementia were identified by the physician of the residential care home to participate in the study, according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) presenting a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe dementia, according to the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (Fourth Edition; <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1533317512466691">30</xref></sup>; (2) living in the care home for at least 2 months, so adjustments to the new people and environment had been performed; (3) requiring staff assistance during daily care activities; and (4) having no other psychiatric diagnosis. The legal guardian of each resident was contacted, informed about the study, and asked to sign the informed consent. In all, 8 legal guardians signed the written informed consent. However, 1 resident died during the implementation period and other was excluded for refusing to be assessed by video recordings. A total of 6 residents were thus recruited.</p>
<p>Residents (4 females) with a mean age of 80.83 ± 10.87 years (age ranged from 66 to 93 years old) and a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe dementia participated in the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1533317512466691">Table 1</xref>).

<title>Care staff</title>
<p>The service manager identified 10 eligible staff participants who maintained direct contact with the residents with dementia during daily care provision. Staff members who were only working at night were excluded as they were not involved in providing morning care. Potential participants were individually informed about the study purposes and invited to participate. Nine agreed to participate. Written informed consent was obtained. Prior to the start of the program, 3 members had to abandon the study (1 due to health problems, 1 for personal reasons, and 1 quitted the job). Thus, 6 staff members, all females with a mean age of 40 ± 11.91 years, ranging from 23 to 51 years participated in the study. Their academic qualifications were primary school (n = 1), 5 to 6 school years (n = 1), 7 to 9 school years (n = 1), secondary school (n = 1), and higher education (n = 2). Half of the sample was working at the care home for more than 3 years (on average 5 ± 5.99 years).</p>

<title>Motor and Multisensory Care-Based Approach</title>
<p>A training program was developed to provide staff with knowledge and skills to introduce MSS and MS to residents’ morning care routines. Morning care was chosen as the recent literature indicates that this is the period of the day where more interaction between staff and resident occurs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1533317512466691">33</xref></sup> and problematic behaviors are more frequent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1533317512466691">16</xref></sup>

<p>Staff participants received eight 60-minute training sessions, 1 every other week, over a 4-month period. The training was performed in the care home by a multidisciplinary team, which included a gerontologist, a physiotherapist, and a psychologist. The topics of the sessions comprised myths and misconceptions related to dementia syndrome; staff-resident relationships and the importance of understanding the effects of dementia on social and self-care abilities of residents; the relevance of maintaining the remaining abilities and integrate MSS and MS strategies during the provision of personal care according to residents’ sensory stimuli preferences (which were collected by the research team dialoguing with the family and care staff); and verbal and nonverbal communication and other facilitative interaction aspects. The intervention has been presented and described in detail elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1533317512466691">35</xref></sup> All participants were given handouts which summarized the most relevant information and emphasized the person-centered care.</p>
<p>In the following 3 days after each session, the gerontologist and the physiotherapist assisted staff during the provision of morning care, clarifying doubts and making suggestions to help them implement the MSS (eg, using a fragranced shower gel or playing a relaxing music during the resident’s bath) and the MS strategies (encouraging the person to perform 1 task, or a part of it, eg, washing the arms, removing the foam from the body, by giving him or her small and simple instructions or physical guidance), according to what has been described in Cruz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1533317512466691">35</xref></sup> The individual assistance was provided as it has been considered essential to promote practice change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1533317512466691">36</xref></sup> and sustain implementation of new knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1533317512466691">2</xref></sup>

<title>Residents’ behavior</title>
<p>The short-, mid-, and long-term effects of the motor and multisensory care-based approach on the behavior of residents with moderate to severe dementia were studied through video recordings of morning care routines.

These interviews were semi-structured and aimed to obtain in-depth staff participants’ opinions about their care practices implementing a motor and multisensory care-based approach (ie, impacts on the care provided, suggestions for future interventions, and difficulties in implementing it into practice). Each interview lasted for approximately 2 hours and was audio-recorded and transcribed.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Residents’ behavior was studied by analyzing the frequency and duration of a list of behaviors (ethogram). The ethogram was obtained from the previous research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1533317512466691">29</xref></sup>
<sup>,</sup>

<sup>,</sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1533317512466691">40</xref></sup> and preliminary observations of the video recordings. The list comprised 4 categories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1533317512466691">Table 2</xref>), caregiver-direct gaze, verbal communication, and task engagement (voluntary and solicited).</p>

<p>The video footage was then selected for analysis. It was predefined that the observation time started when both resident and staff member appeared on the screen and it ended when they were both out of reach of the camera. Thus, to follow this criterion and to be able to compare the observational variables between the different participants and across the different phases of the intervention, the video recordings were cut so that all would have the length of the smallest video recording (211 seconds [3 minutes and 31 seconds]). In the longer video recordings it was pre-established that the start of the video recording analyzes would be the beginning of the observation time.</p>
<p>The video recordings were then analyzed by 2 independent observers. The observers rated the residents’ behaviors according to the ethogram using specialized software, Noldus The Observer XT 7.0 (Noldus International Technology, Wageningen, the Netherlands). They were previously trained to use the software by analyzing the video recordings obtained before data collection, and were blinded to the phase of the data collection (baseline, immediately after, 3 months, and 6 months after). The frequency and duration of the categories were measured for each resident in different phases.</p>
<sec id="section12-1533317512466691">
<title>Reliability of the observations</title>
<p>One of the major challenges to observational data is collecting reliable information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1533317512466691">41</xref></sup> Therefore, the study of the interobserver reliability was performed for the frequency and duration of each behavior in each phase, using the methods recommended for conducting reliability studies with continuous data,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1533317512466691">42</xref></sup> that is, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1533317512466691">43</xref></sup> using Equation (2.1), and the Bland and Altman method for assessing the agreement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1533317512466691">44</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The ICC (2.1) values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1533317512466691">Table 3</xref>) ranged between 1.00 and 0.444 for all categories except 2, indicating excellent to moderate reliability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1533317512466691">43</xref></sup> The lower ICC values, 0.283 and 0.377, were found for the frequency of the category voluntary engagement in the task (baseline) and for the frequency of caregiver-direct gaze (3-month follow-up), respectively.</p>

Nevertheless, the improvement was not observed 6 months after the end of the motor and multisensory-based approach (<italic>r</italic> = .27). With regard to the residents’ voluntary engagement, it found an improvement in both frequency and duration at the post-intervention phase; a large effect size was found for the duration, <italic>r</italic> = .53, but not for the frequency, <italic>r</italic> = .11.

<title>Impacts of the Motor and Multisensory Care-Based Approach on Staff Care Practices</title>
<p>Some impacts were sustained over time. The staff perceived that the training program allowed them to: (i) demystify preexistent beliefs associated with dementia; (ii) be more conscious to person-centered care, and (iii) be able to implement the new acquired knowledge into practice (eg, active participation, multisensory stimulation, and communication skills). However, only in the focus group conducted 2 weeks after the program, participants reported to be (i) more aware of the impact of implementing the acquired skills on all residents’ well-being (not only those with dementia), (ii) able to reflect about their practice, and (iii) motivated to improve their practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1533317512466691">
<title>Suggestions</title>
<p>Grief was suggested as a new theme to be explored in the future programs. Staff also considered that it would be important to conduct the program with the new admitted colleagues. This was mentioned at 3 and 6 months after the program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1533317512466691">
<title>Difficulties</title>
<p>The lack of time and human resources were identified in all focus groups as the major barriers to implement the strategies. In addition, the lack of availability to help was also mentioned at 6 months. In the last focus group, the lack of managers’ support was highlighted as a considerable constraint to the implementation of the intervention.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1533317512466691">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results showed a trend toward positive short-term effects of the motor and multisensory care-based approach on residents’ behaviors; however, no statistical significant differences were found. The frequency and duration of all behavioral categories increased immediately after the program, with the exception of verbal communication duration. An increase of almost 10% was observed for the duration and frequency of the total engagement of residents in the morning tasks at this point of time. Therefore, this study shows that it is very likely that staff has a significant role in stimulating residents’ verbal and non- verbal communication as well as their engagement in tasks. Similar findings have been found previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1533317512466691">29</xref></sup> The exception found for verbal communication duration might be explained by the fact that, during the training, staff was encouraged to stimulate residents’ engagement in daily tasks and be aware of the nonverbal communication as an effective way to communicate with these residents. The increase in the frequency and duration of caregiver-direct gaze and residents’ engagement in the task also supports the idea that residents were receptive to the staff’s orientations and were engaging with the environment and therefore, their verbal communication decreased. Engaging residents with dementia in constructive and meaningful activities (eg, brushing their hair, dressing their clothes) has been shown to be beneficial in increasing positive emotions for preventing loneliness, boredom, and problematic behaviors associated with dementia, and improving ADLs and daily function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1533317512466691">47</xref></sup> These promising results may ultimately be translated in residents’ increased mobility and improvements of psychosocial aspects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1533317512466691">6</xref></sup> and general quality of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1533317512466691">47</xref></sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1533317512466691">48</xref></sup> on day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>However, the duration and frequency of all behavior categories analyzed decreased over time. The declines were already observed at 3 months and levels equal or even below baseline were observed at 6 months. The results from the focus-group interviews might help to interpret these findings. Staff reported to continue to demystify preexistent beliefs associated with dementia, implement the new acquired knowledge, and be aware for the person-centered care. However, simultaneously the lack of: (i) time and resources, (ii) availability to help, and (iii) managers’ support; were identified as the main difficulties to implement the motor and multisensory care-based approach. The time commitment during the morning care to implement this type of interventions has already been raised.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1533317512466691">29</xref></sup> However, in dementia care there are only a few moments where real individual contact between residents and staff can occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1533317512466691">29</xref></sup> and morning care is probably the longest and the most important in traditional care homes. In this study, this was not objectively quantified; however, staff were questioned about this aspect and did not perceive that the time needed for morning care had increased due to the intervention. Furthermore, staff reports to continue to implement the new acquired knowledge; however, the results from the video recordings do not confirm this finding. Social desirability might explain this discrepancy.</p>
<p>Therefore, managers should be aware that, although it is important that the staff access formal training on dementia, training alone cannot transform staff’s practices. If the training is to make any sustained impact, it needs to consider care staff experiences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1533317512466691">49</xref></sup> and be supported by managers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1533317512466691">50</xref></sup> Managers can, for example, give clear and constructive feedback on care practice, or make sure that staff have enough time to support residents to maximize the use of their own abilities in personal care tasks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1533317512466691">50</xref></sup> which will contribute to sustain results over time. In sum, achievements will only be consolidated if other hierarchical levels besides staff are also involved as they will be the ones to legitimate the introduction of new practices.</p>
<p>Developing the intervention with the new colleagues and adding the theme “grief” were the 2 aspects suggested for future training programs. These suggestions lead us to interpret that the high turnover problematic and the importance to manage emotions should be considered and dealt directly in the training programs. These aspects are well described in the literature, however, often neglected in the design of training programs.</p>
<sec id="section21-1533317512466691">
<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>In this study the effects of the motor and multisensory care-based approach were examined directly on the residents’ behaviors; however, staff opinions were also considered to interpret the findings and inform the development and implementation of future training programs. This leads to a more complete, authentic, and rich exploratory data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1533317512466691">51</xref></sup> This is particularly important as in moderate/severe dementia, the only viable alternative (to measure residents’ well-being) is the direct observation of behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1533317512466691">39</xref></sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1533317512466691">52</xref></sup> and ultimately, the goal of staff training is to improve the care provided to residents with dementia, helping staff translating learning into practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1533317512466691">49</xref></sup> Therefore, care staff opinions are crucial for the development and implementation of innovative approaches and change in care practices.</p>
<p>Furthermore, few studies have implemented MSS and MS interventions in the residents’ natural contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1533317512466691">29</xref></sup> but, have used instead special snoezelen rooms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1533317512466691">53</xref></sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1533317512466691">54</xref></sup> or specific exercises to improve cognitive or physical function,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1533317512466691">17</xref></sup> which were added as extras to the residents’ daily routine. This research supports that MSS and MS interventions can be implemented by trained care staff, on a daily routine (bedside, bathroom, etc) and in meaningful activities (brushing the teeth, showering), which facilitates its implementation in institutions with little resources and potentiates its routine use.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that if MSS and MS are implemented by staff on a daily basis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1533317512466691">29</xref></sup>
<sup>,</sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1533317512466691">55</xref></sup> according to a person-centered care, considering resident’s preferences (which in this study was obtained dialoguing with the family and staff), it is possible to encourage and improve resident’s communication and engagement.</p>
<p>The few studies that have trained staff to implement MSS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1533317512466691">29</xref></sup> MS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1533317512466691">13</xref></sup> in daily care provision to residents with dementia had very different durations and yet all reported short-term positive benefits for the residents and/or staff. However, the long-term effects were not examined or in this study were found to deteriorate over time. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that it is not so much the intensity of the intervention (as long as a structured and organized training is provided) that will make a difference, but other strategies need to be explored to help to sustain results such as frequent close follow-up sessions, which will probably need to be a part of each institution policy. This emphasizes the need of involving the organizations as a key element for changing practices, also in dementia care. The role of education and training in care homes and the complexity of promoting and sustaining change has been thoroughly approached by Nolan and his coworkers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1533317512466691">56</xref></sup> however, relatively ignored in the clinical practice. Therefore, not involving the whole organization at its different levels has been a limitation which needs to be acknowledged in this study. Future research should consider this aspect carefully.</p>
<p>Other limitations have to be acknowledged. Given the small sample size, sufficient power was lacking to statistically confirm the differences between the phases; however, effect size for each variable was calculated. Future research with a larger sample, with a control group to provide comparisons, monitoring the organizations, and providing close follow-up sessions is recommended.</p>
