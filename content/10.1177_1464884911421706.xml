<abstract>
<p>Complex environmental science issues are regularly reported by the news media in highly personalized and symbolic terms in order to make the consequences of environmental degradation and risk comprehensible to the public. This article presents a case study showing how the tension between <italic>political statements, human-interest narratives</italic> and <italic>scientific credibility</italic> in this style of reporting can undercut citizen-led claims about environmental risk factors. This tension creates discursive openings that government and industry use to deny the existence of these factors or contest their consequences. The evidence presented in support of this argument relates to episodes of <italic>Australian Story</italic>, a popular ‘soft journalism’ programme, shown on the national public service broadcaster during the 2010 Tasmanian state election campaign. The timing and content of this programme produced extensive debate across multiple mediums about environmental risks, providing insight into the relationship between politics, journalism and the contested status of environmental science knowledge claims in the news.</p>

<body>
<p>Much like the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the resilience and endurance of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s (ABC) public service remit has been founded upon the provision of credible news and current affairs reporting to the public. The level of regard for the ABC has been established historically via a normative and institutionalized emphasis on national reach, impartiality, trustworthiness, and differentiation from commercial operators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911421706">Inglis, 2006</xref>). Public surveys find a clear connection between political knowledge and preference for the ABC as a source of information (and, to a lesser extent, its smaller multicultural sibling SBS). Public broadcasters are relied upon for news by 23 per cent of Australians, second only to free-to-air commercial television news (33%) and more so than newspapers (16%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884911421706">Jones and Pusey, 2010</xref>). The ABC’s influence is further evidenced by the close monitoring of the Corporation’s news and current affairs content by political parties and commentators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464884911421706">Nolan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884911421706">Pusey, 2003</xref>). A politically sensitive controversy chosen for in-depth attention by the ABC News and Current Affairs Department is effectively legitimated as a matter that deserves widespread public attention and, in the process, helps to frame the relevant dimensions of the issue for viewers, listeners and readers. This legitimating and framing power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911421706">Castells, 2009</xref>) matters in the reporting of complex environmental conflicts in particular, as stories provoke responses and counter-responses from committed individuals, groups and parties. The ABC also now plays an increased role in moderating these exchanges as it expands its multi-media presence, advancing beyond its traditional broadcast base to a network of internet-based platforms and a new 24-hour digital free-to-air news and current affairs channel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1464884911421706">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is in this broad context that we analyse two controversial episodes of the ABC’s nationally broadcast and web-archived <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911421706"><italic>Australian Story</italic> (2010</xref>, 15 and 22 February). Parts One and Two of ‘Something in the Water’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1464884911421706">2</xref></sup> concerned forest industry practices and the alleged presence of toxins in Tasmanian waterways, provoking intense news media and internet-based public and political debate. The programmes were screened over consecutive weeks at the start of the 2010 Tasmanian state election campaign, which explains the ferocity of the debate that followed and the strength of the State Government’s response to the claims presented. Intentionally or otherwise, ‘Something in the Water’ signalled an intervention by ABC News and Current Affairs during a closely fought election, which was only underlined by accusations that the episodes had been deliberately held over for broadcast during the election (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884911421706">Poynter, 2010</xref>). Conflict over the forest industry and its activities in the island state has received extensive national and international attention, and dominated the political landscape in Tasmania for more than 25 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884911421706">Lester, 2007</xref>). Events have included the fall of governments and corruption scandals, and the description of the Tasmanian political system as ‘primarily informed by the environment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911421706">Hay, 1991</xref>: 64) remains apt. The 2010 election continued this fractious tradition by producing a hung parliament that, after a month of constitutional argument and negotiation, gave way to a Labor minority government relying on the support of Greens members.</p>
<p>Our objective is to use these events in order to analyse an inherent tension between <italic>political statements, human-interest narratives</italic> and <italic>scientific credibility</italic> in much environmental reporting. Properly understanding this tension is important because of the way that complex and contested environmental science issues are regularly reported in highly personalized and symbolic terms across multiple mediums, even by ‘serious’ public broadcasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884911421706">Lester, 2010</xref>). For instance, a report about the victim of a coastal flood is used to humanize the effects of rising sea levels, while images of a bulldozer crushing trees in a forest convey the man-made destruction of pristine wilderness. Reports of this type relay ‘focusing incidents’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911421706">Giddens, 2009</xref>: 112) to the public that make the impact of environmental degradation comprehensible by emphasizing emotional, personal and physical consequences. But these frames can also simplify, distort or undercut the environmental science that produces degradation and risk, leaving room for critics and opponents to contest the extent of environmental damage or even its very occurrence. Ulrich Beck’s theory of the risk society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884911421706">Beck, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884911421706">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464884911421706">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884911421706">2009</xref>) reminds us that it is the ‘relations of definition’ – the clashes of a ‘multiplicity of antagonistic definitions’ over competing rationality claims – that determine if and how we recognize risks and then attribute responsibility. In the case of <italic>Australian Story</italic>, a confused set of rationality claims produced great drama, ambiguous journalism and contested environmental science. The resulting confusion intensified as conflicting claims travelled between and across broadcast and online media networks during the course of a state election. As we will show, public broadcasters have the power to dissect the complexities of environmental risk, but they can just as easily erode their own mediated authority.</p>
<sec id="section1-1464884911421706">
<title>Soft journalism and editorial ambiguity</title>
<p>The two half-hour episodes of <italic>Australian Story</italic> connected concerns about water quality in the Tasmanian coastal town of St Helens with the mass conversion of farmland and native forests to monoculture eucalypt plantations. Deploying the programme’s familiar personalized approach to serious public issues, the <italic>Australian Story</italic> episodes focused on the life and efforts of a St Helens doctor and member of local council, Alison Bleaney, who had consistently raised concerns about public health in the town. The contentious feature of the two-part programme was the scientific credibility of the claims that were aired and the contested definitions of risk to public health accompanying them. In effect, science was used as a narrative device in a human-interest story. Environmental science and soft journalism made for awkward bedfellows; a point reinforced when <italic>Australian Story</italic> indirectly disavowed its status as a news and current affairs programme. The programme’s Walkley Award-winning<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1464884911421706">3</xref></sup> executive director, Deborah Fleming, who has been at its helm since its inception in 1996, stated that the ‘program took no editorial position and reported Dr Bleaney’s concerns as concerns, not as facts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911421706">ABC News, 2010</xref>). The result was a scientifically based story about environmental risk, apparently devoid of factual claims, broadcast in the middle of an election campaign by an ABC news and current affairs programme. This was, to say the least, a problematic combination that produced a confused epistemological status for the scientific claims that were presented.</p>
<p>Explaining how the situation outlined here arose requires an understanding of the soft journalism format, which is a ‘hybridized’ form of journalism germane to the fluidity presently characterizing global news and current affairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884911421706">McNair, 2006</xref>: 11). Using <italic>Australian Story</italic> as their case study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911421706">Bonner and McKay (2007)</xref> explain that soft journalism eschews sensationalism, aggressive confrontation and masculinist ‘hard-hitting’ current affairs presentation techniques, preferring a focus on the search for meaning, altruism and human perseverance in the face of adversity. A feminized mode of address is conspicuously directed at ‘ordinary people’ and their concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911421706">Bonner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1464884911421706">Turner, 2010</xref>), even when presenting celebrity stories where the subject is made relatable by the use of family members and insights into their domestic life. Common themes include ‘heroic achievement’, ‘taking a stand’ and ‘human weakness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911421706">Bonner and McKay, 2007</xref>). <italic>Australian Story</italic> is a pioneer of this formula – ‘each program a sympathetically crafted essay in presentation of self’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911421706">Inglis, 2006</xref>: 417) – that can attract around 1 million viewers nationally.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1464884911421706">4</xref></sup> The programme has also won multiple media industry awards for its entertaining and revealing stories. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911421706">Bonner and McKay (2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884911421706">Turner, 2005</xref>) rightly point out that soft journalism is not akin to tabloid television – there is no exploitation of the subject, invasion of privacy or ‘dumbed down’ presentation. But it is also correct to say that there is an unresolved tension between human-interest narratives and fact-based reporting in this style of current affairs, which in our case was starkly revealed in the middle of an election campaign where environmental politics played a pivotal role.</p>
<p>The status of <italic>Australian Story</italic> as a current affairs programme has been debated since it first aired in May 1996. The programme addresses current and controversial issues, but its soft journalism formula has seen critics accuse it of giving subjects ‘an unchallenged free kick’ and ‘being the place where high-profile people go to manage adverse publicity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911421706">Bonner and McKay, 2007</xref>: 641). This type of criticism is even said to exist <italic>within</italic> the ABC News and Current Affairs department (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884911421706">Turner, 2005</xref>: 117–118). Shown on Mondays at 8 p.m., <italic>Australian Story</italic> sits in the middle of two-and-a-half hours of programming (7–9.30 p.m.) that are emblematic of ABC news and current affairs. This time span covers the <italic>ABC News</italic> at 7 p.m., which delivers a mix of local, national and international stories in a hard news format; the <italic>7.30 Report</italic>, a flagship half-hour current affairs show hosted for 15 years by respected political journalist, Kerry O’Brien, each weeknight; <italic>Four Corners</italic> at 8.30 p.m., a leading current affairs and investigative journalism programme that offers a marked stylistic contrast to the show directly preceding it, and; <italic>Media Watch</italic>, a short critical examination of the Australian news media.</p>
<p>The ABC’s ‘Principles for editorial practice for news and current affairs’, which appear in its official <italic>Editorial Policies</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911421706">ABC, 2007</xref>, revised 2009), clearly describes its journalistic values: ‘All news and current affairs content will be accurate, impartial and objective, and thereby avoid bias’, it begins. On impartiality, it is noted, ‘Editorial judgements are based on news values, not for example on political, commercial or sectional interests or personal views. Do not unduly favour one perspective over others.’ There is a complementary emphasis on balance in reporting:
<disp-quote>
<p>Balance will be sought but may not always be achieved within a single program or publication; it will be achieved as soon as reasonably practicable and in an appropriate manner. It is not essential to give all sides equal time. As far as possible, present principal relevant views on matters of importance.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This policy framework is a difficult fit for <italic>Australian Story</italic> and its intimate approach to storytelling, as well as other modes of human-interest reporting that convey subjective experiences. The promotional materials for episodes acknowledge the serious character of the news and issues under examination, but jettison conventional applications of impartiality and balance. To do otherwise would detract from the genuine appeal of the programme: ‘<italic>Australian Story</italic> can and does take sides; it does allow the kind of self-speaking that challenges political and social orthodoxies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911421706">Bonner and McKay, 2007</xref>: 654). This approach, nonetheless, creates an uneasy relationship. <italic>Australian Story</italic> is positioned as a product of the ABC’s long-standing and serious tradition of news and current affairs, yet has developed a divergent and successful reputation of its own by rejecting the orthodoxies of the ABC’s current affairs reporting policies.</p>
<p>The value of our case study is informed by the fact that the editorial tension and duality discussed was revealed during the high-pressure atmosphere of an election campaign, producing an increased level of focus and scrutiny. Problems in personalized modes of environmental reporting were revealed that can be difficult to identify clearly at other times. An election campaign is a period normally governed by formal interpretations and strict policing of journalistic objectivity and balance. Moreover, a public broadcaster is entrusted with the task of impartially deciphering the notoriously thorny issue of environmental risk: an impossible stance to maintain when deliberately stressing the human face and partiality of political challengers and claims makers. As will be shown, the response from a pro-logging government was, unsurprisingly, forceful and took the form of a depersonalized scientific investigation that sought to defuse the public health concerns existing in the community of St Helens.</p>

<title>Something in the water</title>
<p>Still central to Australian political life, the six state governments in the Australian federal system control a range of major services and policies, including significant aspects of health, education and the environment, and state elections, like their federal counterpart, are subject to compulsory voting. Tasmanian elections have for four decades been dominated by arguments over environmental issues: hydroelectric schemes in the 1970s and early 1980s, and forest industry activity since the mid-1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884911421706">Lester, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884911421706">Lohrey, 2002</xref>). During the 2010 election campaign, the forest industry – weakened by a downturn in demand for native forest woodchips and its failure to find a backer for a proposed $2 billion pulp mill – had withdrawn from the public eye while attempting to negotiate a compromise with the conservation movement. Meanwhile, with the parliamentary balance of power within reach, the Greens party had distanced itself from its activist protest movement supporter base in order to present a more electorally palatable image to voters. This brokered silence was ruptured by the ABC at the start of the campaign’s second week when <italic>Australian Story</italic> aired Part One of ‘Something in the Water’ on 15 February.</p>
<p>The episode begins by introducing Alison Bleaney, a local doctor and member of the St Helens council, who, with scientist Marcus Scammell and local oyster farmers, had ‘banded together to investigate mysterious water quality issues in one of the most beautiful areas of Tasmania’. These issues are, over the course of the episode, tied to the poor health of some local residents and the declining quality of oyster farms in the region. Bleaney, shown walking with her husband on the beach, delivers a voice-over in which she describes struggling with the prospect of damaging Tasmania’s reputation for ‘people like real estate agencies’ and tourism ventures, and of not wanting to be judged as alarmist. This is a theme that bookends both episodes and in each case is followed by sequences that establish Bleaney as selfless, ‘extraordinary’, as having ‘people’s best interest at heart’ and as being unfairly ‘rubbished’ and ‘dismissed’ by critics. Part One continues the focus on Bleaney’s character by narrating, through interview and historical film and newspaper clippings, her role during the Falklands War, both as a doctor in a local hospital and in providing a crucial communications link between Argentinean and British command. The relevance of the extended Falkland’s segment is established by a telling comment from an interviewee, ‘She is doing in Tasmania what she did in the Falklands in 1982’, which acts to situate her in an environmental ‘war zone’. The episode returns to Tasmania and locates Bleaney in her surgery in St Helens, where she identifies unusual health issues, including rare cancers, among her patients. The oyster farmers and Scammell are introduced into the narrative at this point, which turns to the collective efforts of the group to untangle the ‘mystery’ of water quality in the area. Previous interjections by Bleaney and Scammell into the debate over forestry and, indeed, Tasmania’s broader environmental conflict are implied by association, rather than noted directly. In the next sequence, for instance, a wildlife expert and visuals of Tasmanian devils with grotesque facial tumours speak to the disfiguring and deadly disease endangering the Tasmanian devil population. Although no firm scientific link has been established between the emergence of the disease over the past decade and the practices of the forestry industry, possible links to loss of habitat through clear-felling and the chemicals used in establishing plantations have been part of news reporting and public discussion.</p>
<p>Part One moves towards its conclusion with visuals of Bleaney and Scammell taking samples from the George River, and testing their assumption that the chemicals used on surrounding forestry plantations are polluting the town’s water supply. The first clearly identified political actor is then introduced, environmental campaigner and director of Environment Tasmania, Phil Pullinger, who comments that Bleaney’s actions are in the public interest. The fact that the State Government rejected the findings of Bleaney and Scammell’s previous round of water tests is acknowledged. Television news footage and newspaper headlines reporting the criticisms of the initial testing regime and findings are shown on screen, to which Bleaney, Scammell and supporters respond directly on camera. The episode closes with pointed visuals of children fishing on a jetty.</p>
<p>Part Two of ‘Something in the Water’ is again framed by Bleaney’s ‘fight’. It begins by recapping her experience of the Falklands War and her concern about the types of illnesses presented by patients at her medical practice in St Helens. Central to the drama that follows are accusations of scaremongering and the rejection of Bleaney and Scammell’s previous investigations (again via past news reports<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1464884911421706">5</xref></sup>), including a threat of legal action from the town’s mayor on the basis that it was ‘putting down’ the community and ‘unscientific’. It is stated that their claims were rejected on the basis that their water samples were found to have no human-made chemicals in them. The concentrated surface scum on the water was toxic to daphnia, but contained only organic compounds from ‘naturally produced vegetation such as ti-tree and eucalypts’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1464884911421706">6</xref></sup> The episode moves into a sequence of tightly cut interview footage of Bleaney and Scammell, as well as visuals of them collecting new water samples from the river, packaging them for transportation, and laboratory scientists testing the samples. The conclusion to the ‘mystery’ is drawn that the alleged toxicity of the water is due to the ‘genetic improvement’ of the trees in Tasmanian plantations, not chemical spraying as they initially thought, and that the river foam carries the toxins into the town’s water supply and the surrounding oyster farms.</p>
<p>Various scientists, visualized in their laboratories at work, discuss the findings, which Bleaney expands upon and ‘translates’ in interview. Campaigner Phil Pullinger is again shown, making direct reference to the forest industry when he tells viewers that there are nearly 300,000 hectares of plantations in Tasmania against a visual backdrop of a helicopter spraying a forest. The episode concludes at a restaurant overlooking the ocean, where Bleaney, Scammell and oyster farmers are served local oysters, which they eat while describing them as ‘delicious’. The end captions list the various political actors who were approached for comment and their responses, including the State Government, the State Director of Health, and forest industry lobby groups. Although none of these actors appear on screen in the two episodes, their detailed statements appear on the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911421706"><italic>Australian Story</italic> (2010)</xref> website. The timing and nature of these approaches also feature in the political debate that followed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1464884911421706">
<title>The ensuing debate</title>
<p>Debate about the programme’s disputed scientific claims and content occurred within and across a range of forums immediately after the first episode, including on <italic>Australian Story</italic>’s moderated online ‘guestbook’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884911421706"><italic>Australian Story</italic> Guestbook, 2010</xref>); in newspaper, television and online news and their reader and comment forums; and on independent specialist news and opinion websites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1464884911421706">7</xref></sup> A notable feature of debate was a tendency of anonymous contributors – who may or may not have had vested interests – to stay within the frames created by the report on which they were commenting, whether it was the <italic>Australian Story</italic> episodes or related news and opinion pieces. The <italic>Australian Story</italic> guestbook, for example, was filled quickly with comments relating Bleaney’s advocacy to that of Rachel Carson and her book <italic>Silent Spring</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884911421706">1962</xref>), and the experiences of celebrity environmental campaigner Erin Brockovich. Other entries described personal stories of ‘knowing’, of visiting the region (‘I’ve eaten the oysters, should I be worried?’), and being aware of people who had died of unusual cancers. Bleaney is described as brave, selfless, a hero and caring. Of the 36 messages posted by 34 individual contributors after Part One, all but four supported the program’s content and reflected, if not wholly, the dominant frames of ‘Something in the Water’. Of the 94 messages from 60 contributors posted following Part Two, all but five were supportive and largely displayed the same programme frames.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, contending opinions and frames quickly emerged in other locations, and these were the frames that were most likely to move across forums. They also interacted – powerfully at times – with each other, opening cleavages between various forms of political and environmental risk knowledge in the midst of a tight election race. We identified three main intersecting frames. The first – unlike the programme itself – explicitly connected claims made on <italic>Australian Story</italic> to the broader political and environmental conflict in Tasmania, including plans for the $2 billion pulp mill, which would be fed by plantation-grown woodchips, and general accusations of ‘corruption’ and ‘rot’ in Tasmanian politics. The second frame addressed the programme’s contested science, and focused on the ‘scientific method’ and confusion between the terms ‘genetically improved’ and ‘genetically modified’. These issues appeared in news media coverage, but also intersected with hierarchies of specialist knowledge (‘You are not a doctor, Peter, are you?’) and the deployment of knowledge for political purposes. The third dominant frame was actively concerned with the ABC and its role in producing and airing the programme, again regularly contextualized within the broader political conflict, the election campaign, and the representation of scientific methods and data.</p>
<p>Most of the comments on the <italic>Australian Story</italic> guestbook – as suggested earlier – did not contest the content of the episodes and the ABC. ‘“Something in the Water” is a compelling, well balanced story which is a great credit to the ABC’, is indicative of these types of opinion. Several other comments made explicit connections to the forthcoming 20 March election, reinforcing the ABC’s role in Australian political life:
<disp-quote>
<p>I only hope that this national exposure of one of the many shameful shortcomings of Tasmanian governance will encourage the local community to demand a complete overhaul of public probity and responsibility on March 20th. Unfortunately, I fear that many of the state’s voters never tune in to our ABC. (<italic>Australian Story</italic> Guestbook post, 22 February 2010 9:47:34 p.m.)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Rare comments expressed disappointment with the ABC for failing to provide objectivity and balance in reporting, instead presenting an ‘extremely biased and sympathetic account of persons seeking to enter the highly charged and emotive forestry debate in Tasmania in support of the anti forestry camp without objective evidence to support their conclusions’ (Australian Story Guestbook post, 15 February 2010 11:12:50 p.m.).</p>
<p>In Tasmanian newspapers and their online forums, the ABC’s role in the political conflict was a key source of discussion. The chief political reporter of Tasmania’s highest selling metropolitan newspaper, <italic>The Mercury</italic>, wrote in a column mostly supportive of Bleaney and Scammell’s efforts:
<disp-quote>
<p>The Bartlett Government is quietly suggesting the timing of the ABC’s stories featuring Dr Bleaney and heightening fears about the St Helens drinking water is not coincidental. They believe it is a bomb deliberately timed to go off during the election campaign lobbed with the full knowledge and agreement of the Tasmanian Greens. The Greens deny this – but in the midst of an election campaign, everything becomes political. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884911421706">Neales, 2010</xref>)</p>

<p>As with the <italic>Australian Story</italic> episodes, debate prompted by news stories in <italic>The Mercury</italic> tended to follow the frames of the stories under discussion. Examples include an announcement that a government-sponsored expert panel had been formed to investigate water quality, and speculation about the motives for Bleaney and Scammell’s initial refusal to release their data to the Director of Public Health.</p>
<p>Significantly, the ABC and its roles and responsibilities were central to the discussion occurring in independent online news and opinion forums. A forest industry commentator, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464884911421706">Mark Poynter (2010)</xref>, writing on the website <italic>Online Opinion</italic>, made two claims designed to dent the ABC’s reputation as a politically impartial conveyor of news. First, it was said that the ABC made no attempt to contact forest industry representatives until just days before airing the programme. Second, filming had in fact been completed ‘some months earlier’ and, as already mentioned, was held over purposefully for broadcast during the election campaign: ‘If true, this suggests that although the ABC obviously believed there was a serious public health issue affecting the people of St Helens, they deemed it to be less important than delaying the screening of the programme to help facilitate a particular political outcome.’ The 53 comments that responded to this article included repeated attacks on the ABC’s ‘lack of rigour’ in its practice of journalism, including telling strikes such as this one:
<disp-quote>
<p>I watched ‘something in the water’ completely aghast at the lack of rigour applied to the ‘information’ presented … was this supposed to be journalism? How could the ABC think that it is OK to run a public health scare campaign of this nature? <italic>This was particularly disturbing knowing that the shows producers were aware of the depth of information that questioned Dr Blaineys [sic] hypothesis, but they chose to hide this information on the web site, leaving the general viewing public unduly concerned about water quality</italic>. I hope the ABC’s media watch have a look at this. I hope the programs producers &amp; the ABC management are made to explain their motives in releasing such public mis-information. This is really disappointing stuff from the public broadcaster. (Online Opinion: The Forum post, 8 March <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464884911421706">2010</xref>, 3:36:53 p.m., emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Again, other comments made direct references to the state election, questioning whether the programme had influenced opinion polling that showed a contemporaneous swing towards the Greens against the sitting Labor Government.</p>
<p>Significantly, the State Government established an expert scientific panel to investigate the claims that had been presented, a notable decision from a government that was sceptical about the story. This decision was taken to address legitimate public health concerns, and arguably delegitimize the emotionally framed scientific claims that had been aired on the ABC. In effect, the Government called in ‘real scientists’, which they selected, to resolve the matter. On 29 June, four months after ‘Something in the Water’ was broadcast and three months after the election that produced a record vote for the Greens, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884911421706">George River Water Quality Panel (2010)</xref> released its final report. Comprising six senior scientists from a variety of leading research organizations and universities with acknowledged expertise in water quality, public health and eucalypt chemistry, the Panel’s findings declared that there was ‘nothing to be concerned about regarding the water in the George River’, and that the river foam samples ‘referred to in that story were not truly representative of the water in the river’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884911421706">George River Water Panel Report Questions &amp; Answers, 2010</xref>). Community health records from 1993 to 2007 showed no abnormal cancer rates in the region, and the fact that oyster production had doubled in the bay between 2000 and 2009 was a ‘sign of a healthy environment’. Within days, these findings were rejected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884911421706">Scammell and Bleaney (2010a)</xref>, who claimed in news coverage and on the independent news and commentary website, <italic>Tasmanian Times</italic> (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884911421706">Hutchins, 2007</xref>), that the Panel appeared to have disregarded significant data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1464884911421706">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The then Premier of Tasmania, David Bartlett, greeted the Panel’s findings by calling for an apology not from Bleaney and Scammell, but rather the ABC. In a media release issued on 30 June, the Premier claimed the upper hand in defining the reality of environmental risk. The Panel’s scientific study had found that the ‘report by <italic>Australian Story</italic> was wrong’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884911421706">Bartlett, 2010</xref>). He continued, ‘These two episodes of <italic>Australian Story</italic> caused fear and distress in the St Helens community, and damaged the town’s tourist reputation throughout Australia.’ In a letter to Mark Scott, the ABC’s managing director, Bartlett asked the ABC to remove the programme from its website, or if that was not possible, to add a disclaimer. This letter did not, however, constitute a formal complaint. Additionally, the Premier requested that the ABC add an explanation to the end of another episode. Bartlett’s reaction sparked another debate online, in which he was accused of trying to ‘muzzle the ABC’s <italic>Australian Story</italic> programme with an aggressive and highly political attack’, while the ABC was also encouraged to tell the Premier to ‘get stuffed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464884911421706"><italic>Tasmanian Times.com</italic>, 2010</xref>). The ABC’s managing director forwarded the Premier’s complaint, and twelve others, to its Audience and Consumer Affairs unit. In June 2011, the unit concluded that ‘the program in some respects fell short of ABC editorial standards relating to contextual accuracy and balance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884911421706">Managing Director’s summary, 2011</xref>). As discussed earlier in the paper, the unexamined issue in this judgement is whether the enduring success or effectiveness of the Australian Story format is even related to the type of ‘balance’ traditionally ascribed to public service broadcasting news and current affairs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1464884911421706">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Social and scientific definitions of risk produce intense arguments and symbolic conflicts because of their ambiguous, paradoxical and contested character. As Beck explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>The key issue is how successfully social and legal constructions of the ‘latent side effects’ are upheld or undermined, and hence responsibility is manufactured, and thus to what extent a ‘dense modernization’ is successfully created in which perpetrators are directly confronted with the consequences of their actions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884911421706">2009</xref>: 30)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The site of this definitional conflict is not the forests or waterways, but television, the press and the internet, where citizens rely on the symbolic politics of the media, and ‘tangible, simplifying symbols, in which cultural nerve fibres are touched and alarmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884911421706">Beck, 2009</xref>: 98–99). As applied here, simplicity has multiple meanings and contentious political effects: it can transmit responsibility, sell ‘ecological indulgences’ and create moral outrage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884911421706">Beck, 2009</xref>: 99). Exemplified by the soft journalism format, this is a dramaturgy of heroes and villains, and of a ‘dance’ between political players that quickens and swirls in accordance with the perceived environmental threat of industry practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911421706">Hutchins and Lester, 2006</xref>). In the course of this dance, the likes of Bleaney and Scammell perform the role of ‘small, private alternative experts’ whose peculiarly social rationality bears witness to the experience of environmental risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884911421706">Beck, 1992</xref>: 61; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884911421706">Cox, 2010</xref>: 215). The problem is that <italic>highly</italic> personalized and dramatized stories can openly reveal the tensions between political statements, human-interest narratives and scientific credibility, and disable the capacity of ‘alternative experts’ to sustain legitimacy when explaining the effects of hotly disputed risks. This problem was actually magnified by a scientific Panel that dismissed Bleaney’s claims, and by <italic>Australian Story</italic> – a self-styled current affairs programme – whose executive director declared that concerns, not facts had been reported: a surprising statement to make <italic>after</italic> a programme has been aired.</p>
<p>There is a time and place for soft journalism as a hybrid form of reporting given its deserved appeal and capacity for insight into human character and emotional experience. It also provides a potentially useful space for political challengers who have difficulty having their voices heard in public debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911421706">Cottle, 2000</xref>). But the unique structure and unavoidable partiality of the storytelling on display also demands journalistic circumspection in restricting the range of rationalities and knowledge claims being moulded and presented, especially during an election campaign when myriad allegations and counter-allegations are circulating. Altogether too much was placed onto the shoulders of the ‘hero figure’, Bleaney, by <italic>Australian Story</italic> in this instance. She stood for both social and scientific knowledge, which was an ambition unlikely to succeed given the oppositional or at least separate roles these forms of rationality often adopt in mediated risk definition. Her identification as a town councillor and activist further complicated the epistemology of her claims and her place within the soft journalism format. Each of these roles might sit comfortably as discrete narratives, but, when loaded onto a single subject simultaneously, they opened discursive holes that the personalized approach to reporting was incapable of plugging. These unacknowledged complications, even contradictions, lend themselves to potentially chaotic scientific and political outcomes.</p>
<p>Surrounding networks of debate and negotiation fill the discursive openings left by personalized environmental reporting. The ‘facts’ presented in <italic>Australian Story</italic> were discussed and sorted by news outlets and in internet forums, and connections were made across multiple issues and broader conflicts. It was here that the programme’s references to scientific data and terms were clarified; where direct links to the election and the future of the forest industry were made; and where the ABC’s roles and responsibilities as a public service broadcaster were openly debated. That such sense-making work was done in these surrounding spaces highlights that the intricacies of the ABC’s role deserves close scrutiny, especially in terms of how its reputation for quality is structured by an expanding range of journalism formats and communications platforms. These formats and platforms alternatively augment, cohere and conflict with the conventions of traditional news and current affairs, and the specific editorial policies of public service broadcasters. Such investigation is necessary given the acknowledged power and influence of the ABC in the area of news and current affairs reporting nationally and regionally, and the likelihood that the hybridity characterizing contemporary journalism is set to further produce clashes between network, programme and platform in the public and political spheres. As this article has shown, much is at stake as environmental reports influence the social definition of risk, and the public’s ability to identify, understand and act upon reliable political and environmental information at crucial moments of political decision-making.</p>

<p>An interesting contrast can be made here to complaints about an episode of the ABC’s leading current affairs programme, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911421706"><italic>Four Corners</italic> (2004)</xref>, which also investigated the Tasmanian forests. Broadcast on 16 February 2004, ‘Lord of the Forests’ sparked a series of complaints from industry groups to the ABC and the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). The ACMA found that the programme had failed to make every reasonable effort to ensure that it was impartial and cited language, tone and footage in handing down their decision. While ACMA found that the programme did not breach ABC requirements for balance with regard to the people interviewed and points of view presented, it did find that ‘factual errors acknowledged by the ABC were not corrected in a timely manner’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884911421706">ACMA, 2006</xref>).</p>
