<p>In <italic>Unigene Laboratories, Inc. et al. v. Apotex, Inc. et al.</italic>, 655 F.3d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2011), the Federal Circuit addressed issues of obviousness and the crime fraud exception to privilege. The Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court's denial of summary judgment of obviousness and its grant of summary judgment of nonobviousness. In addition, the Federal Circuit found that the District Court had properly found that documents had not been improperly withheld based on the crime-fraud exception and that additional theories of inequitable conduct raised by Apotex at later stages of the litigation had either been previously addressed by the District Court or had been waived. This case report presents the arguments made at the District Court and Federal Circuit and how each of these courts addressed the issues raised by the parties.</p>

<p>In <italic>Unigene Laboratories, Inc. et al. v. Apotex, Inc. et al.</italic>, 655 F.3d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2011), the Federal Circuit affirmed decisions of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York denying a motion by defendants, Apotex, Inc. and Apotex Corp. (‘Apotex’), for summary judgment of obviousness of claim 19 of U.S. Patent No. RE40,812 (originally U.S. Patent No. 6,440,392), granting a cross-motion by plaintiffs, Unigene Laboratories, Inc. and Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc., for summary judgment that claim 19 was not obvious, dismissing all remaining defenses/counterclaims raised by Apotex and denying Apotex’s motion to compel production of certain documents for which Plaintiffs claimed privilege. In so ruling, the Federal Circuit brought to an end over 5 years of litigation relating to Apotex’s attempt to bring to market a generic version of Unigene’s Fortical® product before patent expiration in 2021.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741134311433733"><title>The District Court decision</title>
<sec id="sec5-1741134311433733"><title>Procedural history</title>
<sec id="sec6-1741134311433733"><title>Unigene’s Fortical® product</title>
<p>Miacalcin®, a salmon calcitonin nasal spray, was first marketed in the USA by Novartis in 1995. <italic>Id</italic>. at 1355. Unigene’s Fortical® product – also a salmon calcitonin nasal spray – was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2005 as bioequivalent to the Novartis Miacalcin® product.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1741134311433733">1</xref></sup> As part of its application to the FDA for approval of Fortical®, Unigene identified U.S. Patent No. 6,440,392 (‘the ‘392 patent’) as a patent ‘with respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted’ under 21 U.S.C. §355(b)(1) and as such the ‘392 patent was listed in the Orange Book for Fortical®.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1741134311433733">2</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741134311433733"><title>The patent-in-suit</title>
<p>The ‘392 patent was issued on August 27, 2002 from an application originally filed on February 2, 2001. Subsequently, Unigene licensed the ‘392 patent to Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc. In conducting due diligence prior to taking a license, Upsher-Smith’s attorney discovered several prior art references that had not been disclosed to the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) during the prosecution of the ‘392 patent, including U.S. Patent Nos 6,087,338 (‘the ‘338 patent’) and 5,912,014 (‘the ‘014 patent’). <italic>Unigene Labs., Inc. et al. v. Apotex, Inc. et al.</italic>, 2008 WL 356482, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 1998). Upsher-Smith’s attorney brought these references to the attention of the law firm that had prosecuted the ‘392 patent, and on February 5, 2004, a reissue application was filed canceling several claims that were anticipated by the ‘338 patent and amending several others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1741134311433733">3</xref></sup> <italic>Id</italic>. The ‘338 patent and the ‘014 patent were both disclosed to the PTO during the prosecution of the reissue application. <italic>Id</italic>.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741134311433733"><title>The Lawsuit</title>
<p>Less than 10 months after Unigene received approval for Fortical®, Apotex filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) seeking to market a generic version of Fortical® prior to the expiration of the ‘392 patent. <italic>Id</italic>. at *2. On July 24, 2006, Unigene and Upsher-Smith sued Apotex for infringement of claim 19 of the ‘392 patent. <italic>Id</italic>. Apotex filed an answer in September 2006, raising affirmative defenses and counterclaims for noninfringement, invalidity, and inequitable conduct. Fact discovery closed in mid-September 2007 and in October 2007, Apotex filed a motion to compel discovery of certain documents claimed to be privileged, based on the crime-fraud exception. The District Court denied Apotex’s motion in an opinion issued on February 4, 2008 (discussed below). The District Court subsequently held a <italic>Markman</italic> hearing on July 14, 2008 and issued a claim construction opinion in August 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1741134311433733">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>On October 23, 2008, Unigene moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the anticipated launch of Apotex’s generic version of Fortical®.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1741134311433733">5</xref></sup> The issue of a preliminary injunction was settled by stipulation of the parties which provided that Apotex would not launch its product unless the District Court found the asserted claim of the patent-in-suit to be invalid or not infringed. <italic>See</italic> Stipulation and Preliminary Injunction Order, <italic>Unigene Labs., Inc. et al. v. Apotex, Inc. et al.</italic>, No. 06-5571 (S.D.N.Y. December 4, 2008).</p>
<p>The ‘392 patent reissued as U.S. Patent No. RE40,812 (‘the ‘812 patent’) on June 30, 2009<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1741134311433733">6</xref></sup> and 2 days later Plaintiffs filed, with the consent of the Court, an amended complaint which substituted the ‘812 patent for the originally asserted ‘392 patent. Apotex filed an answer to the amended complaint on July 20, 2009 which added eight additional inequitable conduct defenses/counterclaims, in addition to the originally raised non-infringement, invalidity, and inequitable conduct claims. <italic>Unigene Labs., Inc. et al. v. Apotex, Inc. et al.</italic>, 2010 WL 2730471, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2010).</p>
<p>On April 17, 2009, Apotex filed a motion for summary judgment of invalidity based on obviousness and a week later Plaintiffs cross-moved for summary judgment of no obviousness. On August 31, 2009, the District Court denied Apotex’s motion, granted Plaintiffs’ cross-motion for summary judgment of non-obviousness, and entered judgment in favor of Plaintiffs. Apotex then moved to vacate the judgment, arguing that additional defenses/counterclaims remained in the case. As a result, the District Court vacated its judgment in favor of Plaintiffs, subject to reinstatement, and directed the parties to brief the issue of whether any claims in the case were still outstanding. On July 7, 2010, the District Court reinstated its opinion on summary judgment and also found in favor of Plaintiffs on all remaining claims as well.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1741134311433733"><title>The crime-fraud decision</title>
<p>At the conclusion of fact discovery, Apotex filed a motion to compel production of certain documents withheld on the basis of attorney–client privilege. In its motion, Apotex sought ‘to abrogate the attorney–client privilege and work product privilege based on the crime-fraud exception and to compel discovery of “all documents including [privileged documents] referring to, mentioning or relating to the prosecution of the ‘392 patent.”’ <italic>Unigene Labs.</italic>, 2008 WL 356482 at *2.</p>
<p>More specifically, Apotex alleged that Unigene ‘omitted and misrepresented material facts during the prosecution of the ‘392 patent with intent to deceive the PTO and that the ‘392 patent would not have issued but for the omission and misrepresentation.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *4. Apotex specifically pointed to: ‘(1) Unigene’s failure to cite the ‘014 patent in the initial prosecution of the ‘392 patent and (2) [an] error in Table 3 of Unigene’s application for the ‘392 patent.’ <italic>Id</italic>.</p>
<p>With regard to the ‘014 patent, Apotex noted that Dr. Stern, the sole inventor named on the ‘392 patent, was also a co-inventor named on the ‘014 patent and as such certainly had knowledge of the patent during the prosecution of the ‘392 patent. <italic>Id</italic>. The District Court first addressed the question of ‘whether the ‘014 patent is material to the patentability of the ‘392 patent and whether Dr. Stern would have or should have known of its materiality.’ <italic>Id</italic>. The District Court initially noted that the ‘014 patent was directed to enteric-coated oral formulations comprising salmon calcitonin, while the ‘392 patent was directed to intranasal formulations. <italic>Id</italic>. at *2. The District Court further noted that Defendants were unable to ‘demonstrate the similarity between oral and nasal deliveries of calcitonin or the materiality of the ‘014 patent to the ‘392 patent.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *5. The District Court also found that Apotex’s contention ‘that the ‘014 patent teaches the effects of citric acid on the bioavailability of salmon calcitonin is not supported by the patent.’ <italic>Id</italic>. Specifically, the District Court noted that ‘Defendants fail to show that the use of citric acid to lower the pH environment of the intestines is material to the bioavailability of calcitonin when administered through the nasal cavity.’ <italic>Id</italic>. Thus, the District Court concluded that ‘[i]n view of these differences … Defendants have not demonstrated the materiality of the ‘014 patent to the patentability of the ‘392 patent.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *6.</p>
<p>The District Court further stated that ‘Defendants’ unsupported allegation that Dr. Stern and Unigene intentionally omitted the ‘014 patent during the initial prosecution of the ‘392 patent is insufficient to state a prima facie case of fraud.’ <italic>Id</italic>. The District Court thus stated that ‘Defendants present no other evidence based on which the Court can infer that Dr. Stern or Unigene had fraudulent intent to withhold or bury reference to the ‘014 patent.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *7.</p>
<p>The District Court next turned to Apotex’s second allegation, that Unigene intentionally misrepresented material data in Table 3 of the ‘392 patent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1741134311433733">7</xref></sup> <italic>Id</italic>. at *8. Specifically, Defendants argued that Unigene intentionally misrepresented experimental results by setting forth in Table 3 of the ‘392 patent that after 15 days of storage at 15°C in a formulation containing 100 mM of citric acid, only 20% of the salmon calcitonin was recovered when 52% was actually recovered. <italic>Id</italic>. Defendants alleged that but for this misrepresentation, the ‘392 patent would not have issued. <italic>Id</italic>.</p>
<p>The District Court found that even ‘[t]he corrected Table 3<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1741134311433733">8</xref></sup> still supports the invention claimed in the ‘392 patent, which is that optimal stability and bioavailability of the salmon calcitonin nasal spray are achieved with citric acid concentrations between 10 mM and 50 mM…’ <italic>Id</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1741134311433733">9</xref></sup> Thus, the District Court found that ‘the error, which is not inconsistent with the position Unigene has taken with respect to the patentability of the ‘392 patent, cannot be considered material.’ <italic>Id</italic>.</p>
<p>With respect to Apotex’s allegation that the misrepresentation was made with the intent to deceive the PTO, the District Court noted that such an allegation was not supported by the evidence in the record and that ‘[t]o the contrary, the evidence tends to prove that this error was an honest mistake, though perhaps a careless one.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *9. The District Court also noted that ‘when Dr. Stern became aware of the error in Table 3, he brought it to the attention of the Examiner of the reissue application … and submitted a second declaration in which he explained that an “inadvertent error during automated data analysis resulted in an incorrect number being entered for the percent [salmon calcitonin] recovered in the last row and column of original Table 3.” <italic>Id</italic>. Furthermore, the District Court noted that Dr. Stern explained to the Examiner why the error in Table 3 did not affect the patentability of the ‘392 patent. <italic>Id</italic>.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the District Court denied Apotex’s motion to compel discovery.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1741134311433733"><title>Summary Judgment</title>
<p>On August 31, 2009, the District Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment of non-obviousness and correspondingly denied Apotex’s summary judgment motion that claim 19 of the ‘392 patent was invalid as obvious. In the District Court’s decision, the court began by noting that ‘[d]uring the reissue proceedings, Plaintiffs submitted, and the patent examiner considered, all prior art cited by Defendants in their motion for summary judgment, as well as all of Defendants’ expert reports.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1741134311433733">10</xref></sup> <italic>Unigene Labs., Inc. et al. v. Apotex, Inc. et al.</italic>, 2009 WL 2762706, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 31, 2009). In addition, the District Court noted that ‘[w]here a claim has also survived a reissue proceeding, and has thus been twice considered by the PTO, the burden of proving invalidity is made “heavier,” and must be met by the party asserting invalidity.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *3 (internal citations omitted).</p>
<p>Turning to the contentions of the parties, the District Court noted that with respect to Claim 19 of the ‘392 patent, the only asserted claim, the claim was directed to a composition which is ‘composed of 2,200 IU/ml of salmon calcitonin, about 20 mM of citric acid, about .2% phenylethyl alcohol, about .5% benzyl alcohol, and about .1% polyoxethylene sorbitan monooleate (‘Polysorbate 80’) [and that] both parties agree that the salmon calcitonin serves as the active ingredient, the citric acid serves as a buffer, absorption enhancer, and stabilizer, the phenylethyl and benzyl alcohols are preservatives, and the Polysorbate 80 is a surfactant.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *6. The District Court noted that Defendants’ obviousness argument was ‘based on a combination of over 40 prior art references [and that] Defendants put forth their obviousness argument despite the fact that all of the relevant prior art identified by Defendants’ chemistry and patent law experts, as well as their expert reports, were submitted to and considered by the USPTO during the reissue prosecution.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *7.</p>
<p>Defendants argued that as of the priority date of the ‘392 patent, a person of ordinary skill in the art (POSA) seeking to make a nasal calcitonin product ‘would have been motivated to make a drug comparable to Novartis’ successful Miacalcin.’ <italic>Id</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1741134311433733">11</xref></sup> The District Court further noted that ‘[b]ioequivalence with Miacalcin would have ensured the new drug’s eligibility for the FDA’s abbreviated new drug application [and] FDA approval through an ANDA would decrease the drug’s time to market and reduce approval costs by reducing or eliminating safety testing. At the same time, the POSA would have been motivated to create a drug that did not infringe the Miacalcin patent.’ <italic>Id</italic>. Nevertheless, the District Court immediately noted that other than the active ingredient, ‘none of the other ingredients of Miacalcin match that of Claim 19.’ <italic>Id</italic>. Thus, the District Court stated that ‘the issue presented is whether it would have been obvious for a POSA to strip away the nonactive ingredients of Miacalcin, and insert the ingredients present in Claim 19 to arrive at Fortical.’ <italic>Id</italic>.</p>
<p>Defendants pointed to several references as disclosing ‘use of about 20 mM of citric acid and/or its salts with calcitonin, specifically salmon calcitonin, in liquid nasal compositions.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *8. However, the District Court noted that nothing in the references ‘suggests using 20 mM of citric acid with salmon calcitonin to achieve the result obtained by the ‘392 patent, which was to have a nasal salmon caclitonin formulation with both shelf stability and enhanced bioavailability.’ <italic>Id</italic>. The District Court specifically noted that in these ‘pieces of prior art relied upon by Defendants, citric acid was used as a buffer, and not as an absorption enhancer or shelf stabilizer.’ <italic>Id</italic>. Furthermore, the District Court noted that the cited references ‘all teach citric acid as a potential buffering agent when used with other absorption enhancers, indicating that citric acid cannot act as both a buffer and an absorption enhancer for calcitonin.’ <italic>Id</italic>. The District Court further noted that ‘[n]o prior art uses citric acid as an absorption enhancer (or shelf stabilizer) in liquid nasal formulations of calcitonin. Therefore, there was no guidance in the prior art for selecting a citric acid concentration to match the absorption enhancing effect of [benzalkonium chloride (BZK)] in Miacalcin.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *10.</p>
<p>The District Court stated that Defendants’ arguments rely upon the blueprints drawn up by the inventor in Claim 19, ‘and from there, Defendants have picked and chosen prior art designed to match the parameters of Claim 19. … Defendants’ methodology is legally incorrect, as it is impermissible to use hindsight to establish an obviousness claim.’ <italic>Id</italic>. (internal citations omitted).</p>
<p>The District Court further noted that ‘not only does the prior art provide more logical places than citric acid for a POSA to start looking for an absorption enhancer of calcitonin, but the prior art teaches away from the use of citric acid as an absorption enhancer, and instead, focuses upon its use as a buffer.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *11. ‘Instead, Defendants[’] POSA would ignore the many compounds noted above, which appear in prior art to be more likely to succeed, and choose citric acid as an absorption enhancer and stabilizer. This giant leap demonstrates that Defendants’ obviousness argument is impermissibly hindsight driven.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *12. Indeed, the District Court noted that ‘Defendants ignore the fact that Miacalcin was formulated and approved without a buffer. It would have made little sense for a POSA, who was trying to replicate Miacalcin, to add new components with new functions.’ <italic>Id</italic>.</p>
<p>The District Court further stated that ‘when viewed correctly, from a prospective basis rather than with hindsight, where the POSA is simply presented with a problem to solve and prior art, it is apparent that the road from Miacalcin to Claim 19 was not suggested by the prior art. In fact, in developing a bioequivalent to Miacalcin, a POSA would have had to have disregarded teachings from the prior art that would have led the POSA astray.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *14. Thus, the District Court denied Apotex’s motion for summary judgment and granted Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. In addition, the District Court stated that ‘[a]s Defendants have conceded infringement of Plaintiffs’ ‘392 and ‘812 reissued patents, this Court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants from further infringement.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *15. Accordingly, the District Court permanently enjoined Apotex from engaging in any activity that infringed either the ‘392 or ‘812 patent. <italic>Id</italic>.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1741134311433733"><title>Summary Judgment – vacated</title>
<p>Following the summary judgment decision, Defendants moved to have the injunction lifted, arguing that additional defenses and counterclaims were still outstanding and as such entry of an injunction was improper. On October 30, 2009, the District Court vacated its earlier summary judgment decision, subject to reinstatement, and ordered the parties to file memoranda, by November 13, 2009, regarding what defenses/counterclaims remain in the case. <italic>Unigene Labs., Inc. et al. v. Apotex, Inc. et al.</italic>, 2009 WL 3682179, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 30, 2009). The District Court also denied Defendants’ request to certify the summary judgment decision for interlocutory review. <italic>Id</italic>.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1741134311433733"><title>Summary Judgment – reinstated</title>
<p>On July 7, 2010, after considering the briefing related to remaining claims submitted by the parties, the District Court reinstated its previous summary judgment decision. <italic>Unigene Labs., Inc. et al. v. Apotex, Inc. et al.</italic>, 2010 WL 2730471, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jul. 7, 2010). In its decision, the District Court also addressed the parties’ arguments regarding remaining claims in the case.</p>
<sec id="sec13-1741134311433733"><title>Infringement</title>
<p>In answers to both the original and amended complaints, Apotex raised non-infringement as a defense and counterclaim ‘because an invalid patent cannot be infringed.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *2. Apotex argued that the Court had erred in finding that it had conceded infringement, pointing in part to the defenses/counterclaims, and that actual infringement remained an issue in the case. <italic>Id</italic>. However, the District Court found that Apotex had claimed that ‘the noninfringement was “because an invalid patent cannot be infringed,” not because the proposed product would not fall within the terms of the patent. That is, in itself, grounds for finding that this claim was never raised and that actual infringement was conceded.’ <italic>Id</italic>. The District Court further noted that Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires Apotex to ‘state in short and plain terms the defenses to claims asserted against it’ and ‘[b]road claims of non-infringement due to invalidity do not preserve a claim of actual non-infringement under this standard.’ <italic>Id</italic>. (internal citations omitted). Accordingly, the District Court found that this defense/counterclaim was no longer at issue. <italic>Id</italic>. at *3.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-1741134311433733"><title>Invalidity</title>
<p>In answers to both the original and amended complaints, Apotex raised the defense/counterclaim that ‘[t]he ‘392 patent is invalid under one or more of the provisions of 35 U.S.C. § 101, et seq.’ The District Court found that ‘[t]his is a broad, general statement encompassing all defenses under the patent laws and does not comply with Rule 8(a)(2) or 8(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and absent further specificity is deemed waived.’ <italic>Id</italic>. The District Court also found that while Apotex had raised a defense/counterclaim of invalidity under 35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶2 for indefiniteness, ‘this defense/counterclaim was not developed during discovery’ and was addressed in the Court’s summary judgment decision and accordingly ‘is barred by previous decisions issued by this Court.’ <italic>Id</italic>.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec15-1741134311433733"><title>Inequitable conduct</title>
<p>The remaining defenses/counterclaims which Defendants maintained were still in the case related to issues of inequitable conduct. The District Court found that certain issues were ‘inextricably intertwined with the issues raised in the crime fraud matter’ and were thus either addressed in the District Court’s Crime-Fraud Decision or were abandoned for failure to raise the issue in Defendants’ motion to compel. <italic>Id</italic>. at *4. With respect to defenses/counterclaims raised for the first time in Defendants’ answer to the amended complaint (which asserted the ‘812 reissue patent in lieu of the ‘392 patent), the District Court noted that ‘[t]he amended complaint merely added the reissue patent information and does not change the scope of the complaint … [while] [t]he answer to the complaint does change the scope of the case dramatically, by asserting issues that could have, and indeed should have, been raised in the answer or amended answer to the original complaint.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *5. Thus, the District Court found that these defenses/counterclaims ‘appear to be abandoned’ and thus the claims were improperly brought and thus not at issue. <italic>Id</italic>.</p>
<p>Defendants also raised a defense/counterclaim that the patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct for failure to disclose a particular reference alleged to be material prior art by Defendants. <italic>Id</italic>. However, the District Court noted that Defendants never elaborated on this defense/counterclaim, and merely mentioned the reference as one of many potential examples of relevant prior art. <italic>Id</italic>. at *6. The District Court thus stated that ‘where there is substantial prejudice to Plaintiffs – namely, not being advised of the contours of this claim until long after the termination of discovery and the filing of dispositive motions – Defendants’ failure to amend their contentions results in this claim being deemed waived.’ <italic>Id</italic>.</p>
<p>The District Court also found that one additional defense/counterclaim of inequitable conduct, first raised in Defendants’ answer to the amended complaint, had been discussed in Defendants’ interrogatory responses. <italic>Id</italic>. at *7. However, the District Court found that the interrogatory response only provided a general description and that ‘[a] general statement such as this in the interrogatories is insufficient to give notice of the theory or nature of [the defense/counterclaim] and fails to [ ] preserve this claim.’ <italic>Id</italic>.</p>
<p>The District Court similarly disposed with the remaining defenses/counterclaims. Accordingly, the District Court reinstated its summary judgment opinion in its entirety. <italic>Id</italic>. at *8.</p></sec></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec16-1741134311433733"><title>The Federal Circuit</title>
<p>Apotex appealed the District Court’s rulings to the Federal Circuit.</p>
<sec id="sec17-1741134311433733"><title>Apotex’s appeal brief</title>
<p>In its brief, Apotex argued that the District Court had erred in finding that claim 19 of the ‘392 patent (or ‘812 reissue) was not obvious. In particular, Apotex argued that ‘[i]n order to prepare a bioequivalent of Miacalcin®, the inventor of the ‘392 patent simply replaced an ingredient in Miacalcin® with ingredients known in the prior art to perform the same functions as the ingredient that was replaced.’ Brief for Defendants-Appellants Apotex, Inc. and Apotex Corp., 2010 WL 4600066, at *18 <italic>Unigene Laboratories, Inc. et al. v. Apotex, Inc. et al.</italic>, 655 F.3d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Citing to <italic>KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc.</italic>, 550 U.S. 398, 417 (2007), Apotex argued that the patent thus ‘simply rearranges old elements with each performing the same function it had been known to perform’ and as such the claims of the patent were obvious. <italic>Id</italic>. at *17 -*18.</p>
<p>With regard to the District Court’s statements that Apotex’s argument was hindsight driven, Apotex argued that ‘[s]imply because the inventor was aware of prior art and based his reasoning for using various ingredients on the prior art does not make it hindsight for Apotex to point to the same art and its disclosures.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *39.</p>
<p>Apotex also argued that the fact that the exemplified formulations found in the cited prior art used citric acid in conjunction with an absorption enhancer did not teach away from using citric acid as an absorption enhancer, as the District Court had found, noting that ‘[p]referred embodiments and disclosed examples and uses do not constitute a teaching away from less preferred or non-preferred embodiments or a broader disclosure.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *52 (internal citations omitted).</p>
<p>Apotex also argued that the District Court had erred in dismissing several of its defenses/counterclaims as untimely filed or as barred by the District Court’s Crime-Fraud decision. <italic>Id</italic>. at *54-*58.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec18-1741134311433733"><title><italic>Unigene’s</italic> a<italic>ppeal</italic> brief</title>
<p>Unigene began its argument by noting that ‘[t]his appeal is Apotex’s third attempt to establish that Claim 19 would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art (POSA). The USPTO considered and rejected Apotex’s prior art and expert reports during the reissue proceeding. The District Court likewise rejected Apotex’s positions on summary judgment.’ Brief for Plaintiffs-Appellees, 2010 WL 5306785, at *15 <italic>Unigene Laboratories, Inc. et al. v. Apotex, Inc. et al.</italic>, 655 F.3d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Furthermore, Unigene argued that ‘[t]he path from Apotex’s proposed starting place, Miacalcin®, to Claim 19 requires so many “correct” choices that it is possible only with clairvoyance of impermissible hindsight.’ <italic>Id</italic>. In addition, Unigene argued that ‘Apotex improperly relies on new arguments and evidence that were never presented to the District Court on summary judgment.’ <italic>Id</italic>.</p>
<p>In its argument, Unigene further noted that ‘Apotex points to no rational reason why a POSA would arrive at the precise components of the composition of Claim 19 in their stated amounts.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *23. Furthermore, Unigene argued that ‘Apotex’s protests notwithstanding, hindsight is <italic>never</italic> used to establish obviousness.’ <italic>Id</italic>. (emphasis in original). Unigene further argued that ‘Apotex’s POSA improperly tracks Dr. Stern’s [i.e., the inventor’s] inventive process to declare that each of his steps was obvious. Dr. Stern, however, was a person of exceptional skill who had spent more than half of his career researching calcitonin.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *26 (emphasis in original). ‘As the inventor and a person of exceptional skill, Dr. Stern’s mental processes are not evidence of the obviousness of his own invention.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *42.</p>
<p>Unigene also argued that the District Court had properly dismissed Apotex’s defenses/counterclaims. <italic>Id</italic>. at *54-*61.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec19-1741134311433733"><title>The Federal Circuit decision</title>
<p>In its decision, the Federal Circuit first turned to the District Court’s Crime-Fraud decision. <italic>Unigene Labs.</italic>, 655 F.3d at 1359. The Federal Circuit noted that the District Court had concluded that the record did not show any evidence of intent to deceive the PTO. <italic>Id</italic>. The Federal Circuit then found that the District Court had not abused its discretion in not abrogating attorney–client privilege on the basis of any crime-fraud exception. In reaching its conclusion, the Federal Circuit did not address the District Court’s determinations of the lack of materiality of the allegedly withheld references. <italic>Id</italic>.</p>
<p>The Federal Circuit also found that the District Court had not abused its discretion in dismissing Apotex’s defenses/counterclaims. <italic>Id</italic>. at 1360.</p>
<p>Turning to the obviousness argument, the Federal Circuit noted that ‘[i]n this case, the patent claims a new composition or formulation to deliver an FDA-approved active ingredient.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at 1361. As such, the Federal Circuit stated that ‘[i]n the context of a composition or formulation patent where the patented formulation was made to mimic a previously FDA-approved formulation, the functional and pharmaceutical properties of the “lead compound” can be more relevant than the actual chemical structure (though not mutually exclusive).’ <italic>Id</italic>. at 1361-62. Citing to <italic>KSR</italic>, the Federal Circuit noted that ‘[i]n this case, the design need is to achieve a bioequivalent composition. The market demand is to achieve a composition that treats the same symptoms as the reference formulation.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at 1362. The Federal Circuit further found that one looking to develop a nasal liquid dosage form of salmon calcitonin ‘would have known that a bioequivalent of Miacalcin®, largely determined by equivalent bioavailability of salmon calcitonin, would have the best chance to gain FDA approval.’ <italic>Id</italic>. Nevertheless, the Federal Circuit stated that ‘even accepting that there was a design need and market pressure to develop a pharmaceutical formulation that is bioequivalent to Miacalcin®, there is no evidence in the record that Claim 19 would be an obvious solution to those motivations.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at 1364.</p>
<p>In particular, the Federal Circuit found that a person of ordinary skill in the art in the relevant timeframe would not have considered citric acid an obvious substitute for BZK’s functions as an absorption enhancer and as a surfactant in Miacalcin®, ‘because citric acid has a vague role in even the closest prior art.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at 1363. Furthermore, the Federal Circuit found that prior art ‘teaches away from using about 20 mM citric acid as an absorption enhancing agent or stabilizing agent in a liquid formulation with a salmon calcitonin active ingredient.’ <italic>Id</italic>.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Federal Circuit affirmed ‘the district court’s grant of summary judgment of nonobviousness in favor of Unigene, affirm[ed] the district court’s denial of summary judgment of obviousness, affirm[ed] the district court’s denial of Apotex’s crime-fraud motion, and affirm[ed] the district court’s dismissal of Apotex’s new claims and defenses.’ <italic>Id</italic>.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec20-1741134311433733" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although salmon calcitonin was an old drug, the Federal Circuit in <italic>Unigene Laboratories, Inc. et al. v. Apotex, Inc. et al.</italic>, found that the sole asserted claim, directed to a particular formulation having specific amounts of specific excipients, was nonobvious despite an acknowledged design need and market pressure to make a product that would have been bioequivalent to Miacalcin®.Thus, the fact that a prior art drug product might have been a natural starting point for the development of a bioequivalent generic product does not mean that a claim to a specific formulation covering a particular bioequivalent generic product would be obvious. While there might have been market pressure to develop a bioequivalent version of Miacalcin®, there might not have been a reason to develop Fortical® which is covered by the specific patent claim successfully asserted against Apotex.</p></sec>

<fn id="fn1-1741134311433733"><label>1</label><p>Unigene filed a §505(b)(2) application – also known as a ‘paper NDA’ – for the approval of its Fortical® product. Unigene’s application identified Miacalcin® as the reference product, and showed that Fortical® was bioequivalent to Miacalcin®. The differences between a §505(b)(2) application and an ANDA were explained by the Supreme Court in <italic>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. Medtronic Inc.</italic>, 496 U.S. 661 (1990) as follows: ‘An ANDA may be filed for a generic drug that is the same as a so-called ‘pioneer drug’ previously approved, see § 355(j)(2)(A), or that differs from the pioneer drug in specified ways, see § 355(j)(2)(C). The ANDA applicant can substitute bioequivalence data for the extensive animal and human studies of safety and effectiveness that must accompany a full new drug application. Compare § 355(j)(2) (A)(iv) with § 355(b)(1). In addition, § 103 of the 1984 Act amended § 505(b) of the FDCA, § 355(b), to permit submission of a so-called paper new drug application (paper NDA), an application that relies on published literature to satisfy the requirement of animal and human studies demonstrating safety and effectiveness. See § 355(b)(2). Like ANDA’s, paper NDA’s permit an applicant seeking approval of a generic drug to avoid the costly and time-consuming studies required for a pioneer drug.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at 676.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn2-1741134311433733"><label>2</label><p>Although Unigene’s application was filed under 21 U.S.C. §355(b)(2) (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 505(b)(2) of the FDCA), there was still a requirement for identifying patents that covered Unigene’s 505(b)(2) product for purposes of listing those patents in the Orange Book.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn3-1741134311433733"><label>3</label><p>During the course of the prosecution of the reissue application, Dr. Stern informed the Examiner of an error in Table 3 in the specification of which ‘he first became aware while collecting documents for production in the instant litigation.’ Specifically, Dr. Stern informed the Examiner that ‘the number 20 was incorrectly entered instead of the number 52 for the percent salmon calcitonin recovered after fifteen days of storage at 50° C for the sample containing 100 millimoles (mM) of citric acid.’ <italic>Unigene Labs., Inc. et al. v. Apotex, Inc. et al</italic>., 2008 WL 356482, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 1998).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn4-1741134311433733"><label>4</label><p>In its claim construction opinion, the District Court construed the term ‘about 20 mM citric acid,’ the only contested claim term. <italic>Unigene Laboratories, Inc. et al. v. Apotex, Inc. et al</italic>., 2008 WL 3992294 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 28, 2008). In its opinion, the District Court rejected both Plaintiffs’ proposed construction (‘approximately 20 mM citric acid and would encompass a reasonable variation of ± 10% in the concentration of 20 mM of citric acid’) and Defendants’ proposed construction (‘approximately 20 mM citric acid, encompassing a range of concentrations greater than or equal to 15 mM citric acid to less than 25 mM citric acid’) and instead the District Court stated that it ‘gives the word “about” its ordinary meaning of “approximately” and construes the claim term no further.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *9.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn5-1741134311433733"><label>5</label><p>Because Apotex provided Plaintiffs with notice of the Paragraph IV certification on or about June 1, 2006, the 30-month stay on FDA approval was set to expire on or about December 1, 2008. Unigene had also requested that the District Court extend the 30-month stay, but withdrew that request when the preliminary injunction issue was resolved <italic>via</italic> stipulation of the parties.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn6-1741134311433733"><label>6</label><p>Claim 19 of the ‘392 patent reads as follows: 19. A liquid pharmaceutical composition comprising about 2,200 MIC units of salmon calcitonin, about 20 mM citric acid, about 0.2% phenylethyl alcohol, about 0.5% benzyl alcohol, and about 0.1% polyoxyethylene(20) sorbitan monooleate. Claim 19 of the ‘812 reissue reads as follows: 19. A liquid pharmaceutical composition for nasal administration comprising about 2,200 MRC units of salmon calcitonin, about 20 mM citric acid, about 0.2% phenylethyl alcohol, about 0.5% benzyl alcohol, and about 0.1% polyoxyethylene(20) sorbitan monooleate.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn7-1741134311433733"><label>7</label><p><italic>See</italic> note 3, <italic>supra</italic>.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn8-1741134311433733"><label>8</label><p>Although the Examiner was informed of the error in Table 3 during the prosecution of the reissue application, Table 3 was not corrected in the reissue as the Examiner considered the correction new matter. The District Court’s reference to ‘corrected Table 3’ is the table with the corrected values – even though the table does not appear in the reissued patent.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn9-1741134311433733"><label>9</label><p>During prosecution of the ‘392 patent, the applicant had represented to the Examiner that ‘citric acid concentrations between 10 and 50 mM were essential in improving the stability of a liquid calcitonin pharmaceutical composition since citric acid concentrations outside the claimed range (either higher or lower than the claimed range) were relatively unstable.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *8. Apotex argued that the 10 mM to 50 mM range ‘only appeared to be critical when the data point for 100 mM concentration of citric acid at 15 days misreported 20% recovery of salmon calcitonin, and it cannot be considered critical when the correct data point of 52% salmon calcitonin is entered.’ <italic>Id</italic>. In other words, Apotex argued that with the 52% data point, the composition appears stable even outside the claimed range.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn10-1741134311433733"><label>10</label><p>The prosecution of the reissue patent overlapped with the litigation. Consequently, as indicated, Plaintiffs submitted documents from the litigation for consideration by the PTO in its evaluation of the reissue application.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn11-1741134311433733"><label>11</label><p>The District Court accepted Defendants’ argument that Miacalcin® was a reasonable starting point for the obviousness analysis, noting that ‘due to Fortical’s similarity to Miacalcin in calcitonin concentration and its bioequivalence, and due to the fact that the inventor of Fortical, Dr. Stern, testified in his deposition that his purpose in creating Claim 19 was to formulate a salmon calcitonin formulation that was bioequivalent to Miacalcin, the Court accepts Defendants’ use of Miacalcin as the lead compound and a reasonable starting point for the obviousness analysis.’ <italic>Id</italic>. at *7, n.11.</p></fn></fn-group></notes>
