<abstract>
<p>The article proposes that patterns of dominance and deference have changed throughout human history. It further proposes that in the last half century such change has – due to culture and technology – accelerated. These fundamental shifts have not, however, had an impact on the leadership industry, which continues, erroneously, to presume that leaders are all-important, that followers are unimportant, and that context is other than central. It is concluded that leadership education and development must themselves adapt to the changing times – times in which leaders generally are losing power and influence, while followers generally are gaining.</p>

<body>
<p>I’ve been told the title of my most recent book, <italic>The End of Leadership,</italic> is somewhat hyperbolic. I incline – sometimes – to agree. After all, I wanted the title to attract attention, not to be taken be taken literally, as if there will be no more leaders, ever.</p>
<p>But as I write this particular piece, not long after the electoral defeat of French President Nicolas Sarkozy by his opponent, Francois Hollande, and as I tally up the losses of European leaders since the start of the debt crisis (no fewer than 16 EU nations, well over half the total, have had a change of government), I wonder. I wonder now as I do in the book if something fundamental is changing, if the balance of power between leaders and followers is shifting in ways that are permanent, with leaders generally losing power and influence, and followers generally gaining.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the meek will inherit the earth, or that the poor will vanquish the rich, or that those without authority will from here on in lord it over those with. Rather it is to point out that leaders everywhere – in every corner of the globe and in the different sectors – are increasingly vulnerable to forces beyond their control and that followers everywhere are lying in wait, ready to pounce on those ostensibly better positioned than they.</p>
<p><italic>The End of Leadership</italic> constitutes my response to two phenomena. The first is changing patterns of dominance and deference, especially during the thirty plus year period during which the leadership industry was spawned and ultimately succeeded beyond anyone’s early imaginings. The second is the ‘leadership industry’ itself – my catchall term for the now countless leadership centers, institutes, programs, courses, seminars, workshops, experience, trainers, books, blogs, articles, websites, webinars, videos, conferences, consultants, and coaches claiming to teach people – usually for money – how to lead.</p>
<p>Essentially my view is a critical one. I am biting the hand that feeds me. Why? The reason is I’m uneasy, increasingly so, about leadership in the twenty-first century – and about the gap between the teaching of leadership and the practice of leadership. I am by no means the only so-called expert to raise questions about the efficacy of teaching leadership or, at least, the efficacy of teaching leadership as we have done in recent decades, quickly, easily, superficially. But I tie my concerns to larger socioeconomic and political trends, particularly to changes in culture and technology that inevitably reframe the relationship between those who are ostensibly dominant and those who are supposedly deferent.</p>
<p>A curious dichotomy permeates the leadership industry – which inevitably undercuts it. On the one hand are leaders who everywhere are struggling. And on the other is the assumption that becoming a leader is, or ought to be, the apotheosis of aspiration. Becoming a leader is widely presumed to be a path to power and money; a medium for achievement; and a mechanism for creating change, sometimes, though hardly always, for the common good.</p>
<p>My own place of employment, Harvard University, exemplifies the trend. Virtually every single one of its professional schools boasts the words ‘leader’ or ‘leadership’ in its mission statement. So, to take just a few examples, the mission of the Harvard Law School is ‘to educate <italic>leaders</italic> who contribute to the development of justice and the well being of society’. The mission of the Harvard Medical School is to ‘create and nurture… the best people committed to <italic>leadership</italic> in alleviating suffering caused by disease’. The mission of the Harvard Divinity School is to ‘educate women and men for service as <italic>leaders</italic> in religious life and thought’. And of course the mission of the Harvard Business School is to ‘educate <italic>leaders</italic> who make a difference in the world’. (Italics are mine.)</p>
<p>By no means is Harvard alone in this fixation on leadership. At least in the United States, it permeates higher education, which suggests, inevitably, if unfortunately, that those who are other than leaders are nothing much. Why, one might reasonably ask, does the Harvard Law School insist it educates leaders? Does it no longer suffice to excel at what you do? To be a consummate professional, in this case a lawyer, who chooses, for whatever reasons, to hunker down to, say, be a student of the law rather than to lead others?</p>
<p>If I were disposed to psychoanalytic speculation I would hypothesize that the leadership industry protests too much – that it has come so far so fast and become obsessively leader-centric precisely <italic>because</italic> leaders now have less power and influence while followers have more. The industry can be seen as a reaction formation – a direct consequence of contextual change experienced by people in positions of authority as being threatening. (Recall that the industry was initially spawned and sustained in the United States in the 1970s, when corporate America was, for the first time since the Second World War, fearful of competition from abroad, especially Japan.)</p>
<p>But, to obsess about leaders to the exclusion of followers is, to put it directly, wrong-headed. Equally wrong-headed is to obsess about leaders and followers to the exclusion of <italic>context</italic> – especially at a moment in human history when contextual intelligence in its broadest sense is of paramount importance. In <italic>The End of Leadership</italic> I argue that leadership (and, for that matter, followership) should be conceptualized as an equilateral triangle in which one side is the leader, another is the followers, and the third is context. In other words no one side is more important than the other two – in this second decade of the twenty-first century all three are equally significant.</p>
<p>How did we get to this point? How did we get to a point where – notwithstanding our laser-like fixation on leaders – followers matter as much? How did we get to a point where to ignore context is to do so at our peril? Three reasons stand out.</p>
<p>The first is the historical trajectory, in which power and influence have devolved from those up top to those down below. In the beginning there were gods and goddesses, heroes and heroines, kings and queens. Plato imagined philosopher-kings and feared totalitarian tyrants. Confucius wrote about great sages who were models of rigor and rectitude. And Machiavelli advised the prince. Not many years later was the early Enlightenment, during which Hobbes broke the mold by granting followers, ordinary people, their first all-important right, the right to life. Then came the later Enlightenment, during which seminal political philosophers such as Locke and Montesquieu expanded Western conceptions of relations between the governors and the governed, with the latter gradually rising in influence and importance relative to the former. Two seismic events sealed the deal: subsequent to the American and French Revolutions, relations among individuals and groups, and the assumptions that underlay them, were never again the same.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the devolution of power and influence continued and even accelerated. Marx and Engels urged the workers of the world to unite. Elizabeth Cady Stanton issued her Declaration of Sentiments (against men) at Seneca Falls. And so was the soil prepared for later liberators such as Gandhi, Mandela, and Martin Luther King, each of whom capitalized on the temper of the times to further free their people and bestow on them rights previously denied.</p>
<p>The phenomenon was worldwide – to wit the end of colonialism. But the pace setter in this general regard was the United States, at least in the mid twentieth century, when the various rights revolutions (for example, civil rights, women’s rights, gay and lesbian and later transgender rights, even animal rights) hit or began to hit their stride. What we can say, then, is that with the passage of time the powerless came to feel more entitled and emboldened, freer if you will to take on the powerful. (Note, incidentally, the leadership industry ignores this historical trajectory entirely – a deprivation that serves no one, least of all those ostensibly learning how to lead.)</p>
<p>The second reason leaders have been diminished in importance is because in recent decades they’ve been cut down to size. The decline in respect for authority is everywhere in evidence. As I wrote in <italic>The End of Leadership</italic>, until recently someone like me – a professor in an institution of higher education – would invariably have been addressed as ‘Professor’ or ‘Doctor’. Now, at least in the US, displays of respect for people in positions of authority have dwindled to almost the vanishing point. Now I’m sometimes called ‘Professor Kellerman’, but I’m equally likely to be called ‘Barbara’, even by students I’ve never met before. Another example is our once deferential attitude toward physicians; we used to take their word as gospel and do what they told us to do. Now we pocket their instructions and then we second guess them. We get another opinion or, more likely, we get another thousand opinions – online.</p>
<p>More generally, once upon a time we more or less blindly obeyed orders issued by our apparent superiors. Now we incline more to challenge them, emboldened to do so by the spread of democracy worldwide, by the rhetoric of empowerment, and by the practice of participation. The evidence of the decline in respect for authority is everywhere – and everywhere are leaders who labor to lead. The change is cultural, contextual, which is why we are quicker to belittle our leaders and slower, much slower, to bestow on them our adulation.</p>
<p>Finally there is technology. Social media enable the spread of information. And they provide a means of expression. And they give the capacity for connection. Think of social media as an open resource, available to most anyone, which empowers most anyone in ways that historically are unprecedented. The so-called Arab Spring is just one of the many glaring examples of what can happen when social media enable those without any apparent power, authority, or influence to undercut the existing social contract – to unceremoniously dump the old guard in favor of the young and restless, who are armed with little more than a smartphone. Put directly, as leaders worldwide are beginning to discover, information, expression, and connection can be a combustible mix in which the outcome is action.</p>
<p>So, what has been the response of the leadership industry to sea changes such as these – the greater role played by followers, the worldwide decline in respect for authority, and the revolution in information technology? By and large the industry has remained undisturbed – untouched, unfazed, and unscathed. By and large it operates now as it has in the past, since its inception some forty years ago. By and large it is still based on the old model in which the leader drives the action, while whatever the other factors that might pertain are discounted or even dismissed as unimportant or irrelevant.</p>
<p>What would I do were I queen of the leadership industry? I would change or challenge at least the five following:
<list id="list1-1742715012455132" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Metrics. What are they? Where are they? What evidence do we have that leadership can be learned – or taught? What evidence do we have that leadership can be learned in a course, or a seminar, or a workshop, most of which are of only very brief duration?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Followers. Why are they not integral to the instruction? Is followership not the obvious, inevitable, counterpart to leadership? Does obsessively accentuating the leader and virtually eliminating the follower make sense, practically, pedagogically?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Values. Huge sums of money are invested in learning good leadership. Is this supposed to mean that bad leadership is inconsequential? Are bad leaders and, again, bad followers, not our constant companions? Do those of us who supposedly are leadership experts have nothing whatsoever to say about how to try to stop, or at least slow, bad leaders?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Breadth. Leadership training tends to run on a narrow track. To take just one example, General Electric has one of the most extensive and expensive of the countless corporate leadership training programs. But, when General Electric invests in developing leaders, it, quite naturally, invests in developing leaders for the benefit of General Electric. There is no leadership program anywhere that comes close to the Platonic ideal – to leader learning as a lifelong process dedicated to educating great generalists.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Context. Context matters as much to leadership as do the leader and the followers. Context matters at every level: the immediate context (e.g. the small group), the more distal context (e.g. the organization within which the small group is embedded), and whatever the other contexts relating to time and space (e.g. the contemporaneous economy generally). In the twenty-first century especially, contextual intelligence is every bit as important as all the other intelligences, such as emotional intelligence.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p><italic>The End of Leadership</italic> does not, literally, suggest that there are no great leaders, or that learning to lead is impossible, or that the instruction is an illusion. But, so far as the leadership industry is concerned, I do recommend, strongly, that the buyer beware.</p>
<p>As to those of us who are in the industry, who make our living in leadership, I argue that we should improve our assessment of what is being accessed, expand our conception of what should constitute a leadership curriculum, and broaden our understanding of how change is created. To do any less is to undermine our own credibility.</p>
