<p>The present is an interlude … [a] strange interlude in which we call on past and future to bear witness [that] we are living.</p>
<p>—Eugene O’Neill</p></disp-quote>
<p>On August 12 of this year Princeton Theological Seminary completed two hundred years of service to church, academy, and world as a Presbyterian institution with a broad ecumenical vision dedicated to preparing leaders marked by the integration of “piety and learning.” The seminary’s bicentennial provides several opportunities to reflect upon and to celebrate the significance of this storied institution. Several special worship services, conferences, and special events have already occurred. The celebrations will conclude this month with a worship service to which the whole world is invited. The current issue of <italic>Theology Today</italic> aims to make a modest contribution to the seminary’s bicentennial festivities with a collection of articles that explore several aspects of the seminary’s history, often with an eye toward its future. In keeping with the special theme of this issue, the book reviews focus on works written by or about Princeton Seminary faculty. James Moorhead’s excellent new volume <italic>Princeton Seminary in American Religion and Culture</italic> (Eerdmans) is a particularly fine contribution to the assessment of the school’s past and provides more than a few clues as to the shape of its future. As I write these reflections, I have Moorhead’s rich and textured book within reach and at the forefront of my thinking.</p>
<p>In the interlude that is the present, we look both backward and forward in order to get our bearings and to affirm the gift of life. First, a look backward. The themes sounded on the seminary’s opening day, August 12, 1812—genuine and deep piety, sound theological learning that is engaged with the issues of the day, and service to the church—were, as Moorhead notes “themes that would long characterize Princeton Seminary’s life and identity.” The subsequent history of the seminary involved playing out these interlocking commitments “like the design of a kaleidoscope … shift[ing] into different patterns.”</p>
<p>Looking back over two hundred years of learning in the Lord’s service, one cannot help but think of all the amazing and colorful characters who have been part of Princeton Seminary. Archibald Alexander, Samuel Miller, Charles Hodge—among the greatest theological minds of the nineteenth century—set the seminary on a faithful and fruitful course. Several of their children or the spouses of their children grew up to carry on the legacy of the patriarchs by becoming professors at the seminary themselves. I am amazed that there was a member of the Hodge family on the faculty continuously—except for one decade—from 1822 until 1937! The vast number of pastors, missionaries, professors, denominational leaders, chaplains, Christian educators, and leaders of non-profit ministries that the seminary has produced astounds the mind. Similarly impressive, though perhaps less in number, are the abolitionists, social prophets, and martyrs for the freedom of the press and for civil rights that the seminary has produced. The future Pope of the Ethiopian Church of some fifty million members was even a student at PTS during the 1980s. To be sure, the seminary has an illustrious and glorious past.</p>
<p>Looking backward also provides plenty of occasion for reproach and repentance. Every one of the professors on the faculty in the nineteenth and early part of the twentieth century had a problem with race and with women in leadership. On the question of race, the PTS faculty—though, thankfully, not all of its students!—took a mediating position that called for a combined strategy of gradualism, paternalism, and colonization with respect to the crisis of slavery. None of the faculty until the middle of the twentieth century could imagine an egalitarian racial pluralism in American society. For that reason, huge amounts of time, ink, and money went into the effort to send freed slaves to Liberia. Even more than a decade after the end of the Civil War, the practical theologian on the faculty spoke in favor of colonization as the best way to solve the race problem in America. The faculty’s attitudes toward women in positions of leadership were likewise deplorable and staunchly conservative—even as late as the 1970s. The seminary was also very slow to shift from an often rigid rationalism funded by a marriage of Scottish Common Sense philosophy and the Westminster standards to a faithfully critical embrace of the fruits of German biblical and theological scholarship. Things do change at PTS, but they tend to change rather slowly. Though the seminary has come a long way on matters of race, gender, and intellectual openness, it still has a long way to go before it gets to the place it should be on these matters in relation to the Reign of God.</p>
<p>Shifting into the future tense, the well-worn Shakespearean line that the “past is prelude” comes to mind at this moment in the seminary’s life. While the seminary celebrates achievements, repents for sins both past and present, and aims to build “from strength to strength,” it turns into the winds of change in order to face the many significant challenges of the future.</p>
<p>In this bicentennial year, Princeton Seminary has come to a crossroads fraught with both possibility and peril. The multitude of challenges comes simultaneously from within and from the wider environment. Internally, the seminary faces a whole series of major issues: transition in presidential leadership; changes in the profile of the faculty and student body; declining enrollment; and adjusting the curriculum and related support structures to meet the needs of today’s theological students. Externally, the seminary also faces many significant challenges: the rapidly changing character of theological education; the rapidly morphing shape of ministry and congregational life; accelerating shifts toward digital texts and pedagogies; massive change in the realm of publishing; continuing strains in the world economy; and a world that has grown increasingly flat, interconnected, and uncertain. Addressing any one of these internal or external challenges would be enough to shape a new chapter in the seminary’s history. Taken together, the internal and external pressures upon the seminary signal that it is approaching a transition into not only a new era, but possibly a new epoch in our life together. In many respects, the questions and issues the seminary faces today about the nature and purpose of theological education are as momentous as those faced by the founders as well as by those who sought to rebuild the seminary after the great schism of 1929. While it is clear that we cannot continue to do business as usual, it is also clear that the future of Princeton Seminary will be about the business of educating and forming leaders for the church marked by the seminary’s hallmark of genuine piety and first-rate learning in service to the church, the academy, and the world. The ways in which these things are accomplished, however, may look very different from anything that has come before in the seminary’s history. As the seminary moves into its third century of service and as it positions itself to meet the challenges of the future head-on, the words of John Mackay in his inaugural address given on February 2, 1937, still ring true: “If we of today are faithful, the great days of this Seminary are not all in the golden past.”</p>
