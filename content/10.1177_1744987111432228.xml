<abstract>
<p>This paper reflects on the challenges and strategies used to conduct a sustained nurse home visiting randomised trial within the universal child and family health service system in Australia. The Maternal Early Childhood Sustained Home-visiting (MECSH) programme is a complex multilevel intervention acting in parallel at the individual and organisational levels, addressing change in individuals and families, as well as the structural and social factors that affect the individuals, particularly families’ access to support and services. MECSH is targeted towards 20–25% of the population who are at risk of poorer maternal and child health and development outcomes. Establishing the intervention within the service system and conducting the research trial simultaneously presented many challenges. The researchers encountered both technical and ethical problems. The role of researchers as disinterested, objective scientists was constantly challenged. We argue that the MECSH trial was a hybrid research model, testing both efficacy and effectiveness, in a participatory framework. Hybrid research can help to generate evidence of the effectiveness of multilevel interventions in more timely ways, but requires greater investment in the time and resources to conduct the research. We see that such investment would pay dividends in the simultaneous development, testing and embedding of effective interventions for families and sustainable capacity for services.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1744987111432228" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is now recognised that to make a difference to patterns of inequality, children’s access to positive early experiences needs to be tackled along the whole social gradient, with services and support being proportionally targeted to the needs and capacities of families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111432228">Marmot, 2010</xref>). Over the past three decades a series of well-designed randomised controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of the USA-based Nurse Family Partnership home visiting programme for first-time, teenage mothers who present early in pregnancy, operating outside the wider universal service system. However, a robust research base for interventions provided by the universal health visiting service for the wider group of vulnerable families is lacking.</p>
<p>In NSW, Australia, the Maternal Early Childhood Sustained Home-visiting (MECSH) programme is a complex intervention, which is embedded in the universal health visiting service, for the broad range of families (20–25% of the population) who are at risk of poorer maternal and child health and development outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987111432228">Matthey et al., 2004</xref>). Women are classified as eligible for the MECSH programme if they have any one or more of the following.
<list id="list1-1744987111432228" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A positive response to any of 12 psychosocial questions routinely recorded and asked by midwives in the antenatal clinic. These questions assess expected lack of practical and emotional support, stressors in the past 12 months, mental health issues, history of abuse in the mother’s childhood, family violence, maternal age under 19 years, late antenatal care after 20 weeks gestation and current substance misuse.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Psychosocial distress in pregnancy. This is assessed using the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987111432228">Cox et al., 1987</xref>). An EDS score of 10 or more may approximate the subgroups labelled in other studies as ‘psychologically vulnerable’ or ‘low psychological resources’. The MECSH program has been shown to be of particular benefit for these mothers and their children.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>MECSH works by providing a structured programme of 25 home visits plus group activities, commencing antenatally and continuing to child-age 2 years, within a system-of-care approach. This system-of-care approach requires local healthcare organisations to develop integrated, tiered service structures within an organising framework for the delivery of high-quality early intervention services to vulnerable families.</p>
<p>This paper will (1) outline the MECSH programme and service system, (2) briefly describe the outcomes of the trial conducted in Australia, (3) discuss the challenges and strategies used to conduct the MECSH randomised trial of a complex intervention for vulnerable families that includes both programmatic and service system components and (4) suggest the processes and policies needed to support future trials of nursing interventions for vulnerable families conducted within the universal child and family health service system.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1744987111432228"><title>The MECSH programme and service system</title>
<p>The MECSH programme was developed to meet the needs of vulnerable families with young children living in a disadvantaged community in south western Sydney. In the context of the development of a range of services to improve the safety and amenity in the community, as well as individual family outcomes, the local health service was charged with employing child and family health nurses to work intensively with high-need families. The goal was to improve developmental outcomes, increase breastfeeding rates, increase awareness of the needs of children, increase the skills of parents in supporting their children’s development and improve parents’ outcomes.</p>
<p>A review of international evidence and services in the local region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111432228">Aslam and Kemp, 2005</xref>) suggested that nurse-delivered programmes with a comprehensive range of content were most effective for mothers from low socioeconomic groups. In addition, such programmes needed to be underpinned by an enabling relationship between the nurse and mother, plus facilitated access to support from a wide range of services. The MECSH programme was thus developed as an intervention with several essential and interacting components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744987111432228">Figure 1</xref>). The MECSH programme also recognised that the home visiting intervention with the family was necessary but not sufficient to change outcomes for a broad range of families. Achieving outcomes would also require a tiered service system that can be more responsive to the needs of vulnerable families through facilitating access to more specialised services and programs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987111432228">Table 1</xref> – MECSH service system).

<p>The MECSH programme is thus a complex, multilevel intervention acting in parallel at the individual and organisational levels, addressing change in individuals and families, as well as the structural and social factors that affect the individuals, particularly families’ access to support and services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987111432228">Swerissen and Crisp, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987111432228">Schensul (2009</xref>: 252) suggested the major benefit of a multilevel intervention is its ability to focus targeted intervention strategies upon multiple key levels concurrently, thus improving the likelihood of a desired outcome. Interventions that focus on individual action and the social context in which those actions occur are more likely to produce sustainable health gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987111432228">Swerissen and Crisp, 2004</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1744987111432228"><title>MECSH trial outcomes in Australia</title>
<p>The randomised controlled trial of MECSH in Australia showed significant improvements in mothers’ confidence, knowledge and experience of being a mother, children’s health and development and a positive environment for children’s development for vulnerable families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987111432228">Kemp et al., 2011</xref>). The MECSH programme was particularly effective in some domains for mothers who were psychosocially distressed antenatally and their children (for example, the environment for children’s development) and immigrant mothers (for example, duration of breastfeeding). We found no evidence that the MECSH intervention was only effective with first-time or teenage mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987111432228">Kemp et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1744987111432228"><title>The challenges and strategies in conducting the MECSH randomised trial</title>
<p>Establishing the intervention within the service system and conducting the research trial simultaneously presented many challenges. The MECSH intervention is, by design, flexible and tailored to families’ needs and capacity. This flexibility and strengths-based approach meant that not every family received exactly the same intervention. The intervention had the goal of changing behaviours and outcomes for families, but also required a substantial shift in nursing practice (from being the expert to providing expert support), and a change in the way the service system works together for vulnerable families. Was the MECSH trial, then, best understood as a study of efficacy, testing one outcome in a highly controlled environment, or effectiveness, studying a range of outcomes in a real-world setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987111432228">Flay et al., 2005</xref>)?</p>
<p>The researchers needed to address the technical and ethical problems of conducting the MECSH trial within universal services, for example controlling the impact of the improved service system and health visitor practice on comparison group families, interaction between the experimental and comparison groups because of community or family connections, group work as part of the intervention and the community visibility of the intervention (such as walking groups). These provided considerable challenges to the conduct of a randomised <italic>controlled</italic> trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111432228">Hohmann and Shear, 2002</xref>). Finally, researchers were required to work interactively in the development of the intervention with the practitioners and services to develop and implement improved practices and systems and also respond ethically to child and family needs identified through research processes and measures. This challenged the role of researchers as disinterested, objective scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987111432228">Schensul, 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec5-1744987111432228"><title>Efficacy or effectiveness</title>
<p>The MECSH programme randomised trial faced the challenge of establishing research with a strong focus on internal validity, seeking demonstration of a clear causal pathway from the intervention to outcome, whilst also focussing on external validity by trialling the intervention for a wide range of participants drawn from the population and delivered within the existing service system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111432228">Hohmann and Shear, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987111432228">Flay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111432228">Atkins et al., 2006</xref>). In terms of efficacy studies, the characteristics of the community setting – client variability, variability in treatment settings (the families’ homes), a range of providers with varying attitudes and training – are viewed as ‘noise’ to be avoided or controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111432228">Hohmann and Shear 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The MECSH research did not seek to avoid this noise, although the trial did attempt to control the noise as described below. The MECSH programme is a population-based intervention for a widely defined group of families that are not homogenous (in contrast with the more homogenous population of first-time teenage mothers who are the focus of the Nurse Family Partnership programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987111432228">Olds, 2002</xref>)). However, this acceptance of the noise of the real world did not mean that internal validity was ignored. Considerable attention was paid to monitoring of the intervention to ensure fidelity of delivery of the programme, both to individual families and by the service system. For example, clear, albeit wide criteria for eligibility for the programme were established and systematically applied, checklists were used to record the activity by the nurses and the researchers supported the health service manager to establish and maintain the second-tier service system.</p>
<p>An under-recognised benefit of real-world research is that rather than comparing the effects of the intervention with a ‘control’ group who receive no treatment or a placebo, effectiveness studies in the real world compare with a ‘comparison’ group, who are receiving the usual care for the population being studied. Such research thus also provides a full description of the usual care provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111432228">Garland et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, some of the most interesting and policy-useful findings from the MECSH trial have been documenting the poor development outcomes for children in the community and the issues families face in accessing services.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987111432228"><title>Control</title>
<p>The ‘noise’ of a community-based trial required attention to particular elements of control in the MECSH trial. A key element in an efficacy trial is control of the experiences of the participants, so that those in the control group are not exposed to the intervention condition. In the context of the community, interaction between groups is difficult to control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111432228">Hohmann and Shear, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>We needed to rethink the construct of ‘contamination’ in the MECSH trial. For example, if a MECSH intervention mother passed any of the resources or information gained from the MECSH programme onto a relative or friend who was in the comparison group, did this ‘contaminate’ the comparison group? Indeed, at times MECSH mothers would invite other family and friends to be at the MECSH visit (some of whom may have been in the comparison group). However, in the context of a community-based intervention aiming to enhance mothers’ confidence in their parenting and their social support networks, it was considered a desirable outcome of the intervention that MECSH intervention mothers felt they had expertise as parents and wanted to share this with other family and friends.</p>
<p>Changes to the service system were also a potential source of contamination. Whilst the researchers could actively monitor the development and engagement of the broader Tier 2, 3 and 4 services, it was not possible to fully control whether this enhanced service system was also made available to comparison group families. A further source of contamination was the ethical approach of the researchers. We felt ethically bound to ensure comparison families who revealed through the research that they were experiencing significant difficulties or concerns were referred to the appropriate sources of support, through the enhanced service system. For example, when child development measures revealed a delay, the researchers would refer these children to developmental support services. Even with this ‘contamination’, the intervention families still achieved significant positive outcomes from MECSH.</p>
<p>We also needed to rethink the construct of fidelity in the context of an intervention that was deliberately designed to be flexible and adapted. Rather than detailed and prescriptive content for each visit, the MECSH programme provides clear principles and guidance about what is adaptable or flexible and what is not, and is structured around detailed goals and objectives for the programme visits. This structure in the programme not only limited variation in treatment to ensure that the identified best practice was being delivered, as well as all the core components of the intervention, but also recognised the necessity for variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111432228">Craig et al., 2008</xref>: 14). To ensure fidelity in the MECSH programme trial, we undertook ongoing and interactive fidelity monitoring, meeting weekly with the intervention team initially and then fortnightly and then monthly as the nurses gained confidence in the delivery of the programme. At the meetings the nurses could talk openly about any difficulties they were encountering in delivering the intervention as planned, and the researchers could monitor, constrain or support adaptation based on the principles underpinning the intervention. To facilitate control of the fidelity of the service system changes, the MECSH trial was conducted in one defined geographic area.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1744987111432228"><title>Role of the researcher</title>
<p>Traditional efficacy randomised controlled trials derive from the ‘science’ approach of control for non-random variation, development and testing of theories, where ‘disinterested scientists, uninfluenced by social values, produce truth claims that constituted the only legitimate source of knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987111432228">Schensul, 2009</xref>: 242–243). The MECSH trial, involving both intervention and service system change, required that the research be conducted in a more participatory way, where the researchers worked with the service managers and providers to develop and understand the intervention and the service context within which it is based, and to solve problems as they arose and the intervention evolved. For example, the nurses found it challenging delivering the MECSH programme to very high risk families experiencing violence or drug and alcohol issues, feeling that child protection services were expecting the nurses to provide daily monitoring of the safety of these families, rather than provide the structured programme focussed on child development and family aspirations. The researchers worked with the nurses, the health service and the broader service system, to establish appropriate boundaries for the delivery of health home visiting services, and a memorandum of understanding with child protection services for support for these high-need families.</p>
<p>The investigators conducting the MECSH trial were from a research centre that was affiliated with both the university and the health service. This provided the researchers with a legitimacy to work with the clinicians and service managers to support implementation of the intervention and service system changes. As mentioned above, the researchers also had a role as referral agents for services for comparison group families where there were significant concerns. This integrated and participatory approach was essential for the successful implementation of a complex, multilevel intervention.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1744987111432228"><title>Processes and policies needed to support future trials of complex interventions embedded in service systems</title>
<p>Within the confines of a single-site trial, with the opportunity for participatory research within the local systems, methods for control and fidelity were able to be managed effectively by the research team. However, as the need for evidence of the effectiveness of interventions such as MECSH that are embedded in universal services expands, ‘research models that promote efficient understanding of services in context are critical’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111432228">Atkins et al., 2006</xref>: 107). Frameworks and designs for these research models, and the processes for conducting research, are now being developed.</p>
<p>Researching multilevel interventions requires participatory research processes and a relationship between the researcher and the service system and community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987111432228">Riley et al., 2005</xref>). Ethnographic frameworks for research can be helpful for researching complex community interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111432228">Hohmann and Shear, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987111432228">Schensul, 2009</xref>). The implication of a participatory ethnographic framework is that trials of interventions embedded within systems need to be built on a relationship between local research institutions and the professional and broader community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111432228">Garland et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Community-based ethnographically framed research of the effectiveness of interventions within system change may not be suitable for individual randomised research designs. Alternative designs, such as randomising by community and cluster randomisation of before and after designs, may be more appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111432228">Landsverk et al., 2011</xref>) in a hybrid of efficacy and effectiveness that addresses both internal (efficacy), and external validity (effectiveness), and allows attention to context.</p>
<p>Hybrid models that seek to test both efficacy and effectiveness, such as the MECSH trial, bring the best of the quality of efficacy studies to the real-world setting and can avoid the delay of working through the efficacy study – effectiveness study – transportability study by investigating the efficacy of an intervention in a real-world setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111432228">Atkins et al., 2006</xref>). In such models the basic research process of identifying what works and identifying the active ingredient of the intervention (why and how it works) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111432228">Hohmann and Shear, 2002</xref>) is researched within the context of the established service delivery system. The intervention and the context are understood to be related in a reflexive process where the knowledge of how an intervention works in the real world (where the intervention is likely to be further developed and scaled up) can help identify the efficacious components of the intervention, and these components can be formulated to be effective within the real-world context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111432228">Atkins et al., 2006</xref>). This is the purposeful reflexive combination of ‘evidence-based practice’ and ‘practice-based evidence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987111432228">Thase, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Such hybrid research accepts the messiness of the real world but, unlike efficacy research, does not require the researcher to control the context in an attempt to move the real world closer to the optimal conditions for interventions to be effective, nor does it consider the intervention to be ‘hostage’ to the real-world context. Rather, hybrid research capitalises on the ‘external validity strengths of service research (e.g., “embeddedness” of the study in usual care settings, with usual care clinicians) and the rigorous measurement methods developed in interventions research’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111432228">Garland et al., 2006</xref>: 37).</p>
<p>The importance of context in conducting hybrid research of interventions in the real-world context of an organisation and their systems does, however, mean that the culture of the service system will impact upon the likely success of the intervention. Success is more likely in organisations and settings that support innovation and reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111432228">Hemmelgarn et al., 2006</xref>). Attention to the fidelity of the intervention demands organisational readiness to ensure that the organisation will alter its features to support the new intervention, rather than alter the intervention (risking loosing the active ingredients) to fit the context.</p>
<p>In paying attention to context, a staged approach to the research may be needed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744987111432228">Figure 2</xref>) that is respectful of existing organisational culture and readiness for innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111432228">Hemmelgarn et al., 2006</xref>). That is, rather than treating the context and processes as ‘noise’ to be controlled, they are considered a reflexive and interactive part of both the intervention and the research processes. Just like cogs, changes in the context and process are interrelated with each other and with outcomes. Hybrid research can be undertaken in this staged way through exploring the contexts and establishing the processes and systems, before considering outcomes. The measurement of outcomes then also needs to consider the impact of the context and processes on those outcomes, through ongoing process measurement, rather than believing that the impact can be fully controlled.
<fig id="fig2-1744987111432228" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Reflexive and interactive processes in hybrid research</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1744987111432228-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Hybrid research in the context of service systems requires intervention researchers to work collaboratively with health service and clinical researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111432228">Hohmann and Shear, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111432228">Garland et al., 2006</xref>). Integration of ‘research-and context-driven knowledge at <italic>every stage</italic> of the research helps to produce both contextual and rigorous knowledge regarding access, effectiveness, and sustainability of… interventions and services’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111432228">Atkins et al., 2006</xref>: 107, emphasis in original). Also critical to this research are change agents who have credibility with the stakeholders and can influence the ‘perceptions, attitudes, and decisions of key opinion leaders, community stakeholders, and service providers, help form new management and service strategies and support the adoption of new assessment and treatment technologies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111432228">Hemmelgarn et al., 2006</xref>: 84). Time and resources are needed to form an effective collaborative team, and explore and respond to the community-based issues that may impact on the research. This kind of research is more time and resource intensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111432228">Hohmann and Shear, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111432228">Garland et al., 2006</xref>: 206).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1744987111432228" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The need for effective interventions for vulnerable families with young children to be available to all those who would benefit is becoming critical as governments seek to address inequalities in opportunities for children. Intervening with a broad range of vulnerable families is best achieved by embedding interventions within the universal service system. The MECSH programme was a multilevel intervention that provided a sustained structured home visiting programme for families and built the capacity of the service system to support the families. Unlike efficacy studies conducted in highly controlled environments, the MECSH trial embraced the ‘noise’ of community-based research, rethinking the real-world threats of contamination and control.</p>
<p>Multilevel interventions, such as MECSH, that address both the skills and capacities of the families, and the capacity of support services and systems to respond to families’ needs, are more likely to produce sustainable outcomes. Future research of multilevel interventions embedded in universal services would be enhanced through the use of hybrid models of research that address the fidelity of the intervention within the context of real-world service provision. Hybrid research can help to generate evidence of the effectiveness of multilevel interventions in more timely ways, but requires greater investment in the time and resources to conduct the research. Such investment would, however, pay dividends in the production of evidence-based practice that is also practice-based evidence for interventions that are effective in producing outcomes for families and building sustainable capacity for services.</p></sec>
