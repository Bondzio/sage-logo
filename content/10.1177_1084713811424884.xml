<abstract>
<p>Two methods of fine tuning the initial settings of hearing aids were compared: An audiologist-driven approach––using real ear measurements and a patient-driven fine-tuning approach––using feedback from real-life situations. The patient-driven fine tuning was conducted by employing the Amplifit<sup>®</sup> II system using audiovideo clips. The audiologist-driven fine tuning was based on the NAL-NL1 prescription rule. Both settings were compared using the same hearing aids in two 6-week trial periods following a randomized blinded cross-over design. After each trial period, the settings were evaluated by insertion-gain measurements. Performance was evaluated by speech tests in quiet, in noise, and in time-reversed speech, presented at 0° and with spatially separated sound sources. Subjective results were evaluated using extensive questionnaires and audiovisual video clips. A total of 73 participants were included. On average, higher gain values were found for the audiologist-driven settings than for the patient-driven settings, especially at 1000 and 2000 Hz. Better objective performance was obtained for the audiologist-driven settings for speech perception in quiet and in time-reversed speech. This was supported by better scores on a number of subjective judgments and in the subjective ratings of video clips. The perception of loud sounds scored higher than when patient-driven, but the overall preference was in favor of the audiologist-driven settings for 67% of the participants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is no unequivocal way to fit modern hearing aids. Different approaches have been developed and several are currently applied in clinical practice.</p>
<p>In modern hearing aids, proprietary fitting rules developed by the manufacturer are usually based on theoretical concepts and on population studies. Those proprietary rules are in many cases not well documented in peer-reviewed articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1084713811424884">Russ, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1084713811424884">Svard, Spens, Back, Ahlner, &amp; Barrenasm, 2005</xref>). The “first-fit” of hearing aids according to proprietary fitting rules is generally based on audiometric data (usually the pure-tone audiogram only) and on the most important acoustic environments for the individual hearing aid user.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1084713811424884">Killion and Gudmundsen (2005)</xref> did an evidenced-based review on the correlation between prefitting measures and hearing aid satisfaction based on self-report measures. In none of the reviewed studies significant correlations were found between traditional unaided prefitting speech measures and hearing aid satisfaction, except in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1084713811424884">Walden and Walden (2004)</xref> for speech perception in noise. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1084713811424884">Wesselkamp, Margolf-Hackl, and Kiessling (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1084713811424884">Pastoors, Gebhart, and Kiessling (2001)</xref> investigated the effect of a fitting strategy based on loudness scaling. They found no evidence that loudness scaling leads to better fitting results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1084713811424884">Cox, Alexander, and Gray (1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1084713811424884">2007)</xref> found that personality is associated with self-reported outcome data. However, separate personality data at the prefitting stage proved to be minimally useful in prediction of long-term fitting outcomes.</p>
<p>After the “first-fit,” the hearing aid user can start a trial period of some weeks in his or her own acoustical environment. After this trial, the hearing aid user can recall his or her positive and negative experiences, and the audiologist or hearing aid dispenser often uses a complaint-driven fine-tuning procedure to reduce the negative experiences encountered in the trial period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1084713811424884">Jenstad, Van Tasell, &amp; Ewert, C, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1084713811424884">Kuk, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1084713811424884">Nelson, 2001</xref>). Although the starting point of such a procedure is relatively well defined (the “first-fit” of the manufacturers) the individual fine-tuning process is not. However, given the fact that there is a large interindividual variation in the acoustical situations and in the perception across patients (even for patients with a similar pure-tone audiogram) the fine-tuning process is crucial but very time-consuming. The acoustic environments of the hearing aid users are not defined well enough to be able to fine tune the hearing aids effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1084713811424884">Kiessling, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, a complaint-driven approach needs effective complaints to work well, and some hearing aid users find it very difficult to formulate the differences in sound quality.</p>
<p>Given the complications mentioned above, a realistic approach is to use a patient-driven fine-tuning procedure. For this purpose, well-structured sets of background noises can be applied to improve the “first-fit” parameters interactively during the initial fitting session in the clinic or in the shop of the hearing aid dispenser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1084713811424884">Robinson, Russ, &amp; Siu, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1084713811424884">Punch, Robb, and Shovels (1994)</xref> found in their study that generalization of the results to all everyday listening situations is not possible. However, they suggested that the predictive value of clinical-based preference judgments, when used in hearing aid fitting, might be substantially improved by using stimulus materials simulating the characteristics of real-world environments.</p>
<p>In this study, the Amplifit<sup>®</sup> II system is applied using audiovideo clips recorded on DVD, representing specific listening tasks in background noises to simulate specific sound environments. For each hearing aid user, a subset of audiovideo clips is selected that matches best with his or her individual listening tasks and listening environments. The hearing aid user is asked to answer closed questions about speech intelligibility, sound dynamics, and sound quality and based on these responses, the hearing aid settings can be changed directly by the hearing aid dispenser. The potential advantage is a better tailoring of the hearing aid settings toward specific listening conditions that are relevant for the individual user. The focus is on subjective aspects of speech intelligibility and listening comfort, but it is not known how effective this method is for finding the optimal balance between the sometimes contrasting demands of listening comfort and speech intelligibility.</p>
<p>The second approach of hearing aid fine tuning is based on real ear measurements with well-defined and widely accepted prescription rules like NAL-NL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084713811424884">Byrne, Dillon, Ching, Katsch, &amp; Keidser, 2001</xref>) and DSL-i/o (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1084713811424884">Scollie et al., 2005</xref>) that have proven to optimize speech intelligibility for large groups. These fitting rules are generic, meaning that they are generally applicable and not restricted to the use for hearing aids of one specific brand. This approach can be characterized as audiologist-driven fine tuning. To compensate for individual acoustic effects in the ear canal or in the ear mould that might cause the aid frequency gain characteristics to deviate from the required responses, real ear measurements can be conducted. The influence of subjective listening comfort is minimized, and the main focus is on restoration of speech intelligibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1084713811424884">Ching, Dillon, Katsch, &amp; Byrne, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1084713811424884">Keidser &amp; Grant, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1084713811424884">Mueller, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>It is not clear which method of fine-tuning produces a more positive fitting outcome. This study is focused on two questions with respect to the fine tuning of a first-fit hearing aid setting:</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>To be less dependent on personal fitting philosophies and fitting expertizes, this study was conducted as a multicenter study in four audiological centers in different parts of the Netherlands.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1084713811424884">1</xref></sup> For this project each audiological center cooperated with two or three selected hearing aid dispensers in its region.</p>
<p>Hearing aid users were invited to participate in this study on a voluntary basis after they had decided to start a trial period with bilateral hearing aids. The inclusion criteria required that their hearing losses be relatively symmetrical (interaural differences for each frequency lower than 30 dB). The participants could be new or experienced users, so new hearing aid users visited the clinic for their first hearing aids; experienced hearing aid users came for replacement of their old hearing aids. They had to speak Dutch, have good vision, and be physically able to complete speech intelligibility tests. They were asked to sign an informed consent before participating in the study. Seventy-three participants were included in this study.</p>
<p>The hearing aid users received a financial compensation for their travel costs and an additional €75 for the three extra visits that were necessary to complete the experimental part of the hearing aid fitting and fine tuning.</p>
<p>In this multicenter study, 73 participants (42 men and 31 women) were included, with an average age of 65 years (range: 43-80). The majority of the hearing losses were sensorineural (92%), 8% were mixed hearing losses (bone conduction &gt; 10 dB [HL] and the air bone gap &gt; 10 dB for at least one ear). The average hearing loss (500, 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz) was 43.5 dB (± 10.5 dB) for the right ears and 44.2 dB (± 10.5 dB) for the left ears (for details, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1084713811424884">Table 1</xref>). Fifty participants represented a first fitting (68%) and half of the participants had an open fitting (<italic>n</italic> = 36). In total, 47 different hearing aid models were prescribed, representing seven different brands.</p>

<title>Experimental Procedures</title>
<p>The focus of this study was on fine tuning, and therefore the first-fit (including the selection of the brand, style, and model of the hearing aids as well as the type of ear mould) was implemented by the hearing aid dispenser, without restrictions. The dispenser made ear impressions and produced appropriate ear mould(s) (or housings for “in the ear” hearing aids), if necessary.</p>
<p>The Amplifit<sup>®</sup> II system was used for <italic>patient-driven fine tuning</italic> (PD approach) of the hearing aids (with the “first fit” of the manufacturer as starting point). This system inventoried the subject’s difficulties in auditory communication using an individually tailored selection of video clips, which were chosen to simulate specific real-world conditions relevant for the subject’s auditory communication situation.</p>
<p>First the subject selected videos that characterized his or her individual communication situations as closely as possible with respect to six aspects of hearing: speech in quiet, speech in noise, speech in reverberation, the perception of soft sounds, the perception of loud sounds, and the quality of sounds. The individually selected subset of videos aims to represent situations the participants encounter in everyday listening as good as possible but in a well-standardized way. For example, this could be a subset of videos like a discussion in a quiet room or a discussion in an office with more background noises or just sounds of a bird whistling. The videos of these individually tailored selections were reproduced in freefield by a surround-sound system with five external boxes and calibrated sound levels to reproduce real-life presentation levels (each system was calibrated with a calibration signal). After each video clip with a length of about 20 to 30 s, the participants were given questions about speech intelligibility in quiet, in noise, and in reverberation, loudness of low-intensity and high-intensity sounds, and sound quality with a closed set of answers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1084713811424884">2</xref></sup> Each answer was correlated with a 5-point score (5 being the best rating). This procedure resulted in an Amplifit profile, containing average scores for each of the six above-mentioned parameters.</p>
<p>Before the (new) hearing aids were fitted, an initial Amplifit profile was measured. The initial test (prefitting) was without hearing aids for the new hearing aid users and with their old hearing aids for the experienced hearing aid users. After the fitting of the hearing aids, the same video clips were judged in the aided condition with the new hearing aids fitted according to the first-fit settings, usually as suggested by the proprietary fitting software. The hearing aid dispenser used the well-structured responses of the Amplifit<sup>®</sup> II system as a tool to assess the quality of the hearing aid settings. If the result was not yet satisfying, settings were optimized according to the fine-tuning suggestions available in most hearing aid fitting software programs and/or based on the experience of the hearing aid dispenser. After one or more fine-tuning sessions, the same video clips were judged again by the hearing aid user, until he or she was content with the fine-tuned hearing aid settings for the selected target conditions.</p>
<p>The initial Amplifit profile and the final profile with the new hearing aids (for new and experienced hearing aid users) fitted by the hearing aid dispenser was conducted again at the audiological centers. Insertion-gain measurements provided objective data to objectify the effect of the ear moulds of the new hearing aids. The settings of the hearing aids obtained by patient-driven fine tuning were documented.</p>
<p>The audiologist-driven fine tuning (AD approach) at the audiological centers was based on the NAL-NL1 target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1084713811424884">Byrne et al., 2001</xref>), carried out under control of real ear measurements derived from broadband noises presented at 65 and 80 dB SPL. After switching off advanced functionalities such as noise reduction and directionality, the frequency gain curves were changed by fine tuning manually to match, as closely as possible, the curves prescribed by the NAL-NL1 prescription rule. Where applicable, advanced functionality was restored with the aim of keeping the PD and AD settings of the hearing aid similar except for the frequency gain characteristics at different levels. The same applied to the use of the comfort programs. The settings of the hearing aids obtained by the audiologist-driven fine tuning were also documented.</p>
<p>After the fitting and fine-tuning procedures, two consecutive field trials were started. Both field trials consisted of 6 weeks each. The order of field trials (PD followed by AD or AD followed by PD) was determined by a cross-over design. The participants were not informed about the order of the trials (single-blinded design).</p>

<title>Evaluation Method</title>
<sec id="section6-1084713811424884">
<title>Real ear measurements</title>
<p>To characterize the gain differences between the patient-driven fine tuning and the audiologist-driven fine tuning real ear insertion gain (reig) curves were measured with continuous broadband speech noises presented at input levels of 65 dB and 80 dB (SPL) with Madsen Aurical real ear equipment. Before the measurements, the directivity and noise reduction options were switched off temporarily in the quiet setting. For open fits, the substitution method was used to avoid interference of the test signal and the feedback-reduction signal in the reference microphone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1084713811424884">Dyrlund, Ostergaard, Haastrup, &amp; Lantz, 2005</xref>). The measurements were conducted before and after each field trial. In this way, it was possible to verify that the particular setting was preserved in the hearing aid during the field trial.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1084713811424884">
<title>SRT test</title>
<p>To evaluate the effects of the hearing aid settings on speech intelligibility, Speech Reception Threshold (SRT) tests were conducted in quiet, in continuous speech noise, and in time-reversed speech noise using male and female voices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1084713811424884">Festen &amp; Plomp, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1084713811424884">Plomp &amp; Mimpen, 1978</xref>). Time-reversed speech was used to simulate as much as possible the daily-life situation without being disruptive due to informational masking. Both the speech and the interfering signals came from the front, from the same loudspeaker and the interfering signals were presented at a fixed level of 65 dB(A). The participant was located in the direct field at least 75 cm from the boxes, in a sound isolated room. The speech material for the SRT test was taken from VU98 sentences<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1084713811424884">3</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1084713811424884">Versfeld, Daalder, Festen, &amp; Houtgas, 2000</xref>), recorded from a male and a female talker. In quiet, only the female voice was used. So in total, 5 tests were conducted with stimuli in front of the participant.</p>
<p>To simulate relevant daily-life situations, spatially separated sound sources were also used. The SRT test was administered with a spatial separation between the target speech and the noise from two loudspeakers positioned at −45° and +45°. The “noise” used was time-reversed speech of the opposite gender to facilitate the distinction between both speakers.</p>
<p>With speech from the right-hand side, the interfering signal came from the left-hand side and vice versa. The order was randomized, and the participant did not know beforehand from which side the speech would be presented. The interfering signal was presented at a fixed level of 65 dB(A), whereas the level of the target speech was varied adaptively. The tests were conducted after each trial period with the hearing aid settings corresponding to the preceding trial period. If hearing aids had more than one program with manual switching, the tests were performed in the “quiet” program for the quiet conditions and in the “noise” program for the conditions with interfering noise.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1084713811424884">
<title>Video clips</title>
<p>After each field trial, the previous individually composed set of video clips was used again but this time only for evaluating purposes and not for fine tuning. Again the participants had to rate subjectively speech intelligibility in quiet, in noise, and in reverberation and they were asked to judge soft and loud sounds, as well as the quality of sounds of specific video clips. If hearing aids had more than one program with manual switching, the video clips were performed in the “quiet” program for quiet situations an in the “noise” program for noisy situations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1084713811424884">
<title>Questionnaires</title>
<p>To retrieve information about the subjective experiences with both hearing aid settings during the 6-week trial periods, the hearing aid users were asked to complete the Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1084713811424884">Gatehouse &amp; Noble, 2004</xref>) during each field trial. This questionnaire has been designed to provide an inventory of the remaining problems experienced in a wide variety of realistic listening situation in everyday life. A visual analogue scale was used with a range from 0 to 10, with only labels at 0 (for example “not at all”) and at 10 (for example “perfectly”). The outcome values were related to speech intelligibility, spatial hearing, and quality of sounds.</p>
<p>A direct comparison between both hearing aid settings was performed by means of a shortened version of the AVETA (Amsterdanse Vragenlijst voor Eén en Tweezijdige Aanpassingen—A validated Dutch Questionnaire for unilateral and bilateral hearing aid fittings) questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1084713811424884">Boymans, 2003</xref>), a questionnaire that was partly based on existing questionnaires such as the Amsterdam Inventory of Auditory Disability and Handicap (AIADH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1084713811424884">Kramer, Kapteyn, Festen, &amp; Tobi, 1995</xref>) and the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1084713811424884">Cox &amp; Alexander, 1995</xref>). Based on 18 questions, outcome values were obtained for detection, discrimination, speech in quiet, speech in noise, localization, and aversion to loud sounds. Each category was represented by three questions. In e few cases some answers were missing. If the majority of answers (2 or 3 out of each set of 3) were available, the average scores for each participant and each category were calculated. If only 1 out of 3 answers was available, the end result was regarded as missing.</p>
<p>All scales ranged from 1 to 4. The AIADH and APHAB questions were posed for the conditions prefitting, with the hearing aid according to the first hearing aid trial and with the hearing aid according to the second trial. The randomization scheme determined whether these answers were related to the PD or AD settings.</p>
<p>At the end of both field trials, the hearing aid users were asked about their overall preference for one of the hearing aid settings, just by asking, “Which setting do you prefer, the setting of the first trial period or the setting of the second trial period.” This preferred setting was then programmed into their hearing aids for continuing use.</p>

<sec id="section10-1084713811424884">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>The results were analyzed in two sections. The first section focuses on the differences between AD and PD settings (Research Question 1) and describes the differences for the objective outcome measures (gain and speech perception), the subjective outcome measures (video clips and SSQ questionnaire) and the outcome measures of the direct comparison (AVETA questionnaire). Paired <italic>t</italic> tests were used to determine the significance of the differences between the results with the AD and PD settings.</p>
<p>The second section focuses on the identification of subject groups that benefit more from one or the other fine-tuning approach (Research Question 2). For this purpose, we used analyses of variance (repeated measures). The results show the effects of the main parameters (as within subject factors) for the different subgroups. The subgroups were distinguished based on differences in age, hearing aid experience (as between subject factors), type of ear mould (open or closed), and gain differences.</p>
<p>In the analysis of the subjective results, missing values were encountered. The results presented are averages of all responses available. Paired <italic>t</italic> tests included only pairs without missing values. The level of significance used in the analyses was defined as <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<p>On average, the curve of the AD settings was higher than the curve of the PD settings. The average gain difference (500, 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz) was 3.2 dB (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The gain differences were slightly less for lower frequencies (a significant difference of 2.6 dB at 500 and 1000 Hz; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) than for higher frequencies (a significant difference of 3.7 dB at 2000 and 4000 Hz; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>The curve of the AD settings was 2 dB lower than the target curves for 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz. At 250 Hz the difference was 5 dB, and at 3,000 and 4000 Hz the differences were 4 and 9 dB, respectively. This was due to the fact that NAL-NL1 could not always be reached without feedback problems, whereas the ear mould could not be changed to keep it constant for both fine-tuning approaches.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated the effects of different fine-tuning approaches on a variety of outcome data, both objective and subjective. Clear differences were found between a patient-driven and an audiologist-driven fine-tuning approach when the shaping of frequency gain was modified, whereas other features such as noise reduction and directionality were identical.</p>
<p>This is in contrast with a study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1084713811424884">Hornsby and Mueller (2008)</xref>, who found no difference between the setting according to NAL-NL1, and the setting after adjusting the hearing aid gain to optimize listening comfort and speech clarity by the participants themselves. The contrast between that study and ours may be related to differences in the starting point before the fine-tuning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1084713811424884">Dreschler, Keidser, Convery, &amp; Dillon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1084713811424884">Hornsby &amp; Mueller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1084713811424884">Mueller, Hornsby, &amp; Weber, 2008</xref>). In our study, the starting point of the interactive fitting was the first-fit rule of the different hearing aids.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1084713811424884">Souza, Yueh, Sarubbi, and Loovis, (2000)</xref> found no relationship between audibility and patient ratings of communication. However, in our study, better speech intelligibility results in quiet were found for the audiologist-driven setting. This is likely due to more overall gain relative to the PD setting.</p>
<p>The patient-driven fine tuning can be considered as a more comfort-driven approach, whereas the audiologist-driven fine tuning can be considered as a more intelligibility driven approach. The initial hypothesis was that the patient-driven setting should score higher on comfort or quality aspects than the audiologist-driven settings based on the NAL-NL1 rule. This effect was only demonstrated for the comfort of loud sounds with video clips and for one question of the SSQ. During video clips, the comfort of loud sounds was higher for the patient-driven settings than for the audiologist-driven settings. The PD settings yielded better scores for subjective judgments of loud sounds. This suggests that subjective judgments of loudness were important for PD settings. However, this effect was not statistically significant in the direct comparison questionnaire. In the SSQ questionnaire, the question about the naturalness of their own voice scored higher with the patient-driven settings than with the audiologist-driven settings, but this significance disappeared after Bonferroni correction. So there is only weak evidence that the hypothesis on listening comfort is correct.</p>
<p>In contrast with the expectations, the quality of sounds during the video clips scored higher for the audiologist-driven settings than for the patient-driven settings, and again this was not confirmed on a statistically significant level by the subscale for sound quality in the SSQ questionnaire.</p>
<p>The second hypothesis was that the audiologist-driven fine tuning should result in better speech intelligibility scores because NAL-NL1 is designed for optimizing speech intelligibility. The data confirmed that speech intelligibility scores were significantly better for the audiologist-driven settings than for the patient-driven settings, both for the SRT tests and for the AVETA questionnaire. However, for the subscale Speech in the SSQ questionnaire, no significant improvement was found for the audiologist-driven approach. The responses to the SSQ questionnaire produced only little differences between the AD and PD settings. One possible explanation for this is that many hearing impaired participants experienced difficulties in completing this questionnaire because not all situations were replicated during both trial periods. As a consequence, participants may have been uncertain as to how to respond to some questions.</p>
<p>The video clips and the insertion gain measurements were both used as tools for fine tuning and as tools for evaluation. Although this approach may have some methodological drawbacks due to lack of independence of fitting and evaluation, the advantage is that both fine-tuning approaches can be evaluated according to the same methods that have been used for the fine tuning. The method used to optimize the intelligibility-driven approach is also used to evaluate the comfort-driven approach and vice versa.</p>
<p>For the videos, we do not expect learning effects, because the hearing aid users were already familiar with the video clips. (The clips had been viewed two or more times with the hearing aid dispenser and two times at the audiological center.) If some learning effects were still present, these would have been compensated for by the randomization of the order of the hearing aid settings.</p>
<p>The larger difference in gain between both settings (more gain for the audiologist-driven fine tuning) for the new users versus the experienced hearing aid users may be explained by the fact that experienced hearing aid users were more used to the gain and the sound of the hearing aid than the new users. From clinical experience, it is well known that new users tend to be reluctant to accept higher gain values, partly because they are used to soft sounds and soft speech and partly because they do not know what to expect. In literature, there is some evidence that new hearing aid users prefer less gain than experienced users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1084713811424884">Marriage, Moore, &amp; Alcántara, 2004</xref>) or show more gain adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1084713811424884">Keidser, O’Brien, Carter, McLelland, &amp; Yeend, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1084713811424884">Cox and Alexander (1992)</xref> found that experienced users obtained more benefit than new users. However, they found similar time-related changes in benefit during the first 10 weeks of hearing aid use.</p>
<p>In the patient-driven approach of our study, the participants had the opportunity to keep the gain values low if that was their preference. The results of the SRT tests could be explained by the difference in the real ear measurements. There was more gain for the AD than for the PD settings especially at 1000 and 2000 Hz. So in a quiet environment, the input level could be set lower for the AD settings than the PD settings to achieve 50% correct speech recognition. In continuous noise, there was no difference between the PD and AD settings because the level of speech and noise were both raised. For the situation in time-reversed speech, the levels of both speech and noise were raised; however, a higher input signal (in this case for the AD settings) produced better speech intelligibility in the temporal gaps.</p>
<p>In this study, comfort of loud sounds measured with video clips was rated higher for the PD settings than for the AD settings. Despite the fact that the AD settings produced better speech intelligibility in quiet and in noise and also scored better quality, special attention should be given to the comfort of loud sounds.</p>
<p>The results from this study suggest that a patient-driven approach may lead to suboptimal speech perception. Therefore, an objective verification by real ear measurements is important. However, the general acceptance and comfort of hearing may profit from an interactive procedure using realistic daily-life situations as simulated in this study by video clips. A way to handle these possibly conflicting requirements is to start with a first fit based on insertion gain measurements and a generic fitting rule and then continue with a fine-tuning process like Amplifit<sup>®</sup> II system. Although this study did not provide hard data, it may be assumed that the patient-driven approach with videos will be more cost-effective than a patient-driven approach with trial and error during successive trial periods. The presence of complaints during trial periods may increase the number of negative trials because of a disappointing result. Such an audio-visual system could also be used for counseling. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1084713811424884">Saunders, Lewis, and Forsline (2009)</xref> found small but significant effects on expectations due to counseling (with or without such a system).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The audiologist-driven approach yielded on average a higher gain than the patient-driven approach, especially at 1000 and 2000 Hz. The objective performance for speech perception in quiet and in time-reversed speech was better with the audiologist-driven settings than with the patient-driven settings. The subjective judgments about speech perception in quiet, in noise and the quality of sounds, with video clips, favored the audiologist-driven settings. The subjective judgments of the comfort of loud sounds favored the patient-driven settings. The subjective judgments about detection, speech in noise, and localization with the AVETA questionnaire were more positive for the audiologist-driven settings. There is a trend that the new users (having more open fits) report greater benefit from the audiologist-driven approach than from the patient-driven approach. After both trial periods, most hearing-impaired participants preferred the audiologist-driven settings (67%) over the patient-driven hearing aid settings (18%), 15% did not have a preference.</p>
