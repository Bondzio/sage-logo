<abstract>
<p>Although waste quantification and projection are important data for waste management, the reliability of their results is difficult to verify. The present study attempted to identify the best waste quantification methods using e-waste quantification studies of mainland China as case studies. Large discrepancies in the predicted amounts of e-waste generated were found no matter whether the same or different methods of estimation are used. Moreover, even when agreements between studies were found, the agreed figures were not necessarily the correct figures. However, since without hindsight it is not possible to tell whether a projection figure is accurate, the convergence rule and a prudent approach to counting on studies conducted with meticulous scientific procedures should be adopted. Two worrying trends are noted. First, the transparency of data collection and computation methods in these studies was not high; second, irresponsible citation practices were found to have already spread to academic studies. As a result, leading organizations in the academic community should consider establishing a platform devoted to the reporting of false or dubious citations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Projection of waste quantities is important to waste management. The exposure of environmentally detrimental recycling of electrical and electronic waste (e-waste) in the People’s Republic of China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X11417986">Leung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X11417986">Wong et al., 2007</xref>) has prompted waste management professionals to find alternative solutions to solve the e-waste problem in this country. Fundamental to such investigation is to determine the quantities of e-waste generated. However, valid projection of e-waste quantities is difficult to make and its reliability is also difficult to prove. In the present study, an attempt was made to assess the reliability of various projection methods on the e-waste of mainland China. In addition, the common pitfalls and the sources of uncertainties that would lead to disagreements in the findings reported in these studies are also detailed.</p>

<title>Generic methods to estimate E-waste quantities</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11417986">Walk (2004)</xref> mentioned three methods for estimating waste quantities generated but not necessarily disposed of in an economy, namely, projections (also known as the time-series model), input–output models and factor models. Among the three, the input–output model is the most promising and most frequently used to make quantitative estimations of e-waste. Two commonly used approaches that come under the input–output concept are ‘market supply methods’ and the ‘consumption and use approach’. Recent applications of the ‘consumption and use approach’ are the estimation of e-waste generation in Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11417986">Chung et al., 2011</xref>) and computer waste in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X11417986">Dwivedy and Mittal, 2010</xref>). More complex variants of the input–output models include the ‘time-step method’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X11417986">Walk 2004</xref>) and the ‘use-phase analysis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X11417986">Walk 2009</xref>). In these methods, a delay (equivalent to the lifespan of appliances) for electrical and electronic products (e-products) to become e-waste is assumed. Thus, information on product lifespan is needed to complete the estimation. In addition, a seldom mentioned approach to estimate quantities of e-waste disposed of is the direct waste analysis method. Records of e-waste receipts in all local waste facilities are one source of information. E-waste disposal data can also be obtained by field determination at major end-disposal facilities. Hong Kong SAR government used this method to estimate e-waste disposal figures of the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X11417986">Environment Bureau, 2010</xref>). Making reference to the studies reviewed, the strengths and weaknesses of the main methods to estimate e-waste quantity in a particular year, namely e-waste quantification, are stated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X11417986">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Selection criteria</title>
<p>Although there are numerous studies or reports mentioning the amount of e-waste in mainland China, many are secondary data; the methodological steps and the assumptions made for computing those figures are not explained in detail. This is particularly the case with figures cited in newspapers and websites. Without knowing the methodology and assumptions used, it is not possible to compare the performance of different methodological approaches in e-waste estimation objectively. As a result, in this study, only first-hand e-waste estimation studies have been compared when their computation methods are also known. Seven studies conform to this criterion. However, in order to show the differences between first-hand studies and those using secondary data, China Business Council for Sustainable Development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11417986">CBCSD, 2007</xref>) is also included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X11417986">Table 2</xref>. Quoted from the official Xinhua News Agency, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X11417986">CBCSD (2007)</xref> reported that every year about 15 million units of television sets (TVs), refrigerators and washing machines were discarded in China. However, there is no information on the computation methods used, the year covered or the nature of the waste (generated or disposed).<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X11417986">Table 2</xref> is a summary of all of the studies evaluated. The market supply method is the most frequently used approach in estimating e-waste generated in mainland China but not all of them are trend studies, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11417986">Streicher-Porte and Yang (2007)</xref>. Trend studies are to identify trends that accurately describe e-waste growth and therefore may be less accurate about the annual quantities of a specific year. Thus, despite the convergence in methodology adopted, large discrepancies between findings of different studies may exist. In the following sections, e-waste estimations from seven studies are compared and attempts are made to explain the discrepancies.</p>

<title>Methods of comparison and limitations</title>
<p>As the time periods and e-waste types covered by these studies are not uniform, in order to make legitimate comparisons, only findings from studies covering the same period(s) and the same genre of e-waste are compared. Two fundamental approaches have been used. Pairwise comparison is used when the two studies reviewed cover the same e-waste typesor the same period. In cases where more than two studies are relevant, one study is used as the focal point of discussion.</p>
<p>Results from some studies cannot be compared with each other. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11417986">Müller et al. (2009)</xref> and Asia-Pacific Regional Centre for Hazardous Waste Management Training and Technology Transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11417986">ARCTTT, 2005</xref>) are examples. While both have used the market supply method and attempted to estimate e-waste generated in 2005, the former chose to use the Gaussian distribution model which was more often called the normal distribution while the latter opted for the Gompertz distribution which was more often used to describe population growth; if their results could be rendered comparable, the conclusion would have a high chance of throwing light on which distribution model is more appropriate for e-waste estimation. This, however, cannot be done because the coverage of the two studies has no commonalities: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11417986">ARCTTT (2005)</xref> does not provide an estimate of personal computer (PC) waste for 2005 and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11417986">Müller et al. (2009)</xref> only cover PC waste. Comparison between <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11417986">Schluep et al. (2009)</xref> and other studies also cannot be made without making arbitrary assumptions on unit weights of different genre of e-waste because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11417986">Schluep et al. (2009)</xref> have provided estimates denoted in weight only for the year 2007 whereas other studies have focused on the number of units of e-waste generated.</p>
<p>As there is no empirical data on the actual amount of e-waste generated (or even disposed) in mainland China, it is almost impossible to directly validate such projections. Thus, the convergence rule and a prudent approach are adopted to assess the quality of the study outcomes. If studies agree with each other, then it is more likely that the agreed results are the best available estimates. It is commonly accepted that studies conducted by meticulous scientific procedures should be more trustworthy than their less rigorous counterparts. This prudent approach is also used.</p>

<title>PC waste estimates compared</title>
<p>Among these studies, only two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11417986">Liu et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11417986">Müller et al. 2009</xref>) have covered estimation of e-waste generated in 2005. While both made use of PC sales data to make estimations, there are two major differences. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11417986">Liu et al. (2006)</xref> stated their estimates only in diagrams; the figures in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X11417986">Table 2</xref> were read from the diagram. Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11417986">Müller et al. (2009)</xref> used the Gaussian distribution to make time-series estimates whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11417986">Liu et al. (2006)</xref> did not state the kind of distribution used in their study. Despite the possible imprecision stemming from graph reading, it is evident that the estimate of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11417986">Liu et al. (2006)</xref> for PC waste is substantially higher than the value that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11417986">Müller et al. (2009)</xref> put forward.</p>
<p>Differences in PC lifespan assumptions used in the two studies may explain the discrepancy in their estimations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11417986">Müller et al. (2009)</xref> assume an average life of 4.91 years for an average computer whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11417986">Liu et al. (2006)</xref> assume a shorter lifespan of 3.5 years. However, there is reason to doubt if a 1.41 years difference in lifespan assumption can adequately explainthe difference in the results of these two studies. Thisis because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11417986">Müller et al. (2009)</xref> state clearly that theyalso consider waste from stored unused PCs whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11417986">Liu et al. (2006)</xref> are silent on whether waste from idle machines is included in their estimates. If not, then the actual discrepancy between the two studies is even greater. On the whole, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X11417986">Müller et al.

Not only is the same methodology used in both, the assumptions of lifespan of home appliances are also the same in these two studies.

(2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11417986">Yang et al.

<p>Estimates of waste generated from refrigerators and washing machines provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11417986">Liu et al. (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11417986">ARCTTT (2005)</xref> are similar or largely similar for 2005, as well as 2010. However, there is large discrepancy (about 8 million units) between the two in the case of TV sets for 2005; The estimate of Liu et al. is smaller than that computed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11417986">ARCTTT (2005)</xref>. However, the two studies still agree regarding the quantum of TV waste in 2010.</p>
<p>The greatest difference is found between their estimates of air-conditioners waste. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11417986">ARCTTT (2005)</xref> estimated that 30 million units of air-conditioners waste were generated in 2005, which was 15 times the estimate of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11417986">Liu et al. (2006)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11417986">ARCTTT’s projection (2005)</xref> for air-conditioner waste for 2010 was also high. It is not clear why such big differences only occurred in estimates of air-conditioners. An even more puzzling point is that the assumed lifespan used for air-conditioners in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11417986">ARCTTT (2005)</xref> is only a year longer (11 years compared to 10) than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11417986">Liu et al. (2006)</xref>. Although a shorter lifespan does result in higher e-waste estimation, the observed differences cannot be explained fully by the difference in lifespan assumptions.</p>
<p>The use of Gompertz curve in modelling e-waste growth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11417986">ARCTTT (2005)</xref> and the use of different statistical bases for model input are probably the most convincing explanations for the major discrepancy in air conditioner waste predictions. It is evident from Figure 3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11417986">Liu et al. (2006)</xref> that from 2003 to 2010, the rate of increase in air conditioner waste was very slow. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11417986">ARCTTT (2005)</xref> projected quantities from 1990, using the Gompertz distribution, resulting in 2005 being a period of rapid growth. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11417986">ARCTTT (2005)</xref> used national trade and production statistics as inputs while (as previously mentioned) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11417986">Liu et al. (2006)</xref> used both national household appliance possession statistics <italic>and</italic> sales data, and there is no explanation of how the two different sets of data are deployed in their model. Thus, it is possible that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11417986">Liu et al. (2006)</xref> may have made unreported manipulation of the data for model input and caused the surprisingly large discrepancy. Thus, the type of growth distribution assumed, time horizon of projections and the existence of hidden computation methods are all plausible reasons for the large difference in estimates of air-conditioner waste generated in China.</p>

<title>Comparison between year-specific and non-year-specific estimates</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11417986">Streicher-Porte and Yang (2007)</xref> is the focus of discussion in this section. Among all studies, the estimates of PCs and air-conditioners waste made are the lowest in this study but their estimates of quantities of waste TV sets, refrigerators and washing machines are similar to those computed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11417986">Liu et al.

On the whole, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11417986">Streicher-Porte and Yang (2007)</xref> tend to give more conservative estimates despite having assumed the same e-product lifespans as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11417986">Liu et al.

As the computation method is not described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X11417986">Streicher-Porte and Yang (2007)</xref>, it is not possible to explainsuch differences. In general, estimates of non-specific years have assumed that current e-products are rendered obsolete at an average rate and, therefore, a relatively short period of validity (less than 5 years) for the projection is assumed.</p>

<title>Comparison of findings obtained by different estimation methods</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11417986">Duan et al. (2007)</xref> is the only study that has used the consumption and use approach and is the focus of discussion in this section. However, no comparison can be made between <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11417986">Duan et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X11417986">Schluep et al. (2009)</xref> because the years covered and waste unit used are different, despite both have adopted the same quantitative estimation approach.</p>
<p>Among the studies reviewed, the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11417986">Duan et al. (2007)</xref> are more comparable with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11417986">Yang et al. (2008)</xref> as they covered the same years and the same generic types of e-waste. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11417986">Duan et al. (2007)</xref> presented separate estimates for sub-categories of e-waste, including plasma display panel (PDP), liquid crystal display (LCD) TV sets and notebook computers, in addition to traditional CRT TV sets and desktop computers. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11417986">Liu et al. (2006)</xref> have been ambivalent about whether notebook computers, PDP and LCD TV sets were covered in their study. In order to render them comparable, it has to be assumed that the estimations of waste TV sets in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11417986">Liu et al. (2006)</xref> also included PDP and LCD TV waste and their estimations of computer waste also included notebook computers.Under this assumption, it is concluded that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11417986">Duan et al. (2007)</xref> tended to produce lower figures of e-waste with the exception of air-conditioners for both 2006 and 2010 and computers for 2010 (Items 1, 2, 7 and 8 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X11417986">Table 2</xref>). In addition, a much higher rate of growth is asserted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11417986">Duan et al. (2007)</xref> for computer products waste. Lifespans assumed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11417986">Duan et al. (2007)</xref> for desktop and notebook computers are 6 and 5 years, respectively, whereas in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11417986">Yang et al. (2008)</xref>, an age distribution model is used to simulate the change of lifespan of computers in China from 1993–2003 (5.2 years to 3.5 years). As a result, the lifespans assumed by Duan et al. arelonger than those used by Yang et al. and, therefore, the difference in lifespans cannot be used to explain the muchhigher PC waste projection made in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11417986">Duan et al. (2007)</xref> for 2010. As a conclusion, no explanation of why and how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X11417986">Duan et al. (2007)</xref> assumed such a high rate of growth for computers (both desktop and notebook) can be given because the distribution model used for making projections has not been stated.</p>
<p>However, with the exception of computer waste, it appears that the consumption and use approach tends to give more conservative (i.e. smaller quantities) estimates than the market supply method. This may due to the inclusion of overseas consumption of appliances in aggregated national sales data.</p>

<title>Finding the best estimates</title>
<p>In sum, the most liberal estimates are several times the most conservative ones with respect to computers and air-conditioners waste. If the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11417986">ARCTTT (2005)</xref> estimate of PC waste in 2010 is accurate (300 million units), each Chinese national would be producing 0.22 units of PC waste every year. This translates into China’s per capita PC waste generation rate being almost twice that of the more developed Hong Kong SAR, which has a PC waste generation rate of only 0.12 units (figure derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11417986">Chung et al. 2011</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11417986">ARCTTT (2005)</xref> has made very liberal estimates of air-conditioners waste generation. ARCTTT estimated that by 2010, there would be about 42 million units of air conditioners waste generated, almost eight times the estimates of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11417986">Yang et al. (2008)</xref>. However, the question is whether the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X11417986">ARCTTT (2005)</xref> estimates (42 million units of air conditioners waste by 2010) are necessarily wrong.</p>
<p>To answer this question, an abridged calculation has been made using the consumption and use approach, deploying the latest published national statistics of household appliances ownership from hindsight. In 2008, each household in mainland China owned 1.0028 units of air conditioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11417986">China Statistics Bureau, 2009</xref>). In that year, China had 420.3 million households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X11417986">China Statistics Bureau, 2009</xref>). Thus, the total number of air-conditioners owned in 2008 should be 421.4 million units and as air-conditioners are assumed to have a 10-year lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X11417986">Liu et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X11417986">Yang et al. 2008</xref>), it is expected that on average there would be about 42.1 million units of air-conditioners waste generated each year. Thus, although the ARCTTT estimates are much larger than all other studies, it may in fact be a more realistic figure.</p>
<p>Thus, the seemingly better and more vigorous studies may not provide the most accurate estimates of e-waste generation. Indeed, it is hard to state definitively which study is more accurate with respect to all e-waste types and their trends. The safest conclusion is that no studies can be deemed reliable for all estimations it provides.</p>
<p>Disagreements among the studies are often caused by the lack of transparency in the computation methods used, source data deployed and the heterogeneous units (of waste) used. Although without hindsight it is not possible to tell whether a projection figure is accurate, it is possible to screen out the less reliable ones – those that have no detailed description of the methodologies and have a low degree of source data transparency are undoubtedly less rigorous studies; their estimations even if later found to closely approximate reality their success is probably founded on chance, not meticulous scientific procedures.</p>

<title>Precautions in data interpretation</title>
<p>A number of problems were observed in the body of literature in the course of this review. These problems are noteworthy not just for the purpose of finding an accurate estimate of the amount of e-waste generated in China but also because similar problems may be found in e-waste studies for other places as well.</p>
<p>A fundamental problem encountered in this study was that many of the figures of e-waste are secondary data; that is, not derived or worked out by the authors but cited from other sources. While making such citations is a very common practice in newspapers and even official publications, it should be done only when the authenticity of the data can be assured or when the data are critically reviewed. Citing important figures without verification or review is a practice that has now even spread to academic journals or reputable reports. This practice is undesirable and errors are difficult to discover. A case in point is the citation of China’s computer waste generation figure in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11417986">Nnorom and Osibanjo (2008)</xref>, which stated that estimation of 4 million units of computer waste per annum for mainland China was based on a report published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11417986">Greenpeace (2005)</xref>. In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11417986">Greenpeace (2005)</xref> report, the same computer waste generation figure was cited from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X11417986">United Nations Environment Programme (2005)</xref>, which contained no personal computer waste estimation for China at all. Owing to the dubious nature of their figures, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X11417986">Nnorom and Osibanjo (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X11417986">Greenpeace (2005)</xref> studies have not been included in the present assessment. Relying predominantly on secondary sources of data has attenuated the reliability and creditability of academic studies.Second, appropriate primary data on which e-waste estimates are based can be difficult to secure. These primary data include, but are not limited to, statistics on imports, exports, domestic consumption and product sales. Although national sales statistics of e-products are available for mainland China, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X11417986">Feszty et al. (2003)</xref> remarked that regional e-product sales data for Scotland were not available and had to be derived from those for the UK. Similarly, municipal level e-product sales data are not available for Hong Kong, one of the special administrative regions of China. Even for statistics that are available, the integrity can be doubtful. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X11417986">Wilkinson et al. (2001)</xref> considered e-product sales data from Dublin’s Central Statistics Office unreliable and did not use them directly for e-waste calculation for Ireland. This is particularly the case with external trade statistics which are usually compiled from information declared on trade declaration forms, and in some cases, only when shipment value exceeds a certain level would the trade data be published in official statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X11417986">Crowe et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X11417986">Janz and Bilitewski (2009)</xref> remark that customs records in Germany do not differentiate between waste and new appliances and this is similarly the case with Hong Kong SAR. Trade data are invariably self-reporting in nature and are seldom verified. A case in point is the doubtful reliability of export data of TV sets in Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X11417986">Chung et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, discussion above shows that even if raw data are used and lifespans of e-products are standardized, there is no guarantee of agreement in results generated from the market supply method. So, does it mean that this method does not generate reproducible results? Mentioned previously, the lack of agreement among studies using the same quantitative estimation approach may stem from incomplete or unclear descriptions of methodological details rather than the methodology itself. As a result, researchers are urged to always adopt the good practice of reporting their methodologies in full so that policy makers and facility planners have all the information they need to decide which studies are more reliable.</p>
<p>Fourth, readers are reminded that waste generation figures do not necessarily reflect quantities of waste disposed. However, waste generation figures are important figures for planning of the collection, recycling and treatment infrastructure. E-waste disposal figures, on the other hand, indicate the scale of resource wastage and represent the recovery potential of the waste stream. Nevertheless, no studies reviewed are able to provide an estimate of quantities of e-waste disposed in China. Thus, there is a serious lack of information on the recovery potential of e-waste in China.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Limited by the difficulties to validate projection figures on 	e-waste generated in mainland China, this paper can only assess to what extent the seven studies reviewed converge. As the ownership and sales of major e-products in mainland China are published by the government every year, e-waste projection using such published data should largely agree with each other if the same methodology is used. However, more disagreements than agreements were found. Disagreement exists despite the use of the same input databases and same quantification methods. On the accuracy of results, there is a lack of evidence to suggest which commonly used waste quantification method is most capable of producing reliable e-waste estimates. It is difficult to determine which method reviewed is the best because often these studies did not report all the important information (e.g. years covered, distribution model used) used in their computation. This has rendered complete assessment of their calculation impossible.</p>
<p>Yet, it is also demonstrated here that agreements among studies do not necessarily mean that they are accurate. Conversely, apparently outlying findings may be closer to the truth. However, since without hindsight it is not possible to tell whether a projected figure is accurate or not, adopting traditional wisdom to count only on studies conducted with meticulous scientific procedures is still the best option.</p>
<p>There is a common consensus in the academic world that neglecting the data computation methodology and just reporting figures from other sources is an irresponsible act (citation) and should be discouraged. However, it is worrying that irresponsible citation practices have spread to academic studies, irrespective of whether the published articles or studies have undergone the peer-review process. To deter irresponsible citation behaviour, it is suggested that leading organizations in the academic community establish a publicly accessible platform for reporting of false or dubious citations to reduce the adverse effects on credentials of academic works, from such bad practices.</p>
