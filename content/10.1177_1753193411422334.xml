<abstract>
<p>We compared the aesthetic outcome of scars after closure of open carpal tunnel incisions with either absorbable 4-0 Vicryl Rapide or non-absorbable 4-0 Novafil. Patients were recruited in a randomized controlled trial and scars were scored at 6 weeks using a modified Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale. Scores demonstrated differences only for pain, vascularity and cross-hatching between both groups, though none of these were statistically significant. The dissolving and falling out of Vicryl Rapide was significantly more comfortable than removal of 4-0 Novafil sutures, assessed on a numerical analogue scale. There was no difference in infection rate between both study groups, supporting overall the use of Vicryl Rapide for the closure of palmar hand incisions, in light of the convenience and cost savings associated with absorbable sutures.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Skin incisions and lacerations on the palmar aspect of the hand are traditionally closed using non-absorbable sutures, although absorbable sutures have been used successfully for wound closure in paediatric patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411422334">Al-Qattan, 2005</xref>). Previous studies have compared absorbable and non-absorbable sutures for the closure of hand wounds, but have not examined in detail the aesthetic outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411422334">Erel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411422334">Howard et al., 2009</xref>) or standardized the wounds being examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411422334">Kundra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411422334">Shetty et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The primary aim of our study was to compare the aesthetic outcome following closure of a standardized palmar wound (open carpal tunnel release), using either 4-0 Vicryl Rapide (VR) or 4-0 Novafil (NF) for closure with simple interrupted sutures. Secondary outcome measures included pain perceived during suture removal and the incidence of postoperative wound infection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1753193411422334" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study received ethical approval from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Cork University Teaching Hospital. Patients attending for elective open carpal tunnel release were offered participation in this study. All patients recruited to the study consented to participation on an entirely voluntary basis, following discussion of alternative treatment options and after provision of an information leaflet of the study aims and design, as well as a separate consent form, approved by the Ethics Committee of Cork University Hospital. Patients were excluded from the study for the following reasons: repeat surgery; known allergy to suture materials; previous hypertrophic or keloid scar; concurrent chemotherapy, steroid or immunomodulatory treatment. After giving informed consent, patients were randomly assigned, using a sealed envelope method, to have the skin closed using either Vicryl Rapide™ 4-0 (Ethicon, Kirkton, Scotland) or Novafil™ 4-0 (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) after open carpal tunnel release. All procedures were carried out by the senior author or specialist registrars in plastic surgery. A straight palmar incision was used to gain access to the flexor retinaculum, subsequently closed with simple interrupted sutures of one of the suture materials and dressed with Jelonet (Smith and Nephew Healthcare, Hull, UK) and gauze.</p>
<sec id="section3-1753193411422334">
<title>Postoperative follow-up</title>
<p>Patients were asked to return to the dressing clinic on the fifth postoperative day to exclude postoperative wound infection. As the definition of wound infection can vary widely, we interpreted this from a clinical viewpoint and scored as a wound infection any patient that was prescribed antibiotics for their wound.</p>
<p>On the fourteenth postoperative day, patients returned to the outpatient department for removal of sutures (Novafil group), at which point they were asked to rate the pain associated with suture removal on a numerical analogue scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).</p>
<p>A scar assessment was carried out in the outpatient department 6 weeks after the operation, using a modified Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411422334">van de Kar et al., 2005</xref>). This scale, which has been validated for linear scars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411422334">Draaijers et al., 2004</xref>), assesses the scar from the viewpoint of both the patient and the clinician. Assessment of cross-hatching replaced the criterion for ‘surface area’ on the clinician component of the scar assessment scale, as this was thought to be a point of primary interest between absorbable and non-absorbable sutures. The minimum sample size required to detect a difference in a normalized POSAS score of 1 between two groups was calculated to be 16 patients/group, at a standard deviation of 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411422334">Brant, 2011</xref>). Statistical significance was tested with Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test. Surgeons assessing the wounds at the 6 week time point were blinded with respect to study group, but this was not possible for patients.</p>

<p>There were no wound infections in either the VR or NF group.</p>
<p>Numeric Analogue Pain scores (0 to 10) were 0.2 (SD 0.4) for the VR group and 1.3 (SD 2.0) for the NF group, the difference being statistically significant (Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.039).</p>
<p>For ease of interpretation, POSAS scores were normalized to a scale of 0–10. Overall scores did not reveal any statistically significant differences for the patient component, observer component, or in the total score. A subgroup analysis did not reveal any statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1753193411422334">Table 2</xref>). Most importantly, the difference in scores between VR and NF for cross-hatching was not statistically significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>An ideal method of wound closure would be rapid to perform, provide sufficient strength during the proliferative period of wound healing, provoke minimal inflammatory reaction, not require significant aftercare and lead to a good cosmetic outcome. Traditionally, incisions in the hand are closed using non-absorbable monofilament sutures, as these are thought to result in less cross-hatching and less postoperative wound infection than braided absorbable sutures. In our experience, however, the same surgeons will often close hand wounds in children with absorbable sutures in order to avoid the inconvenience, and occasionally traumatic experience, of postoperative suture removal in this group.</p>
<p>The successful use of Vicryl and Vicryl Rapide in children is documented, but the scar outcomes were not formally assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411422334">Al-Qattan, 2005</xref>). Other studies have compared Vicryl Rapide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411422334">Howard et al., 2009</xref>) or Vicryl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411422334">Erel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411422334">Shetty et al., 1997</xref>) with non-absorbable sutures for the closure, but have not examined the aesthetic scar outcomes at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411422334">Howard et al., 2009</xref>), not used scar assessment scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411422334">Shetty et al., 1997</xref>), or not standardized the wounds being studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411422334">Kundra et al., 2010</xref>). This leaves the question whether the outcomes of wound closure with simple interrupted sutures is different when done with absorbable or non-absorbable sutures.</p>
<p>We decided to use patients undergoing open carpal tunnel release as our study population, as the carpal incision can be standardized relatively easily, and the glabrous skin is not prone to delayed healing, which can be the case for thin flaps in fasciectomy for Dupuytren’s contracture. Nor is the skin subject to significant movement which could influence the wound healing process.</p>
<p>The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale is simple and rapid in its application and has been validated for the scoring of straight line scars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411422334">Draaijers et al., 2004</xref>). Overall POSAS scores for the Vicryl Rapide and Novafil groups were almost identical. The biggest subgroup differences were for pain and vascularity, where Novafil performed worse than Vicryl Rapide, and cross-hatching, where Novafil scored better. However, none of these differences reached statistical significance, despite sufficient patients having been enrolled to differentiate between a 1 point difference in POSAS scores with an α of 0.05 and a β of 0.80.</p>
<p>A limitation of the study is that scar assessment was done 6 weeks postoperatively, which might be considered rather early. We felt it best to fit this assessment into our normal postoperative follow-up for patients undergoing carpal tunnel release, as it would have been difficult to get patients to attend clinic several months later, unless there were ongoing symptomatic problems. Whilst the majority of wounds tend to improve with time, the 6 week scar outcome may well better highlight any differences between the two study groups, as the wound should be nearing the end of its proliferative phase.</p>
<p>Novafil was removed 2 weeks after operation, whereas Vicryl Rapide was allowed to fall out spontaneously, usually taking 2–3 weeks to do so. Although removal of Novafil sutures did cause statistically significantly more pain than Vicryl Rapide sutures falling out spontaneously, the absolute pain score was relatively low. The clinical importance is therefore not so much the amount of discomfort perceived during suture removal, but the inconvenience associated with it. One potential disadvantage of Vicryl Rapide as a suture material is the fact that sutures will fall out spontaneously, which may cause inconvenience to the patient when clean conditions are required, as for example during food preparation. The time taken for sutures to fall out was not recorded, as we felt it too reliant on accurate recording by the patient.</p>
<p>The infection rate, judged from a pragmatic viewpoint as any inflammation thought to require antibiotic treatment, was not different for either group. This fact, as well as the lack of a measurable difference in scar outcome between both suture materials, supports the use of Vicryl Rapide for the closure of palmar hand wounds, since it offers significant cost and time savings to both patient and healthcare provider.</p>
