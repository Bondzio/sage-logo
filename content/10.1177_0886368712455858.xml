<abstract>
<p>The turbulent environment of the last two decades has made it difficult to manage employee rewards well. When revenues vary while compensation costs remain fixed it impacts profitability in private sector firms and makes it difficult for public sector entities to remain within budgets. Organizations need to use scenario based planning to develop robust rewards strategies that will work reasonably well in a variety of possible futures. Current strategies and programs should be evaluated to ensure they are sustainable. Alternative approaches to rewarding employees that make rewards costs more variable enables them to be better aligned with revenues.</p>

<p>Managing used to feel like riding a roller coaster, due to environmental fluctuation across “business cycles.” Since 2007, it feels more like riding a raft through rapids that extend as far as the eye can see. This fundamental change should alert rewards strategists that the game has changed . . . perhaps for a long time. The turbulent environment makes it prudent to employ scenario-based planning, which enables an organization to plan for a number of possible futures and to develop strategies that will work in any of them.</p>
<p>The rewards packages offered to employees by organizations are almost entirely fixed costs, which only go up. Although executives and sales personnel generally have significant portions of their current cash compensation in the form of variable compensation, this variability is minute when compared with the total workforce costs.</p>
<p>Fixed costs do not work well in a variable revenue world. In the private sector, CEOs must deal with the stock analysts, who apply short-term pressure to sustain/grow profits. The concern about analyst opinions is understandable when one considers that most U.S. organizations fund themselves largely through equity, while much of the rest of the world relies more on long-term relationships with investors. But this reality makes fixed costs unsustainable in the long run if revenues are highly variable. And since for many organizations its workforce costs may be the largest cost, it puts pressure on rewards strategists to find a way to make a larger portion of workforce costs variable and controllable. The public sector has yet to recognize that its generous benefits and early retirement ages cannot be sustained.</p>
<p>There has been a major shift in retirement programs in the private sector, from defined benefit pension plans to defined contribution plans. This helps organizations better control their share of the costs of the plans, by specifying how they match employee contributions. Some have even taken the next step and made their matches contingent on performance. For example, a 50% match on employee contributions up to 6% of pay may be guaranteed. But if the organization meets its business plan the match could be raised to 75%, and if the optimistic target is hit it could be 100%. By doing this on a year by year basis the costs are better aligned with performance and the resources to fund programs.</p>
<p>Another step that is being taken more often is the use of performance-based adjustments to base pay and this shift has begun in the public sector as well. In the early 1990s, more than two thirds of public water utilities used time-based step progression systems; today less than one third do (annual AWWA Water Utility Compensation Survey). And states, counties and cities have increasingly moved to systems with less automatic progressions. As the market compensation levels stagnated, those left with step-rate systems were forced to add 3% to 5% to their payrolls, which outpaced the market and violated their pay policies. The automatic cost feature of step systems is so onerous that less than half of the federal workforce is left in the GS system, having been taken out agency by agency into “excepted service” systems that allow for better cost control.</p>
<p>But more needs to be done if organizations are to effectively compete in “permanent white water.” One approach to base pay management that is emerging is a system that combines base pay increases and cash awards. Guidecharts that embrace the concept that both performance and position in the pay range should determine one’s pay adjustment are still being used. But under the combination approach organizations segment out a portion of the approved budget for cash awards (see sample guidechart below).</p>

</fig>
<p>In this example, a 3% budget for pay actions had been approved, but 1% had been reserved for outstanding performance awards (OPAs). This had the effect of reducing the rate at which base payroll was increased, leading to reduced compounding in the future. It also made high levels of performance rewarding, even for those being paid high in the range. (Note: the above model assumes employee pay rates were distributed evenly in the pay range and that the performance rating distribution was as shown in parentheses under the rating level.)</p>
<p>These revised strategies are not easy to implement when the existing programs have been in place for extended periods and when there is low turnover, resulting in a lot of “entitled” employees. But apprehension on the part of management to chart a different course is often created by listening to employee objections when changes are discussed. What is needed in many organizations is a course in business management. Without understanding the economics, management must deal with employees who can take the organization to the edge of the abyss, much like the auto worker and steel worker unions did in the United States. This resulted in a lot of lost jobs, either through shutdowns or offshoring, a result not adequately considered by the militants driving the escalation in fixed workforce costs. Management has typically not been blameless either. When organizations trumpeted record profits for several consecutive years in the 1990s, they often forgot to adequately share the bounty with employees. And when they did it was through fixed cost escalating programs for the most part.</p>
<p>In the public sector, legislatures continue to pander to their workforces by continuing to increase pay and benefits, while pushing the liability for this largesse to future legislatures to worry about. And allowing actuarial assumptions about investment returns of 8% to be used (when the realistic assumption would be 2% in today’s environment) the actual liability is grossly understated. Given the demographics of the U.S. labor force, they will not be able to “kick the can down the road” much longer before facing reality.</p>
<p>Rewards strategists have a responsibility to ensure decision makers understand the implications of current pay and benefits programs. If they are unsustainable in their present form, they must be changed and management has to face that reality. As the mandated changes are implemented, the first step must be educating the workforce that this is not exploitation . . . it is a prerequisite for sustained viability and subsequent survival.</p>
