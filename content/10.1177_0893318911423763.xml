<p>It seems there is a desire among those of us who call ourselves nonprofit organizational (NPO) scholars in the communication discipline to develop something substantial. We want there to be some sort of body of work—theoretical meat—or at least empirical foci that create impact of some kind. It seems also that this desire stems in part from the need of many nonprofit communication scholars to establish legitimacy to the subarea of NPO communication scholarship. So, we often find ourselves asking, “What should we build and with what goal(s) in mind?”</p>
<p>A consistently articulated goal is to “prove” that nonprofits are unique and thus justify our study of them. I have to say I’m not very excited by that proposal. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318911423763">Frumkin (2002)</xref> has noted NPOs have some things in common with governmental organizations and other things in common with for-profits, and so their “otherness” is relative to what they are compared. He concludes it might be time to retire the “nonprofit” term given the wide diversity of types of organizations in the landscape variously referred to as the “independent sector,” “voluntary sector,” “nongovernmental sector,” “civil society,” and “third sector,” among other terms. Frumkin’s discussion demonstrates why the “uniqueness” goal might be problematic.</p>
<p>Another possible goal of our collective work in the study of communication in/of/around NPOs might be to generate new theory or to challenge existing theory in organizational communication. Since our “canon” of organizational communication knowledge has largely been built on western for-profit organizations, there is certainly room to add to the dimensions and foci of current knowledge. This goal is not one bent on proving that NPOs are unique but rather setting aside that question and instead focusing on the simple fact that NPOs might be a better (or best) place to study many dynamics that organizational communications scholars are/should be interested in studying. This is a path I have advocated elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318911423763">Lewis, 2005</xref>) and think still might be a useful direction for us to pursue.</p>
<p>A third option is the one I advocate in the remainder of this essay. While we have succeeded in being <italic>interesting</italic> in our NPO scholarship, I think we have been less <italic>useful</italic>. That is, we are not necessarily tackling problems, puzzles, and possibilities that those in practice would find relevant and important. One way forward is to spend less time trying to convince our organizational colleagues that our interests are important and/or legitimate and spend more time trying to answer questions of importance to practitioners in NPOs.</p>
<p>This approach is appealing on a number of levels. First, it can move us off of a path that might develop into a random set of descriptive studies of the unusual or the atypical (which I think are too often our default foci). Second, if we discovered some commonalities among NPO practitioners in terms of what is most urgently needed, most significantly challenging, and what is on the near horizon for opportunities, we might find ourselves coalescing around topics that do and will matter. Third, it provides an opportunity to lead our subarea in demonstrating the value of, and illustrating good models for, engaged scholarship.</p>

<title>Engaged Scholarship as a Means to Be Useful</title>
<p>Engaged scholarship has been discussed for several years (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318911423763">Lawler, Mohrman, Mohrman, Ledford, &amp; Cummings, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318911423763">Van de Ven &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0893318911423763">Van de Ven, 2007</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318911423763">Barge and Shockley-Zalabak (2008)</xref> argue,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Academic scholars have traditionally been concerned with the construction of scientific knowledge, which tends to be decontextualized and based on technical rationality, while practitioners are more concerned with practical knowledge that focuses on making moral choices about how to act in contingent situations. (p. 251)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Andrew <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0893318911423763">Van de Ven (2007)</xref> asserts that we have traditionally tried to bridge the gap between these different foci of academic scholars and practitioners by encouraging knowledge transfer—finding ways to give “back” our expert knowledge to practitioners. Van de Ven and others note that not only is this a very limited (and paternalistic) approach but it misses the point that our real challenge lies in knowledge production. That is, we are creating knowledge without partnering with practitioners, and the result is knowledge that is not very useful. Van de Ven argues, “Engagement is a relationship that involves negotiation and collaboration between researchers and practitioners in a learning community; such a community jointly produces knowledge that can both advance the scientific enterprise and enlighten a community of practitioners” (p. 7). Fundamentally, our knowledge is better if we partner in diverse learning communities rather than simply aloofly draw our own conclusions and then generously share them with those who are the objects of study.</p>
<p>Although this has some immediate appeal, some have debated about the practical and philosophical problems of doing engaged scholarship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318911423763">McKelvey (2006)</xref> questions the plausibility of the ideal of engaged scholarship by articulating three insolvable problems: (a) the biases of for-profit organizations; (b) the mismatch of “success goals” for scholars and practitioners; and (c) the timetable differences between problem–solution cycles of businesses and academics.</p>
<p>As I see it, engaged scholarship does provide a mechanism for NPO communication scholars to move toward building a desirable set of outcomes. The basic tenets of engaged scholarship involve principles that will work well with NPO research (and perhaps avoid some of the issues that McKelvey raises). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318911423763">Van de Ven and Johnson (2006)</xref> suggest engaged scholarship tackle “big questions.” Many NPOs are already grappling with “big questions” such as solving intractable societal problems; galvanizing diverse groups of stakeholders around complex community, national, and global issues; generating and executing effective governance without benefit of bureaucratic authority; and defining and assessing goals and mission within the context of contested, consequential, and moral grounds (e.g., HIV, terrorism, racial equality).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318911423763">Van de Ven and Johnson (2006)</xref> also recommend that we work collaboratively within a learning community. NPOs often collaborate first and would therefore likely be more amenable to collaboration than many for-profit, or even governmental, agencies who are more prone to proprietary concerns. Certainly, there are contexts in which NPOs also compete, but their skill sets and normal way of operating tends to include collaboration. Thus, it seems likely that partnering with a variety of NPOs for the sake of increasing knowledge production on problems of practice and problems of explanation (e.g., theory) would be easier than McKelvey suggests it is in business contexts. Our participation in convening collaborative learning communities among NPOs that share common practice challenges but who rarely cross paths might be quite useful and welcome.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318911423763">Van de Ven and Johnson (2006)</xref> also argue for establishing lengthy relationships with those in the field we wish to know. Although some for-profit sponsors of our research might be happier the faster we moved through their organization and delivered our “goods” (e.g., a report), in my experience NPO sponsors tend to be very suspicious of “drop-in” research projects. Dropping in for a week(s) to hand out surveys, do some interviews, and observe a few meetings usually yields few insights that these practitioners value. They often give little credence to whatever practical recommendations or observations are provided as an outcome of such research. Thus, many NPO practitioners may prefer a slow-forming relationship that spans months or even years.</p>

<sec id="section2-0893318911423763">
<title>How to Begin Engaged Scholarship to Push the NPO Agenda</title>
<p>I recommend three starting points for an engaged approach to NPO communication scholarship: (a) convene; (b) identify best practices; and (c) conduct a future search strategy.</p>
<p>Faculty can play a useful role in convening NPO practitioners who would make up a useful learning community. A powerful way to convene NPO practitioners would be to gather those who do not know one another but who share something in common in terms of puzzles, problems, or possibilities (e.g., NPOs who serve stigmatized populations, that are adopting social media, or that are staffed by episodic volunteers). Such a community would share ideas, resources, and lessons learned. This would benefit both the scholar and practitioners.</p>
<p>A second step would be to identify NPOs that are highly successful in some regard and document their best practices. This alone would be useful for the NPO leaders who seek models for best practice given their lack of resources for and access to consultants. Scholars can help to survey the larger world of best practice models by teaming up with each other, bridging to other academic and practice communities, and drawing on knowledge, experience, and networks of scholars in other disciplines. Once best practices in any given domain are identified from such methods, the scholar can enter into partnership with NPO practitioners to discover why best practices work. This becomes fodder both for mapping out important contingencies for the practitioners (so that poor-fitting practices are not transported inappropriately) and developing theoretical explanation of a phenomenon of interest to the scholarly community.</p>
<p>This approach is nonthreatening to NPOs as we would not be going in with the intention of studying, exposing, and documenting dysfunction or failure. Although that might be interesting (e.g., to show that volunteers are routinely ignored, that boards and CEOs have poor decision making, or that engagement of community stakeholders is lacking), it does not help anyone or anything get better. Focusing on best practice models and elaborating on why they work and how they might be equally or better suited in other contexts is useful. This is not to say there is no role for healthy critique in providing useful feedback to nonprofits but to say that mere description of dysfunction provides fewer practical outcomes for nonprofits.</p>
<p>Third, an important role that scholar-practitioner learning communities can play is to stimulate thinking and research about the future of NPOs. In the conversation between what communication scholars know about trends in organizing, communication, media, and social interaction and what practitioners see as trends in service delivery, patterns of organizing, dominance of governance models, and problems they are facing, and so forth, we can make some very informed choices about the future of NPOs and NPO research. Scholars bring to the table both theory and methodological tools as well as interested graduate students. NPOs bring insight and a strong motivation to see into the future of their own fields and the state of the “civil society” in general. As a learning community joins together to imagine the future for a particular niche, the potential for useful agenda setting is high.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to consider some cautionary notes about doing this sort of engaged work with NPO practitioners. There are some good lessons to be learned from the experience of our health communication colleagues who have started to embrace the model of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR). In CBPR, members of communities participate directly in the research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318911423763">Israel, Schulz, Parker, &amp; Becker, 2001</xref>). This model has been applied to help address public health issues such as safe drinking water, education about substance abuse, and other community health issues. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318911423763">Bidwell (2009)</xref> states, “CBPR seeks to benefit disenfranchised communities and their health through a redistribution of power and transformation of social structures” (p. 742). In this tradition, community members are involved not only as subjects or data assistants (helping to access subjects) but are involved in the decision-making process of research design, data analysis and interpretation, and the evaluation of the action outcomes of research. The documented benefits of CBPR in its various forms suggest that in some cases this approach has resulted higher validity to research as well as the training of community members in research techniques. Through participation in research and playing important roles in decision making, agenda setting, interpretation of data and so on, community members (or practitioners) can be empowered by some degree of control over knowledge production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318911423763">Stoecker, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There are some caveats noted by those who track CBPR and other similar models. For example, it is easy to drift into “tokenism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318911423763">Stoecker, 2009</xref>, p. 393), wherein practitioners’ presence becomes merely a symbol rather than a resource. They can be treated as naïve witnesses to the research as opposed to active empowered partners. We must learn to listen to and respect practitioners’ voices in our research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318911423763">Bastida, Tseng, McKeever, &amp; Jack, 2010</xref>). We also will need to learn to share resources (data, budget, personnel)—a particularly daunting challenge when grant dollars are involved.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges of engaged scholarship and the pain we may feel upon sharing control over our research projects and research agenda with those outside of the academic world, I see great potential here. This approach can enliven us, help guide us to important issues and topics, and, best of all, lead us to being useful. If we accomplish nothing else, that would be a truly great outcome.</p>
