<abstract>
<p>Cerebellar infarction is a known possible complication of extreme prematurity, and usually results in severe disability. This report presents a 20-month-old girl (16 months corrected), who was born in a toilet at 24 weeks gestational age. She had multiple neonatal predictors of poor outcome, including unilateral cerebellar hemispheric infarction, grade 3 intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, fungal sepsis, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary valve stenosis, lack of prenatal care, and poor social situation. Despite all these poor prognostic factors, she was close to meeting corrected-age-appropriate motor and cognitive milestones. The etiology and outcomes of cerebellar infarction in extremely premature neonates, and possible contributors to this child’s function, are discussed.</p>

<p>Cerebellar infarction is an increasingly recognized complication of extreme prematurity (&lt;28 weeks gestation).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811420873">1</xref></sup> Cerebellar injury may occur with or without the more common supratentorial lesions of prematurity, such as intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia. The cerebellum develops rapidly during the third trimester, but environmental factors can interfere with or stop that process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420873">2</xref></sup> Children who have a history of extreme prematurity with cerebellar infarction usually have severe motor and cognitive delay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811420873">3</xref></sup> This report presents a 20-month-old girl born at 24 weeks gestational age who had unilateral cerebellar hemispheric infarction and multiple other predictors of poor outcome, who nonetheless is close to meeting developmental milestones and does not show signs of cerebral palsy.</p>
<sec id="section2-0883073811420873">
<title>Case Report</title>
<p>This child was born at 24 weeks gestation to a G7P5 mother. Her mother received no prenatal care because she was unaware of the pregnancy; the child was delivered vaginally in a toilet at home. The mother denied any antenatal drug or medication exposure.</p>
<p>After delivery, the child was immediately taken to an outside hospital. Initial weight was 0.88 kg. Full details are not known due to a complicated social situation. She spent close to 4 months in the neonatal intensive care unit. She was given surfactant, intubated, and maintained on mechanical ventilation. She was hyperglycemic and received prophylactic antibiotics due to her delivery in a toilet. She had fungal sepsis with possible disseminated intravascular coagulation including low platelets, and required a transfusion of packed red blood cells. On day 3 of life, ultrasound imaging revealed a left-sided grade 3 intraventricular hemorrhage and probable left cerebellar hemorrhage. She was placed on phenobarbital after an abnormal electroencephalogram. Echocardiogram revealed moderate patent ductus arteriosus, and she was given indomethacin. She required pulmonary valvuloplasty at 3 months of age due to severe pulmonary stenosis.</p>
<p>She was twice admitted to our hospital for failure-to-thrive at 8 and 16 months of age. Weight, height, and head circumference were all well below the 3rd percentile when corrected for preterm birth. Video fluoroscopic studies demonstrated normal swallow. She gained at least 30 grams per day during each admission, suggesting nonorganic feeding dysfunction. Her family was mixing her formula at 16 kilocalories per ounce rather than the prescribed 24 kilocalories per ounce, the child regularly missed scheduled feeds, and the family missed multiple follow-up appointments. Child protective services placed her in foster care.</p>
<p>An electroencephalogram at 9 months was unremarkable, and phenobarbital was weaned off. A magnetic resonance image of the brain at 17 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811420873">Figure 1</xref>) revealed near-complete absence of the left cerebellar hemisphere with damage to the left vermis, but the left middle cerebellar peduncle was present. She also had bilateral cerebral white matter volume loss (left side greater than right side) and periatrial gliosis, consistent with periventricular leukomalacia. Prothrombotic workup revealed mild protein C deficiency and heterozygosity for the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T gene variant, but was otherwise unremarkable.</p>

<p>At 20 months old (16 months corrected), the child’s foster mother reported that she used 4 words specifically, and was trying to stand alone. On exam, height, weight, and head circumference were all below the 3rd percentile, with head circumference further below the 3rd percentile than height or weight. She waved “hi” and “bye,” made good eye contact, pointed to objects, and played well with her foster-sister. She displayed appropriate stranger anxiety. She tracked a toy well in all directions with 1 to 2 beats of nystagmus bilaterally at the extreme limits of gaze. She moved all 4 extremities well and had mild hypotonia. She reached well for a toy with both the left and right hand with no evidence of dysmetria, sat unsupported, pulled to stand, and walked holding on to furniture. She had slightly brisk reflexes bilaterally in her biceps and knees, 2 to 3 beats of clonus in right ankle, and 1 beat of clonus in her left ankle.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The increasing use of MRI in neonates has increased awareness of the neurological complications of prematurity. Intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia have been recognized for decades, but cerebellar infarctions in extremely premature neonates have become more recognized in the past 15 years. As awareness of cerebellar stroke in premature neonates has grown, so has recognition of the long-term outcomes, which are usually poor.</p>
<p>The etiology of cerebellar infarction in the premature newborn may be multifactorial. Mechanical ventilation or a large patent ductus arteriosus may contribute to impaired cerebral blood flow regulation. Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic events, systemic hypotension due to sepsis or other triggers, focal vaso-occlusive events, and generalized ischemia can result in decreased cerebellar perfusion. Rapid reperfusion may induce hemorrhage. Coagulation disorders and thrombocytopenia are other potential contributors to cerebellar stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420873">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811420873">3</xref></sup> The child in this report had prolonged mechanical ventilation, patent ductus arteriosus, sepsis, and low platelets due to possible disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. However, it is unclear if she had primary cerebellar hemorrhage or hemorrhage secondary to an initial ischemic event.</p>
<p>Cerebellar infarction in extremely premature neonates can affect 1 or both cerebellar hemispheres. Mercuri and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420873">4</xref></sup> found evidence of cerebellar lesions in magnetic resonance imaging studies of 10/73 (8.2%) extremely preterm children. Six had unilateral, hemispheric infarction, 3 had moderate unilateral atrophy, and 1 had severe bilateral atrophy. The inferior vermis was damaged in 5. The infarcts appeared to be in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory.</p>
<p>Cerebellar insults are associated with impairments in motor planning, coordinated movement, and postural stability. Damage to the lateral regions of the cerebellar hemispheres may result in ipsilateral ataxia and myoclonus. Damage to the medial regions of the cerebellum affects truncal stability. The inferior vermis and flocculonodular lobes coordinate eye movement, and disruption of these regions may result in nystagmus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811420873">5</xref></sup> Bodensteiner and Johnsen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811420873">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811420873"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811420873">8</xref></sup> were the initial investigators to report that extremely preterm infants with cerebellar insult had “mixed” cerebral palsy, with elements of spasticity, ataxia, and/or dystonia. Messerschmidt and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811420873">9</xref></sup> evaluated 31 children with perinatal cerebellar insult who were 24 to 36 months of age. All had cerebral palsy, 15 (48%) had the severe, “mixed” form. Mercuri and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420873">4</xref></sup> also found that all premature children in their cohort with cerebellar infarction or atrophy had motor impairments, including ataxia (40%), hemiplegia (30%), and quadriplegia (10%). The child in this report tracked a toy well, and had only mild nystagmus at extremes of gaze. She had mild hypotonia and brisk reflexes, but did not show impaired movement or balance consistent with cerebral palsy.</p>
<p>The cerebellum is also involved in general cognition, language, and social behaviors. Limperopoulos and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811420873">10</xref></sup> compared severely preterm children with and without cerebellar hemorrhage at a mean age of 31.5 months. Children with isolated cerebellar hemorrhage had a greater incidence of impaired cognitive performance (40% vs 0%), receptive language deficit (37% vs 0%), expressive language deficit (42% vs 0%), and internalizing behaviors such as social withdrawal (34% vs 9%). Abnormality of the vermis was associated with autistic traits, consistent with previous research suggesting this portion of the cerebellum plays a role in autism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811420873">11</xref></sup> The girl in this report used 4 words (suggesting mild expressive language delay), and showed no evidence of autistic behavior, despite severe hemisphere and vermis injury.</p>
<p>The child’s better-than-expected function suggests neuronal plasticity. However, while cerebellar reorganization in response to perinatal cerebral injury has been demonstrated in children, little is known about cerebellar or cerebral response to cerebellar injury in premature neonates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811420873">12</xref></sup> The child’s changed environment also likely contributed. Long-term enrollment in parent-child early intervention programs results in improved developmental outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811420873">13</xref></sup> The child in this report began receiving state-provided early intervention therapies as an infant and was placed in a more nurturing home environment at 16 months of age.</p>
<p>In some extremely premature children, missing cerebellar hemispheres may be due to disrupted development between 20 and 40 weeks gestation rather than infarction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420873">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811420873">14</xref></sup> However, this child appears to have had infarction of existing cerebellar tissue with either primary or secondary hemorrhage. The initial ultrasound at 3 days of age suggested left cerebellar hemorrhage, and magnetic resonance imaging showed a left middle cerebellar peduncle, suggesting the left cerebellar hemisphere was present during development. She may have had additional cerebellar developmental arrest secondary to the initial injury.</p>
<p>At 20 months old (16 months corrected), the child in this report is achieving almost age-appropriate motor and cognitive milestones, and does not show any signs of autistic behavior. More research on neuroplasticity after cerebellar infarction in the extremely premature child is necessary. As the factors affecting long-term outcomes of cerebellar insults in extremely premature infants become clearer, better perinatal interventions and therapies may improve the overall neurodevelopmental outcome of these children.</p>
