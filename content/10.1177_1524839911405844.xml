<abstract>
<p>To support successful and inclusive community organizing for childhood obesity prevention, this research identified stakeholder perspectives on what communities should do to prevent childhood obesity. It employed factor analysis on statement sorts (Q methodology) conducted by 95 people in an upstate New York community. These participants sorted 36 statements about the issue by how much he or she agreed or disagreed with each. Participants were recruited through strategic snowball sampling to sample a variety of perspectives. The four resulting factors, or perspectives, were interpreted in the context of presort demographic surveys and postsort interviews. This research found one stance that fits the environmental perspective common in public health. The other three factors indicate important variations among perspectives centered on individual responsibility, ranging from libertarian to technocratic views. However, overall, results revealed a substantial degree of agreement among the four perspectives, including on providing access to family activities and on making fruits and vegetables more available and affordable, for example, through subsidies. This article points to common ground for community action on childhood obesity prevention, highlights areas likely to generate considerable contention, and shows whose views are not being accounted for in, at least, this community’s childhood obesity prevention project.</p>

<body>
<p>Childhood obesity, with its concomitant health problems, arguably presents the biggest U.S. public health issue of our time. Debate about causes and solutions has flourished over the past decade. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839911405844">Institute of Medicine (2004)</xref> has argued that “prevention of obesity in children and youth is, ultimately, about <italic>community</italic>” (p. 193), and dozens of communities have launched childhood obesity prevention projects. This begs several questions, including what <italic>are</italic> communities doing and what do members of those communities think they <italic>should</italic> be doing? This article begins to answer that last question in one upstate New York county. The question is important for practical reasons (to minimize oppositional politics) and normative reasons (there are significant community values at stake).</p>
<p>Published work to date on what community members believe about the importance, causes and prevention of childhood obesity has used surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839911405844">C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839911405844">Evans, Finkelstein, Kamerow, &amp; Renaud, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839911405844">Hardus, van Vuuren, Crawford, &amp; Worsley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839911405844">Potestio, McLaren, Vollman, &amp; Doyle-Baker, 2008</xref>) or interviews and focus groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839911405844">Hesketh, Waters, Green, Salmon, &amp; Williams, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839911405844">Pagnini, King, Booth, Wilkenfeld, &amp; Booth, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839911405844">Pearce et al., 2009</xref>). Often, the aim is to identify what public health prevention strategies citizens might find acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839911405844">Evans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839911405844">Hardus et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839911405844">Pagnini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839911405844">Potestio et al., 2008</xref>). For example, one study found that Americans “supported most school-, community-, and media-based strategies that involved offering health information, limiting unhealthy food promotion, and increasing healthy nutrition and physical activity choices, but were generally opposed to regulatory and tax- or cost-based interventions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839911405844">Evans et al., 2005</xref>, p. 26). Although such data provide a useful bellwether for national actions, a passionately opposed minority can block change even if most people support a particular approach. Surveys in particular reveal little about the opposition specific policies might face from citizens, such as eliminating chocolate milk in a school or banning food advertising during children’s television programming. Identifying acceptable public health strategies via surveys or interviews is perhaps further complicated by the findings of one survey revealing that “typical determinants of policy preferences, such as ideology or partisanship, are not good predictors of attitudes on obesity policy” among U.S. adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839911405844">Oliver &amp; Lee, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study circumvented some of these issues by using a statement-sorting method called Q methodology. This method explores the distinctive and overlapping perspectives on an issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839911405844">Clark, 2002</xref>) rather than describing the distribution of these perspectives within a population or categorizing them into preconceived groups. In contrast to previous survey research, which by design could reveal majority opinion but not areas of consensus, the present research identified potential common ground for community action, or at least arenas for unopposed action, for childhood obesity prevention. The methodology also avoids imposing any preconceived notions about perspectives on participants. Although a few studies have used Q methodology to examine perspectives on food-related health issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839911405844">Pelletier, McCullum, Kraak, &amp; Asher, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839911405844">Roberts, Struble, McCullum-Gomez, &amp; Wilkins, 2006</xref>) and health issues more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839911405844">Goto, Tiffany, Pelto, &amp; Pelletier, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839911405844">Stenner, Cooper, &amp; Skevington, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839911405844">Tielen, van Staa, Jedeloo, van Exel, &amp; Weimar, 2008</xref>), none have been published in the arena of obesity.</p>
<sec id="section1-1524839911405844" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This study used Q methodology, in combination with demographic surveys and structured interviews, to identify perspectives on the roles communities should play in preventing childhood obesity. Q methodology provides a semiquantitative and systematic way to study subjectivity, or the views and feelings, about an issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839911405844">Brown, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839911405844">Stephenson, 1968</xref>). Participants sort statements about an issue according to how much they agree or disagree with each. Factor analysis is then used to group these sorts. Interpretation of resulting factors reveals perspectives on the issue and permits detailed analysis of areas of relative agreement. Q factor analysis identifies subgroups of <italic>people</italic> based on the correlations among their sorts rather than, as in more commonly used Pearson’s <italic>R</italic> factor analysis, forming factors based on correlations among people’s <italic>traits</italic>. Unlike <italic>R</italic>, Q does not assume that participating individuals share a conceptual structure.</p>
<sec id="section2-1524839911405844">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The research team used strategic snowball sampling to invite individuals in one upstate New York county to participate, starting with contacts from the research team (composed of the authors, two community members, and 14 university students) and following up on selected participant referrals to achieve sample diversity (e.g., in geography, employment, race, and political party). We also oversampled two demographic groups: high school students (because we felt their views were underrepresented in local work in this area) and members of the local childhood obesity prevention project (because their views were driving the local obesity prevention agenda and, thus, of greater political and practical importance locally).</p>
<p>Of the 157 invited to participate, 99 people took the survey and conducted the Q methodology statement sort (a 63% participation rate). Where time allowed, participants were invited to participate in postsort interviews. Of 59 asked, 54 agreed (91% participation). After four sort exclusions because of incomplete sorts or extensive inconsistencies, the survey and sort analysis included 95 participants (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839911405844">Table 1</xref>). All interviews were included in qualitative analysis.</p>

<title>Data Gathering</title>
<p>Q methodology has four steps: development of the statement set, statement sorts by participants, factor analysis of the sorts, and factor interpretation. This research also included a presort demographic survey and structured postsort interviews.</p>
<sec id="section4-1524839911405844">
<title>Creating the Q-sort statements</title>
<p>The statements for sorting in a Q study should represent the range of social views held on the research question, ideally originating from actual discourse on the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839911405844">Brown, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839911405844">Watts &amp; Stenner, 2005</xref>). Sources for the 36 statements used in this study included discussion forums, interviews quoted in academic literature, and 40 local stakeholder interviews. This “natural” language usually results in statements that are more complex than survey questions. For example, one statement was “the decision about what types of food to eat is a personal choice. Schools and youth centers should not restrict the availability of certain foods just because they are considered less healthy.” Internal assessments and pilot tests with 12 participants confirmed the statement set was balanced. Only one of the 99 participants mentioned feeling that the statement set constrained expression of her perspective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524839911405844">
<title>Presort demographic survey</title>
<p>All participants filled out a 17-question survey before the sort, measuring demographic variables and asking participants to rank the importance of and responsibility for childhood obesity prevention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524839911405844">
<title>Conducting Q sorts</title>
<p>Participants were asked to sort the 36 statements into a quasinormal distribution according to how much they agreed or disagreed with each statement. Unlike a survey, participants ranked each statement in relation to the others into one of five “buckets,” from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to <italic>strongly agree</italic>. On the sort grid’s 5-point scale, only 4 statements could be placed in each of the <italic>strongly agree</italic> (+2) and <italic>strongly disagree</italic> (−2) extremes. The agree (+1) and disagree (−1) slots accommodated 8 statements each. The remaining 12 spaces were in the middle (0). The forced distribution is not a statistical requirement but a means of pushing participants to prioritize, as opposed to a survey that would allow, for example, agreement with every statement. This prioritization demands more thought and granularity in the views participants indicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839911405844">Brown, 1980</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1524839911405844">
<title>Postsort interviews</title>
<p>Following their sorts, 54 of the adults participated in a short structured interview (teens participated during class time, leaving no time for interviews). Participants selected six statements to comment on and then were asked to give feedback on the sorting process overall. Interviewers provided transcriptions to the authors with research notes reflecting on the process.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1524839911405844">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Analysis began with reading each interview transcript twice. Then the 95 sorts were entered into PQMethod statistical software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839911405844">Schmolck, 2002</xref>) and subjected to centroid factor analysis (because the goal was to identify viewpoints and their overlaps, where applicable) with one varimax rotation.</p>
<p>The four resulting factors were interpreted to characterize the perspective that each revealed. First, “idealized” sorts for each perspective were generated by ordering statements by their <italic>z</italic> scores and analyzed for their “gestalt” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839911405844">Watts &amp; Stenner, 2005</xref>). Then interviews were reread in the context of each interviewee’s sort correlations with the factors. Finally, survey results were tabulated for those who positively defined the four perspectives. For each survey question, group-level chi-square tests were conducted to compare the distribution of characteristics across the four perspectives with the expected distribution at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1524839911405844" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Factor analysis of the sorts identified four perspectives on what communities should do to prevent childhood obesity. One group took a “system” view commonly found in public health, and three focused more on individual responsibility. We called the groups holding these views Environmentalists, Libertarians, Technocrats, and Bootstrappers.</p>
<p>Of the 95 people included in this analysis, 78 defined (i.e., were significantly correlated with) one of these four groups. Of course, these four groups are idealized. No sort correlated fully with one view (greatest was <italic>r</italic> = .91). Most participant sorts (72%) positively correlated reasonably well (<italic>r</italic> &gt; .2) with at least two factors. The four factors identified explain 46% of the variation in the sorts that defined them.</p>
<p>The following sections describe each perspective based on the normalized rank scores of statements in each factor and on interviews with an author-coined descriptive name for each perspective. The correlations shown in parentheses identify how well sorts done by participants quoted here correlated with the factor being discussed. Any differences on survey responses are also mentioned.</p>
<sec id="section10-1524839911405844">
<title>Four Perspectives</title>
<sec id="section11-1524839911405844">
<title>Environmentalists</title>
<p>Environmentalists took a public health perspective on childhood obesity prevention, focusing on how surrounding environments and systems influence and constrain family behaviors. They viewed childhood obesity as not only a food and activity issue but one related to inequity. They believed it is unfair to expect struggling families to have the energy and determination it takes to eat well. Accordingly, they favored community organizing approaches to childhood obesity prevention, such as lengthening school lunch periods and integrating food into the school day, lobbying for fruit and vegetable subsidies, and providing family cooking courses, bulk-buying clubs, and community gardens.</p>
<p>Although Environmentalists believed that parents need to take some responsibility (agreeing with a statement that said, “Parents must take responsibility for setting a good example by eating well themselves”), they disagreed with statements that put that responsibility exclusively on parents’ shoulders. As one person in this group (<italic>r</italic> = .59) said, specifically about the statement partly quoted above, “I don’t agree with the implications of the statement that parents actually have the <italic>ability</italic> to take responsibility.” Another (<italic>r</italic> = .74) noted that “my views really center on economic equity, education, and local action. Those are kind of my values.” A third (<italic>r</italic> = .78) provided the name for this group with this comment:
<disp-quote>
<p>A lot of issues that people might think are private issues are actually public health issues . . . Given that it’s harder to get fruits and vegetables [and] harder to exercise in poor neighborhoods, it’s not a personal choice, it’s an environmental choice.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the survey, nearly all of the 37 Environmentalists ranked community childhood obesity prevention as very important. Out of the 17 research participants who were also part of a community childhood obesity prevention effort, 16 defined the Environmentalist group. Of the 21 high school students who defined factors, none were Environmentalists, and one actually defined this factor negatively (<italic>r</italic> = −.59), meaning that person held extreme feelings on the same statements as the others in this factor but in the opposite direction. This teen was the only research participant to negatively define a factor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1524839911405844">
<title>Libertarians</title>
<p>The Libertarians strongly favored individual responsibility, feeling that prevention is more about personal accountability than about community efforts. They did not like any policy suggestions that included mandates, restrictions, or taxes. However, they favored free opportunities for family physical activity and, more than any other factor, improvement of access to fruits and vegetables through subsidies.</p>
<p>This was the only group to agree that protecting individual freedoms and keeping taxes low are more important than preventing childhood obesity and that schools and youth centers should not restrict the availability of certain foods just because they are considered less healthy. Although this group’s agreement with these two statements was not particularly strong, it contrasted sharply with often fervent disagreement from those defining the other three factors.</p>
<p>Of the 11 Libertarians, 10 were high school students. The teens in this group ranked community childhood obesity prevention as only somewhat important (<italic>n</italic> = 9) or not important (<italic>n</italic> = 1). Unfortunately, no interviews were conducted with the people defining this factor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1524839911405844">
<title>Technocrats</title>
<p>Like the Libertarians, the Technocrats put prevention responsibility on parents’ shoulders. However, they also favored the “hard” policy approaches that Libertarians rejected, including being the only group to support a junk food tax. The Technocrats stood alone in disliking “softer” statements about nurturing child self-esteem and offering longer lunch periods.</p>
<p>This comment from someone defining this group (<italic>r</italic> = .34) represents the technical, goal-oriented stance on childhood obesity prevention that was held by Technocrats:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s regulated as far as how the food’s grown so why shouldn’t it be regulated as far as what foods they’re allowed to offer the public? Because it’s going to be us paying for it in the long run if people are eating a lot of unhealthy things. It’s going to affect their overall health and put stress on the health system and Medicaid.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Though group-level differences for political party did not reach significance (<italic>p</italic> = .10), this group had more Republicans than the others. Of the 10 Technocrats, 9 ranked the issue as very important and one as somewhat important for communities to address.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1524839911405844">
<title>Bootstrappers</title>
<p>The self-reliance advocated by this group inspired a moniker from the “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” saying. The Bootstrappers held that, however challenging feeding children healthy foods might be, it is within a parent’s responsibility and capacity to do so. They were the only group to agree that “all parents have the capacity to keep their children from becoming obese. Parents have to take responsibly first and foremost, and community efforts won’t help much until and unless parents make this a priority” and the only one to disagree with a statement opening with: “It’s not fair to expect struggling families to have the energy and determination it takes to eat well.” Also, although not opposing systemic approaches to supporting healthy eating and activity—such as fruit and vegetable subsidies, equitable economic development, and free physical activities—this group also did not support them as much as the others. Bootstrappers instead preferred education approaches.</p>
<p>These comments from a “Boostrapper” (<italic>r</italic> = .70) characterize this group’s perspective:
<disp-quote>
<p>If you take your kids to a fast food restaurant . . . you can make them eat the healthy stuff. And if they go out with friends to those places, you can say “You’re forbidden to eat that garbage.” That’s all you got to do. It’s as simple as that . . . Taxing junk foods? I strongly disagree. People should be smart enough to figure out that if they eat a bag of chips everyday, they’re going to get overweight and it’s not good for them. And if they can’t figure it out then that’s their choice . . . The only way you’re going to change it is by trying to educate people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Demographically, the 19 Bootstrappers may have been more likely than the other groups to be male (<italic>p</italic> = .13) and to earn household incomes more than $120,000 per annum (<italic>p</italic> = .06). Their ratings of the issue’s importance varied more than other groups, with 7 saying community prevention is somewhat important, 10 that it is very important, and 2 that it is the most important health issue communities need to address.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Statistically speaking, there was little consensus among the four perspectives. The Environmentalist and Libertarian views in particular had little overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524839911405844">Figure 1</xref>). However, ideologically and practically speaking, this research shows extensive potential common ground for childhood obesity prevention action in three ways.</p>

<caption><p>Conceptual Map of Factor Relationships and Their Correlations</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1524839911405844-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>First, the four perspectives are actually quite close together in comparison to possible ideological space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524839911405844">Figure 1</xref>). Interfactor correlations ranged from 0 to .49, with a notable absence of negative correlations. The statements that any one group placed at the extremes of the sort grid, the others tended to place in the middle sort columns. This shows that although these perspectives may not always agree, they also do not often actively <italic>dis</italic>agree.</p>
<p>Second, the individual-level results indicate great potential for agreement. Looking at the factor loadings for each of the 95 participants, of the 380 correlations (95 people × 4 factors), only 18% were negative, and the average negative correlation was only −.11. More than 40% of participants correlated positively, even if only slightly, with all four factors. The average positive correlation was .30. Only one person negatively defined a factor.</p>
<p>Third, negotiation and agreement are qualitative processes. Statistical difference does not necessarily translate to actual disagreement. For example, factor <italic>z</italic> scores for a statement advocating fruits and vegetable subsidies ranged from 1.63 (Libertarians) to −0.15 (Bootstrappers), with Technocrats and Environmentalists near 1. A Bootstrapper would be unlikely to protest a move for such advocacy in a community effort, even if she or he did not join the effort herself or himself. A Bootstrapper would, however, likely resist junk food taxes (relevant statement <italic>z</italic> score = −1.27) or advertising bans (<italic>z</italic> score = −1.27). Even among the two groups with the least correlation, Environmentalists and Libertarians, both groups agreed (i.e., had positive <italic>z</italic> scores) that communities should provide free family activity opportunities, provide more than 20 minutes for school lunch, organize fruits and vegetables for food pantries, pay attention to child self-esteem, lobby to subsidize fruits and vegetables, and strive for successful and equitable local economies.</p>

<title>Uncontested and Contested Prevention Strategies</title>
<p>Approaches to community childhood obesity prevention summarized in the uncontested strategies column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524839911405844">Table 2</xref> garnered strong support from at least two perspectives and faced no opposition. Also, temporarily setting the teenaged Libertarian perspective aside, the other three groups all felt strongly that individual freedoms and low taxes are <italic>not</italic> more important than childhood obesity prevention and that schools and youth centers should restrict foods available for health reasons. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524839911405844">Table 2</xref> also lists the most contested prevention strategies among the four perspectives. Perhaps the most telling difference on the “systemic” versus “individualist” split between Environmentalists and the other perspectives was that although all groups agreed communities can and should work to prevent childhood obesity, all but the Environmentalists agreed with a statement ending “this is more about personal accountability than community childhood obesity prevention efforts.”</p>

<p>NOTE: “Uncontested” strategies are listed from most to least agreed. The “contested” list begins with strategies drawing the most disagreement. To account for overall and comparative strength of agreement, relative agreement/disagreement was calculated as the absolute value of each statement’s average <italic>z</italic> score across four factors minus the <italic>z</italic> score spread. Also, only statements with at least one group expressing strong views, that is, &gt;|1| are included, since these would be more likely to have advocates/opponents among those holding these perspectives.</p>

<p>Also, the four perspectives were in almost perfect agreement (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .99) on survey ranking questions about <italic>why</italic> we should prevent childhood obesity (for child health, then happiness, then reducing costs), <italic>what</italic> to measure (eating and activity, with obesity rates vs. equitable access to healthy food and activity vying for second place, followed by environmental change then community development), and <italic>who</italic> “can and should do the most” (families, then local institutions and governments, with state and federal governments and the private sector trailing).</p>

<title>Implications and Conclusions</title>

<title>Community action for access</title>
<p>The common ground views found here support improving families’ access to healthy food and activity, with tolerance or support for restricting food in schools and youth centers. Strategies to ban or tax unhealthy options garnered strong opposition from at least two groups.</p>
<p>Within the school food environment, there appears to be a “cupcake line” that would be crossed at peril. This was indicated not only by <italic>z</italic> score splits on a statement advocating a school ban on all junk foods, including at bake sales, but also by comments about that statement. For example, one Environmentalist (<italic>r</italic> = .60) commented, “Let’s not turn into food Nazis!” Another person (whose sort correlated at <italic>r</italic> = .30-.50 with all but the Libertarian factor) cautioned, “We have to be careful we’re not being super food police, never having a cupcake cross the door is a little bit extreme.”</p>
<p>Following the positive and asset-based strategies advocated in community development practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839911405844">Kretzmann &amp; McKnight, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839911405844">Minkler, 2005</xref>) appears to be a promising guide to achieving consensus on community action for childhood obesity prevention.</p>

<title>Participation, negotiation, and discussion</title>
<p>A democratic ethic demands that stakeholders have the opportunity and support needed to substantively negotiate policy decisions that affect them. Applying this ethic offers practical benefits as well, because even a small group of opponents can derail policy changes if they are well organized. In addition to mapping agreed areas for action, this research raises three important democratic action issues for, at a minimum, the childhood obesity prevention project in the community where this research was conducted.</p>
<list id="list1-1524839911405844" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>One, account for non-Environmentalist views in “community-based” childhood obesity prevention work</italic>: The most active participants in this community’s childhood obesity prevention project overwhelmingly held Environmentalist views. This research suggests a need to become aware of other viewpoints in the community and seek common ground with people that hold those views, even if they are not active project participants.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Two, include children, youth, and teens</italic>: The 29 high school senior participants ranked community childhood obesity prevention radically lower in priority than the adults did, with 66% ranking it as somewhat or not important, compared with 91% of adults ranking it either as very important or more important than any other health issue. Twelve of these teens were enrolled in a special program for those interested in health professions; although this subgroup rated it as more important than their peers, this still fell far short of the adult rankings. High school students also defined the Libertarian factor and were entirely absent from the Environmental one. Yet, of course, children and teens arguably are the single most important stakeholder in this issue. These teenagers are unlikely to want to get involved in an obesity prevention project per se but might be drawn by specific initiatives such as gardening, developing activity opportunities, and improving fruit and vegetable access. For example, youth have been key partners in a number of community-based food, fitness, and health initiatives (The Food Project [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://thefoodproject.org/">http://thefoodproject.org/</ext-link>]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839911405844">Nuestras Raíces, 2008</xref>; wereFedUp youth leaders [www.werefedup.com]) to improve the nutritional quality of school foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839911405844">Coleman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839911405844">Goldberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839911405844">Harris et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839911405844">Wojcicki &amp; Heyman, 2006</xref>). Also, youth deliberations with adults can provide important mentoring and enable both age-groups to become more informed, appropriate, engaged, and effective citizens.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Three, facilitate informed public discussion and debate</italic>: Obesity is perhaps the most complex public health issue we face, without clear links to any one gene, vector, practice, or product. Prevention is intertwined with issues that are deeply complex in their own right, from parenting to pollution to agricultural policy. Calls for evidence-based strategies in community childhood obesity prevention ring hollow in the face of inadequate evidence about what actions work best at this level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839911405844">Doak, Visscher, Renders, &amp; Seidell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839911405844">Dunton, Kaplan, Wolch, Jerrett, &amp; Reynolds, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839911405844">Institute of Medicine, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839911405844">Kirk, Penney, &amp; McHugh, 2009</xref>). The evidence-based narrative is further challenged by reliance on mobilizing community volunteers to address issues like childhood obesity, because this mobilization must also build on volunteer passions, beliefs, and priorities. Yet high obesity rates, inequity in these rates, and their toll on well-being demand effective action. Citizen values, beliefs, and priorities can, should, and do affect what is possible in community-based childhood obesity prevention. Participants shared rich and complex beliefs and values about these issues in interviews. Some participants and other community members who joined e-mail or face-to-face forums about these results reported that this research provided a welcome opportunity to think more deeply about these issues. Further informed dialogue can help shape these beliefs and values and create a foundation for negotiating appropriate community actions.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In sum, the relative absence of polarized viewpoints points to several promising areas for community action. These include providing and promoting access to free family activities and developing policies to make fruits and vegetables more available and affordable. At the same time, the differences require attention. These differences include but also transcend rudimentary frames of individual responsibility versus social responsibility for health. This research highlights important distinctions within individual views on what would constitute acceptable action as well as overlaps with environmental perspectives. Finally, at least in this upstate New York community, local childhood obesity prevention actors should take special care to incorporate the views and priorities of youth and of people holding non-Environmentalist perspectives in their project’s actions.</p>
