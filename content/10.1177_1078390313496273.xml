<p>The American Psychiatric Nurses Association (APNA) position paper titled, “Competency-Based Training for Nurse Generalists: Inpatient Intervention and Prevention of Suicide,” addresses an urgent need in the comprehensive treatment of people with suicidal tendencies and behaviors. The inpatient setting is the genesis of many people’s treatment after suicidal crisis, yet suicide risk is universally overlooked in the spectrum of recovery-based interventions.</p>
<p>I offer the unique perspective of being a person with many of the risk factors for suicide: serious mental illness, posttraumatic stress disorder, a military veteran, severe childhood abuse, three maximum-security psychiatric hospitalizations, and in long-term recovery from addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390313496273">Van Orden et al., 2010</xref>). I am also a national behavioral health advocate with numerous <italic>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</italic> awards, a suicide prevention trainer, an adjunct instructor with a faculty appointment in the Department of Psychiatry at a medical school, and a published author. I have also survived two suicide attempts: one on an inpatient unit and the other immediately after release from an inpatient unit. It is from this myriad viewpoint that I beseech the full support of this initiative of the APNA to address this deficiency in the current competencies of generalist psychiatric nurses.</p>
<p>The psychiatric nurse dominates the milieu of the inpatient setting. The nurse is the only constant in a world of perpetual flux and interchangeable mental health professionals. With the psychiatric nurse having “24 hour accountability for the care and safety” (APNA Position Paper) of the residents on the inpatient unit, no other medical professional is in a more appropriate role to assess the risk of suicidal behavior on the inpatient unit. APNA’s focus on inpatient experience shows that the hospital should not be just housing, and the psychiatric nurses have the unique ability due to the scope of their practice to create a connection with a hospitalized patient to destabilize the perception that one must commit suicide before the belief becomes “stable and permanent” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390313496273">Joiner et al., 2007</xref>). The generalist psychiatric nurses have the opportunity due to their constant interaction and monitoring of the patient to interweave a thorough risk assessment of suicide into the “connection and flow” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390313496273">Joiner et al., 2007</xref>) of their occupational activities.</p>
<p>In my numerous stays on inpatient units, I learned to avoid the staff, fear the staff, and lie to the staff. Every discussion was centered on my problem, my symptoms, my need to change my entire life. While you are concerned with my illness, I am concerned with only one thing: Release. Only the psychiatric nurse showed me compassion on the locked unit. While held in restraints for more than 24 hours begging to die, a psychiatric nurse wiped my face and wrists and talked to me for a few minutes. Connected with me. They let me know I was not alone . . . that I was still alive.</p>
<p>After the restraints, I prepared to end my life on the locked unit by throwing myself through a window. The thought of death became an absolute. Silently, I raged to die. Alfred Alavarez, an author and suicide attempt survivor, described this peculiar mindset. Alavarez stated that “the logic of suicide is different. It is the unanswerable logic of a nightmare” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390313496273">Miller, 1992</xref>). The generalist psychiatric nurse is in the most appropriate role to address and interrupt this “logic of a nightmare” before I am released. Before I am convinced that my perceptions are correct, innate, a fact.</p>
<p>On release from the hospital with these concrete ideas of despair, self-hate, and burdensomeness, I stepped off the rocks of a jetty into the winter waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Beyond the reach of the caring hand of the psychiatric nurse, beyond hope, beyond reason, I plunged deep into the swirling gray waves. Only by serendipity and the swell of the frozen tide was I washed back onto the rocks shocked at my actions and unsure of my mortality.</p>
<p>The need for APNA to step forward and take the lead in developing competencies for generalist psychiatric nurses to assess suicidal risk is paramount to create more effective nurses and better outcomes for one of the highest at-risk groups for suicidal actions. The systematic review of the literature in the policy paper shows that “inpatient psychiatric patients are at high risk for suicide; and discharge from a psychiatric inpatient unit is strongly associated with death by suicide” (APNA Position Paper).</p>
<p>As a national advocate for the people with behavioral health issues, I see this as an urgent public health issue that needs immediate redress. Selfishly, as a person that lives with these issues in their recovery and the father of a young daughter, these competencies may someday save my own life.</p>
