<sec id="section1-0363546512445273">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Anatomic reconstruction of the coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments has become a popular surgical treatment for high-grade acromioclavicular (AC) dislocations, but little has been reported about complications related to these newer surgical techniques.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512445273">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>We sought to review the complications related to several new techniques for the anatomic reconstruction of the CC ligaments for the treatment of AC separations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512445273">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512445273">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>We conducted a retrospective review of the operative treatment of AC separation utilizing anatomic reconstruction of the CC ligaments by reviewing the case logs of 3 fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeons at a single academic sports medicine center for the past 5 years using appropriate current procedural terminology codes. The medical records and postoperative radiographs were assessed for complications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512445273">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Twenty-seven cases of anatomic reconstruction of the CC ligaments were reviewed. All patients had an autograft or allograft ligament reconstruction utilizing either a coracoid tunnel (10 cases) or a loop around the coracoid base (17 cases). Eight complications (80%) were noted in the coracoid tunnel group including 2 coracoid fractures (20%), 5 patients with some loss of reduction (more than 5-mm increased CC interval displacement on subsequent postoperative radiographs) (50%), and 1 patient with an intraoperative failure of the coracoid button fixation (10%). Six patients developed complications in the coracoid loop group (35%) including 3 clavicle fractures (18% within group, 11% overall), 1 patient with loss of reduction (6%), 1 patient with loss of reduction and an infection (6% within group, 4% overall), and 1 patient with adhesive capsulitis postoperatively (6% within group, 4% overall).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512445273">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Newer techniques for the anatomic reconstruction of the CC ligaments may have steep learning curves associated with complications such as coracoid and clavicle fractures. Loss of reduction continues to be associated with the operative treatment of high-grade AC separations. Further refinement of surgical technique and experience with the operative treatment of AC separation is warranted.</p>

<p>Injuries to the acromioclavicular (AC) joint are extremely common and make up 0% to 12% of all shoulder girdle injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512445273">16</xref></sup> Many of these injuries are partial or incomplete injuries and can be treated nonoperatively. Older operative techniques for maintaining reduction of the dislocated AC complex were complicated most commonly by hardware migration of smooth pins. These pins have been reported to migrate into the lung, spinal canal, carotid sheath, subclavian artery, and aorta.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512445273">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512445273">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512445273">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512445273">25</xref></sup> Loss of reduction was also a common complication and was associated with decreased patient satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512445273">19</xref></sup> Other unique complications to AC reconstructions include erosion of cerclage material through either the clavicle or coracoid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512445273">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512445273">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512445273">12</xref></sup> Fractures of the coracoid have been described with older techniques for coracoclavicular (CC) screw fixation, and fractures of the clavicle have been reported with newer techniques for anatomic CC ligament reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512445273">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512445273">27</xref></sup> In addition, new techniques involve drill holes through the coracoid for graft placement and fixation and introduce a potential new source of complications as these tunnels can lead to fracture or cutout. Fractures at the base of the coracoid involving this drill site have been observed, but the frequency of this complication has not been previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512445273">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>As newer techniques and technologies are developed to help better re-create an anatomic reconstruction of the dislocated AC complex, it is important to analyze new complications that may develop. Several new studies have compared anatomic reconstruction techniques biomechanically, and a single study has compared anatomic reconstruction techniques using artificial ligaments and Dacron vascular prostheses clinically, but we are not aware of any clinical studies comparing anatomic reconstruction techniques using autografts or allografts and reporting their complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512445273">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512445273">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512445273">29</xref></sup></p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>We retrospectively reviewed the operative treatment of AC dislocations with CC reconstruction over a 5-year period (July 2005 to August 2010) at our academic sports medicine center by 3 fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeons. Specifically, the case logs were examined for the following current procedural terminology (CPT) codes: 23550, open treatment of acromioclavicular dislocation, acute or chronic; and 23552, open treatment of acromioclavicular dislocation, acute or chronic, with fascial graft. This study was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Virginia.</p>
<p>Each operative report was then reviewed as to whether a repair or reconstruction technique was used. In terms of reconstruction technique, we noted whether a Weaver-Dunn–type nonanatomic reconstruction or a newer anatomic reconstruction of CC ligaments was performed. Further examination of the anatomic CC ligament reconstruction technique was subdivided into those utilizing 2 clavicular tunnels with a loop of graft around the coracoid base (coracoid loop technique) or those utilizing a single clavicular tunnel and a coracoid process tunnel with button fixation under the coracoid and tenodesis screw and washer fixation (GraftRope, Arthrex, Naples, Florida) over the clavicle (coracoid tunnel technique). The use of autograft or allograft tendon tissue for reconstruction was also noted.</p>
<p>The postoperative imaging and medical records were reviewed for each case specifically comparing the incidence of complications in the groups of anatomic CC ligament reconstruction subdivided into a coracoid loop technique cohort and a coracoid tunnel technique cohort. Complications included loss of reduction measured on radiographs as more than 5-mm increased CC interval displacement on subsequent postoperative radiographs, return to the operating room, infection, arthrofibrosis of the glenohumeral joint, and fracture of the clavicle or coracoid. Additional information gathered from the medical record and radiographs included age, sex of patient, cause of injury, acute or chronic nature of the AC separation (&gt;3 months from time of injury until reconstruction was defined as chronic), and length of clinical and radiographic follow-up.</p>
<p>Surgical technique did vary between the 3 surgeons involved depending on arthroscopically assisted versus open technique and coracoid tunnel versus coracoid loop technique along with differences in graft selection and fixation methods. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512445273">Table 1</xref> contains additional patient-specific technique modifications that may have varied between cases including type of graft, size and number of tunnels, additional suture fixation, whether the reconstruction was attempted arthroscopically or with an open technique, in addition to demographic and patient follow-up data.</p>

<p>When an arthroscopically assisted approach was used, standard diagnostic arthroscopy was performed with the patient in the beach-chair position. After any intra-articular injury was addressed, the rotator interval was developed and cleared of soft tissue using a radiofrequency ablation device to allow visualization of the coracoid. Once the coracoid was adequately visualized and the coracoid tunnel technique was utilized, a separate skin incision was made approximately 3.5 cm medial to the AC joint for drill placement. The drill guide was then introduced through the anterosuperior arthroscopic portal and directed to a location centrally below the coracoid. The guide pin was then drilled through the coracoid in a standard fashion and then overdrilled with the appropriately sized reamer. One or 2 tunnels were then placed in the clavicle. Specific recommendations for tunnel placement based on early experience included minimizing the clavicle tunnel diameter, allowing at least 20 to 25 mm between clavicle tunnels, and allowing at least 10 to 15 mm between the lateral tunnel and the lateral edge of the clavicle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512445273">5</xref></sup> The graft, which had been prepared on the back table, with the flip-type cortical button was then passed through the tunnels and flipped after appropriate tension and while directly visualizing the button placement arthroscopically. The AC joint was then appropriately reduced, and the graft was tensioned with the washer brought down to the dorsal clavicle. A biotenodesis screw was then used for fixation in the clavicle tunnel.</p>
<p>When an open technique was used, a longitudinal incision was made from the coracoid to approximately 3.5 mm medial to the AC joint following the Langer lines. Dissection was carried out deep through a longitudinal split in line with the deltoid fibers to identify the coracoid process. Enough dissection was carried out medially and laterally to allow passage of a suture passer or right-angle forceps to pass a suture below the coracoid process if the coracoid loop technique was utilized. In addition to the graft being passed below and around the coracoid, additional fixation was often used both for initial reduction of the AC dislocation and also for additional fixation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512445273">Table 1</xref> outlines additional fixation sutures, tapes, or suture anchors that were used in specific cases per surgeon’s preference. Clavicle tunnels were prepared in a similar fashion whether an open technique or arthroscopically assisted technique was utilized. Reduction was confirmed intraoperatively with fluoroscopy or postoperative radiographs in the recovery room.</p>
<p>We have reported the differences in complications between the 2 different technique cohorts and also between reconstructions based on grade of the initial AC separation, acute versus chronic injuries, and autograft versus allograft reconstructions. Because of the small sample size, diversity of techniques and modifications, along with differences in chronicity and grade of initial injuries, the authors believe that statistical comparisons would potentially take away from the primary focus of the study, which was a report of complications related to these reconstruction techniques.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Our review found 39 patients who had undergone surgical treatment of high-grade AC separations. Eight patients had Weaver-Dunn–type reconstructions, and 4 patients had acute repairs and were excluded from our analysis. Twenty-seven patients had anatomic reconstruction of the CC ligaments.</p>
<p>Of the 27 cases of anatomic reconstruction, 10 cases utilized a coracoid tunnel, and 17 cases utilized a loop around the coracoid base. Eight complications (80%) were noted in the coracoid tunnel group. These included 5 patients (50%) with radiographic loss of reduction, 2 patients (20%) sustained coracoid fractures, and 1 patient (10%) had an intraoperative failure of the coracoid button fixation and was transitioned to a coracoid loop. Six complications (35%) were noted in the coracoid loop group. These included 3 clavicle fractures (18% within group, 11% overall), 2 patients with radiographic loss of reduction (12%) of which 1 of these patients also had an infection (6% infection rate within group, 4% overall), and 1 patient had adhesive capsulitis postoperatively that resolved with physical therapy and stretching (6% within group, 4% overall).</p>
<p>The clavicle fractures from this series were previously reported by one of the authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512445273">27</xref></sup> There were no clavicle fractures since 2007 with modifications to tunnel diameter and location of tunnel placement.</p>
<p>The first coracoid fracture was sustained by a 31-year-old man who had a chronic type V AC separation that had failed nonoperative treatment and was treated with anatomic reconstruction of the CC ligaments utilizing a semitendinosus tendon allograft and a GraftRope (Arthrex) reconstruction technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512445273">Figure 1</xref>). A 6-mm hole was utilized for both the clavicle and coracoid tunnels. He returned to the clinic 10 weeks postoperatively with recurrence of his deformity and radiographs that revealed loss of reduction and obvious coracoid process fracture. This was treated with revision surgery utilizing open reduction and internal fixation of the coracoid with screw fixation and revision CC ligament reconstruction using a hamstring autograft utilizing a coracoid loop technique.</p>

<p>The second coracoid fracture was sustained by a 54-year-old man with a chronic type V AC separation that had failed nonoperative treatment and was treated with an arthroscopically assisted CC ligament reconstruction with a GraftRope reconstruction (Arthrex) utilizing an ipsilateral gracilis autograft and 5-mm coracoid and clavicular tunnels. Immediate postoperative films confirmed reduction, but 2-week follow-up films found a coracoid fracture and recurrence of the deformity. He was treated with a revision involving an allograft loop through the clavicle tunnel and tied over a washer with a PEEK tenodesis screw and nonoperative treatment of the coracoid fracture. An 8-hole reconstruction plate (Synthes, West Chester, Pennsylvania) backed this up with 2 screws proximally and distally spanning the AC separation. Unfortunately, this construct also failed and needed further revision with a hook plate that maintained reduction.</p>
<p>Loss of reduction was seen in 5 of the 10 patients treated with the coracoid tunnel technique (50%) and in 2 of the 17 patients with the coracoid loop technique (12%), of which 1 patient had an infection and had received a tibialis anterior allograft. Overall, loss of reduction was seen in 6 of 27 anatomic reconstructions (22%); this excludes 1 loss of reduction that was associated with infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512445273">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The grading of AC separation for the AC separations in our series included 7 patients with grade III separations, 1 patient with a grade IV separation, and 19 patients with grade V separations. There were 2 complications (29%) associated with the reconstruction of grade III AC separations, no complications (0%) associated with the reconstruction of grade IV AC separations, and 12 complications (63%) associated with the reconstruction of grade V AC separations.</p>
<p>Nine patients (33%) had acute AC separations, and 18 patients (67%) had chronic AC separations. There were 10 complications (56%) associated with the reconstruction of chronic AC separations in the combined cohorts. There were 4 complications (44%) associated with the reconstruction of acute AC separations in the combined cohorts. Five of the 6 reconstructions (83%) that had a loss of reduction without infection or fracture were performed for chronic AC separations.</p>
<p>In terms of the use of allograft versus autograft tendon use, 8 of 10 reconstructions (80%) in the coracoid tunnel group utilized autograft hamstring tendons, and 2 utilized allograft tendons (20%). One of the coracoid fractures occurred with allograft tendons, and 1 occurred with autograft tendons. In the coracoid loop group, 8 of the 17 reconstructions (47%) utilized autograft hamstring tendons, and 9 reconstructions utilized allograft tendons (53%). Of the combined cohorts of coracoid tunnel and coracoid loop techniques, 5 of the 11 (45%) reconstructions that utilized allografts had complications, and 9 of the 16 (56%) reconstructions that utilized autografts had complications. In the coracoid loop group, the lone infection occurred with an allograft tendon graft, but the lone loss of reduction without an infection occurred with an autograft tendon reconstruction. In the coracoid tunnel group, the 5 losses of reduction not associated with coracoid fracture occurred with autograft tendon reconstruction.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Acromioclavicular dislocations are tremendously common injuries. Until the recent advent of anatomic reconstruction of the CC ligaments, there were a multitude of different surgical options for the treatment of high-grade separations including fascial grafts, Dacron grafts, coracoid process transfers, screw fixation, and distal clavicle excision with and without coracoacromial ligament transfer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512445273">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512445273"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512445273"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512445273">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512445273">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512445273">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512445273">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512445273">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512445273">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512445273">28</xref></sup> All of these had variable levels of success especially in terms of maintaining reduction. The anatomic reconstruction of the CC ligaments has shown good preliminary results in one series showing mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score improvement from 52 to 92 postoperatively and Constant-Murley score improvement from 66.6 to 94.7.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512445273">5</xref></sup> However, even in experts’ hands, there was an 18% failure rate with 3 failures including 1 loss of reduction (6%), 1 infection (6%), and 1 with persistent pain despite revision distal clavicle excision (6%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512445273">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>We present a case series of consecutive anatomic reconstructions of the CC ligament for high-grade AC separations at an academic university sports medicine center. Unique complications were encountered including clavicle and coracoid process fractures. The clavicle fractures from this series were previously reported by one of the authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512445273">27</xref></sup> The authors hope that reporting these complications again in a broader series focused on overall complications related to these techniques is not misinterpreted such that the incidence of clavicle fractures is overestimated in the literature. However, it does bear repeating that meticulous attention to surgical technique can help minimize the risk of clavicle fracture. Specific recommendations include minimizing the clavicle tunnel diameter, allowing at least 20 to 25 mm between clavicle tunnels, and allowing at least 10 to 15 mm between the lateral tunnel and the lateral edge of the clavicle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512445273">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512445273">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>In terms of the 2 coracoid fractures encountered, both were associated with the coracoid tunnel technique. One utilized a 6-mm tunnel and allograft, and the other utilized a 5-mm tunnel and hamstring autograft. The second case was performed arthroscopically, while the first case was done with a traditional open exposure. Certainly, modifications of the technique to minimize the diameter of the tunnels in both the clavicle and the coracoid, if utilized, are essential to preventing postoperative fracture using these techniques. Adequate visualization of the coracoid is essential especially if this reconstruction is going to be attempted arthroscopically, and surgeon experience and comfort level with these techniques need to be exceptional.</p>
<p>We report a much higher rate of complications associated with anatomic reconstruction of the CC ligaments than previously reported. In addition to several of the technique modifications mentioned previously, and the unique complications associated with coracoid tunnel techniques, another explanation for our higher rate of complication was the higher number of chronic separations included in this series. Carofino and Mazzocca recently reported a series that excluded those cases of “chronic etiology.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512445273">5</xref></sup> In our series, 5 of the 6 loss of reduction complications, which were not associated with an infection or fracture, were performed for chronic high-grade AC joint separations.</p>
<p>In terms of the use of autograft versus allograft tendon in these reconstruction techniques, the complications were relatively evenly split between autografts (56%) and allografts (45%). One coracoid fracture occurred with an allograft and 1 with an autograft. The lone infection occurred with an allograft in the coracoid loop group. All of the losses of reduction not associated with a coracoid fracture in the coracoid tunnel group occurred with autografts. This is likely biased by the fact that most of the coracoid tunnel group had autograft tendons (80%). Given the small number of allografts used in the coracoid tunnel group, it is difficult to account for the increased rate of complications seen in this series based on autograft or allograft use. Further study will be needed to find an association with risk of failure and either allograft or autograft use.</p>
<p>A potential alternative approach to chronic AC injuries or revisions of failed surgical treatment of these injuries may include the use of the clavicular hook plate. More rigid fixation including locking screw potential may help protect anatomic constructs temporarily. However, rigid fixation across the AC joint may limit normal physiological scapulothoracic motion and thus require subsequent removal of the plate. Several recent studies have shown good subjective clinical results using the clavicular hook plate for the treatment of high-grade AC joint injuries with a complication rate around 10%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512445273">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512445273">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Weaknesses of this study include the lack of uniform follow-up, which varied from 2 weeks (because of loss of follow-up for a single patient) to 38 months. In addition, we did not have subjective outcome scores for these patients. It is difficult to assess the effects of loss of reduction by radiographic parameters clinically without subjective outcomes. Loss of reduction may not be considered a treatment failure or a complication if the patient is subjectively satisfied and has returned to normal activities with adequate function. Further studies will need to evaluate the subjective outcomes preoperatively and postoperatively to assess whether loss of reduction affects patient outcomes. Also, surgical technique was not standardized across the time period or by surgeon. A standardized postoperative orthosis was not utilized as previously recommended by Mazzocca et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512445273">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512445273">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, we believe this to be the second documentation in the literature of coracoid fracture secondary to anatomic CC reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512445273">11</xref></sup> In addition, we present a higher complication rate than previously reported, including a higher rate of loss of reduction. In particular, the coracoid tunnel technique was associated with a very high complication rate. The high rate of complications observed in this study is likely multifactorial and includes technical considerations, patient compliance issues, and patient selection. At this point, the preference of the authors is to use the coracoid loop technique because of concerns about the various complications reported. The reconstruction of high-grade AC separations should be undertaken cautiously, and further study needs to be done in terms of the differences in surgical treatment of acute versus chronic high-grade AC separations.</p>
