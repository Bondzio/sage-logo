<abstract>
<p>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been used to treat severe treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. Multiple psychotropic medications are usually prescribed in high doses prior to or concomitantly with ECT. Little is known about the interaction of ECT with psychotropic medications. ECT is known to induce seizures, but its tendency to induce absence seizures is not. We present a case of a 44-year-old female, on multiple psychotropic medications, who had frequent atypical absence seizures for many days after ECT. Electroencephalography (EEG) confirmed atypical absence seizures by the presence of typical 2.5 to 3 Hz generalized sharp and slow waves with disorganized background activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>ECT has been used as a therapeutic modality in psychiatry since 1938. Post-ECT seizures have been reported mostly as generalized convulsions, whereas reports of nonconvulsive seizures after ECT have been rare. ECT is used most typically in patients who have failed to respond to, or to tolerate, one or more courses of antidepressant medications and/or augmentation with other psychotropic medications.</p>
<p>The mortality of ECT is not higher than minor surgery performed under general anesthesia; approximately 1 in 50 000 cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412452674">1</xref></sup> ECT can cause headache, transient amnesia, drowsiness, and prolonged recovery of consciousness, agitation, disorientation, hypomania or frank mania, as well as persistent bradyarrhythmias, blood pressure lability, or epileptic activity, shortly after the treatments. In the long term most common side effects are memory disturbance and headache.</p>
<p>There are no well-established consensus guidelines about the choices of psychotropic medications concomitantly during ECT. A common practice is not to use stimulants and lithium during ECT since they can lower seizure threshold and can cause unpredictable interaction with ECT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059412452674">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>ECT is typically administered 2 or 3 times weekly until the clinical response is achieved. An average course of therapy for an acute episode of illness consists of 6 to 10 treatments. The patients who are refractory to medications or have recurrent episodes may receive maintenance treatments once every 1 to 4 weeks to prevent relapse.</p>
<sec id="section2-1550059412452674">
<title>Case Report</title>
<p>The patient was a 44-year-old caucasian female with history of depression since age 25. She was born in Scotland. Her past medical history during childhood was significant for measles. Detailed past medical history was obtained from the patient, her mother, and her husband. They reported no history of any seizure or similar symptom, incident, or sign that would imply possible seizures in the remote or recent past. There was no history of febrile seizures or childhood seizures and no history of head trauma or central nervous system infection. Family history was unremarkable for epilepsy.</p>
<p>The patient was sexually abused by her father and brother numerous times. When she was 21 years old, she moved to the United States, where her husband was working. At age 25, she was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety and had no suicidal ideation. At age 34, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and oxcarbazepine (OXC) was added to her antidepressants. She was treated with different psychotropic medications including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. The patient’s treatment was further augmented with methylphenidate, lithium, and various antipsychotics. Nonetheless, she continued to experience a relapsing-remitting course of illness.</p>
<p>In June 2011, she received 14 treatments of ECT via unilateral frontal stimulation over the course of 4 weeks. The patient showed psychotic behavior with visual and auditory hallucinations even before ECT was initiated. After ECT, she manifested bizarre behavior such as involuntary, purposeless, repetitive opening and closing of drawers associated with staring spells with rapid eye blinking, lasting for less than a minute, with decreased responsiveness during spells. She became  herself quickly without a postictal period.</p>
<p>Due to change in her behavior, including stereotypy, she was referred for an EEG, which manifested frequent atypical absence seizures. Due to her abnormal EEG, she was admitted to hospital to treat her seizures. At the time of admission, her baseline medications were lithium, OXC, aripiprazole, levothyroxin, and alprazolam. The last ECT session was a week before her hospitalization.</p>
<p>On admission, the patient was comfortable with stable vital signs. Her Mini-Mental Status Examination revealed decreased short-term memory. Otherwise her neurological examination was unremarkable. At the bedside she was seen to have intermittent brief episodes of staring with rapid eye blinking. These episodes were brief, lasting less than 20 seconds. She returned to baseline without confusion.</p>
<p>The patient’s initial EEG was consistent with abnormal disorganized moderate amplitude background activity with diffuse theta frequency slowing. There were frequent moderate-to-high amplitude 2.5 to 3 Hz generalized sharp waves, spikes, and slow waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1550059412452674">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1550059412452674">2</xref>). Her bedside long-term EEG monitoring showed frequent seizures, consistent with generalized 2.5 to 3 Hz sharp and slow waves with evolution in amplitudes. Their duration varied from 10 to 30 seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1550059412452674">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1550059412452674">4</xref>). Due to disorganized background, absence of normal background and 2.5 to 3 Hz generalized spike, and slow wave discharges (SWDs), her EEG pattern was consistent with atypical absence seizures.</p>

<p>Lithium was discontinued on admission. Initially she was treated with valproate (VPA) in addition to OXC. Zonisamide (ZNS) was added later. Oxcarbazepine was discontinued after admission, since this medication can worsen absence seizures. Levetiracetam was not chosen due to the ongoing severe depression since it has negative psychotropic effects. Phenytoin (PHT) was added since she stayed refractory on ZNS and VPA. Phenytoin was chosen to treat her refractory absence seizures since it is available as an intravenous formulation, which makes rapid administration easy to obtain the therapeutic level. Although PHT is not always an antiepileptic of choice to treat absence seizures, it was discontinued after the second dose since it had no effect on the EEG. Her EEG showed improvement after dose adjustment of VPA and ZNS, although she continued to have atypical absence seizures for 1 week throughout her hospital stay.</p>
<p>During the  hospital stay, she had an extensive workup including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ictal Single Photon Emission Computed Photography (SPECT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1550059412452674">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1550059412452674">7</xref>), and spinal tap, in addition to complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel. Her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was normal. In the CSF cultures, the measles antibodies were negative. Her lithium level was 1.4. Her brain MRI revealed nonspecific white matter changes. Ictal SPECT did not show any localization of seizures.</p>

<p>A week after her admission, the patient was discharged home on ZNS and VPA. Her follow-up EEGs a week after discharge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1550059412452674">Figure 5</xref>) showed improvement and complete resolution of absence seizures. Her EEG a month later showed complete resolution of generalized epileptiform discharges. As her background returned to normal, her antiepileptic regimen was tapered to VPA only.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This case highlights absence seizure provoking effects of ECT in the presence of psychotropic medications. There was no sign of infective or metabolic derangement that might affect seizure threshold. Post-ECT seizures rarely occur. Most commonly reported seizures after ECT are generalized tonic–clonic seizures. Status epilepticus is considered a very rare complication of ECT. With the application of anesthesia, muscle relaxation and oxygenation, the incidence of status epilepticus after ECT has been markedly reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059412452674">2</xref></sup> The first case of status epilepticus after ECT was reported in 1959.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059412452674">3</xref></sup> Status epilepticus is described as prolonged seizures, longer than 5 to 10 minutes, or inability to return to baseline between seizures. In the majority of  cases, clinical seizures were reported immediately, or within days of the last ECT. Since 1980, multiple cases were reported with convulsive and nonconvulsive status epilepticus after ECT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059412452674">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1550059412452674">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Absence is a nonconvulsive epileptic seizure characterized by impairment of consciousness which occurs concomitantly with a generalized, bilaterally synchronous spike (or polyspike) and SWD at 2.5 to 4 Hz. The duration is typically between 9 and 12 seconds. These seizures are activated by hyperventilation and occasionally by photic stimulation. Absence seizures typically present during childhood, but can occur later as a  juvenile form. Absence seizures usually involve less prominent changes in awareness and more evident arrest of motor initiation.</p>
<p>Absence seizures are usually genetically determined. Possible mechanisms of epileptogenesis involve gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) systems and T-calcium channels. The thalamus plays a prominent role on the basis of the evidence from EEG, neuroimaging, and functional imaging studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1550059412452674">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1550059412452674">24</xref></sup> Reticular nucleus within the thalamic structure is an important pacemaker. The frontal cortex, in particular, is involved in absence seizures, as revealed by the increased oxygenation and the activation of dorsolateral and orbital frontal areas observed in functional imaging and EEG studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1550059412452674">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1550059412452674">24</xref></sup> Absence seizures require selective cortical networks, including orbital and mesial frontal regions and thalamic reticular nuclei.</p>
<p>There are different theories about how ECT works. While it induces a generalized seizure with an electrical current, its effect on neuroendocrine system has been accepted as the main mechanism of action. The ECT induces wide release of endocrines, numerous endocrine responses in humans, such as elevated plasma concentrations of prolactin, adrenocorticotropin, and neuropeptide Y (NPY). All are hormones, related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which appear dysregulated during severe depression.</p>
<p>ECT causes generalized and repeated seizures affecting the centrencephalic structures—and most likely also the prefrontal regions—representing a necessary path for its efficacy. In absence seizures, the thalamocortical network has been dysregulated and uncontrolled.</p>
<p>In this case, ECT-induced repeated seizures might have altered the pathway between cortical and subcortical regions and therefore might have decreased the inhibition and control of thalamocortical connection via cortex. As a result, there might have been increased synchronicity between thalamus impulse generators and cortex, leading to absence seizures with generalized 2 to 3 Hz spike and wave pattern as seen in this case.</p>
<p>Absence seizures are divided into 2 groups, typical and atypical. The EEG in typical absence will show normal background between interictal generalized 3-Hz spike and wave discharges. Patients with atypical absence seizures will have diffusely slow and disorganized background, multifocal epileptiform discharges and generalized spike and slow waves with a slow frequency of 2 to 3 Hz. In our patient, the EEG shows disorganized background and generalized 2- to 2.5-Hz spike and SWDs, considered to be atypical absence seizures.</p>
<p>Both VPA and lamotrigine are viewed as first-line treatment in epilepsy. Both ZNS and levetiracetam are also very effective medications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1550059412452674">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1550059412452674">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many psychiatrists consider ECT  as a last resort treatment. Therefore, the majority of patients undergoing ECT are treated with tricyclics, often in high doses, with lithium and/or anticonvulsants, and sometimes with stimulants as in this case. Thus there might be other causes for the development of seizures after ECT. In our case, continuation of lithium and stimulants is considered a risk factor for seizures after ECT. Lithium could have lowered seizure threshold. Also by itself it can cause seizures at high levels. Aripiprazole, a comparatively new atypical antipsychotic, has 0.1% seizure-inducing potential, much lower than other antipsychotics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1550059412452674">30</xref></sup> So far, there have been few case reports of aripiprazole-associated seizures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1550059412452674">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1550059412452674">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>The 2- to 3-Hz spike and slow waves can appear as secondary bisynchrony in partial epilepsy. It has been reported in frontal lobe epilepsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1550059412452674">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1550059412452674">36</xref></sup> In partial epilepsy, this pattern usually has focal onset with rapid generalization. Also clinical symptoms will vary and tend to last longer than absence seizures. In our case due to clinical semiology and lack of clear asymmetry at EEG onset, this EEG pattern is more consistent with atypical absence seizure.</p>

<sec id="section4-1550059412452674">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>ECT is used in severe treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. Absence seizures in this case might have been provoked by repetitive ECT. Possible mechanism may be related to alteration of the pathway between cortical and subcortical regions, as a result of decreased inhibition and control of thalamocortical connection via cortex. In this particular case, one needs to consider the possibility that being on multiple medications lowering seizure threshold and receiving more than 6 to 12 ECT sessions might have played a role in the occurrence of absence seizures.</p>
<p>Before ECT, a careful history including a list of current medications should be obtained. The medications with a potential to lower seizure threshold such as tricyclics, antidepressants, lithium, antipsychotics, and stimulants should be reduced or discontinued prior to ECT to prevent prolonged seizures during and after ECT. Patients with confusion or unexpected change in mental status should be worked up carefully. The EEG should be made immediately to rule out seizures which can be very harmful situations.</p>
