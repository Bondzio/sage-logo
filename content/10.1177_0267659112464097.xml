<title>Background:</title>
<p>Neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) patients are particularly vulnerable to the effects of uncompensated insensible water loss resulting in hypernatraemia. There exists a long-standing relationship between hypernatraemia and varying degrees of cerebral dysfunction. The aim of this study is to explore the degree to which free water loss occurs across a commonly used ECMO oxygenator, the polymethylpentene (PMP) membrane Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT (Medos, Medizintechnik AG, Stolberg, Germany). The secondary aim is to assess to what extent the addition of heat and/or humidity ameliorates this water loss.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0267659112464097">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>An ECMO circuit consisting of a centrifugal pump and a Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT oxygenator was primed with crystalloid and albumin. Each experimental trial was carried out in triplicate, with gas flow rates of 1, 3 and 4.8 L/min being investigated. Fluid loss was assessed at six time points over a 24-hour period.</p>

<sec id="section3-0267659112464097">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Water loss increased significantly from 1 to 3 L/min gas flow (p=0.05) and from 3 to 4.8 L/min gas flow (p=0.025). The mean water loss differences between the differing gas flow trials per L/min gas flow were non-significant (72.4 ±3.9 ml/24hrs). The effect of heating the gas to 37°C did not significantly alter water loss, whereas heat and humidity reduced water loss significantly (p=0.009).</p>

<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Insensible water loss from a Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT oxygenator is approximately 72 ml/day per L/min gas flow over 24 hrs. Heating and humidifying the gas reduces the fluid loss significantly to approximately 8 ml/L/min gas flow over 24 hrs (p=0.009).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a therapy that is offered to patients after the failure of standard medical and surgical options. Due to the relative severity of the illness, this patient demographic is particularly susceptible to fluid and electrolyte disturbances and, therefore, requires constant monitoring and meticulous fluid balance. Perhaps the most vulnerable subset of ECMO patients, due primarily to their diminutive circulating volume, is the neonatal population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112464097">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Within the neonatal population at our institution, a gradual increase in patient serum sodium levels whilst on ECMO was observed. This increase was always followed by a gradual return to baseline once ECMO was ceased. This was particularly obvious when a high gas flow strategy was trialled (with the addition of carbon dioxide) in order to improve the resolution of blood gas management during ECMO. It was this occurrence that led to the speculation that, firstly, a possible water loss across the ECMO oxygenator might be the cause of the patient hypernatraemia and, secondly, if humidifying the gas entering the oxygenator could prevent the water loss and, therefore, limit the rise in patient serum sodium.</p>
<p>There exists a long-standing relationship between electrolyte disturbance, in particular hypernatraemia, and cerebral dysfunction within the infant population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112464097">2</xref></sup> It is understood that the extent of the patient hypernatraemia dictates the extent of the central nervous system symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112464097">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112464097">3</xref></sup> These symptoms include, but are not limited to, generalized irritability, seizures and coma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112464097">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has been previously established that, during ECMO, an amount of water loss occurs, within the chosen oxygenator, from the blood phase to the gas phase of the device. The volume of actual water loss has been shown to vary between individual devices and the particular membranes used within the device. Camacho et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112464097">4</xref></sup> using a silicone membrane oxygenator, reported a 72-ml water loss over a 24-hour period, per litre/minute (L/min) of gas flow. Alexander et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112464097">5</xref></sup> studied a microporous, hollow-fibre, membrane oxygenator and reported an 83-ml water loss over a 24 hour period, per L/min gas flow. Of particular interest, due to the membrane material under investigation, was a study by Lawson and Holt.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112464097">6</xref></sup> Investigating the polymethylpentene (PMP) membrane within the Quadrox D oxygenator (Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG, Hirrlingen, Germany), they described a 48-ml water loss per day, per L/min gas flow.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, PMP membrane oxygenators have become increasingly popular within the ECMO sphere. This is primarily due to the inherent characteristics of the actual fibres. It is understood that PMP fibres consist of an asymmetric pore structure that ensures an efficient gas exchange that can be sustained over a prolonged period of time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112464097">7</xref></sup> This ability is similar to silicone membrane devices, yet the PMP oxygenator manages to achieve long-term, effective gas exchange with a significantly lower pressure drop.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112464097">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112464097">8</xref></sup> The asymmetric pore structure of the PMP fibre is covered by a dense outer skin. This feature permits gas transfer across the fibre without the direct contact of blood and gas across a micropore.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112464097">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112464097">9</xref></sup> Avoiding direct contact between blood and gas almost eradicates the risk of plasma leak, a feature reported commonly when the hollow-fibre, polypropylene device was used for extended periods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112464097">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this study is primarily to quantify the water loss from a Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT oxygenator (Medos, Medizintechnik AG, Stolberg, Germany) over a 24-hour period at various gas flows. Secondly, this study aims to discover if altering the temperature and/or humidifying the gas entering the oxygenator reduces the water loss from the device.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The in vitro ECMO circuit was set up to mimic our standard ECMO circuit, with additions to facilitate the experimental design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112464097">Figure 1</xref>). This circuit consisted of a Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT oxygenator and a Rotaflow centrifugal pump (Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG, Hirrlingen, Germany). The tubing used was 1/4" and 3/8" with Xcoating (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The tubing distal to the Rotaflow contained a Bio-Probe flow transducer (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN), which was used to measure fluid phase flow in all trials. A restrictive gate-clamp was applied to the tubing exiting the Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT in order to generate a circuit pressure of 200 mmHg. The circuit pressure was measured at the inferior Luer port at the outlet of the Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT by a Datex-Ohmeda S/5™ console (Datex-Ohmeda, Finland). Proximal to the Rotaflow centrifugal pump was a three-way tap which enabled the connection of an intravenous giving set to which was attached four fluid-filled burettes which were, in turn, attached to a digital hanging scale (Wedderburn HS-3000, Ingleburn, Australia). The scales were calibrated prior to use and measured in 2 g increments up to a maximum weight of 3000 g. A 1/4" Y connector was placed in the tubing exiting the Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT in order to redirect flow through a haemofilter and then through a Capiox<sup>®</sup> flexible venous reservoir (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), returning to another 1/4" Y connector within the tubing pre the centrifugal pump.</p>

<p>Schematic diagram of the in vitro circuit setup.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0267659112464097-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>The circuit, whilst open to the haemofilter and flexible venous reservoir, was initially primed with Plasma-Lyte 148 (Baxter Healthcare, Toongabbie, Australia) and de-aired, followed by the addition of 4% albumin (Albumex, CSL Bioplasma, Broadmeadows, Australia). Using the haemofilter, the prime was concentrated to result in a solution with a colloid osmotic pressure (COP) of approximately 23 mmHg. The COP was measured on an Osmomat 050 Colloid Osmometer (Gonotec, GmbH, Berlin, Germany) which was calibrated at 2 levels prior to each use.</p>
<p>Once the desired COP was achieved, the circuit was isolated from the flexible venous reservoir and haemofilter. Apart from being open to the fluid-filled burettes, the circuit was now a ‘closed system’. Any fluid ‘lost’ from the oxygenator would result in fluid being drawn back into the circuit automatically from the fluid-filled burettes. This process would result in a visible and measureable fluid reduction and, also, a net reduction in the displayed value on the digital hanging scale. The circuit temperature was maintained at 35°C, utilising the Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT integral heat exchanger in conjunction with a Maquet HU35 Heater Unit (Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG) with a set temperature of 36°C. The circuit temperature was measured using a Capiox<sup>®</sup> Leur Thermister (Terumo, Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) inserted into the superior Leur connector at the outlet of the Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT, connected to the S/5™ console.</p>
<p>The fluid phase flow rate for all trials was one litre per minute. The gas flow rates under investigation were 1, 3 and 4.8 L/min, one litre per minute being a typical gas flow rate utilised for neonatal ECMO and 4.8 L/min being the maximum rated gas flow for the Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT oxygenator. Three litres per minute was studied in order to discover if the measured water loss was linear over differing gas flow rates. In order to improve the physiological credentials of the study, the gas used was Carbogen (BOC, North Ryde, Australia) which is a 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide mixture. The gas line also contained a Capiox<sup>®</sup> Leur Thermister from which the gas temperature was measured using the S/5™ console. A precision volumetric flowmeter was used outside of the study trials to demonstrate that the actual gas flow displayed on the gas cylinder rotameter was the gas flow actually being delivered.</p>
<p>In order to assess whether the temperature of the gas entering the gas phase of the oxygenator impacted upon the measured water loss from the device, a Fisher and Paykel MR720 Humidifier (Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, Panmure, Aukland, NZ) was incorporated into the gas line. This device was dry, with a set temperature of 40°C and a chamber temperature of 37°C. When assessing if humidification reduced measured water loss, the humidifier was filled appropriately with sterile water for injection (Baxter Healthcare, Toongabbie, Australia), with a set temperature of 40°C and a chamber temperature of 37°C. The heat and humidification trials were only conducted with a 4.8 L/min gas flow.</p>
<p>Each experimental gas flow trial ran for a complete 24 hours. Each gas flow trial was carried out in triplicate, using a completely new study circuit under similar study conditions. Visual burette measurements and displayed weight measurements were made at the beginning and end of the study and at least four times, at varying intervals, over the 24-hour trial. The environmental temperature and humidity were recorded at 15-minute intervals over the 24-hour study run, using a Hygrochron temperature/humidity logger (Esis Pty, Pennant Hills, Sydney, Australia).</p>
<p>Computerized statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 19 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) for Windows (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Where appropriate non-parametric analysis was used for these data, with median values being compared. Comparisons between unpaired groups were derived using the Mann-Whitney test. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used for three independent samples to compare daily water loss across 1, 3 and 4.8 L/min gas flows. Mean values ± standard deviation is used to describe environmental factors, circuit temperatures and COP. A <italic>p</italic>-value of equal to or less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<p>Over the course of the study run, the average ambient air temperature was 22.0 ± 0.9°C and the average ambient relative humidity was 33.9 ± 0.1%. Over all study runs, the circuit fluid phase temperature was maintained at 35°C. The mean gas temperature entering the oxygenator, on non-heated trials, was 22.2 ± 0.7°C. The mean pre-trial COP for all circuit trials was 22.9 ± 0.4 mmHg. Collected water loss from the gas exhaust of a Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT recorded no measurable amounts of electrolytes when placed through a blood gas analyser.</p>
<p>Using weight to assess water loss (1 g = 1 ml), the average total recorded water loss from the Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT over the 24-hour trial was 76.0 ± 5.3 ml at 1 L/min gas flow, 205.3 ± 7.6 ml at 3 L/min gas flow and 349.3 ± 11.4 ml at 4.8 L/min gas flow. The linear rise in water loss across all gas flow trials is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267659112464097">Figure 2</xref>. A significant increase in water loss was found between 1 and 3 L/min gas flow (p=0.05) and between 3 and 4.8 L/min gas flow (p=0.025).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Intensive care units (ICU) are generally very adept at the monitoring of the fluid status of their particular patients. It is this close attention that enables a timely response to electrolyte disturbance and the prevention of negative sequelae. Where a disconnect between the observation of a problem’s occurrence and the response to that particular problem may occur is if the problem is not expected or the clinician cannot highlight the cause. Water loss from an ECMO oxygenator, although previously described, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112464097">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112464097"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112464097">6</xref></sup> remains a potentially unexpected cause of hypernatraemia in the ECMO/ICU patient. As discussed earlier, the neonatal population is very susceptible to an uncompensated free water loss due to their proportionally small circulating volume in comparison to the amount of water lost over a 24-hour period.</p>
<p>The method of water loss across a membrane is primarily dependent upon the structure of the membrane involved. If the particular membrane contains pores, then a combination of bulk transfer, driven by a pressure gradient, and diffusion along a concentration gradient are the methods of water transfer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112464097">10</xref></sup> The degree to which bulk transfer contributes to water transfer, in comparison to diffusion, depends upon the size of the membrane pores. If the membrane contains no pores, then the water transmission across the membrane is understood to occur due to a process referred to as activated diffusion. Activated diffusion is driven by a concentration gradient which leads to water dissolving into the surface of the membrane and migrating through the membrane along its concentration gradient, followed by desorption and evaporation on the other side of the membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112464097">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The observed water loss in our study, utilising the PMP membrane, would have been primarily due to activated diffusion. We have demonstrated that the water loss across the Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT device was linear and directly proportional to the gas flow rate. These findings would suggest that a high gas flow strategy during neonatal ECMO could result in a rapid free water loss and, very probably, could be complicit in an equally rapid rise in patient serum sodium levels. Irrespective of the gas flow rate, the approximate hourly water loss per L/min of gas flow was 3 ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0267659112464097">Figure 3</xref>). An awareness of this number should permit the clinician to predict and, therefore, factor in this water loss into the child’s fluid management plan.</p>
<p>It has long been established that a proportional relationship exists between the temperature of air and the air’s capacity to hold moisture. Unsaturated air will absorb water by evaporation from a wet surface until it reaches equilibrium. This equilibrium would be when the air becomes saturated or when the air reaches 100% relative humidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112464097">11</xref></sup> During this study, the addition of heat to the gas entering the Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT oxygenator exerted no effect on the measured hourly water loss in comparison to the non-heated trials. One may speculate that this lack of difference in water loss between the heated and non-heated trials is twofold. Firstly, there is no alteration in the moisture concentration gradient across the membrane in comparison to the non-heated trials. Secondly, the volume of moisture present on the gas side of the membrane did not surpass the amount of moisture that the ventilating gas could carry in the non-heated trial; therefore, heating the gas (and, thus, increasing the amount of moisture the gas could hold) exerted no determinable difference. This particular study did not measure the relative humidity at the exhaust of the oxygenator, which would have permitted a greater understanding of this process.</p>
<p>As already discussed, the amount of water that air can hold at any given temperature is limited; and when its maximum capacity is reached it is said to be saturated or has 100% relative humidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112464097">11</xref></sup> Following this train of thought, one could assume that, if the gas entering an oxygenator had 100% relative humidity, the diffusion gradient across the membrane would be eradicated and, therefore, any water loss would be eliminated.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this study, the gas entering the oxygenator was heated to 37°C and humidified to 100% relative humidity, i.e., 44 mg of water/L. Whilst not completely eliminating the water loss, a significant reduction was observed. The reason an observable amount was still seen is most likely due to the gradual cooling of the gas as it traversed the device. As the gas cooled, its moisture-carrying capacity would reduce and result in the formation of condensation until equilibrium is re-established at the lower temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112464097">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Excluding the humidified trial, if the daily water loss per L/min gas flow from this study was compared to the studies highlighted earlier, an interesting occurrence becomes apparent. The daily loss we recorded, using the Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT PMP membrane, was 72.4 ml/day per L/min/gas flow. Camacho et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112464097">4</xref></sup> recorded 72ml/day per L/min/gas flow, utilising a silicone membrane, Alexander et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112464097">5</xref></sup> reported 83 ml/day with a microporous, hollow-fibre membrane, and Lawson and Holt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112464097">6</xref></sup> measured 48 ml/day with the PMP membrane within the Quadrox D.</p>
<p>It can be seen that our daily measured water loss was similar to all other studied oxygenator membranes apart from the device with an albeit larger surface area, but an identical membrane material, namely, the Quadrox D. It has been previously established, using the silicone membrane, that surface area on its own does not influence water loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112464097">4</xref></sup> We were unable to explain why such a difference between the two PMP membrane devices existed. Eventually, we ran a pilot study, comparing the Quadrox D and the Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT. We found that the water loss from the Quadrox D was almost identical to the Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT device under similar conditions (72.7 v 72.4 ml/day per L/min gas flow).</p>
<p>For the purpose of assessing water loss from the oxygenator for this study, we decided that the most effective method, with the level of resources available to us, was utilising the burette method described. Whilst constructing a circuit only open to the fluid-filled burettes, any water lost from the circuit would consequently result in water being drawn back into the circuit from the burettes.</p>
<p>The primary measurement of water loss for this study was weight. This method of assessing water loss relies heavily on the assumption that 1 ml of water lost is equal to 1 g in weight. The measured water lost during each trial was recorded by weight and by visual burette measurements. Whilst the results were similar with both methods, no results were presented from the visual burette measurement due to the rather subjective nature of this method of recording water loss.</p>
<p>As described in the methods section, for the purpose of this study, an oxygen/carbon dioxide mixture was used as the ventilating gas and care was taken to ensure that a physiological COP was maintained within the circulating fluid. The primary reasons for this attention to detail was to as closely as possible mimic a physiological scenario. With regards to the COP, whilst unlikely, we also wanted to ensure that maintenance of a normal COP would rule out the influence of an abnormal COP on water loss, which could adversely affect the clinical applicability of the findings.</p>
<p>Introducing warmth and moisture to an ECMO oxygenator may lead to concern over an increased infection risk. Whilst the taking of cultures during in vitro testing would be warranted, we speculate that the risk would be minimal. This low risk is due to several reasons; firstly the ‘true’ nature of the PMP membrane would make it extremely difficult for any micro-organisms to pass from the gas phase through to the blood phase of the device; secondly, the humidification system is a clean ‘closed’ system using sterile water. Prior to advocating the use of humidity in limiting insensible water loss across ECMO oxygenators, further studies would be required in blood trial circuits to assess whether the increase in condensation observed would impact upon gas exchange.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, the insensible water loss from a Hilite<sup>®</sup> 2400LT is directly proportional to the gas flow rate and is approximately 72 ml/day per L/min gas flow or approximately 3 ml/hr per L/min. The volume of water loss can be significantly reduced by humidifying the gas entering the oxygenator, although this should not yet be attempted clinically until the impact upon gas exchange is assessed. The insensible water loss from an ECMO oxygenator should be understood, acknowledged and factored into a patient’s fluid management plan by clinicians in order to avoid negative sequelae.</p>
