<abstract>
<p>Annually there are 500 000 preventable deaths in the United States caused by smoking; as health care professionals, pharmacists have a unique opportunity to advise, assess, and assist patients to quit smoking. This review article provides pharmacists with a “toolbox” containing an overview of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods for smoking cessation. Currently approved over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications (nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline, and bupropion) are summarized, and nonpharmacologic therapies discussed include cognitive therapy and hypnosis. In addition to traditional therapies some potential approaches to smoking cessation are addressed, including nicotine immunizations and electronic cigarettes.</p>

<p>The literature reports that the average smoker will die at least 14 years earlier than nonsmokers, mostly as a result of health issues related to cancer and cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460823">1</xref></sup> Pharmacists are often the first health care professional contacted for smoking cessation therapy information and can provide guidance and support to patients committed to quit. Through counseling, pharmacists can assist patients in navigating potential therapy obstacles (eg, smoking relapse) to ensure successful cessation, as continued smoking may result in not only direct but also indirect consequence. An Internet search for “smokers” will pull news stories showing employers are beginning to deny offers of employment to those who smoke, children of smokers are absent from school more often than nonsmokers, and some health plans are giving financial as well as other incentives for healthy behavior, including a tobacco-free lifestyle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012460823">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012460823">3</xref></sup> These indicate an attitude and cultural change around smoking tobacco, smokers, and the impact that smoking has had on our society. Rising health care costs and lost employee productivity associated with smoking supports the momentum in health care to promote smoking cessation for Americans.</p>
<p>To better prepare pharmacists for using the “toolbox” of smoking cessation methods it is important to understand the consequences of smoking, the depth and scope of addiction, the pharmacology of nicotine, how to assess nicotine dependence, what alternatives and options to suggest, and that almost all patients will relapse. Reversion to smoking is an expected step on the path of reduction to cessation, and patients must be prepared accordingly. The purpose of this review article is to provide pharmacists with an understanding of nicotine addiction and associated consequences with smoking, an update on pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods for smoking cessation as well as novel approaches to smoking cessation.</p>

<title>Epidemiology/Pharamcology</title>
<p>Cigarette smoking is the most popular method of tobacco use worldwide and the number one cause of preventable deaths in the United States, responsible for about 1 in 5 deaths per year or approximately 500 000 deaths per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460823">1</xref></sup> This mortality rate surpasses the combined death total of HIV, illicit alcohol and drug use, suicide, murders, and car accidents. In 2007, an estimated 45.3 million adult Americans smoked cigarettes with the incidence being more common among men (23.9%) than women (18.0%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012460823">1</xref></sup> The literature reports that the average smoker will die at least 14 years earlier than nonsmokers, mostly as a result of health issues related to cancer and cardiovascular disease. Moreover, the risk of death due to lung cancer is 13 times higher in female smokers and 23 times higher in male smokers as compared with nonsmokers. Smokers are also 2 to 4 times more likely to develop coronary heart disease; additionally, the risk of dying from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is 10 times greater in smokers versus nonsmokers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0897190012460823">4</xref></sup> Therefore, cigarette smoking has a tremendous impact on health which translates into direct and indirect monetary costs. During 2000 to 2004, cigarette smoking was estimated to be responsible for $193 billion in annual health-related economic losses in the United States, $96 billion in direct medical costs, and approximately $97 billion in lost productivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012460823">5</xref></sup> The total economic costs (direct medical costs and lost productivity) associated with cigarette smoking are estimated at $10.47 per pack of cigarettes sold in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012460823">6</xref></sup> Cigarette smoking results in 5.1 million years of potential life lost in the United States annually.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0897190012460823">
<title>Psychological and Physiological Dependence of Nicotine</title>
<p>There are over 7000 chemicals found in tobacco smoke and nicotine has been identified as the most addictive chemical constituent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012460823">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012460823">8</xref></sup> It should be noted that of the 7000 chemicals mentioned earlier, approximately 90% of the constituents of smoke are produced as vaporized pyrolysis by-products of smoking, while the rest are in the form of particulates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012460823">9</xref></sup> An example of some of the constituents of cigarette smoke that are considered poisonous or carcinogenic include ammonia, benzene, carbon monoxide, cyanide, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, phenols, and tar.</p>
<p>The average cigarette contains between 13 and 19 mg of nicotine. Smoking 1 cigarette typically delivers 1 to 2 mg of nicotine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012460823">9</xref></sup> Nicotine is absorbed into the bloodstream after the tobacco product is chewed, inhaled, smoked, or applied transdermally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0897190012460823">9</xref></sup> As nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the bloodstream and can readily cross the blood–brain barrier. The time to reach maximum concentration (tmax) in the brain tissue is within 10 to 20 seconds, at which time it stimulates the dopamine reward pathway which is reported to be responsible for the addictive nature of nicotine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012460823">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012460823"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190012460823">12</xref></sup> The half-life of nicotine in the body is around 2 hours. The amount of nicotine absorbed by the body from smoking depends on many factors, including the type of tobacco (nicotine concentration), puff volume, and puff rate. Nicotine is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes (mostly CYP2A6 [80%] and also by CYP2B6).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190012460823">13</xref></sup> A major metabolite is cotinine with a half-life of 24 to 48 hours, which makes it an indicator for recent nicotine use. Other primary metabolites include nicotine <italic>N</italic>-oxide, nornicotine, nicotine isomethonium ion, 2-hydroxynicotine, and nicotine glucuronide. Gluconuration and oxidative metabolism of nicotine to cotinine are both inhibited by menthol, an additive to mentholated cigarettes, thus increasing the half-life and peak plasma levels of nicotine “in vivo.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0897190012460823">13</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The dopamine reward pathway is not understood completely. However, research suggests that initially nicotine stimulates the central nervous system (CNS) followed by CNS depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012460823">14</xref></sup> These changes to the CNS after one is exposed to cigarette smoke produces the effects of calmness, increased alertness, improved memory, and loss of appetite, which are all positive re-enforcers for continued smoking. Conversely, nicotine also increases heart rate and blood pressure. With continued use of nicotine, there is an increase in nicotinic receptors and potentially a desensitizing of those receptors as well in the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190012460823">15</xref></sup> Consequently, more nicotine is required to achieve the desired effects for the user. At this point, physiological tolerance is developed to nicotine, leading to dependence and an opportunity to be treated with nonpharmacological and pharmacological therapies.</p>
<p>In addition to the physiological dependence model, there is an equally important psychological piece that must be incorporated to fully understand the tobacco dependence/withdrawal cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012460823">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012460823">8</xref></sup> The ritualistic behavior of obtaining, handling, and lighting, and smoking a cigarette around certain behaviors, events, or feelings can contribute to the craving and addiction of tobacco. Some commonly reported triggers are anxiety, driving, or in the context of social gatherings. It should be noted that behavioral therapies can help mitigate some of these symptoms and urges, such as identifying the environmental triggers of craving and implementing strategies and coping skills to manage these feelings.</p>
<sec id="section4-0897190012460823">
<title>Patient Assessment</title>
<p>The pharmacists’ role is to provide advice, dispense over-the-counter recommendations, and direct the patient back to their prescriber for the balance of care. In this pharmacists are limited to the information that comes directly from the patient. It is important for pharmacists to be aware of a few techniques and tools to better drive our patients’ initiative to quit smoking as well as to better provide accurate information on the depth of their dependence on cigarettes. In brief, these tools are motivational counseling or interviewing, the Fagerstrom test, and the 5 As (ask, advise, assess, assist, and arrange).</p>
<p>Motivational counseling or interviewing is a technique where one actively listens first and follows up to help the patient find their motivation to change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012460823">16</xref></sup> The first step in motivational counseling is to show empathy to the patient. Starting with genuine concern one can assess their level of commitment to quitting. Next “develop a discrepancy” in their justification to continue smoking; allow them to see the impact of their decisions on others. Then, work through their resistance and rationalization of behaviors to a point that the patient is educated regarding how to use the tools and resources at hand to achieve success. The goal is to engage the smoker into discussing what they live for. Once patients reach this point, they may begin to participate in implementing a smoking cessation plan. Pharmacists are encouraged to learn more about motivational counseling at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ahrq.gov/clinic/tobacco/tobaqrg2.htm#table13">www.ahrq.gov/clinic/tobacco/tobaqrg2.htm#table13</ext-link>.</p>
<p>The Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence is a quick and simple tool to help patients assess their own nicotine dependence. Though the questions are subjective, they provide a numerical scaled response that is easily interpreted to demonstrate a level of nicotine dependence as well as a “low, moderate, and high” rating. Along with the rating, reinforcing statements are provided to help drive the patient in their next step. By using this nicotine-dependence assessment, pharmacists can begin to develop a systematic set of recommendations for guiding their patients. A copy of the Fagerstrom tool is available in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0897190012460823">Table 1</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190012460823">17</xref></sup>

<p>The last assessment tool that pharmacists may use is the 5 As method found at www.surgeongeneral.gov/tobacco.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012460823">16</xref></sup> It is most useful in smokers who are invested in quitting. Pharmacy teams should make a conscious effort to “ask” as many patients who come to the pharmacy if they smoke cigarettes. For health system pharmacists, the question should be included in charted items and in the community setting it is ideal when prescriptions are dropped off or when counseling occurs. Then, “advise” all smokers on the necessity to quit smoking with conviction and pose a relevant justification for cessation. Next, “assess” each smoker’s willingness to try to quit smoking and suggest they set a date to start their attempt. For those who are willing, “assist” them to develop a plan to quit smoking and advise them that they may need to adjust their plan and their expectations along the way. Part of the assistance provided should include educating the patient on options of therapy, the need to have support from family and friends, the need for them to self-evaluate their triggers, habits, and perceptions on why and when they smoke, and an understanding that you and your team will be supportive. Finally, “arrange” to follow-up with the patient to support them and show your commitment to their success.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0897190012460823">
<title>Cognitive Therapies</title>
<p>According to the American Institute for Cognitive Therapy, cognitive therapy is best described as psychotherapy designed to help patients learn to help themselves, not focusing on childhood barriers or experiences but on means of self-reliance to accomplish goals or tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0897190012460823">18</xref></sup> As such, the one unifying and most likely predictor of success in smoking cessation is the addition of some form of cognitive therapy and support. The support and effectiveness seen with cognitive therapies is easily likened to the methods and successes of other addiction treatment programs like alcoholics anonymous, narcotics anonymous, and even overeaters anonymous. Having a coach to help cheer on success and inspire one to achieve cessation gives maintenance of the success message, ultimately bolstering the patients’ insight of their own will to quit.</p>
<p>Patients tend to let their perceptions create a denial of the depth of their addiction to nicotine and cigarettes. In Dickter and Forestell’s “Peering through the smoke: The effect of parental smoking behavior and addiction on daily smokers’ attentional bias to smoking cues,” a noted reason children of smokers begin earlier is they accept a different norm surrounding addictive behaviors and have “a reduction in the amount of cognitive resources available” to make proper decisions requiring judgment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0897190012460823">19</xref></sup> These children miss the prompts that other children detect and make decisions accordingly. This absence of perception is also seen among peer groups and can explain cohorts of smokers within a larger population. The findings by Dickter and Forestall suggest that the conscious and subconscious cognitive reinforcements affect choice to smoke but in converse should also bolster a choice to quit.</p>
<p>Various models for cognitive therapy exist to support smoking cessation. There are findings with structured methods, such as acceptance and relationship-focused behavior,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190012460823">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0897190012460823">21</xref></sup> short-term and long-term methods with success,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190012460823">22</xref></sup> methods that include group therapy in the average adult and in the elderly individuals,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0897190012460823">23</xref></sup> and methods that recognize a paired buddy or sponsor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0897190012460823">24</xref></sup> Finally, it has been suggested that Internet-based supportive continuation of therapy in the home may be useful. Regardless of method, the most effective cognitive support program is one that the patient will accept and actively participate in, keeping their ties to support and coaching. According to Thomas et al the converse is seen in the absence of cognitive support, they conclude “the greatest barrier to cessation was social isolation,” with a 90% relapse rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0897190012460823">20</xref></sup>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0897190012460823">
<title>Hypnosis</title>
<p>Hypnosis is another cognitive means that should be considered when advising patients. Hypnosis, like all cessation means, is relatively ineffective if used alone. It is only another tool in the arsenal of quitting, and it is not for every patient. Only those who truly believe in hypnosis and are not skeptical of alternative means will derive any assistance from hypnosis therapies. Likewise, it is important for these patients to have an active and supportive social network to help bolster their efforts. “Predictors of Smoking Abstinence Following a Single-Session Restructuring Intervention with Self-Hypnosis” define hypnosis as “a state of receptive, attentive concentration that facilitates adherence to a primary treatment strategy, but is not in and of itself a treatment.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0897190012460823">25</xref></sup> Practically, hypnosis works by helping to place a suggestion in the subconscious. This suggestion is to consider not smoking, to believe that one does not need a cigarette, to have belief in one’s own ability to quit, or some other positive reinforcing statement or belief to aid in smoking. In addition to hypnosis, there is an additional practice known as self-hypnosis. Self-hypnosis is a technique to reinforce the positive suggestions of the hypnosis sessions that is either self-lead or lead by a recording from the hypnosis provider.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0897190012460823">26</xref></sup> Self-hypnosis allows for home-based follow-up by the patient.</p>
<p>According to Wadden and Anderton in their “The Clinical Use of Hypnosis,” the technique is used for a variety of addictions and addictive behaviors, yet there is no single method that is shown to be preferred for hypnosis treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0897190012460823">25</xref></sup> Their findings are from the early 1980s and to their point, more research was needed and has occurred since this time. Charlap, in 1996, discusses a 2-session model with home-based self-hypnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0897190012460823">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0897190012460823">28</xref></sup> Regardless of specific method, each model that demonstrates promise as a means to stop smoking relies on a recurring therapy. Those patients who use the self-hypnosis technique ultimately reinforce the belief that they can succeed continually and derive up to 25% success 1 year after starting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0897190012460823">29</xref></sup>

<title>Traditional Pharmacologic Methods</title>
<p>Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation has remained constant in recent years. First-line therapy includes nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, and varenicline, with NRT being the oldest of the therapies. NRT dosage forms include gum, lozenges, patches, inhalers, and nasal sprays.</p>
<p>Bupropion, originally developed as an antidepressant, was approved for smoking cessation in the United States in 1997 and marketed under the name Zyban<sup>®</sup>. Varenicline, the first pharmacotherapy developed for smoking cessation, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006 and marketed under the name Chantix<sup>®</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0897190012460823">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0897190012460823">31</xref></sup> Studies have shown that NRT, bupropion, and varenicline are more efficacious verses placebo for smoking cessation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0897190012460823">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0897190012460823"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0897190012460823">34</xref></sup> However, success rates are not optimal and may be due to a variety of reasons, such as the absence of pharmacological therapy pairing with nonpharmacological interventions. When choosing the right pharmacotherapy, several factors should be considered including cost, adverse effects, ease of use, availability, and other preferences as detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0897190012460823">Table 2</xref>. Assessing such factors can aid a clinician and patient in choosing the best smoking cessation product. Most success has been seen when using more than 1 pharmacotherapy option or when using pharmacotherapy along with other modalities of smoking cessation like cognitive therapies or other novel methods. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0897190012460823">Table 3</xref> provides additional support and resources in each state for patients and pharmacists to support smoking cessation.</p>

<title>Electronic Cigarettes and Immunization: Future Alternatives</title>
<p>Electronic cigarettes were first introduced to the US market in 2007. Electronic cigarettes, also called e-cigarettes and sometimes referred to as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDSs), are increasing in frequency of use, as they are marketed as a “safer” or “healthier” alternative for smokers by manufacturers. These tobacco-free nicotine delivery devices are sold over the Internet, in convenience stores, mall kiosks, local flea markets, and in some drug stores (including large national chains). Electronic cigarettes are available in 3 different styles, either as a 1-piece disposable vaporizer with a nonrefillable nicotine cartridge, a 2-piece system composed of a rechargeable battery and a refillable cartridge, or a 3-piece kit which consists of a rechargeable battery, a nicotine cartridge, and an atomizer. Nicotine cartridges are advertised as having varying levels of nicotine (sometimes called nicotine density) for the user to choose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0897190012460823">35</xref></sup> The “vapor”—a term used to describe the person using an e-cigarette, since it is vapor that is inhaled rather than smoke—can either purchase a prefilled cartridge (which equals in use to about 1 pack of cigarettes), or refill reusable cartridges using the liquid nicotine mixture commonly referred to as e-juice. This liquid may contain a flavor, nicotine, or both; additives include herbal or vitamin supplements, such as ginseng or coenzyme-Q10. Many flavors in varying strengths are available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0897190012460823">35</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The mechanics of e-cigarette use are of simple design. An airflow sensor is activated by the smoker as the air is drawn in through the cigarette which then activates a heating element in an atomizer to vaporize the contents of the cartridge. The user inhales water vapor, rather than smoke (as in traditional tobacco products) containing nicotine. To simulate the flame of the cigarette, a small light-emitting diode glows at the end of the device, often in fashionable colors.</p>
<p>A majority of the devices are currently made in China. According to manufacturer websites, e-juice or e-liquid contains propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, distilled water, natural flavors, and nicotine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0897190012460823">36</xref></sup> However, in early 2009, the FDA’s Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis performed qualitative testing of 2 e-cigarette devices with 19 various cartridges and not only reported varying levels of nicotine but also detected varying levels of toxic substances like diethylene glycol and a number of carcinogenic impurities, such as <italic>N</italic>-nitrosonornicotine (NNN).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012460823">2</xref></sup> Some of these chemicals are nicotine degradants also found in traditional cigarettes and other tobacco products. Since little clinical data regarding these devices and their composition are available, their clinical utility is limited, necessitating the need for more studies to determine efficacy and safety before general use by the public.</p>
<p>ENDSs have been associated with recreational use by cigarette smokers because of similarities to the actual act of smoking, as they deliver nicotine, which satisfies the pharmacologic craving and addresses a behavioral need by mimicking the act of smoking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0897190012460823">37</xref></sup> An online survey by Siegel et al explored the potential for use of e-cigarettes in smoking cessation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0897190012460823">38</xref></sup> According to an anonymous e-mail survey of 216 first-time electronic cigarette buyers, smoking habits were examined 7 months after their initial purchase, 31.0% of respondents reported abstinence in smoking cigarettes, and more than one-third (34.3%) claimed to be completely nicotine-free. Bullen et al examined the effect of electronic cigarettes on user craving to smoke as well as the preference when compared to a nicotine inhaler.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0897190012460823">39</xref></sup> They reported that ENDSs were more effective in reducing the desire to smoke in the first 15 minutes when compared to the nicotine inhaler, and over the first hour of use as effectively as the nicotine inhaler. Electronic cigarettes also appeared to deliver nicotine faster and more efficiently, possibly due to the absorption via respiratory tract versus via buccal absorption from the nicotine inhaler.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0897190012460823">40</xref></sup> A study by Polosa et al examined the effects of electronic cigarettes on smoking reduction and cessation over 24 weeks. However, the study was performed with subjects who were not interested in smoking cessation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0897190012460823">41</xref></sup> After 24 weeks, 32.5% of study participants reported at least 50% reduction in cigarette smoking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0897190012460823">41</xref></sup> The results of this trial suggest that current smokers may be willing to switch to e-cigarette use to decrease their cigarette use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0897190012460823">40</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Future clinical trials assessing these devices may provide another avenue to manage risk factors for smokers who are not currently willing to quit. At this time there are no studies that compare the effectiveness of ENDSs to other methods of smoking cessation. A notable reason for low use is the FDA’s regulatory status or lack of quality management of these devices. Presently, the FDA intends to develop guidelines for regulation of e-cigarettes under the federal rules that apply to tobacco products (not medical devices) after the ruling of the US Court of appeals for the DC Circuit in the case Sottera v. FDA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0897190012460823">42</xref></sup> Because of this ruling, manufacturers are not able to market their product as a smoking cessation device, as it would be considered a therapeutic device and thus would fall under stricter FDA monitoring. More studies will need to be performed to confirm the relevance of e-cigarettes in smoking cessation, but current research points to many exciting possibilities.</p>
<p>The popularity of e-cigarettes is on the rise as many marketers advertise the use of these devices as more socially acceptable in comparison to regular tobacco products, even encouraging their use in smoke-free zones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0897190012460823">43</xref></sup> Some communities have already banned these devices in workplaces and in public buildings by adding them to their regulations covering cigarettes and other tobacco products. The awareness of ENDS has doubled in the past couple of years, with the greatest increase among current smokers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0897190012460823">43</xref></sup> With FDA regulation and additional supporting clinical evidence, electronic cigarettes may provide an alternative to smoking when used long term and medical practitioners may consider expanding smoking cessation programs to include smoking reduction or switching patients to e-cigarettes. Large, well-designed, long-term studies need to be conducted to examine the efficacy of smoking cessation programs that include the use of e-cigarettes.</p>
<p>Another potential future alternative is a nicotine immunization to cease all cigarette and nicotine cravings effectively and quickly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0897190012460823">44</xref></sup> With the anticipated craving reduction, an easy smoking cessation would follow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0897190012460823">45</xref></sup> Celtic Pharma, Novartis-Cytos, Nabi, and Chilka Pharmaceuticals have researched and developed a nicotine immunization. The methods for generating the immunologic response and production of the vaccine vary across the 4 biotechnology companies. The biological effect is produced by causing an immunologic response to nicotine; it is then quarantined by nicotine-specific antibodies causing a reduction in available nicotine to illicit a response in the CNS and a reduction in response in the previously aforementioned dopamine reward pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0897190012460823">45</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Nabi’s “NicVAX” is further along in the investigative process, into phase III. Nabi found smoking cessation to be comparable to a placebo at about 11% at 12 months, demonstrating no clinical efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0897190012460823">39</xref></sup> Additionally, the dosing schedule is unclear and projected to be up to 6 injections at a cost of at least $300 to as much as $1600 per injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0897190012460823">46</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Clinical trials for approval of the vaccine have stalled, for the majority, in phase II and in 1 case phase III of their approval process. The results for all products indicate that the premise remains sound, but the use of a vaccine must be limited to another option as part of a cessation plan and not a stand-alone method. Nabi has realized this idea that immunization is only part of the cessation process and as such is studying immunization in conjunction with varenicline in the Netherlands and is expected to release results in late 2012.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>When working with smoking cessation patients, pharmacists should strive to prevent and/or reduce the number of relapse episodes. Pharmacists are easily accessible and have a variety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy options to utilize as well as the basic training to counsel and direct patients regarding therapies. A successful strategy in achieving complete smoking cessation is to match the individual patient’s needs with the appropriate combination of cessation therapies from the toolbox.</p>
