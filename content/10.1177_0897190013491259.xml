<body>
<p>The great American physician, writer and Harvard Professor Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809-1894) once said:<disp-quote>
<p>The great thing in the world is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are moving. And I think we are moving in the right direction.</p>
</disp-quote>As your President, I discussed over these past 12 months an incredible change occurring in our profession. This transition has been possible in part due to a more innovative philosophy and dogged lobbying to our NYS lawmakers.</p>
<sec id="section1-0897190013491259">
<title>An Innovative Philosophy: The Pharmacy Practice Model Initiative</title>
<p>The efforts of ASHP and the ASHP Foundation helped actualize its 2020 vision through the Pharmacy Practice Model Initiative (PPMI). That is, using technology, pharmacy technicians, and residency training, among others, to create a foundation to further implement a direction for our profession that has been as obvious to me as my bald spot is to my barber: That we will always know more about medications than physicians and other health care providers—Period. Not a question mark, comma, or a semicolon. Our education and training puts us on top as leaders of medication management within our health systems, our interdisciplinary teams, and our patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0897190013491259">
<title>Legislative Action</title>
<p>Our organization has been instrumental in advancing 2 important legislative agendas, Collaborative Drug Therapy Management (CDTM) and the advancement of technicians in New York State. Again, allowing pharmacists to use their expertise in medication management more independently and getting in line with many other states in our country in taking advantage of an underutilized resource and a basic foundation in our departments, our technicians.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0897190013491259">
<title>So How Are We Doing?</title>
<p>What has the New York State Council of Health-system Pharmacists (NYSCHP) done to move the PPMI model forward?
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>
<underline>Residents and Residency Training</underline>: Residency programs have grown in NYS, allowing our institutions to take advantage of the experience and skills of over 140 residents per year. The NYSCHP has included both PGY1 and PGY2 residents to participate and present in our local chapter and state meetings and created the basics of a residency task force to ask the question on how the NYSCHP can attract and retain residents in our organization.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<underline>Technology</underline>: A Technology Task Force will be created this summer to determine how we can make the best use of technology in creating more time for our pharmacists to provide direct patient care and provide the tools necessary to optimize that care.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<underline>Education</underline>: The Council continues to sponsor excellent educational programming with no better example than this weekend’s program. And I am happy to announce that through the efforts of Joe Pinto, Director of Education and Workforce Development, we are currently working on a jointly sponsored educational program with the states of New Jersey and Connecticut. </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<underline>Technicians</underline>: Led by the efforts of Chris Jadoch, JD, RPh, Vice-President for Public Policy, James Lytle, JD, and the New York State Board of Pharmacy, we have finalized a proposal to amend the education law, in relation to the registration certification of pharmacy technicians and will work to get this bill on New York State’s legislative agenda. Not only is this is crucial to our transition to a fundamentally changed pharmacy practice model, it will improve the overall safety of our patients. You need look no further than this year’s Annual Assembly educational programming and our keynote speaker to see how important it is to register, certify, and better educate our technicians.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<underline>CDTM</underline>: On May 17, 2011, Governor Cuomo signed into law legislation giving NYS pharmacists the opportunity to provide collaborative drug therapy with physicians. In my mind, this is the most significant change in the practice of pharmacy in New York in quite some time. Earlier last year, the NYSCHP anticipated rapid development of CDTM-based clinics and hence sponsored a conference to help move these programs along. A bit surprising, but understandably, the mind was willing, but the body, well it just didn’t move as fast. Protocol development, credentialing, changes in medical staff bylaws, reimbursement issues, and just plain acceptance by our health-system colleagues and <underline>ourselves</underline> made the initial steps quite difficult for many institutions. Hence, a second CDTM summit held in February, hosted by our GNYHA colleagues, helped to provide ideas, challenges and reimbursement ideas for NYS health systems wishing to initiate CDTM practices.</p>

</p>
<p>So how did we do? I’ll let you be the judge.</p>
<p>Someone near and dear to all of us once said, “Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don’t matter and those who matter don’t mind.” It’s not enough to be a leader, it’s to <underline>know</underline> you are that leader, that expert in pharmacotherapy.</p>
<p>I was honored to have been able to travel to all 7 of New York State pharmacy schools to speak to over 800 pharmacy students about how to live their lives as confident optimists and to not be a TGIFer (“Thank God It’s Friday”). I would tell the students that if this friend of ours was a pharmacist, he might tell them that they are in the midst of an exciting transition in pharmacy and to go and grab the opportunities that await them. They need to consider themselves as leaders in medication management. This is just a great time for our profession! (By the way, that dear friend of ours? Well, that was the American writer, poet, and cartoonist, Dr. Seuss [1904-1991].)</p>
<p>So that’s why I need to tell you that it’s OUR job, all this in room, to mentor our residents and students and show them the importance of leadership and professional organizations. Remember, you can’t teach leadership in a classroom, you have to teach it by example. And that is the very reason why we developed and implemented an ongoing Leadership Development Program for our current and future Council leaders. Implementing a change in our profession will require us to change the way in which all health care professionals view pharmacists and how they deliver medication-related care. This will invariably require enhanced skill in how we communicate to patients, our colleagues, and health care administrators and how we build that confidence that comes with knowing that we <underline>are</underline> medication experts. Providing a series of lectures or seminars to achieve these and related goals can provide needed tools to develop as more effective and successful leaders. The second of our series is on Saturday, right after the keynote.</p>
<p>Finally, in May of last year, I emphasized that in order to transition in our new health care environment, we have to, as Mahatma Gandhi said, “become that change we want to see.” Have we? I don’t know about you, but when I think back on my travels around our great state of ours, I can only smile and be that confident optimist. We made a great start over the past year and have great momentum as I pass the gavel to President-elect Halim.</p>
<p>So in closing, I just want to thank a few folks for making this year so rewarding:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>For the patience and diligence of Debra, Carol, and Jill at the Council office. You did a great job at making me look good. And you can’t get any better than that.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>To my Montefiore colleagues, especially to my friend and soon-to-be fellow Past-President Frank Sosno-wski. I learned and continue to learn leadership by example.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>To the guys that did all the work, my Board of Directors. You know, I had the easy job. All of our success, all the cool stuff that happened this year either came from or was coordinated by those 11 individuals. It wasn’t me, I was just this year’s quarterback. Do me a favor and make sure to thank them. </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Lastly, and most importantly, I thank you, the leaders and members of this terrific organization. Over the past 12 months, I traveled over 5,000 miles across New York. I want to thank you for your support in my efforts, whether it be while lecturing at our pharmacy schools, attending the inaugural pharmacy gala in Rochester, my presentation to the NY Board of Pharmacy in Buffalo or to the successful Champions campaign evidenced by increases in membership in all the chapters I visited. It wasn’t me; it was you who made this all happen. I was just lucky to represent you. </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>And lastly to my wonderful wife Merrette: Honey, I’m comin home for dinner.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Dr. Suess also said, “If you never did you should. These things are fun and fun is good.” He got that one right. It was an honor and a privilege to be your President in 2012-2103. Thank you for the opportunity.</p>
