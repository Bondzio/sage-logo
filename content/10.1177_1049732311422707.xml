<abstract>
<p>In this plenary address, I introduce the Global Congress for Qualitative Health Research, its purpose, and its role internationally. Within this context, I explore the origins and development of qualitative health research, the content of qualitative health research, its components, and its contribution to health research. I argue that qualitative inquiry develops in levels, building from exploration and description of phenomena to the identification of concepts, the theoretical basis for quantitative inquiry, qualitative theory development, and to utilization, implementation, and evaluation. This incremental development is not purposefully planned, but occurs as a result of voluminous inquiry into similar topics using different qualitative approaches and designs. A single study rarely makes a breakthrough; rather, we must recognize the conglomerate of qualitative studies that give it validity and strength. The Global Congress for Qualitative Health Research will provide a forum for international collaboration for the development of qualitative health research.</p>

<body>
<p>Thank you for your kind invitation to present to this opening plenary on this significant occasion. The Global Congress for Qualitative Health Research (GCQHR) is not a formal organization: there are no fees; no memberships. We are not incorporated in any one country. We are not tied to a single university or organization. Rather, it can best be described as a movement. The GCQHR belongs to you, and will become whatever it needs to be. At the moment, our program consists of conferences addressing qualitative health research supported by each volunteer host—this year, so wonderfully, by Ewha Womans University in Seoul, Korea. Next year, in 2012, we will meet in Milan, Italy.</p>
<p>Today, I invite you to reflect about what all this fuss is about, and why it is important. Let us consider:</p>
<list id="list1-1049732311422707" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What is qualitative health research? Where did it come from, and why?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What does qualitative research in health contribute to our understanding of illness and of health?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How do qualitative findings contribute to the development of mainstream knowledge?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How do we continue to build the subdiscipline of qualitative health research?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These are important questions, challenging questions; but if we cannot answer these questions affirmatively, then we should leave now, quietly.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732311422707">
<title>What is Qualitative Health Research?</title>
<p>First, let us clarify our field with a definition:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Qualitative health research is an inductive research approach used for exploring health and illness. It considers the perspective of the people themselves, rather than the researcher’s perspective. Researchers use qualitative inquiry to elicit emotions and perspectives, beliefs and values, and actions and behaviors for the purpose of understanding the participants’ responses to health and illness, the meanings they construct about the experience, and their subsequent actions.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1049732311422707">
<title>Where Did it Come From, and Why?</title>
<p>From the 1950s to the 1970s, the health professions were focused primarily on tasks, and our texts were pragmatic sets of instructions. Meanwhile, such disciplines as sociology, anthropology, and psychology were using qualitative methods, such as ethnography in anthropology, and ethnomethodology in sociology contributed the groundwork for developing behavioral concepts. Some of these concepts were of relevance to the disciplines interested in behavioral concepts of health and illness, such as empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311422707">Rogers, 1951</xref>) and stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311422707">Goffman, 1963</xref>).</p>
<p>Nursing was the first of the health care disciplines to adopt qualitative research. Recognizing the fundamental importance of qualitative inquiry, a small cohort of nurses with doctorates in anthropology and sociology struggled to introduce qualitative methods into nursing. I will refer to these researchers as the first generation, and they were in two main clusters: nurse-anthropologists, and the grounded theorists at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).</p>
<sec id="section3-1049732311422707">
<title>The Nurse-Anthropologists: Culture and Health</title>
<p>The nurse-anthropologists were primarily Madeleine Leininger, Pamela Brink, Agnes Aamodt, and Marguerita Kay, using ethnographic methods, and initially focusing on the interaction of cultural influences on health. This work led to the development of transcultural nursing as a subdiscipline in nursing, and included the use of ethnographic methods.</p>
<p>The first transcultural books for nursing were Leininger’s <italic>Two Worlds to Blend</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311422707">1970</xref>), Brink’s edited volume, <italic>Transcultural Nursing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311422707">1976</xref>), and Leininger’s <italic>Trans-cultural Nursing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311422707">1979</xref>)—the proceedings of the first three transcultural nursing conferences. The lobbying of these nurse-anthropologists for the incorporation of qualitative methods into nursing had an important influence on the acceptability of qualitative research methods.</p>
<p>Until 1985, nurses used qualitative research methods from anthropology, sociology, or education. The first qualitative research methods books for nursing were published in 1985 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311422707">Field &amp; Morse, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311422707">Leininger, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311422707">Parse, Coyne, &amp; Smith, 1985</xref>), and gradually qualitative research methods became introduced into nursing programs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732311422707">
<title>The UCSF School of Grounded Theory</title>
<p>In the late 1960s, Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss joined the Department of Nursing at the University of California, San Francisco to assist with developing their doctoral research. With a cadre of nurses—first, and most notably, Jeanne C. Quint (later Jeanne Quint Benoliel)—they developed grounded theory. The first studies were conducted on death and dying, and were published as monographs: <italic>Awareness of Dying</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311422707">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1965</xref>) and <italic>A Time for Dying</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311422707">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1968</xref>). The methodological text was <italic>The Discovery of Grounded Theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311422707">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>), which is still in print!</p>
<p>Glaser and Strauss mentored a cohort of doctoral students in both conducting research and publishing extensively. Their students continue to develop grounded-theory methods, to publish, to conduct inquiry, and to mentor students internationally. Of note are Julie Corbin, Barbara Bowers (with Lennie Schatzman), Phyllis Stern, Adele Clarke, and Kathy Charmaz (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311422707">Morse et al., 2009</xref>). The contributions of this second generation will be addressed later.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732311422707">
<title>Phenomenology</title>
<p>In the 1970s, phenomenology filtered across the Atlantic from Europe, first to the University of Pittsburg through Amedeo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311422707">Giorgi (1970)</xref>, and then, in the 1980s, as hermeneutic phenomenology practiced by Max <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311422707">van Manen (1990)</xref> at the University of Alberta. The “pull” factor within nursing and health was in their students from health professions who were interested in the meanings of health, caring, and caregiving. Van Manen, whose primary appointment was in education, mentored nurses for several decades, making a strong contribution to qualitative health research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732311422707">
<title>The Second Generation of Nurse Researchers</title>
<p>By the 1990s, qualitative methods had separated from culture per se, and were being applied to all patients and nursing in general. The second generation of nurse-researchers were those of us who were lucky enough to obtain a PhD in nursing and to learn methods from nurses who understood health as a context of inquiry. These second-generation researchers taught courses in qualitative methods, and established texts.</p>
<p>These nurses are now leaders in qualitative methodology. They have produced a large number of studies that contribute to the theoretical basis of nursing; they have identified unique processes and concepts that are specific to nursing, and educated a large number of doctoral and postdoctoral students to continue and expand this work as the third generation. Their publications and methods spread to the other health disciplines: social work, physical therapy, family medicine, and psychiatry. Groups of faculty at universities included Allen Young and Margaret Lock at McGill University; Noel Chrisman at the University of Washington, and Arthur Kleinman and Byron Good at Harvard University.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732311422707">
<title>The Internationalization of Qualitative Methodology</title>
<p>By the mid-1990s, the demand for qualitative methods was worldwide. Although qualitative researchers still had problems obtaining research funding and sometimes received rejections from journals for inappropriate reasons, researchers themselves were recognizing the place of qualitative inquiry in research, and demanding more than texts and short courses associated with conferences; they were demanding a means to obtain qualitative expertise. The major contributions of the second generation of qualitative researchers include the following:</p>
<sec id="section8-1049732311422707">
<title>Development of the Qualitative Health Research journal</title>
<p>The first issue was published in 1991, and the journal is now in Volume 22. <italic>QHR</italic> is published monthly, totaling about 168 articles per year. Although it has an international editorial board and international reviewers, it is, unfortunately, published only in English.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732311422707">
<title>Development of specialty texts in qualitative health research methods</title>
<p>The next achievement was the development of a number of methodological texts—both general qualitative methods for health researchers, and single-method texts (phenomenology, grounded theory, and so forth) for health professionals. Some of these texts have been translated into other languages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732311422707">
<title>Establishment of the IIQM</title>
<p>The International Institute for Qualitative Methodology was established in 1997 at the University of Alberta, Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311422707">Morse, 2008</xref>). Its structure was important; it was linked to nine international sites, which, in turn, supported the development of qualitative inquiry throughout their regions by linking to universities that were geographically proximal or linguistically similar. By 2007, 115 universities were linked in this way.</p>
<p>What did the IIQM accomplish? The IIQM programs were year round, and targeted toward training and development of qualitative methods and dissemination of qualitative inquiry.</p>
<sec id="section11-1049732311422707">
<title>Established international conferences</title>
<p>These were held annually, one in Canada—Qualitative Health Research (now in its 17th), and one internationally—Advances in Qualitative Methods (now in its 12th).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732311422707">
<title>Disseminated methods</title>
<p>Dissemination of qualitative methods for health research was a priority: Faculty published methods texts and articles. The IIQM established an online journal,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1049732311422707">1</xref></sup> <italic>The International Journal of Qualitative Methods</italic>, with international editors and an international review board, so that articles could be submitted in any language, reviewed in that language, and then posted online in both English and the original language. Unfortunately, in 2008 this reverted to an English- language journal with French and Spanish abstracts. Nevertheless, we now know that such an ideal model is possible. The IIQM also published a monograph series focusing on full-length qualitative studies, and established an annual dissertation award, publishing excellent dissertations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732311422707">
<title>Conducted research and developed qualitative methods</title>
<p>IIQM staff applied for grants and published articles and texts addressing problems in qualitative methods. For instance, in 2001, an edited book titled <italic>The Nature of Qualitative Evidence</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311422707">Morse, Swanson, &amp; Kuzel, 2001</xref>) was the product of a seminar.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049732311422707">
<title>Collaborated internationally for training in qualitative methods</title>
<p>The IIQM hosted a residency program, and also a training program—EQUIPP (Enhancing Qualitative Understanding of Illness Processes and Prevention)—for pre- and postdoctoral fellows. A training program for visiting scholars and postdoctoral fellows was also available, with many international faculty. By 2007, international sites expanded regionally, to 115 universities. Regional conferences and workshops were held; they established their own journals, and supported qualitative health researchers with their university linkages. The IIQM was rapidly followed by the establishment of short courses in various qualitative methods in other regions; qualitative courses were introduced at the graduate level, and fast become mainstream.</p>

<sec id="section15-1049732311422707">
<title>The Third Generation of Qualitative Researchers</title>
<p>We have not quite solved all of the problems; there is still much to do. The third generation will be busy in the next decade. There remains a need for more substantive theory—more practice-based theory, more applied theory. There is much to be done in the development of qualitative methods, the refinement of processes of analysis, and so forth. The drive for qualitative inquiry still comes from North America, although there have been great strides from researchers in Australia, Britain, Scandinavia, and other regions. Because of different cultures and contexts of health and illness, there is a need for targeted theory to be produced from other regions, including China, South Korea, Thailand, and Japan—although producing culturally specific theories for particular ethnic groups is starting to take a stronger hold and may be more advanced than I realize. As I see it, the problems are:</p>
<list id="list2-1049732311422707" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Although qualitative inquiry is becoming stronger, its role in knowledge development is poorly understood and underappreciated, even by qualitative researchers themselves.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fragmentation caused by different languages inhibits united collaboration, so we have streams of inquiry, with little appreciation or cross- fertilization internationally.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lacking articulation of the importance of the contribution of qualitative inquiry; we are left unappreciated, underutilized, and often misunderstood. Qualitative findings may be ignored.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The onus is on us, on qualitative researchers, to present our case for qualitative inquiry, and to explicate how qualitative inquiry fits into knowledge development in general and internationally. This is our first and most urgent task in the continual development of qualitative inquiry.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1049732311422707">
<title>What Does Qualitative Health Research Do?</title>
<p>Of course qualitative health research addresses content about health and assisting the ill, saving lives—but so does quantitative health research. What are the unique contributions of qualitative research findings?</p>
<sec id="section17-1049732311422707">
<title>Provides Understanding</title>
<p>First, qualitative research focuses on the sensitizing and humanizing issues in health and illness. We include emotions in our analysis, and do not “factor out” the suffering. Although we boast that our research is holistic, we actually focus on particular concepts or processes within context, so that it is not entirely holistic. Such descriptions provide caregivers with understanding, and some consider this the only “purpose” attributed to qualitative inquiry, for without the systematic investigation into the meaning of illness and health, our care would lack humanistic perspectives. Denying the person, care may become abusive—or perceived as abuse. Care that lacks consideration of the person is rejected by our patients, and refused care renders care useless.</p>
<p>We have been taught that care must always be person-centered, individualized, provided within the patient’s developmental and cultural frame of reference. Explanations must be intelligible, and permission and consent obtained. How do we obtain information that will provide us with adequate understanding of our patients, so as to provide person-centered care? In the clinical arena, some will tell you it is obtained from experience. Experienced nurses are able to shortcut—they use intuition, they multitask with extraordinary insight, they call on a vast bank of experience to make sense of the situation and know how to respond. Others will tell you that understanding another is a part of common sense, part of being human, or part of being themselves a sensitive nurse, and able to put themselves in the patient’s position. But I will tell you that the caregiver–patient relationship is more that trial and error—more than learning by experience, or than identifying with a patient. Nursing has bungled along for decades, and seems to be getting by, but we can do better: with clinically based, qualitative theories guiding our care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1049732311422707">
<title>Enables Microanalytic Description of Mechanisms</title>
<p>Qualitative inquiry enables the thick or rich description of microanalytic behaviors. Some methods are specially attuned for such purposes, such as conversation analysis, or microanalysis using video recordings. Of importance, these descriptive methods allow the investigator to understand what is happening on the surface, but do not provide data regarding the meaning of the event. For instance, we may use these methods to slow a videotape and show the actual action of touch, but such data will not provide any information about the meaning of being touched as perceived by the participant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1049732311422707">
<title>Enables Documentation of Trajectories and Change</title>
<p>Qualitative inquiry enables rich descriptions of change over time, while at the same time attending to the mechanism of change. Detailed descriptions of the transition points show the rationale or instigator for change, provide a microanalysis of the mechanism for change, and a rich description on the changed state. Grounded theory also provides a mechanism for analyzing the process that holds the phenomena together.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1049732311422707">
<title>Identifies and Develops Concepts</title>
<p>Concepts are collections of behaviors that cluster together for a particular purpose, and have been defined and given a name. They enable us to communicate, and enable application, investigation, and the recognition of future occurrences. Qualitative research provides the tools for the observational, interview, and textual analysis to explore the phenomena, and to delineate concepts, their attributes, and their interaction with other concepts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1049732311422707">
<title>Develops Models and Theories</title>
<p>Models and theories are targeted on health and illness. They enable qualitative assessment, quantification, and manipulation, as well the conduct of epidemiological studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1049732311422707">
<title>Enables Correction of Inquiry and Quantification</title>
<p>Finally, qualitative inquiry enables the expansion of the use—or correction of the misuse—of the application of research findings. It enables the examination of quantitative theory and its epidemiological application, and testing on large data sets. These are very essential functions in knowledge development. The problem is, we have not described the process of how this occurs, and in doing so explained the importance of our work.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1049732311422707">
<title>Qualitative Health Research in Action</title>
<p>Qualitative inquiry provides the knowledge for the provision of person-centered care, so that care may be collaborative and acceptable to the patient. Such care is effective and efficient. Our patients are compliant, comfortable, and feel safe. We make care safer by modifying the caregiving practices, and even save lives. We bring the plight of the vulnerable forward, into our agenda for health and social policy. We advocate. We support, build, and modify appropriate hope; we comfort the family and, as partners, support their caregiving. We care for the dying and the bereaved. We nurse communities, exploring problems such as homelessness, abusive relationships, and the plight of the elderly, thus making families, neighbors, and community organizations healthier. And when there are special crises, we stand in the front line to assist, some even doing qualitative research to learn from our mistakes and prevent recurrences.</p>
<p>For instance: Qualitative researchers will have an enormous contribution to make in the rebuilding of Japan—not necessarily the structure of the country—the bridges, hospitals, schools, and houses—but the families, and communities. The reconstruction of healthy families and communities, one could argue, is more important than the physical structures that make a town, but such reconstruction usually receives far less funding or attention from governments. We could take this one step further: Perhaps the funding for social concerns is less than that for essential physical structures, simply because we do not know what to do. This is the place of qualitative inquiry—to develop and provide such a vital social roadmap. Of course, sewers and water supplies, schools and roads are important, but not necessarily more important than the ability of the citizens to recuperate, to learn to laugh, to suffer healthfully, to rebuild families, and to feel safe again.</p>

<p>These categories covered the landscape of health research, and provide a firm descriptive and interpretative foundation for epidemiological and other quantitative health research. They provide important insights into health from microanalytic processes to the development of theories. But how this actually occurs has not yet been described.</p>

<title>How Do Qualitative Findings Develop Mainstream Knowledge?</title>
<p>The major and constant criticism of qualitative inquiry in general, but especially of qualitative health research, remains: It is said that it is weak and probably invalid. It is insignificant; we work with small samples, purposefully selected, and even though we boast holism, we work with delineated topics that are isolated from the complexity of reality. We do not replicate, arguing that our work, if conducted rigorously, is correct as is. Today, I will not defend these accusations—many have done so, working to counter these criticisms. As qualitative researchers, we must be the first to move forward with confidence, and consider qualitative inquiry to be solid, valid, and correct. Therefore, let us examine the place of qualitative inquiry in knowledge development, and the mechanism by which this occurs.</p>
<p>Knowledge develops slowly and in clusters. It is rare that a seminal study leapfrogs to a position of influence and remains as a milestone. No matter how important you think your dissertation is, it will probably make its mark by adding strength incrementally to a number of similar studies. This is how all knowledge develops, although sometimes a cluster of studies may go “off course,” and need to be corrected. Qualitative research is no different. Qualitative research goes through phases of development to clinical application. As studies around a topic accrue, they go through phases, changes in scope and in focus, as the concepts and theories develop. As this knowledge becomes more accepted, researchers become more certain. Let us examine this process more closely.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1049732311422707">
<title>The Incremental Development of Qualitative Knowledge</title>
<p>I have identified eight phases of the development of qualitative knowledge, from the investigation of a phenomenon to the implementation of an intervention. I will use examples from the literature on hope to illustrate the types of studies used in each level or phase.</p>
<sec id="section27-1049732311422707">
<title>Level 1: Identification of Significant Concepts</title>
<p>Initially, qualitative studies are conducted to examine an interesting phenomenon or process in a particular clinical situation, to see “what is going on.” These studies often use phenomenology, ethnography, or narrative analysis, and from the developed categories or themes the concepts inherent in the phenomenon are identified. Some of these concepts may be obvious and already named as lay or even as scientific concepts; others may be so new that they must be named, described, and delineated, using qualitative methods from the next phase.</p>
<p>Hope was identified as an important concept in the illness experience in the 1980s and early 1990s. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311422707">McCann (2002)</xref> found that nurses “uncovered hope” in clients with schizophrenia, and Samson and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732311422707">2008</xref>) found that hope was evident among parents of a child suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which was indicative of “how the parents were coping and adjusting.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1049732311422707">
<title>Level 2: Description of the Concept(s)</title>
<p>In the next series of studies, researchers specifically target the concept of interest using various methods of concept analysis, or methods that enable its description and delineation. The attributes (characteristics), the boundaries, the antecedents of hope, and the consequences of hope are identified and delineated.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311422707">Morse and Doberneck (1995)</xref> delineated the characteristics of hoping. In order for hope to exist, one must always feel a threat, identify a hoped-for goal to remove oneself from the threat, and develop a plan to work toward that goal. Those who are working toward a hoped-for goal build a support system, avoid those who are skeptical and nonsupportive, and endure the process. They seek signs that they are on the right course, and if they are not achieving their goal, they return to despair to correct their plan and try other strategies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-1049732311422707">
<title>Level 3: Studying the Concept in Different Situations</title>
<p>Researchers now begin their study by targeting a concept rather than waiting for the concept to emerge inductively in the process of data collection. Rather than a study of, for instance, coming out of bereavement, the researcher targets hope, and begins the study by searching the literature using the concept of hope as a key term, as well as searching for literature pertaining to the concept “in use”—in this case, in bereavement.</p>
<sec id="section30-1049732311422707">
<title>Contexts</title>
<p>Studies appear comparing the use of the concept by examining perspectives of different genders, or participants in different developmental stages (for instance, as manifest in children, the elderly, or other age groups). Researchers may also examine the concept as it is used in individual and in family groups, in different ethnic groups, or in other settings.</p>
<p>Hope was something that occurred in interactions between physicians and patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311422707">Wong-Wylie &amp; Jevne, 1997</xref>) that acquired a numerical meaning when information was given (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311422707">Thorne, Hislop, Kuo, &amp; Armstrong, 2006</xref>). The process of hoping continued to be explored in intensive care units (ICU; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311422707">Verhaeghe, van Zuuren, Defloor, Duijnstee, &amp; Grypdonck, 2007</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311422707">1993</xref>, Laskiwski and Morse noted that hope was not a static concept, but a concept that changed as relatives and the patient came to accept the reality of their illness. Other authors later came to record the process and course from despair to hope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311422707">Krueger, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-1049732311422707">
<title>Conditions</title>
<p>By studying the concept in different conditions, I refer to how the concept is used or appears in patients suffering from various illnesses: how the concept is manipulated by those with different diseases, prognoses, and disabilities; studies about how hope is used in suffering from cancer, with HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311422707">Harris, &amp; Larsen, 2008</xref>), or in AIDs dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311422707">Kelly, 2007</xref>). There have been studies exploring hope in caregiving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311422707">Holtslander &amp; Duggleby, 2009</xref>), and so forth. These studies are different from Level-1 studies (identifying the phenomena), as they state clearly that they are studying the use of concept <italic>x</italic> in patients with a particular condition, rather than exploring the phenomena (patients with a particular condition) to see what concepts are present and then identifying their characteristics. That is, these studies are targeted on the concept, almost working deductively with a scaffold as a framework, seeking to describe the concept and its attributes, as it is “in use.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-1049732311422707">
<title>Cultures</title>
<p>Exploring the concept cross-culturally—how it is manifest by different cultural groups, or subcultural groups such as those living in poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311422707">Krueger, 2009</xref>), and so forth—is important. If the concept and its anatomy (i.e., the concept’s structure, its attributes, boundaries, antecedents, and consequences) appear, then the concept is not a culturally bound concept, but a universal concept. This is an important step in inquiry. It does not mean that if the concept appears locally, used only by particular groups, or in some cultures, that it is not significant. Rather, it is an important finding for the understanding and teaching of health in that particular country or culture. These types of studies do not appear quickly in the literature. We are speaking of at least a decade of work, and many, many qualitative publications.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section33-1049732311422707">
<title>Level 4: Exploring the Relationship of the Concept With Other Cooccurring Concepts</title>
<p>Here the researcher deliberately designs the investigation to examine the interaction between the concept of interest and other cooccuring concepts. Ideally, the investigator should explore the independence or the mergence of the concept, asking: In what ways do the attributes of each concept interact? When change occurs, in what ways do the concepts move—do they move in tangent, or remain separate? Does one concept change the other? Do they cross, run parallel in the process? Or do both change to form another concept? For instance, if we are exploring emerging from suffering, and the concept at the intersection of emotional suffering is hope, we can examine the attributes of each concept during the transition, and see how “hope seeps in,” changes and replaces emotional suffering (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311422707">Morse &amp; Penrod, 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section34-1049732311422707">
<title>Level 5: Conducting a Metasynthesis</title>
<p>It is at this point, when the concept is moving toward maturity and has been described in many qualitative studies in various contexts, that researchers should consider conducting metasyntheses. Researchers have enough data (i.e., studies of the various previously described types) from enough perspectives to determine that the conceptual attributes (or characteristics) will be present in every case. As we know that variations in the strength or variations in the role of the attributes give rise to different forms of the concept, it should be relatively easy at this point to identify the types or forms of the concept(s) of interest. Patterns of hope will be evident, such as “hoping for a chance for a chance” (in a heart transplant unit), or “hoping against hope” (for women who are 5-year survivors of breast cancer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311422707">Morse &amp; Doberneck, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In such metasyntheses, researchers compare and contrast all definitions and attributes (identified according to types and settings) to determine which are common to all studies and which are context-bound, or perhaps a serendipitous “error.” Again, this step enables the researchers to identify universal vs. culture-bound concepts, and to remove the “noise” (i.e., “mock” attributes, or those associated with one set of particular circumstances). Later, when the research in one particular setting becomes adequate, metasyntheses belonging to particular contexts or illness conditions may appear in the literature. For instance, Duggleby and her colleagues conducted a study on hope as experienced by family caregivers of persons with chronic illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311422707">Duggleby et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section35-1049732311422707">
<title>Level 6: Model and Theory Development</title>
<p>Next, qualitative researchers begin model building by examining and identifying internal processes, mechanisms, and their linkages. At this point, concepts are more than labels to a qualitative researcher. We are interested in the strength and interactions of the attributes, and what the concept does therapeutically. As collections of behaviors, concepts are not static, but change their form to fit a particular situation. Exploring the process of development and utilization of the concepts, researchers explore the internal mechanisms and the interrelationships of the attributes, usually using grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311422707">Forbes, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311422707">Morse &amp; Doberneck, 1995</xref>). Researchers examine studies exploring how the concept is used, how hope is manipulated and supported by nurses and physicians in the provision of care, by relatives in interactions or lay caregiving, and by the patient within his or her beliefs, faith, spirituality, and religion, and thereby leading to solid mid-range theory. Furthermore, if hopes do not eventuate, hope theory states that the person may identify another goal, and the process continues or begins again.</p>
<p>This process may be extended to exploring linking the concept with other concepts, and how attributes and the boundary of the concepts link and become parts of other concepts. Concepts are “opened,” and the common or shared characteristics are where the two concepts join. We study how concepts change during trajectories, and how strength and ordering of the attributes change as, for instance, the researcher moves through the process, focused on the concepts, hence developing an emerging model. For instance, the attributes of hope may be also linked with attributes of other concepts, thus creating an expanded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311422707">Morse &amp; Penrod, 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section36-1049732311422707">
<title>Level 7: Assessment and Measurement</title>
<p>By this phase, quantitative researchers may have become interested in our concepts; they may be developing questionnaires and instruments to measure the concept, to determine its prevalence epidemiologically, and designing quantitative experiments to test emerging hypotheses. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311422707">1992</xref>, Kay Herth developed an <italic>Abbreviated Instrument to Measure Hope</italic>. Later, the Herth Scale was translated into Spanish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311422707">Arnau, Martinez, de Guzmán, Herth, &amp; Konishi, 2010</xref>). Qualitative findings may be used for the qualitative development of assessment guides, and using “converted” data as behavioral indices of progression along a trajectory. <italic>The Hope Assessment Guide</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311422707">Penrod &amp; Morse, 1997</xref>) was developed directly from qualitative data, with the behavioral indices of the stage of hoping directly transformed into indices for assessing a patient’s stage of hope.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section37-1049732311422707">
<title>Level 8: Clinical Application</title>
<p>The concept has now matured and is used in a formal therapy, both quantitatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311422707">Martin &amp; Stermac, 2010</xref>) and qualitatively. Qualitative applications are made by clinicians who have begun to recognize that hope may be manipulated and used to ease and relieve symptoms and conditions, or to predict their onset; for instance, in the ICU, in cases of suicidal ideation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311422707">Kondrat &amp; Teater, 2010</xref>). Qualitative narratives have also been used to construct hope in rehabilitation settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311422707">Warren &amp; Manderson, 2008</xref>). Qualitative clinical applications also include the use of spirituality in prisons to manipulate hope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311422707">Nedderman, Underwood, &amp; Hardy, 2010</xref>), and in palliative care, to show how chaplains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311422707">Nolan, 2011</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732311422707">Thompson, 2011</xref>) use hope with the dying. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311422707">Giske and Artinian (2007)</xref> balanced hope and despair to develop a model for clinicians to support patients awaiting diagnosis in a gastroenterology unit.</p>
<p>To summarize, you will note that the foundation of our understanding of hope has come from qualitative researchers—decades of work by large numbers of research teams working relatively independently. It must be noted, however, that the process of conducting research is not sequential, but rather haphazard. Researchers follow their own research programs, their own disciplinary agendas, and their personal interests; they follow funding calls and clinical opportunities. As qualitative researchers, we teach them to be skeptical of the work of others, and to value and prioritize principles of induction—all of which results in slow progression through this model.</p>
<p>Although not all concepts are developed this way—for instance, coping and social support were scientific concepts developed by quantitative researchers, and even models, such as the Health Belief Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311422707">Rosenstock, Strecher, &amp; Becker, 1988</xref>), had limited qualitative input—most of the concepts and models used in health care have been qualitatively derived. There is a vast volume of qualitative research which, considered collectively, can no longer be ignored.</p>
<p>Using this argument, there is no question that our research is significant, comprehensive, and important. But our research is scattered. I cannot read the research published in Korean or Thai or even French, and it is possible that you cannot read or access North American journals. Databases are limited in their scope, and articles often restricted in their access. So, despite the fact that we have the technology to collaborate, and to synthesize our findings even further,</p>
<list id="list3-1049732311422707" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>we work independently,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>we are compartmentalized in our regions, and as a consequence</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>we end up reinventing the wheel.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Although we have the technology, our system is nevertheless arrogant and ethnocentric, so that significant findings are delayed and impeded. Our research is expensive, as we replicate each other’s work, or are forced to ignore large banks of relevant research. Patient care suffers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section38-1049732311422707">
<title>Changing the World With QHR</title>
<p>Qualitative health research is essential for building a solid understanding of people’s perceptions of health, health beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors, yet the question remains: How it will be done?</p>
<p>I charge you to continue to conduct qualitative research, to build a solid evidence base for the construction of qualitative health research. We must collaborate, synthesize, and compare these studies internationally, and cross-culturally. We must construct powerful theories to improve the health of all people of all nations.</p>
<p>Together, we can overcome the limitations of language, restricted databases, and communication. This is your charge as the Third Generation. That is what the Global Congress for Qualitative Health Research is all about. Together we can support and lobby to create a system that supports our collaboration.</p>
<p>To do this, we need an army of researchers. We need students. We need resources—qualitative health research texts, methods texts, funding, support from our deans and governments. We need a forum for discussing, disseminating, and synthesizing qualitative research: that is, The Global Congress for Qualitative Health Research. Then, moving arm in arm, globally, we can make a difference. And that is why we are there today.</p>
