<p>The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) has enacted child protection policy reform.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213492350">1</xref></sup> COAG has adopted a public health model of care which finds its greatest strength in a range of interventions, including prevention, early intervention and intensive family treatment models. Multiple family risk factors are acknowledged (COAG, p. 21),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213492350">1</xref></sup> and specifically the case of Indigenous child maltreatment (COAG, p. 25).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213492350">1</xref></sup> However, the policy fails to act on the implications of multiple risks. Rather, the report generates a long series of tables describing numerous existing programs. A new paradigm for complex family risk is needed which draws from the evidence of child abuse trends, what is known in general about multiple risks, and what local databases can teach us.</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856213492350">
<title>National trends in child maltreatment</title>
<p>The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) has documented national trends of reported child maltreatment and out-of-home placements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213492350">2</xref></sup> Up to 2007, there were increases in notified, investigated and substantiated cases, and a doubling of the number of children in out-of-home care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213492350">3</xref></sup> There have been reductions since 2007; however, between 2010 and 2012 notifications and substantiations trended upwards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213492350">2</xref></sup> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were consistently overrepresented in the substantiation statistics and their numbers continue to increase. In addition, a careful analysis of the dynamics of children out-of-home placements reveals that the increase in numbers of placements are due to longer periods in care, not higher rates of placements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213492350">4</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1039856213492350">
<title>Multiple risks</title>
<p>Evidence of multiple risk profiles emerges from diverse sources. A prospective study of comprehensive risk factors by Sidebotham and Heron<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213492350">5</xref></sup> revealed that parents who were younger, had histories of mental health difficulties and maltreatment, and had low educational attainment were more likely to have been investigated for abuse and have a child who becomes part of a child protection plan. Bromfield and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213492350">6</xref></sup> found evidence of co-occurrence of domestic violence, parental mental health and substance abuse problems. As well, such families were becoming the primary client group. In relation to Indigenous child protection issues, a report found the co-occurrence of violence, alcohol and drug abuse, exposure to pornography, and housing problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213492350">7</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1039856213492350">
<title>Local child maltreatment databases</title>
<p>Given research detailing the presence of multiple risk factors, identifying similar patterns in local, specialized child protection databases would be a powerful spur to the development of new models of care.</p>
<sec id="section8-1039856213492350">
<title>State-based information collections</title>
<p>Reports on substantiated abuse from the Queensland Department of Child Safety (DChS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213492350">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213492350"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213492350"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213492350">11</xref></sup> found the median age of mothers and fathers was 32 years and 34 years, respectively. Indigenous families and single-parent households were overrepresented. The types of harm perpetuated by parents were similar to national trends, i.e. emotional, physical with neglect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213492350">8</xref></sup> Nearly half of the parents had a drug and or alcohol problem, and over a third had two or more incidences of domestic violence in the past year, while a quarter had been abused or neglected as a child.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213492350">9</xref></sup> About a fifth had a criminal history or current or past mental health disorders, and nearly a half had more than one identified risk factor. One-fifth of the families had children with one or more high medical needs. Nearly half of the cases had children with a mental health problem. A summary report noted that most families were experiencing multiple complex risk factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213492350">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>A clinical research database</title>
<p>A Brisbane-based Child and Youth Mental Health Service pilot program for treatment of child neglect/physical maltreatment recruited 23 families. The study obtained Ethics Committee approval. The children and caregivers agreed to a comprehensive psychosocial assessment. There was no prior selection for psychosocial risk factors. Inclusion criteria were: 1) selected offices of the DChS had substantiated abuse (physical, emotional or neglect); 2) the abuse occurred within the previous 90 days; 3) the abused child was aged between 6 and 17 years; and 4) the DChS’s and the parent’s goal was for the maltreated child to remain with the family.</p>

<title>Clinical needs of families</title>
<p>The majority of children (76.2%) had behavior problems in the clinical range (measured by parent report Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213492350">13</xref></sup> Results for the self-report Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213492350">14</xref></sup> revealed clinical ranges of 4.3% (dissociation) to 21.7% (depression). Children in the clinical range on the self-report on the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213492350">15</xref></sup> were double that identified on the TSCC (43.5%).</p>
<p>The majority of parents (87%) in this sample scored as having dysfunctional parenting practices characterized by an over-reliance on overly long reprimands and talking, as measured by the Parenting Scale (PS) verbal subscale (91.3%), and of laxness (82.65%), based on the PS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213492350">16</xref></sup> More than two-thirds (65.2%) of parents were suffering from significant psychological distress, as measured by the global index of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856213492350">17</xref></sup> In addition, parents with psychological problems reported fewer social supports measured by the Interpersonal Support Evaluation Checklist (ISEL).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213492350">18</xref></sup> On average, parents had 3.67 clinical problems (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.69) with a minimum of one problem for each parent. The total number of identified problems (both clinical and practical) for each family ranged from two to eight. On average, families were experiencing five concurrent problems.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In summary, data from the DChS and the research study identify the same problem, i.e. multiple system problems across child, parent, family, and community domains. For example, in the research dataset, more than two-thirds of the parents had severe psychological distress; the Australian average over 12 months is 20%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856213492350">19</xref></sup> Australian population parenting norms available from the Western Australian Child Health Survey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213492350">20</xref></sup> suggest problematic parenting in 32.1 % of parents while in the research project 87% reported parenting functioning/ practices problems. The level of mental health problems in the children was five times greater than the Australian average (76.2% versus 14.1%), as was reported depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856213492350">21</xref></sup> We cannot generalize from a small database to the overall child maltreatment population. However, the degree to which the patterns identified mirrored the larger datasets and international literature suggests intervention needs to address multiple factors.</p>
<p>Programs premised on ameliorating a few correlates may be doomed to failure. Policy development based on reducing a range of specific modifiable psychosocial dysfunctions may achieve better outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856213492350">22</xref></sup> In addition, disadvantaged families may need a “one-stop shop” to address multiple needs.</p>

<sec id="section13-1039856213492350">
<title>The case for multisystemic therapy for child physical abuse and neglect</title>
<p>Multisystemic therapy (MST),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856213492350">23</xref></sup> backed by over 25 years of research, has been successfully used in a range of problem areas where complex systemic/contextual forces operate within the child’s ecology. In recent years, the MST model has been adapted for application for children who are physically abused and/or neglected and their families (MST-CAN).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1039856213492350">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1039856213492350">25</xref></sup> A 5-year randomized effectiveness trial compared MST-CAN with enhanced outpatient treatment that included client engagement, a parenting group, and any needed outpatient, inpatient, or substance misuse service.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1039856213492350">26</xref></sup> At 16 months post baseline assessment, youth in the MST-CAN condition showed greater reduction in internalizing problems and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms; fewer youth were in out-of-home placements, and of those placed, there were fewer changes in placement. Parents in the MST-CAN condition had reductions in psychological distress, neglectful parenting, minor and severe assault of the child, and psychological aggression, and significantly greater increases in social supports.</p>
<p>MST-CAN characteristics are: a) detailed assessment of key ecological drivers; b) strong engagement processes; c) workable multiple home-based appointments over 6–8 months‘ d) 24 hours per day/7 days per week on call; e) treatment of the multiple problems by one team provider; f) interventions specifically applied to multi-system risk factors; and g) monitoring of treatment goals via evidence-based practice and weekly supervision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1039856213492350" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In Australia, reported cases of child abuse and neglect have been increasing. Children are remaining longer in out-of-home placements. International and Australian trends indicate that abuse is frequently embedded in families with multisystemic needs. We argue that only an intervention program that can modify multisystemic factors will be effective. MST-CAN has the track record of addressing modifiable multi-ecological correlates. In addition, MST already has a background of assisting Western Australian Indigenous families in the juvenile justice system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1039856213492350">27</xref></sup> Furthermore, the logjam in out-of home placements may be due to the difficulties in returning youth to complex multi-problem families. MST-CAN may offer an evidence-based response to many of the above problems.</p>
