<sec id="sec1-0265691412451813w"><title>Mary Elise Sarotte, <italic>1989: The Struggle to Create Post-Cold War Europe</italic>, Princeton University Press: Princeton NJ, 2009; xvi + 321 pp., 24 illus.; 9780691143064, £20.95 (hbk)</title>
<p>Each chapter of <italic>1989</italic> opens with several quotations, perhaps the most telling of which is from Daniel Kehlmann’s <italic>Measuring the World</italic> – ‘freedom and chance are a question of the middle distance, a matter of how far away you are’ (48). Sarotte’s scholarly and erudite study of the construction of the post-1989 world focuses closely on the shifting goals of crucial actors as they navigate chaotic circumstances and struggle for dominance. Chance played an important role, for example, in the almost accidental opening of the Berlin Wall following the DDR’s Politburo spokesperson’s bungled press conference early in the evening on 9 November. But for Sarotte the central player and master of the middle distance was Chancellor Kohl, who was close enough to events to recognize opportunities but distant enough from other actors to pursue ruthlessly his own post-89 objectives. The upshot of this play of chance and freedom, the extension of West German structures to the former East, was perhaps the most workable but not the most visionary of the possible political models (9). The momentous upheaval of 1989 was followed then not by the ‘end of History’ but rather the movement eastward of structures that already existed in the West (201).</p>
<p>What other architectural options were there for the construction of post-89 Germany? According to Sarotte, there was the Soviet ‘restoration model’ of restoring the post-War quadripartite control of Germany, although Gorbachev had abandoned this by 1990; second there was Kohl’s (again rapidly abandoned) plan for a revived German confederation; third, Gorbachev’s later, ‘heroic’ model of trans-continental economic and military institutions; and finally there was Kohl’s ultimately successful ‘prefab’ model. The latter was the rapid extension to the former DDR of the already constructed West German institutions – the Basic Law, currency, NATO and European Community. Although not initially listed as a core actor it is clear in later discussion that the East German dissidents and protestors, many of whom retained a democratic socialist vision of the future, were significant too. However, they were marginalized and found themselves in a different future than they had wanted. This could be said too of most popular movements in communist Europe and it would have been interesting to know Sarotte’s thoughts on the implications of disappointed expectations for these societies’ subsequent development.</p>
<p>This is a story of how Kohl was able to persuade other actors – NATO, the US, the Soviet Union, East and West Germany, and the EC – to accept his vision. In this process the two dominant powers of the Cold War were not the most important actors and the ‘endgame was heavily European’ (209). Two events convinced Kohl that it was possible to move to unification rapidly despite initial opposition from Gorbachev and some Western leaders such as Thatcher. These were the mass demonstrations for German unity in Dresden in December 1989 and the victory of the Alliance for Germany in the March 1990 East German elections. For Sarotte it was crucial that Kohl won Gorbachev over, which he did through the promise of loans (of around 11–12 billion DM) and reform of NATO that secured the signing of the 2+4 agreement in September 1990. Gorbachev is also a tragic figure in all this, losing everything despite his attempts to preserve the Soviet Union by accommodating US and Western European leaders. However, in buying unification Kohl may not have been Sarotte’s astute strategist so much as a pragmatist who flowed with unfolding events.</p>
<p>It is true that much of this story is already known. But Sarotte’s account is both lucid and meticulously researched. Using multiple data from interviews with historical figures involved, biographies and extensive archival sources, she recounts the conversations, communiqués and personalities central to the events. This is a major contribution to scholarship in this field. It does nonetheless have limitations. Despite its broad title, it is a study that shows Germany as in some ways exceptional, rather than in the context of the multiple dimensions of 1989 and its aftermath. The exclusive focus on key political actors occludes the diverse influence on post-communist Europe of mass protests (aside from being a foil for Kohl’s schemes), agencies such as the World Bank, IMF and EBRD, armies of neoliberal policy advisers, and former party elites metamorphosed into new entrepreneurs. Finally, there is an unexamined assumption throughout that the Cold War is over. Yet many remnants of the Cold War still exist, like the Korean conflict, and NATO, which not only survived 1989–91 but expanded eastwards and shifted from a defensive pact to an interventionist organization. Both of these, along with missile defence disputes, have alarmed Russian leaders who, amid tense relations with the West, have several times in recent years reverted to language reminiscent of the Cold War.</p>
