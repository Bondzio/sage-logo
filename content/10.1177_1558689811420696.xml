<abstract>
<p>Mixed methods research has emerged as a credible alternative to unitary research approaches. The authors show how a combination of a triangulation convergence model with a triangulation multilevel model was used to research an aspiring school principal development pilot program. The multilevel model is used to show the national and regional levels in the research design, whereas the convergence model illustrates how data were analyzed through a series of phases so that both formative and summative findings could emerge. The authors illustrate through some of the findings how their design contributed to adjustments to the program and to their findings. The challenges of undertaking such a mixed methods design reveal a complexity not always evident in abstract conceptual models.</p>

<p>Mixed methods research initially emerged in social sciences such as in education and evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1558689811420696">Alise &amp; Teddlie, 2010</xref>), both of which are the context for the research that is examined in this article. Mixed methods research has received increased interest from researchers across different disciplines despite having undergone a rigorous debate period where quantitative and qualitative approaches were positioned as being incompatible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689811420696">Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1558689811420696">Denzin, 2010</xref>). Even though aspects of that debate still linger today, the establishment of mixed methods as a credible approach to research is now reflected with the emergence of a multiplicity of associated paradigms and strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1558689811420696">Onwuegbuzie &amp; Combs, 2010</xref>). However, as we will discuss in this article, the application of a mixed methods strategy is not without its challenges. What can appear straightforward in a conceptual design model is not necessarily easily transferred to a research context; we had to adapt and combine existing models to create our own.</p>
<p>Our design model was used to research the effectiveness of a national aspiring principal development program that was funded and promoted by the New Zealand Government’s Ministry of Education. The program was delivered through six contracted regional providers so that the whole nation was covered. This set up the potential to research the program across all providers in a broad and general manner while also complementing the research with individual in-depth case studies of a sample of providers. Our contract with the Ministry of Education was independent of those established with the six regional providers, so our role was one of evaluation research and not program delivery. We introduce this article with a brief background of the program, the subsequent research questions, and then discuss how our mixed methods design was informed by theoretical mixed methods design models. Our Multiphase Triangulation Model is explained and used to illustrate how it contributed to some of our key research findings and the subsequent challenges it provided for the research team.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The 18-month National Aspiring Principal Program (NAPP) was part of the wider New Zealand Government and Ministry of Education policy priority to strengthen professional leadership in schools. The policy was part of the government’s response to school principal supply issues highlighted in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development school leadership report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1558689811420696">Pont, Nusche, &amp; Moorman, 2008</xref>) and was part of the international trend of governments starting to recognize the key role of school leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1558689811420696">Crow, Lumby, &amp; Pashiardis, 2008</xref>). In New Zealand, the supply issue is reflected in the ageing population of school principals. In 2004, 8.7% of school principals were aged 60 years or older; by 2010, this had risen to 17.1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1558689811420696">Ministry of Education, 2010</xref>). It was intended that the research findings on the effectiveness of this pilot program would be used to inform future work of the Ministry of Education aimed at developing and increasing the national pool of aspiring principals. Three key research questions guided the research:</p>
<list id="list1-1558689811420696" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: Is the NAPP effective professional development for aspirant principals?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: At the conclusion of the program, are the aspirants confident and do they have the skills and knowledge required for first time principalship?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Research Question 3</italic>: At the conclusion of the program, are the aspirants prepared for recruitment?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The key expected outcomes from this contracted research were the production of:</p>
<list id="list2-1558689811420696" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>A report on the quality of the aspiring program curriculum and its delivery</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A report on the effectiveness of the recruitment to, and retention in, the aspiring principals’ program</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A report on the readiness and success of aspirants in gaining principalships in a variety of school contexts</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Recommendations for the establishment of further effective national aspiring principal programs</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The research was concerned with examination of a wide range of variables that included the quality of the program design, delivery, recruitment and retention, and outcomes. Because evaluating professional development, and specifically leadership professional development, is so multidimensional, a range of stakeholders was focused on in data collection, including those who had funded the professional development (Ministry of Education), those who designed (six regional governing steering committees and regional coordinators) and delivered it (facilitators) in six regions across New Zealand, those who participated in it (the aspirants), and others (e.g., the aspirants’ principals). These groups varied in size from 2 (Ministry personnel) to 175 (aspirants).</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education stipulated that a wide range of learning experiences for aspirants was expected to be delivered by each regional provider. These included a needs analysis of each aspirant, a small school-based leadership project, peer support within professional learning groups, engagement with academic readings, opportunities for reflection, and coursework based on the following five strands:</p>

<p>In this article, we focus on selected findings to illustrate and examine the mixed methods design that was adopted to meet the diverse demands of the research and how this particularly contributed to some of the reporting of the effectiveness of the NAPP. A more comprehensive account of the findings is reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1558689811420696">Piggot-Irvine &amp; Youngs, 2011</xref>). The intent of this article is therefore to provide examples of the elements, applications, and challenges of the mixed methods design in the NAPP research context and to link it to the literature and models of mixed methods design.</p>
<sec id="section2-1558689811420696">
<title>The Applicability of a Mixed Methods Approach</title>
<p>The diverse range of required perspectives, the wide range of numbers within stakeholder groups, and the extensive input and output variables to be examined in the NAPP research led us to select a mixed methods design. We needed to provide an overall interpretation of the program at a generalized national level, particularly in relation to aspirant perspectives, and also needed to investigate in more detail what activity occurred at a regional provider level. A mixture of quantitative and qualitative approaches was deemed to be the most appropriate means to generate data that could be used to provide some generalization and detailed accounts of the program.</p>
<p>Combining quantitative and qualitative approaches within research has a long-standing history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1558689811420696">Rallis &amp; Rossman, 2003</xref>) and is increasingly being used in evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1558689811420696">Russ-Eft &amp; Preskill, 2009</xref>), particularly as an alternative to generalized quantitative surveys and large-scale syntheses of professional development literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1558689811420696">Guskey, 2000</xref>). Research using a mixed methods approach usually requires large teams so that a wide range of research skills can be drawn on to facilitate the research and our team was no exception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1558689811420696">Rallis &amp; Rossman, 2003</xref>). Across the team there were individuals with research experience in qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis, mixed methods design, and intervention strategies such as action research. Consequently, the team exhibited team-centric leadership rather than leader-centric leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1558689811420696">Zaccaro, Heinen, &amp; Shuffler, 2009</xref>) due to the shared expertise distributed across the members though the project leader played a key role, particularly in the early stages of the research enabling the team to exhibit shared leadership. The combined research experience, coupled with shared leadership, enabled us to address some of the weaknesses of mixed methods research, particularly in relation to available expertise and time intensiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689811420696">Bryman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1558689811420696">Johnson &amp; Onwuegbuzie, 2004</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1558689811420696">
<title>The Emerging Interest in Mixed Methods</title>
<p>Mixed methods has progressed through four overlapping time periods: the formative period, the paradigm debate period, the procedural developments period, and more recently an emerging interest period exemplified through public interest and government funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689811420696">Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2007</xref>). Our research of the government-funded NAPP is a reflection of this recent emerging interest period due to the contestable environment associated with the selection of the research provider and their intended research design. Though there have been arguments against involving the political dimension in our field of education research due to research possibly becoming conformative to government agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1558689811420696">Cohen, Manion, &amp; Morrison, 2007</xref>), we experienced the flexibility of being able to generate our own research design. Nevertheless, as the employment and popularity of mixed method designs continue to increase, researchers will need to be critically aware of how external political factors shape and possibly hinder or enable their research if funding is externally provided through non-research-based agencies that influence education and other social policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1558689811420696">Hesse-Biber, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The paradigm debate period and procedural developments period have now provided researchers who employ a mixed methods design with an emerging framework that does not position quantitative and qualitative as mutually exclusive approaches to research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1558689811420696">Ivankova, Creswell, and Stick (2006)</xref> describe the mixed method design as “integrating both quantitative and qualitative data . . . within a single study” (p. 3). It can sit in a pragmatist paradigm or philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1558689811420696">Johnson &amp; Onwuegbuzie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1558689811420696">Onwuegbuzie &amp; Leech, 2005</xref>) that advocates for “research that best addresses the research problem” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1558689811420696">Creswell, 2007</xref>, p. 23). It is in the middle of the postpositivistic to constructivist paradigm continuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1558689811420696">Leech, Dellinger, Brannagan, &amp; Tanaka, 2008</xref>) and is an eclectically orientated paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1558689811420696">Mutch, 2009</xref>). The rationale for using such an approach varies but is often based on an argument that quantitative and qualitative data complement each other, and the combination allows for more robust analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1558689811420696">Johnson &amp; Onwuegbuzie, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689811420696">Creswell and Plano Clark (2007)</xref> assert that the quantitative strand should not just add to the qualitative (or vice versa) but rather the data should be integrated in a meaningful, complementary way that extends and clarifies each set of data, though the weighting between the two does not need to be equal in the mixed methods design.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1558689811420696">Rossman and Wilson (1985)</xref> have summarized, the combination of qualitative and quantitative data collection, however, is not without controversy with a “paradigm purist” (or latterly described as an incompatibility thesis) argument contesting that ontological and epistemological assumptions associated with quantitative and qualitative research should not be mixed. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1558689811420696">Ercikan and Roth (2006)</xref>, without referring to mixed methods, argue that it is more helpful to move beyond this dichotomous and purist approach by emphasizing more of a focus on research questions and the collaboration of researchers with qualitative and quantitative expertise. Rather than purism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1558689811420696">Johnson and Onwuegbuzie (2004)</xref> note that the mixed methods, or varied approach with its methodological pluralism, offers flexibility for what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1558689811420696">Onwuegbuzie and Leech (2005)</xref> describe as the “pragmatic researcher.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1558689811420696">
<title>The Application of a Pragmatic Approach</title>
<p>Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1558689811420696">Onwuegbuzie and Combs’s (2010)</xref> 11 mixed methods paradigms and worldviews, we took a “pragmatism-of-the-middle-philosophy” (p. 412) due to the expected ongoing practical and outcome focus of the research. The six regional providers of the NAPP expected formative feedback so they could make adjustments to their delivery, and the Ministry of Education expected summative recommendations based on the outcomes of the program.</p>
<p>Often, when researching the effectiveness of professional development programs, analysis is required within a context, such as one regional provider, and also across contexts, such as the nationwide perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1558689811420696">Guskey, 2000</xref>). Our pragmatic position was one informed by the intent of our contract with the Ministry of Education and the manner in which the NAPP was delivered. In essence, we took a “what works” approach though this does not mean that we are committed to staying in this position with other research. We take the view that the context of the research also needs to shape the position of the researchers who will bring along their own epistemological preferences. The key for us is whether or not the researchers are open to learn and critique their preferences based on the context of the research.</p>
<p>A pragmatic approach opens up the opportunity for a choice of techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1558689811420696">Onwuegbuzie &amp; Leech, 2005</xref>), and such choice, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1558689811420696">Bryman (2008)</xref> suggests, involves critical decisions to be made about:</p>
<list id="list4-1558689811420696" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>The weighting to be given to quantitative and qualitative data (prioritizing)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The sequence of data collection and analysis (implementation)</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The stages at which the quantitative and qualitative data are integrated (integration)</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>We aimed to place equal priority on both qualitative and quantitative data with large-scale questionnaires used to triangulate the former data, an aspect that we discuss in more detail later on in this article. Data collection and analysis was implemented under the category of a combined “convergence” and “multilevel” model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689811420696">Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2007</xref>), where both qualitative and quantitative data were collected almost simultaneously and concurrently and compared and contrasted and integrated at almost all stages rather than just quantitative preceding qualitative as with a “sequential” design approach. The overall intent of our research was to gain a “fuller understanding” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1558689811420696">Creswell &amp; Tashakkori, 2008</xref>, p. 115) of the impact of the NAPP through analyzing data at both a national level and at a regional level. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1558689811420696">Figure 1</xref> shows, this approach meant that the overall design, as well as being mixed methods framed within a multilevel model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689811420696">Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2007</xref>), was also a larger study that encompassed a dual case study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1558689811420696">Yin, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Equal priority was placed on quantitative and qualitative data though a distinction was made between qualitative data at Level 2 and Level 3. Levels 1 and 2 correspond to the national sampling frame that incorporated all stakeholders, whereas Level 3 corresponds to the in-depth case studies of two of the six regional providers. This multilevel design enabled us to compare and contrast the data from the national sampling frame with data from the regional case studies throughout the phases of the research period.</p>

<title>Conceptualizing and Applying a Multiphase Triangulation Design</title>
<p>The multilevel model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1558689811420696">Figure 1</xref>) is limited in terms of displaying the multiple phases that are integral to mixed methods research; it provides a way of viewing the multiple levels inherent in the design but does not reveal the dimension of time through a research project. The research of the NAPP was established around four key phases:</p>
<list id="list5-1558689811420696" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Phase I</italic>: Program initiation</p>
</list-item>

<p><italic>Phase III</italic>: Program end-point</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Phase IV</italic>: Program post-point</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The multiple-phase approach was informed by the research questions listed earlier in this article and our intent to provide both formative findings to the providers during the program so that changes to delivery could be made and summative findings to the Ministry of Education in relation to the overall effectiveness of the program. For the research team, our commitment to formative feedback meant ongoing comparison and contrasting of the data across the four phases via Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the mixed methods design leading to the enabling of possible multiphase convergence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1558689811420696">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The convergence model is used when researchers “want to compare results or to validate, confirm, or corroborate quantitative results with qualitative findings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689811420696">Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2007</xref>, p. 65). We used this convergence model slightly differently at each phase during the research due to each phase having a distinctive yet overlapping and integrated purpose in the overall multilevel research design (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1558689811420696">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The multiple data collection tools employed in our multiphase triangulation design were aimed primarily at providing cross-checked or triangulated data from which more rigorous and valid conclusions could be drawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1558689811420696">Denzin, 1997</xref>). Cross-checking could be carried out within a phase to generate findings and also between phases. As we progressed through each phase of the research, the mix of the quantitative and qualitative data collecting tools, particularly through Phases II to IV, enabled us to constantly compare and contrast the phase data as well as develop an ongoing and cumulative interpretation of the overall findings as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1558689811420696">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Creating the Conditions for Triangulation</title>
<p>Triangulation is often referred to when data that are compared and contrasted are generated through different methods, though it is a concept that cannot be limited to a “one-size-fits-all” definition. Rather, triangulation needs to be “tailor-made” to fit the research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1558689811420696">Wolf, 2010</xref>). Our research design and contrasting data collecting methods provided us with the possibility to analyze our data through three types of triangulation: time triangulation, combined levels of triangulation, and methodological triangulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1558689811420696">Cohen et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>We developed the conditions for time triangulation to occur across all three levels of the research design by employing some degree of repetition throughout the phases. For instance, aspirants were asked to develop their own self-identification code that they entered at the start of each electronic questionnaire. This enabled us to track and compare the impact of development on individual aspirants throughout the program and 4 months after it was completed. It was unknown as to whether the sample of aspirants fitted a normal distribution, so nonparametric tests, rather than parametric tests, were employed for between-questionnaire analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1558689811420696">Blaikie, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings generated through each questionnaire were also compared with aspirants’ views in the case study focus groups and analysis of feedback forms for their provider so that methodological triangulation was possible between quantitative and qualitative data. This form of triangulation was also intentionally built into the design by observing what was delivered by regional facilitators during our case study visits and then comparing it with the provider’s plan for program delivery that was analyzed earlier on the program.</p>
<p>The inclusion of two regional case studies into the design meant that we created the conditions for multilevel triangulation to occur so that the national data generated through aspirant questionnaires and regional provider interviews could be compared and contrasted with specific examples that emerged from the two regions. This enabled us to report not just on the more generalized national findings of the evaluation research but also provide examples of regional practice and contextualized aspirant perceptions of their development and learning.</p>

<title>How the Multiphase Triangulation Model Contributed to the Research Findings</title>
<p>In this section, we illustrate how the components of our multiphase triangulation model were integrated and used in the evaluation research. Rather than provide an overview of all our main findings, we focus on three specific findings: the importance of principal support, the relevancy of aspects of the NAPP curriculum, and the role school-based projects played in aspirant development.</p>
<sec id="section8-1558689811420696">
<title>An Emerging Finding: The Importance of Principal Support</title>
<p>At the beginning of the NAPP, the Ministry of Education Program Director wrote to all the aspirants’ principals informing them of their required support of the aspirant. Specific mention was made in relation to the school-based project that was expected to be undertaken by aspirants in the program and with helping the aspirant understand some of the areas of compliance that principals are accountable for, such as finance, personnel, property, administration systems, and legal requirements. Early data from the case study focus groups indicated that this small group of aspirants were experiencing a wide range of support from their principals, with some indicating that their principal had “no clue” about their expected role and others, particularly from smaller primary (elementary) schools, stating that their principal appeared to be well informed.</p>
<p>The findings from these initial focus groups were compared with the rating means from the mid-point questionnaire in the hope that some multilevel triangulation would emerge. Using a 6-point scale (0 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>; 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>), aspirants rated their principal’s understanding of what was expected of the aspirant as 3.06 and what they thought their principal’s understanding of the principal’s role in NAPP was as 3.03. Neither rating produced any further insight for us at this stage. However, an unexpected finding emerged from other mid-point questionnaire data. Most aspirants stated that they heard about NAPP from their school principal, a professional development provider, or through Ministry of Education advertising. We split and analyzed the mid-point questionnaire rating scale responses across these groups at an α = .05 level of significance and found that the role of the principal could be a possible variable affecting aspirant development on the program. Where aspirants were approached and encouraged by their principals to apply for NAPP, the aspirants were more likely to understand each of their respective roles in NAPP, were more likely to find NAPP relevant, and were more likely to effectively apply the NAPP curriculum to their school. The emergence of this mid-point finding resulted in the adaptation of the aspirant focus group questions and subsequent questionnaires so that more data could be collected, specifically related to the role of the principal in aspirant development. Further analysis related to the size of the school indicated that aspirants in smaller schools (less than 500 students) generally had better access to the principal than those in larger schools, and aspirants were able to provide some detailed examples of any principal support in their final focus groups due to the added focus we placed on this emerging finding. The multilevel and methodological triangulation between these different methods across the different levels in our design confirmed that aspirants whose principals had encouraged them to apply were more likely to find the program relevant and applicable to their school. In contrast, we had found no previous literature to suggest that this finding had emerged in other principal development programs and so ventured into the evaluation research with little intentional focus on principals who encouraged aspirants to apply for the NAPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1558689811420696">Piggot-Irvine &amp; Youngs, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1558689811420696">
<title>A Formative Finding: The Relevancy of the Delivered NAPP Curriculum</title>
<p>Early on in the program the data emerging from the focus group interviews and observations in the case studies indicated that aspirant development needs as identified through a leadership needs analysis tool were not on the whole being applied. One case study region appeared to be adapting to the needs of their aspirants in these early stages better than the other and triangulated with the aspirants rating higher in the mid-point questionnaire compared with all other providers in relation to effective aspirant needs analysis. As an example of time triangulation, the data emerging from the two case studies were compared between each phase and two trends emerged. The aspirants expected and experienced a lot of emphasis on the key leadership of learning role of the principal but not as much as they had expected on the complementary management role that is considerable in New Zealand’s largely self-managing schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1558689811420696">Hodgen &amp; Wylie, 2005</xref>). Two aspirants near the end of the program reiterated the emphasis on leading learning while also recognizing the management role of New Zealand principals:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I knew it was going to be about leading learning, but a few of us thought there would be more about property and finances and the administrative side of the principal.</p>
<p>An issue is that principals who have been in the job are focused on the management stuff, so the leadership and pedagogy has been really refreshing, getting that real depth of leadership.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The data that emerged over time through the two case studies would not have been sufficient for us to provide meaningful formative feedback to the other providers, particularly in relation to meeting the aspirants’ needs. As an example of methodological and multilevel triangulation, the mid-point questionnaire findings confirmed that there were some likely “gaps” in the delivery of the NAPP curriculum up to that point. The utilization of combined levels of triangulation revealed that a little more emphasis was required on the management functions of school leadership such as property, finance, education, law, strategy, and human resources as a support to the leadership of learning. Up to that point most of the emphasis had been on the key role of principals as leaders of teaching and learning without making the links to the subsidiary management tasks of a principal that can support a learning environment.</p>
<p>There was evidence to suggest that the overall delivery of the curriculum significantly improved based on a comparison of aspirant mean responses so that it better met the needs of the aspirants. Aspirants’ rating of the relevance of the curriculum rose from 3.35 in the mid-point questionnaire through to 3.80 in the end-point questionnaire (0 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>; 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>), a finding that was strengthened with most aspirants, who gained principalships during the NAPP, choosing to stay in the program. The suggested improvement in relevancy may have been due to aspirant feedback to their regional provider and the formative feedback that we regularly gave to the regional providers, the latter made possible due to the multiphase design that we employed. A comparison of the data from the mid- and end-point questionnaires as a form of time triangulation also revealed that aspirants’ rating of their ability to apply new knowledge to their practice improved from 3.29 to 3.95. This was the largest statistically significant difference generated through the questionnaires and was complemented by aspirants’ likelihood of entering into a career of principalship increasing from 3.58 to 4.21 during the last 4 months of the NAPP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1558689811420696">
<title>A Contrasting Finding: The Usefulness of the School-Based Projects</title>
<p>As part of the NAPP design, aspirants were expected to carry out a project in their school so that opportunity would be given for them to apply new knowledge to their practice. Interviews with the regional provider coordinators early in the program indicated, however, that aspirants needed considerably more information than they had received in advance of their first workshops to design a leadership project that was both relevant and workable. We followed this up with the aspirants in both case study regions as a form of multilevel triangulation between Levels 2 and 3 of our multiphase triangulation design, and the initial interview feedback were reinforced by both focus groups aspirants as well as with further comments from the case study regional coordinator. The focus group aspirants expressed a desire for more time and guidance on their projects with the issue of the short timeframe for projects also evident in regional coordinators milestone reports to the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Although the early reflections of aspirants on the leadership project were mixed, by the time of the final focus groups aspirants in one of the case study regions had seen value in the projects. The aspirants from the other case study region stated the project had been “loose,” though it was seen by all but one member to still have been of value. The mid- and end-point questionnaires provided us an opportunity to triangulate this shift in perceptions at the case study level with overall national perceptions. Aspirants were asked to rate if their project had enabled them to effectively apply the NAPP curriculum in their school context, and the subsequent rating mean had increased from 3.47 to 3.71. One of the final case study observations, however, enabled us to delve a little deeper beyond the generalized questionnaire findings in relation to some of the outcomes associated with the projects. The observation of aspirants presenting their project findings to their regional cohort revealed that approximately two thirds of them presented projects that were based on clear evidence and theoretical underpinning, and just more than half showed a clear understanding of the principles of managing change, which was a component of the NAPP curriculum. Considering the trepidation and concerns expressed by some aspirants earlier in the program, we were able to observe the aspirants’ eventual engagement with the leadership projects and their willingness to be advised by facilitators/coaches in one of the case study regions. Given the support identified by these case study aspirants in relation to their facilitators, we were also in the latter stages of the program evaluation now increasingly interested in the role that the principal played due to the emerging finding related to principal support discussed at the beginning of this section.</p>
<p>Just prior to the emergence of the principal support finding at the mid-point of the program, four out of the six regional coordinators mentioned “mixed” or “variable” support from principals in their interviews, with one saying, “There are very good principals out there, and also those who aren’t being particularly helpful.” One aspirant in the mid-point questionnaire reiterated the possibility for a contrasting range of principal support stating, “If you don’t have an effective principal in your school the leadership project is near impossible.” This perspective was also repeated by two of the regional coordinators interviewed after the end of the program, with one saying that some aspirants “were completely stymied by principals stopping them from practicing what they wanted at all.” The data that emerged across the different levels from the questionnaires, the regional coordinator interviews, and the case studies clearly indicated contrasting views of how principals supported aspirants with their projects, but did not indicate anything about what type of principals were more likely to offer support.</p>
<p>It is with this example that a complex mixed methods approach can be illustrated to show how further depth and understanding can be gained through research. The application of the finding related to principals supporting aspirants to apply for the program created opportunity for us to look back over findings that were emerging across the different levels and through the phases. We separated out the questionnaire data of aspirants who had been encouraged to apply by their principal and found out that these aspirants were more likely to effectively adapt their application of the NAPP curriculum to their school context through their project. This emergent theme of the role of the principal led to the insertion of a key question in the final focus group for aspirants that investigated how supportive the host principal had been. In one region, all six of the final focus group aspirants stated that their principal had been supportive. One noted that he had weekly meetings with his principal and had also incorporated his project goal as an appraisal goal. The 39 principals who completed the final questionnaire after the program had finished in Phase IV provided a triangulated perspective on the support they offered throughout the program. It should be noted that those who responded tended to be principals who took an active role in supporting the aspirant because nearly all strongly agreed (mean = 4.74) that they had taken an active role in supporting their colleague’s application onto the program.</p>
<p>This section has illustrated how the multiple-level design of our research created opportunity to possibly triangulate data emerging from national and regional contexts. If we had used a solitary level throughout the multiple phases, we would have been limited to only interpreting changes throughout the program either at a generalizable level or at a more local level. Similarly, if we had used a multiple-level design without multiple phases, we would not have been able to understand and report on changes throughout the program soon after they occurred. The ability to then offer formative feedback to the providers would have been severely limited, and our research team may have then been positioned by providers and aspirants as researchers who were distant from the context of the leadership development process. For the context of this research, multiple levels and multiple phases were required; however, the application of this was not without its challenges.</p>

<title>Challenges of Multiphase Triangulation in Mixed Methods Research</title>
<p>The sustainability of a mixed methods design through several phases does present a research team with numerous challenges, the main one being the amount of data collected. Even though mixed methods can provide opportunity for a range of triangulation types as a means to enhance validity, “the enhanced analytical density does not necessarily presage enhanced certainty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1558689811420696">Fielding, 2009</xref>, p. 436). The mere act of continuously adding more data through a greater number of data collecting tools does not automatically imply that validity and certainty of conclusions will be enhanced in mixed methods research. We found that we had to intentionally focus on developing the conditions for possible triangulation as an inherent aspect of our multiphase triangulation design so that we could draw on time triangulation, combined levels of triangulation, and methodological triangulation as a possible means to enhance validity. Our greatest challenge was consequently trying to assimilate and then connect data across the three levels and over the four phases with a range of participant groups. The complexity of these processes is not always clearly evident in mixed methods conceptual designs and could create a “minefield” of issues for the unsuspecting and inexperienced mixed methods researcher.</p>
<p>The complexity inherent in our design also meant that we had to function effectively as a team, wherein we were aware of each other’s common and complimentary research expertise. For example, one member of the team carried out all the questionnaire analysis not just because the member had the expertise but also because the member could compare the data as a means of time triangulation. The challenge for us was the integration of different data sets through combined levels of triangulation and methodological triangulation, a process that demands time. We did not have extendable timeframes for our research due to it being tied to an external contract, so we all had to complete our analysis work in a timely fashion so that it could be filtered back to the NAPP providers as formative feedback and also inform the following phase. This, however, does raise a reflective question for the mixed methods researcher, when do you stop analyzing, comparing, and contrasting the data? For us, this was somewhat dictated by the requirement to submit a summative report to the Ministry of Education soon after the completion of the program. However, we also did not move on to the next set of data analysis until we were satisfied that we had compared data sets across multiple phases and multiple levels. The consequence of this for our research team though was many more hours of analysis.</p>
<p>The design we used generated a vast array of data, and not soon after Phase 2, due to the amount of significant findings, we started to trim back some of the questions in the intended Phases 3 and 4 data collecting tools. For instance, the three questionnaires decreased in size as the evaluation continued so that the evaluation research process was more manageable. Since completing the evaluation research of NAPP, we were awarded another evaluation research contract related to school leadership development that uses our multiphase triangulation mixed methods design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1558689811420696">Youngs et al., 2010</xref>). This time, we trimmed the design back to three phases and increased the size of the research team as a means of further addressing the challenges that we experienced with the design and implementation of the mixed methods research discussed in this article.</p>

<sec id="section12-1558689811420696">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have provided an illustration of how a mixed methods design can be used to effectively carry out research, especially in the context of evaluation, and have suggested that mixed methods research reaches saturation with data analysis once all data sources have been assimilated and intentionally analyzed using appropriate forms of triangulation. By drawing on a range of research expertise and combining two triangulation design models of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1558689811420696">Creswell and Plano Clark (2007)</xref>, we have hopefully been able to contribute to the growing need to provide examples and discuss the challenges of mixed methods design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1558689811420696">Creswell &amp; Tashakkori, 2008</xref>). Rather than take a dichotomous and purist approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1558689811420696">Ercikan &amp; Roth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1558689811420696">Rossman &amp; Wilson, 1985</xref>) with research, we advocate for more critique of approaches that start with a commitment to shaping design from questions based on the focus rather than developing research questions that first need to be aligned to and derived from a commitment to either quantitative or qualitative approaches to research. As we do this, new models and adaptations of existing research design models will emerge, particularly with mixed methods. The onus will then be on ensuring that the application of these design models are published and critiqued so that they can be moved beyond abstract conceptualization.</p>
