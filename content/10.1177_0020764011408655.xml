<title>Background:</title>
<p>Boredom has been reported as a common experience for service users of acute psychiatric wards. It has been associated with negative mental and physical health. Research has yet to show what factors are associated with boredom proneness within the acute psychiatric population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0020764011408655">
<title>Aims:</title>
<p>(1) To investigate the distribution of boredom proneness in a population of mentally ill inpatients according to age, gender, diagnosis, Mental Health Act status and length of stay in hospital. (2) To test the hypothesis that boredom proneness is negatively correlated with autonomous activity levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0020764011408655">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>Two self-report questionnaires were used with 55 inpatients of acute psychiatric wards: the Boredom Proneness Scale (Farmer &amp; Sundberg, 1986) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983). Questions were also asked about individuals’ activity engagement during their current admission. Data on age, gender, diagnosis, ethnicity, Mental Health Act status and length of stay were collected from case notes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0020764011408655">
<title>Results and conclusions:</title>
<p>The highest incidence of boredom proneness was in participants with depression. Those detained under the Mental Health Act appeared less boredom prone than those admitted voluntarily. Boredom proneness was not associated with age, gender or length of stay. There was an association between engagement in more autonomous activities and lower boredom proneness.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Boredom is related to a range of factors including a lack of external stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764011408655">Csikszentmihalyi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764011408655">Hill &amp; Perkins, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764011408655">Mikulas &amp; Vodanovich, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020764011408655">Zuckerman, Eysenck, &amp; Eysenck, 1978</xref>), a lack of internal or cognitive abilities to keep oneself entertained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764011408655">Csikszentmihalyi, 2000</xref>), an affective component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011408655">Ahmed, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011408655">Farmer &amp; Sundberg, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764011408655">Hill &amp; Perkins, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020764011408655">Rupp &amp; Vodanovich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764011408655">Tolor, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020764011408655">Vodanovich, Verner, &amp; Kilbride, 1991</xref>), the presence of unmet needs or constraints on the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764011408655">Hill &amp; Perkins, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764011408655">Leong &amp; Schneller, 1993</xref>) and attribution or meaning for the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764011408655">Barbalett, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764011408655">Conrad, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764011408655">Hill &amp; Perkins, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764011408655">Leong &amp; Schneller, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764011408655">Mikulas &amp; Vodanovich, 1993</xref>). The theory of under-arousal views boredom as a drive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020764011408655">Berlyne, 1960</xref>). Boredom is therefore defined as a negative affective state of low arousal that results from a feeling of inability and lack of skills to meet needs within the existing environment.</p>
<p>Boredom has been reported as problematic for inpatients of acute psychiatric wards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020764011408655">Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, 1998</xref>). This has been confirmed as a concern held by service users themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764011408655">Antoniou, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764011408655">Janner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020764011408655">Maudsley Hospital Audit Department, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764011408655">Mind, 2000</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020764011408655">Mind (2006)</xref> publication <italic>Building Solutions</italic> found that so-called ‘activity rooms’ were not used for activities, but for other purposes such as office space: service users reported that ‘there was nothing to do 90% of the time’. The <italic>Star Wards</italic> document articulated the problem of boredom from a service user perspective: ‘Acute mental health inpatients have about 600 hours of potential activity during the average seven week stay. Currently you’d be lucky to have constructive activity, including one-to-one conversations with nurses, for 10 of those 600 hours.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764011408655">Janner, 2006</xref>, p. 8).</p>
<p>The experience of boredom has been shown to have the potential to lead to behaviours that both undermine treatment and provide risks to service users. For example, the <italic>National Audit of Violence (2003–2005) Final Report</italic> found that one of the triggers for violent behaviour was frustration at the lack of activities available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020764011408655">Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2006</xref>). Boredom has also been found to be a factor associated with patients absconding from psychiatric wards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020764011408655">Bowers, Jarrett, Clark, Kiyimba, &amp; McFarlane, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In the authors’ experience, the perceived problem of boredom in acute mental health wards is usually responded to by giving service users something to do, either via a referral to occupational therapy, or by the provision of organized group recreational activities. However, Antoniou (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020764011408655">2007</xref>, p. 33) described experiencing boredom as an inpatient ‘even when there are activities planned every hour’. This suggests that boredom is more complex than is often assumed, as there is an internal as well as an external component to boredom. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764011408655">Conrad (1999)</xref> proposed that boredom occurs in the interaction between an individual and how they interpret their experience. An individual will remain unstimulated when environmental stimulation is present if it has no meaning for the person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764011408655">Barbalett, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764011408655">Mikulas &amp; Vodanovich, 1993</xref>). Thus, merely providing an additional stimulus in the form of an organized group activity alone may not successfully tackle boredom in many cases. Indeed boredom proneness, defined as a tendency to be easily bored, is known to be a trait that varies across individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764011408655">Harris, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Although it has been established that boredom is a problematic experience for mental health inpatients, there is currently a lack of literature investigating boredom or how to combat it in inpatient settings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764011408655">Martin (2009)</xref> has theorized that teaching the use of mindfulness techniques may promote people’s capacity to manage boredom. These techniques involve focusing attention without being distracted by thoughts. However, this idea was based on research carried out in a healthy population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764011408655">Martin, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764011408655">2009</xref>) and has not been tested in a mental health population.</p>
<sec id="section6-0020764011408655">
<title>Boredom, health and well-being</title>
<p>Investigation of boredom proneness in this population is important because boredom has been associated with several aspects of mental and physical ill health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020764011408655">Sommers &amp; Vodanovich, 2000</xref>). Research into mental health shows that depression is associated with both boredom and boredom proneness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011408655">Ahmed, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011408655">Farmer &amp; Sundberg, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764011408655">Tolor, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020764011408655">Vodanovich et al., 1991</xref>). Depression is another state of low arousal and dissatisfaction, but Farmer and Sundberg differentiate between the two constructs via quality and intensity of mood. They suggest that sadness and feelings of personal loss are characteristic of depression, whereas boredom is characterized by lack of interest, which is not dependent on the presence of sadness. Boredom proneness has been associated with other negative affective states including hopelessness and loneliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011408655">Farmer &amp; Sundberg, 1986</xref>), anxiety and hostility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020764011408655">Vodanovich et al., 1991</xref>), anger and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020764011408655">Rupp &amp; Vodanovich, 1997</xref>) and alienation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764011408655">Tolor, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020764011408655">Gordon, Wilkinson, McGown, and Jovanoska (1997)</xref> associated boredom proneness with neuroticism. Other associations with mental ill health include drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764011408655">Laudet, Magura, Vogel, &amp; Knight, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020764011408655">Levy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020764011408655">Samuels &amp; Samuels, 1974</xref>) and pathological gambling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020764011408655">Blaszczynski, McConaghy, &amp; Frankova, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020764011408655">Hamilton, Haier, and Buchsbaum (1984)</xref> showed that the ability to cope adaptively with boredom was inversely related to evidence of psychopathology. None of these studies has included participants with symptoms of psychotic illnesses.</p>
<p>Boredom proneness may also affect physical health. It has been associated with increased eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020764011408655">Abramson &amp; Stinson, 1977</xref>) and excessive cigarette smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020764011408655">Ferguson, 1973</xref>). These behaviours make it likely that boredom will affect an individual’s physical health if the behaviour becomes a habitual way of dealing with boredom.</p>
<p>These undesirable associations with boredom and the effects of boredom on physical and mental health suggest that it may be clinically relevant to identify those in a population undergoing treatment for mental health problems who are prone to boredom. Previous research has identified a number of factors that may be important in whether individuals are boredom prone. These include gender, age and feeling constrained.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0020764011408655">
<title>Gender, age and boredom proneness</title>
<p>Gender has been studied in relation to boredom proneness. A number of authors have reported that men are more prone to boredom than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764011408655">Harris, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764011408655">Martin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764011408655">Tolor, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020764011408655">Vodanovich &amp; Kass, 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020764011408655">Watt &amp; Blanchard, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020764011408655">Zuckerman et al., 1978</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020764011408655">Seib and Vodanovich (1998)</xref> found that women are more prone to boredom than men. Gender variations in boredom proneness have not previously been investigated in a mentally ill inpatient population.</p>
<p>Age has also been studied in relation to boredom. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020764011408655">Zuckerman et al. (1978)</xref> reported that boredom proneness appeared to decrease with increasing age, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764011408655">Martin (2007)</xref> reported under 40s as slightly more susceptible to boredom proneness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764011408655">Harris (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764011408655">Tolor (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020764011408655">Vodanovich &amp; Kass (1990a)</xref> found no significant correlation between age and boredom proneness. Age variations in boredom proneness have not been investigated in mentally ill inpatient population prior to this study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0020764011408655">
<title>Boredom proneness and clinical populations</title>
<p>Most studies on boredom proneness in adults have been conducted with student populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011408655">Ahmed, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764011408655">Conrad, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011408655">Farmer &amp; Sundberg, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764011408655">Hill &amp; Perkins, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020764011408655">Leong &amp; Schneller, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764011408655">Martin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020764011408655">Rupp &amp; Vodanovich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020764011408655">Seib &amp; Vodanovich, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020764011408655">Sommers &amp; Vodanovich, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764011408655">Tolor, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020764011408655">Vodanovich &amp; Kass, 1990a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020764011408655">1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020764011408655">Vodanovich et al., 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764011408655">Csikszentmihalyi’s (2000)</xref> research involved rock climbers, composers, dancers, chess players and basketball players. There are no studies of boredom proneness or how to intervene effectively in an acute inpatient psychiatric population, despite national reports acknowledging boredom as a common complaint of inpatients of acute psychiatric wards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020764011408655">Janner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020764011408655">Mind, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020764011408655">Sainsbury Centre Mental Health Centre, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The hospital environment may cause feelings of constraint in some individuals, such as those detained against their will under the Mental Health Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764011408655">Department of Health, 2007</xref>) or those who have remained in hospital for a long time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020764011408655">Hill and Perkins (1985)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020764011408655">Vodanovich and Kass (1990b)</xref> suggested that constraint contributes to boredom, so it is possible that formally detained individuals might be more prone to boredom than those who do not feel constrained. It may also be possible that the longer people stay in hospital, the more time they have to fill, so length of stay may be associated with boredom proneness.</p>
<p>If individuals are able to initiate activity themselves to fill their time, perhaps they will be less prone to boredom. Thus, there may be a negative correlation between boredom proneness and levels of autonomous (self-initiated) activity.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Boredom has been identified as a common problematic experience for mental health inpatients and the literature indicates that boredom proneness is associated with several aspects of mental ill health. However, boredom, boredom proneness or how to intervene have not been investigated previously in an inpatient psychiatric population. The aims of this study are twofold:</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>A survey method was employed. Data on age, gender, diagnosis, ethnicity, Mental Health Act status and length of inpatient stay were collected from case notes. This was done for both participants and those who declined to participate, in order to check whether participants were representative of the total eligible sample.</p>
<p>The measure used to collect data on boredom proneness was the Boredom Proneness Scale (BPS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011408655">Farmer &amp; Sundberg, 1986</xref>). This is a standardized measure that consists of 28 true/false items: a higher score indicates a higher tendency to boredom. As boredom proneness has been associated with depression and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011408655">Ahmed, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011408655">Farmer &amp; Sundberg, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020764011408655">Sommers &amp; Vodanovich, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020764011408655">Vodanovich et al., 1991</xref>) and a proportion of the study population was likely to suffer from depression and/or anxiety, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020764011408655">Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983</xref>) was used to control for this. The HADS is a 14-item scale, providing a brief state measure of anxiety and depression, using seven items each. Higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>Self-reported activity data were recorded and activities were divided into the following groups: organized groups on the ward; autonomous activities on the ward; organized groups and classes in the occupational therapy resource centre; other organized activities off the ward (e.g. gym or chapel); and autonomous activities off the ward. Eating, sleeping and bathing were discounted.</p>
<p>Following approval from the local NHS ethics committee, inpatients of an acute inner London mental health service, who were considered able to consent and participate by their treatment team, were invited to participate over a period of five months. The researcher provided a verbal invitation and an information sheet. Written consent was obtained for all participants and their anonymity was maintained.</p>
<sec id="section11-0020764011408655">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data were processed and analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020764011408655">Table 1</xref>). Data were screened to check that they fulfilled assumptions for parametric statistical analyses. All data were normally distributed with the exception of activity data, which was skewed. Non-parametric Spearman’s correlations were therefore used to analyse activity data.</p>

<p>Participants with personality disorder were found to be the most prone to boredom with the highest mean score (22.00) and a relatively low standard deviation (2.83). This was closely followed by those with depression (<italic>M</italic> = 20.00). The lowest levels of boredom proneness were recorded in the schizophrenia (<italic>M</italic> = 11.8), hypermanic (<italic>M</italic> = 11) and psychotic illness (<italic>M</italic> = 10) groups. The standard deviations (6.11–7.60) indicated a greater variation in scores for participants with schizophrenia, paranoid schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and depression with psychotic features.</p>
<p>The above diagnostic groups were collapsed using DSM-IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020764011408655">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>) categories in order to test for statistically significant differences in boredom proneness scores. The categories were reduced to schizophrenia, other psychotic illness, depression, other mood disorder and other illness (e.g. dementia). The other illness group was omitted from statistical analysis of diagnostic groups due to its lack of heterogeneity. The boredom proneness scores using the collapsed diagnostic categories are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0020764011408655">Table 3</xref>, along with distribution according to Mental Health Act status.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study found no evidence of any differences in boredom proneness according to age, gender or length of hospital stay within a population of mentally ill inpatients. This is not consistent with the majority of previous research, which finds that men are more prone to boredom than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764011408655">Harris, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020764011408655">Martin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764011408655">Tolor, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020764011408655">Vodanovich &amp; Kass, 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0020764011408655">Watt &amp; Blanchard, 1994</xref>) and that boredom proneness decreases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020764011408655">Zuckerman et al., 1978</xref>), although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020764011408655">Harris (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764011408655">Tolor (1989)</xref> also found no association with age. The difference in findings could be a feature of the different populations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020764011408655">Polly, Vodanovich, Watt, and Blanchard (1993)</xref> found that attributional or cognitive processes were more predictive of boredom proneness than gender and this could also partially account for gender differences reported in other studies.</p>
<p>Boredom proneness was shown to be significantly correlated with depression and anxiety, confirming previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020764011408655">Ahmed, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011408655">Farmer &amp; Sundberg, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020764011408655">Tolor, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020764011408655">Vodanovich et al., 1991</xref>). People with schizophrenia were less prone to boredom than those with depression, but more than those with other illnesses. Individuals with other psychotic illnesses appeared to be less prone to boredom than those with other mental illnesses. There was a suggestion that those with a personality disorder may be particularly prone to boredom as they achieved the highest mean boredom proneness score; this suggestion is based on only two cases, but it does perhaps merit future investigation.</p>
<p>It was hypothesized that those detained against their will under a section of the Mental Health Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020764011408655">Department of Health, 2007</xref>) may be more prone to boredom, due to constraint being a theoretical component of boredom. Unexpectedly, the opposite was demonstrated. Those who were not detained on section were more prone to boredom. A large proportion of the voluntary patients were diagnosed with depression compared with the sectioned patients; given that depression is highly correlated with boredom proneness, this may account for the result seen. It is therefore possible that constraint is not an essential component of boredom proneness, as was suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764011408655">Mikulas and Vodanovich (1993)</xref>. Perhaps constraint can contribute to feelings of an inability to act, and it is this feeling that could be a component of boredom.</p>
<p>There was some evidence to support the hypothesis that those who engaged in autonomous activity were less prone to boredom. This concurs with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020764011408655">Farmer and Sundberg’s (1986)</xref> view of the more boredom-prone person as tending to display little evidence of autonomous orientation. There are a number of possible explanations for this. For example, perhaps feeling unable to initiate what one wants to do may contribute to boredom proneness.</p>
<p>The correlation between boredom proneness and the number of autonomous activities executed off the ward did not reach statistical significance. This may have been due to the restrictions that are sometimes placed on the movements of mentally ill inpatients that are considered at risk in some way. It would be much harder to initiate and complete off-ward activities if a member of staff had to be engaged to accompany a service user.</p>
<p>There was no evidence of any relationship between boredom proneness and organized activities, whether they were located on the ward, in the occupational therapy resource centre or elsewhere.</p>
<sec id="section19-0020764011408655">
<title>Implications for psychiatric inpatient services</title>
<p>The results of this study indicate that those who suffer from depression, anxiety or perhaps a personality disorder are likely to be more prone to boredom than other service users of acute psychiatric wards. Therefore these are the people who are highly likely to experience boredom and its negative effects, and may benefit most from interventions to assist in reducing boredom. No other variables investigated were more predictive of boredom proneness than these three diagnoses.</p>
<p>The finding that those who engage in autonomous activities on the ward may be less prone to boredom suggests that services should provide encouragement, support and opportunities for autonomous activities. Positive experiences of successfully completing autonomous activities will enhance general self-efficacy and encourage further action in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020764011408655">Shelton, 1990</xref>). Service users have also highlighted how important individual activity interventions are to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764011408655">Lim, Morris, &amp; Craik, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As outlined in the introduction, there is some evidence that the activities provided need to be meaningful to the service users (rather than to the service providers) if they are to engage with them and not find them boring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020764011408655">Conrad, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020764011408655">Dewis &amp; Harrison, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020764011408655">Laudet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020764011408655">Lim et al., 2007</xref>). An individual will remain unstimulated when environmental stimulation is present if it has no meaning for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020764011408655">Barbalett, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020764011408655">Mikulas &amp; Vodanovich, 1993</xref>). The activities also need to be sufficiently demanding to provide challenge, but not so much that they are perceived as too difficult to try (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020764011408655">Csikszentmihalyi, 2000</xref>) or result in experiences of failure, which will negatively impact on self-efficacy and discourage future engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020764011408655">Bandura, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020764011408655">Shelton, 1990</xref>). Individual service users are likely to be differently skilled, so activities need to be able to provide varied or graded complexity.</p>
<p>It is important that services address both internal and external components of boredom. The provision of activities will only tackle one of these components, but interventions to assist individuals to develop skills to provide their own stimulation will address the other. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020764011408655">Martin (2009)</xref> has suggested that assisting service users to be more mindful, which is the ability to focus attention and not be distracted by thoughts, would be a helpful intervention.</p>

<title>Limitations and future research</title>
<p>This study had a few limitations that should be considered before drawing conclusions. The main limitations were that the study was cross-sectional and used self-report questionnaire measures. The cross-sectional design of the study means that the direction of causality in any associations cannot be determined. For example, the association between boredom proneness and depression may be due to aspects of depression, such as hopelessness, a lack of energy or a poor sense of self-efficacy, causing boredom proneness because such symptoms could discourage an individual from initiating or engaging in activity. Conversely, a high proneness to boredom, characterized by a lack of interest, could contribute to depression. It is therefore important that future research uses prospective designs to investigate these relationships further.</p>
<p>The use of questionnaire measures raises a number of issues. First, the scales were not validated or designed to be used in this specific type of adult population. The BPS was developed and tested in student populations and the HADS was created for use with medical outpatients. This may have affected the reliability of the results, although each of the measures had been well established in other adult populations. Second, boredom is a multi-dimensional construct but the BPS treats it as uni-dimensional by only using a total boredom proneness score for analysis.</p>
<p>These issues and limitations are common to all cross-sectional, self-report data, and this study offers a useful first step towards understanding the pattern of boredom proneness in mental health inpatient services. The results of the current study raised some interesting issues that future research using larger samples could explore further; in particular, examining the extent of boredom proneness in patients with a diagnosis of personality disorder. In addition, this study only included participants diagnosed with a mental illness and so it may be useful to compare boredom proneness in inpatients staying for similar lengths of time on medical wards, especially as diagnosis was found to be a significant variable.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study of inpatients of acute psychiatric wards found no evidence of variations in boredom proneness according to age, gender or length of stay in hospital. Diagnosis was the variable most predictive of boredom proneness in that those who were depressed or anxious appeared more prone to boredom. Individuals with a personality disorder may also be particularly boredom prone but this needs to be examined further in a larger sample. The greater tendency to boredom in patients admitted voluntarily may be associated with the high incidence of depression in informal patients. Thus, those who are most at risk of boredom proneness were identified.</p>
<p>The results support the hypothesis that boredom proneness is negatively correlated with autonomous activities carried out on the ward. This suggests that autonomous activities should be encouraged and supported in acute mental health wards. A starting point and suggestions for further research have been provided.</p>
