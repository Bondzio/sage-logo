<p>It was certainly a Congress to remember – a record number of delegates poured into the harbourside venue, with the spectacular fireworks and lightshows of the ‘Vivid’ festival providing the perfect backdrop to the week that unfolded. Making this year’s event still more memorable was the concurrent celebration of the College’s golden jubilee.</p>
<p>The scientific program was propelled each day by plenary sessions from our international and local keynote speakers, which were enthusiastically attended and received. They covered a broad spectrum of topics, from neuroplasticity and the putative neuropathology of schizophrenia, to a withering critique of the process for developing DSM-5 and novel approaches to assessing the continuing competence of medical professionals.</p>

<p>The concurrent sessions that ran through the bulk of the first 3 days provided more than a little something for everyone. All subspecialties and interest areas were well represented, and delegates were frequently confronted with difficult choices as to which session to attend. Many of the breakout rooms were full to overflowing, with some of the popular presentations including updates on the management of borderline personality disorder; ‘all you needed to know’ about medical negligence and the mandatory reporting of doctors; a fiery debate on the value of clinical risk categorisation in the prevention of suicide and violence; and a symposium on squalor and hoarding.</p>

<p>The highlight of the social program was, without doubt, the Gala Dinner, held at the stunning Doltone House at Jones Bay Wharf. Hilarious routines were provided by our Master of Ceremonies, NSW Fellow Angelo Virgona, and renowned guest comedienne Jean Kittson. It was difficult to pick who was the funnier! I’ll give it to Jean … but only just. And to top off a great evening, whether with the spring of youth or the muscle memory of many years treading the boards, delegates grooved and bopped away to the iconic 80s Oz band ‘Mental as Anything’ who were looking shaggier and scraggier than their heyday, but still pumping out those well-loved tunes with style.</p>
<p>Congress 2013 will be notable for hosting the inaugural Asia-Pacific Forum, where representatives from 16 nations across the Pacific Rim and mainland Asia convened to discuss the challenges of delivering mental health services in their homelands. They were delighted to be able to attend a reception at Government House, hosted by NSW Governor and esteemed RANZCP Fellow the Hon. Prof. Marie Bashir. Congress also provided an opportunity to fund the attendance of 20 NSW medical students, hand picked from a larger group of students with a strong interest in psychiatry who had expressed an interest in participating. This initiative is likely to be an excellent investment in our College’s future.</p>

<p>The program finished on a high note, with a wonderful Maori acknowledgement to incoming President, Murray Patton, including a truly fearsome haka. It reminded us all of the richness of our binational College. The ‘achievements’ of Congress 2013 were substantial and will live long in the memory. The ‘aspirations’ for Perth 2014 and future Congresses should be a prospect to savour.</p>
