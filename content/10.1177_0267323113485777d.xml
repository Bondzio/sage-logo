<p>There is now clear evidence that something of a ‘transnational turn’ is taking place in the field of television studies. This is hardly unique. In recent years several academic disciplines – from literary to historical to film studies, and still others – have witnessed a paradigm shift towards a transnational approach that has moved theory and research beyond the long-established dominance of national frameworks in the scholarly agendas. The spread of transnational turns within academia has raised certain warnings worth considering (to which I will return later) and the usual suspicion that embracing this paradigm shift may be driven by fashion. But whether or not ‘going transnational’ risks becoming ‘the latest buzzword of the scientific circus’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323113485777">Fickers and Johnson, 2010</xref>: 1), as it is believed in some quarters, there is no doubt that television studies has undertaken over the last few years a move towards transnational perspectives that challenge the long-lasting hegemonic hold exercised by nationally bound frames of analysis.</p>
<p>This is a welcome and timely move, which despite still being relatively recent has already produced a body of scholarly work that has shed fresh light both on current evolutionary trends and past historical processes of television, now regarded and investigated as a medium positioned and functioning in a largely transnational cultural space. Worth mentioning in this respect among the latest publications are Chalaby’s research on the emergence of countless cross-border TV channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267323113485777">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323113485777">2009</xref>); studies of the peculiarly transnational phenomenon of format adaptations pioneered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267323113485777">Albert Moran (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267323113485777">2010</xref>); the equally pioneering undertaking pursued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323113485777">Fickers and Johnson (2010)</xref> with the view of doing comparative historical analysis of European television from a transnational perspective; the scholarly tour-de-force manifest in the wonderful book by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267323113485777">Michele Hilmes (2012)</xref> that reconstructs the complex story of the mutual relationships and influences between British and American broadcasting since the early days of radio.</p>
<p>The book by Elke Weissmann is a further addition to this growing body of scholarship (largely exceeding the few citations I have given). The work – which is the outcome of demanding research carried out by the author over the years of her doctoral and postdoctoral studies – focuses on the multiple forms of dialogue and exchange that have characterized ‘the special relations’ between British and American television drama from the 1970s onwards. Not surprisingly, given the recognized pre-eminence of the ‘Anglo-American media connection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267323113485777">Tunstall and Machin, 1999</xref>) on the international television scene, the matter dealt with in Weissmann’s book has not been totally overlooked so far. Even though Hilmes may be right saying that ‘very little British scholarship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267323113485777">2012</xref>: 267) has engaged in telling the story of this special bilateral relation and its impact on television and culture, comparatively speaking the subject has attracted more scholarly interest than other instances of television transnationalism. Hilmes herself devotes a long chapter to the transatlantic partnership in relation to TV drama, in addition to the book-length contributions provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267323113485777">Jeffrey Miller (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267323113485777">Paul Rixon (2006)</xref> about, respectively, the role of British programmes in American culture and the importance of American programmes in the UK television context.</p>
<p>In the space for discussion created by preceding publications, Weissmann’s work positions itself as the first book-length monograph that takes a two-sided transatlantic perspective to offer a detailed account of the patterns of interaction developed between UK and US drama throughout four decades, from 1970 to 2010. The opening chapter of the book presents a historical overview of the import/export of TV drama over the whole period, highlighting how trade policies and practices were reshaped following changes in television distribution, reception and production. Despite an overload of issues, information and references hindering clarity and straightforwardness in certain points of the text, this results in a useful preliminary summary.</p>
<p>The two subsequent chapters investigate complex questions of difference and style as intervening factors that can influence trade policies and television consumption. Challenging the unidimensional conception of cultural difference as a deterrent to import and appreciation of foreign drama, Weissmann argues that a range of American products, from <italic>Dallas</italic> to <italic>Miami Vice</italic> to <italic>Sex and the City</italic>, proved attractive for British buyers and audiences alike precisely because they were perceived as completely different: their difference being built on the spectacle of wealth, consumerist lifestyles, fashion, so far removed from the working-class life portrayed in many gritty UK dramas. On the other side of the Atlantic, it was the peculiar theatrical style of the British literary adaptations and costume dramas that encouraged imports and more importantly aesthetic emulation by the American networks, thus turning the appreciation of mutual differences into a potential factor of transnational similarity. The birth of the American mini-series in the 1970s offers the author a case in point on the influence exercised by UK drama and the way it was negotiated and reworked by the US counterpart. As recalled in Chapter 4, the mini-series borrowed format and style from the British classic serials, which at that time were successfully aired by PBS on a dedicated time slot, but the UK-originated components of the new genre were nonetheless intertwined with features traceable to Hollywood cinema.</p>
<p>The remaining three chapters are, respectively, concerned with audiences of forensic drama, co-productions and quality TV. Whereas co-production issues fit all too evidently into the transnational framework – also allowing for some interesting considerations on the ways transnationalism in co-productions is subjected to being nationally reinscribed by television critics – the same cannot be said for the other couple of topics. Chapter 6 does not manage to demonstrate convincingly that audience online reviews of forensic series have pertinence and relevance in connection with the overarching discourse on transnational drama. This is largely due to the mismatch between an over-elaborate argument and scarce, not particularly telling evidence. As for the American quality drama, Weissmann’s discussion on the transnational origin and outlook of the genre is persuasive; but again, when gendered fantasies of ownership and creative control are evoked to account for the construction of quality TV as distinctively American in British discourses, the argument sounds more speculative than evidence-based.</p>
<p>I wish the book had more than occasionally engaged in issues of cultural representation and the wider resonance of transnational drama in UK and US society and culture. Nonetheless, it offers not a few points of interest and reflection, among which I have found intriguing and worthy of further thematization, the emergence, from Weismann’s accounts, of a somewhat counterintuitive imbalance of influence in the special relations between the two sides of the Atlantic: in the sense that American drama appears to have been shaped by its British counterpart more than the other way round. The book also deserves merit as an attempt to map paths and patterns of interaction between television industries and cultures beyond the ‘usual suspects’: i.e. import/export, co-productions, format-adaptations. In this connection, however, it is worth recalling the warnings I alluded to at the beginning. I refer here to Mette Hjort’s statement that ‘the term transnational does little to advance our thinking about important issues if it can mean anything and everything that the occasion would appear to demand’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323113485777">2009</xref>: 12). If the transnational turn is here to last, then television studies needs to engage in elaborating conceptual definitions and typologies of television transnationalism that might allow for better discernment and understandings of ‘what counts as transnational and what does not’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323113485777">Hjort, 2009</xref>: 13).</p>
