<p>When it comes to the issue of proselytization, most people have strong opinions with few being ambivalent. Depending on one’s religious perspective, proselytizing is always wrong or is always right. For some people, religion should remain private and any public sharing of religious beliefs is deeply offensive. For others, correct religious beliefs are a matter of life and death and should be shared as often as possible. How can such divergent views be accommodated in a western culture that values both freedom of religion and a pluralism that allows people to believe what they want?</p>
<p>Elmer Thiessen, in his book <italic>The Ethics of Evangelism</italic>, looks at this divisive issue from a very helpful perspective. Instead of beginning with the emotional reaction of trying to hide from Jehovah’s Witnesses or being manipulated by an evangelist into converting neighbours, the author looks at the issue from a philosophical point of view.</p>
<p>Thiessen, who confesses to be a Christian, acknowledges the challenges that western societies are facing with regard to public faith. The author presents numerous cases in which people have been punished for sharing their faith. To some, this is a positive achievement, as it moves society along the secular continuum. But does the banning of proselytizing really fit with western values?</p>
<p>Thiessen systematically goes through the issues, working past emotional responses, and focusing on the main questions. Thiessen begins by looking at some introductory considerations. Here he puts the conversation in its social and academic context and provides an apologetic for why the subject is important. In the second section, Thiessen examines some of the objections to proselytizing. Here, Thiessen deals with many important topics, including questions about the nature of truth and religious pluralism. He also looks at questions about freedom and concerns about physical or psychological coercion. Thiessen then presents a positive approach to proselytizing, using a somewhat surprising argument from John Stuart Mill.</p>
<p>Thiessen also presses the reader to differentiate between etiquette and ethics. Proselytizing may make one feel uncomfortable, but that does not mean it is unethical. He reminds the readers that as much as a person may want to be free from proselytization, the religious person equally wants the freedom to proselytize. Both sets of desires must be taken into account. Thiessen explains that proselytization takes place all the time, even if it is not always religious in nature. For example, evangelists for Apple computer products or German automobiles are perfectly acceptable, and one must ask why switching the subject to religion makes proselytization unethical.</p>
<p>Despite Thiessen’s clear defense of proselytization, he does admit that it can be done in an unethical manner. Just because a sound defense can be raised for proselytization this does not mean that every form of evangelism is acceptable. Not only does the author condemn physical and psychological coercion, he also criticizes so-called “friendship evangelism.”</p>
<p>
<italic>The Ethics of Evangelism</italic> is an important book, if for no other reason than that few scholars have looked at this subject. Thiessen does an excellent job of opening the path to further discussion. While those predisposed to being against proselytization will likely disagree with Thiessen’s conclusions, this book will, hopefully, move the conversation deeper. For those who support a secular state free from religion, this book will provide challenges to their value system. For those who feel the need to evangelize everyone they meet, this book may cause them to re-evaluate what they do and how they do it.</p>
