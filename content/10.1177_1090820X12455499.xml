<p>“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” “The enemy of ‘good’ is ‘better.’” “Don’t upset the applecart.” These are all common expressions with a common meaning: Leave it alone. Be satisfied with what you’ve got. Stick to the status quo.</p>
<p>As aesthetic surgeons, we are often faced with the dilemma of whether to try something new in our practices. It may be a new piece of equipment, a new surgical technique, or a new safety protocol. Sometimes opting for change is a relative “no-brainer.” For example, the recommendation to use intermittent pneumatic compression devices or venous foot pumps in any plastic surgery operative case lasting over 1 hour, as well as for all our patients receiving general anesthesia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12455499">1</xref></sup> appears to have been widely adopted. An aesthetic surgeon is likely to assess that there is essentially no downside to incorporating these specific measures, and there are potential benefits—added protection for the patient and a reduction in the doctor’s liability risk for an untoward venous thromboembolism (VTE) event. However, recommendations for the use of chemoprophylaxis have not been as broadly embraced, particularly by surgeons operating in nonhospital ambulatory surgery centers. When it comes to chemoprophylaxis, the risk-benefit ratio can be highly patient- and procedure-dependent, and thus the subject remains controversial. This is despite recommendations, albeit measured ones, for specific uses of chemoprophylaxis from as credible a source as the Venous Thromboembolism Task Force of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12455499">2</xref></sup> The question is, upon what should we base our personal “best practices”? The recommendations of “experts”? Our own clinical experience? What is the key to making us change, or not change—not just with respect to VTE prevention but in every aspect of our surgical practices?</p>
<p>As an American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) Visiting Professor, I have had the pleasure of addressing many groups of plastic surgery residents. Invariably, one of the first things I tell them is that the only procedure I perform today exactly as I was originally taught is skin grafting. Virtually all my other techniques have totally changed over the years. And while today I am a huge proponent of evidence-based medicine (EBM), I must admit that many of the past changes I have chosen to make in the way I perform surgery were based more on clinical experience and judgment than meticulous scientific evaluation. Of course, this was not necessarily a matter of choice. Aesthetic surgery’s historical reliance on expert opinion and small case-series data, rather than on direct controlled comparisons between treatment options, has sometimes limited our ability to make scientifically-based decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12455499">3</xref></sup> However, when deciding whether or not to try a new technique, I have always attempted to answer the following questions:</p>
<list id="list1-1090820X12455499" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Does the technique really provide a better aesthetic result?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Does it provide consistently reproducible results?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are these good results attainable by all or only the “experts”?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is the safety profile better than, or at least equal to, that of my current technique?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is the technique a good match for my level of surgical skill and experience?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Most surgeons still evaluate aesthetic outcomes the way I did in my younger years (and, for the most part, still do)—relying upon their own sensibilities about what looks good and what doesn’t, as well as feedback from satisfied (or unsatisfied) patients. You may have read in a previous issue of this journal about a new paradigm for the quantitative analysis of aesthetic results proposed by Aly et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12455499">4</xref></sup> The authors first accomplish the task of determining an aesthetic “ideal” and then measure actual patient outcomes against it, utilizing advanced photographic and software technology. Their methods are intriguing and certainly useful for developing a more evidence-based approach to aesthetic outcomes. Most of the time, however, aesthetic surgeons first evaluate the results of a new technique by viewing examples of another surgeon’s work and deciding, on a purely subjective basis, whether they like what they see. Yes, there may be only a few patient photos upon which to make a judgment and, presumably, those are among the best results that the presenting surgeon has to offer. But if the technique seems to successfully address anatomic areas with which we ourselves have experienced problems or been disappointed by suboptimal results, our interest is understandably piqued.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as Dr David Larson pointed out in his excellent Guest Editorial, “Fat Is Exciting, but . . .,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X12455499">5</xref></sup> the tendency among plastic surgeons has always been to adopt a new technique first, ask questions later. I believe this hurried approach to decision making is even more prevalent today than in the past. For one thing, we face mounting pressure from our patients to adopt new techniques that have been touted as the “latest and greatest” in the popular media. These days, it is not unusual for a patient to begin the consultation by telling her doctor exactly what procedure she needs, as well as the precise technique she wishes the physician to employ. This conversation often takes place before the surgeon has even had an opportunity to evaluate the patient’s aesthetic concerns. Surgeons also can feel pressured to expand their range of techniques because of competition from plastic surgery colleagues and other specialists in the community who may be aggressively advertising their claimed expertise in a new procedure. These are not necessarily the “right” reasons to change your technique or add variations to your current methods, but they are real-world, practical reasons why many plastic surgeons might decide to try something new.</p>
<p>The very important question of whether the superior results of a particular technique are consistently reproducible is certainly the crux of any good decision to make a change. This is the question that EBM is perhaps most successful in addressing for the aesthetic surgeon. Granted, EBM has its limitations. For example, it cannot account for individual factors such as quality- and value-of-life judgments, and it often requires large numbers of patients to detect differences in treatment results. It can be very effective, however, in predicting outcomes in areas of practice that can be analyzed using scientific methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X12455499">6</xref></sup> When consumers demand a better product, the market usually responds to meet that demand. In the same way, aesthetic surgeons are beginning to recognize that the validity of their personal decision-making process depends on the quality of available data to support it. In response, clinicians and researchers are slowly incorporating more EBM principles into their study design, data collection, and presentations. With more complete data in the literature, and more careful attention by presenters to providing scientific evidence of consistently reproducible results, aesthetic surgeons can approach decision making with greater confidence and clarity.</p>
<p>Nowhere is the availability of scientifically-based data more important than in the area of patient safety. Unfortunately, the safety of a new technique or product is not merely a matter of assessing results in the intraoperative and immediate postoperative periods. Sometimes, as we all know, safety issues do not emerge until much later. In our well-intentioned efforts to curb capsular contracture, how many times and by how many surgeons were steroids injected into breast implants before it was determined that this practice has potentially negative consequences down the line?<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X12455499">7</xref></sup> Only in an ideal world would we be able to anticipate and prevent every conceivable patient complication, but EBM gives us the best possible chance at intelligently weighing risks and benefits before we decide to try something new.</p>
<p>Progress in any field or any endeavor depends, to some extent, on taking risks. But especially in the field of medicine, we cannot afford blind risks. We must be armed with scientific facts. We also must be aware of our own strengths and limitations as surgeons. There are many operative techniques that I employ on a regular basis today that would have been wholly inappropriate for me to undertake during my first few years in practice. I simply did not have the experience or the confidence to venture too far from what I had been taught. What works well in one person’s hands doesn’t necessarily work as well in another’s, particularly without the requisite experience to handle unforeseen complications. Of course, the concept that greater complexity necessarily achieves better results has essentially gone by the wayside. Many of our patients are happiest with the least invasive options. And even our own clinical studies, flawed as they may be from a scientific perspective, have often failed to demonstrate any significant advantage in more- versus less-complex techniques. The examples that come readily to mind are the studies that compared results from 4 different face-lift techniques performed on sets of identical twins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X12455499">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X12455499">9</xref></sup> Although obviously some surgeons adamantly favor one face-lift technique over another, most objective critiques have concluded that a combination of proper patient selection and surgeon judgment and skill—as much as or more than a specific technique—is responsible for consistently excellent results. On the other hand, there may be compelling reasons to change certain things we do. As a good example, there is growing evidence that the use of progressive tension sutures in abdominoplasty is effective in reducing seroma and eliminating the need for drains. While there is a learning curve for this technique, the data suggest it is a change worth considering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X12455499">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X12455499"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X12455499">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The decision to change one’s way of doing things is never easy. Sometimes we try something new and end up going back to what we are used to. But all of us, as aesthetic surgeons, have an obligation to educate ourselves about new techniques and methods. We have an obligation to research the literature and carefully evaluate studies, including their Level of Evidence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X12455499">13</xref></sup> And, finally, we have a responsibility to our patients to adopt new techniques that demonstrably improve outcomes and patient satisfaction. In the process, we ensure continued growth of our professionalism, skill, and creativity.</p>
