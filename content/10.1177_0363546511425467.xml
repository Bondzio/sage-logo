<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Little is known of injury patterns in track and field (athletics). Injury prevalence has been proposed as the most appropriate measure of the injury rate in sports where athletes are at risk for overuse problems.</p>
<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> To ascertain 1-year retrospective and current prevalence of injury in elite track and field athletes to help plan injury prevention programs for this sport.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design:</bold> Descriptive epidemiology study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Two hundred seventy-eight youth (16 years old) and adult athletes from an eligible study population of 321 athletes were included.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The 1-year retrospective injury prevalence was 42.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36.9%-49.0%); the point prevalence was 35.4% (95% CI, 29.7%-41.4%). The diagnosis group displaying the highest injury prevalence was inflammation and pain in the gradual onset category (1-year prevalence, 20.9%; 95% CI, 16.2%-26.2%; and point prevalence, 23.2%; 95% CI, 18.4%-28.7%). A strong tendency for higher 1-year prevalence of 16.5% (95% CI, 12.2%-21.4%) than point prevalence of 8.5% (95% CI, 5.5%-12.5%) was recorded for sudden onset injuries in the diagnosis group sprain, strain, and rupture. The body region showing the highest injury prevalence was the knee and lower leg with 15.0% (95% CI, 11.0%-19.8%) 1-year prevalence and 13.7% (95% CI, 9.8%-18.3%) point prevalence, followed by the Achilles tendon, ankle, and foot/toe with 11.7% (95% CI, 8.2%-16.1%) 1-year prevalence and 11.4% (95% CI, 7.9%-15.8%) point prevalence.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The injury prevalence is high among Swedish elite track and field athletes. Most of the injuries affect the lower extremities and are associated with a gradual onset. Although it is associated with a potential recall bias, the 1-year retrospective prevalence measure captured more sudden onset injuries than the point prevalence measure. Future prospective studies in track and field are needed to identify groups of athletes at increased risk.</p>

<body>
<p>Track and field (athletics) is a popular sport worldwide with international championships organized for athletes from 17 years of age. In 2010, the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) represented 212 national athletic federations (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iaaf.org">http://www.iaaf.org</ext-link>). Only a few epidemiological studies covering cross-discipline populations of elite track and field athletes have been reported. These studies report annual injury incidences between 61% and 76%, with a strong dominance of overuse-related conditions such as tendinopathies and stress fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511425467">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511425467">10</xref></sup> In sports, overuse injuries are seen as a result of repeated microtrauma without a single identifiable event responsible for the condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511425467">14</xref></sup> Temporal models describing the development of load-induced injury associated with overuse injuries have recently been presented such as in the areas of tendinopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511425467">9</xref></sup> and osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511425467">25</xref></sup> According to these temporal models, tissue changes associated with load-induced injury can be illustrated along a continuum. At the early reactive stages of this continuum, reduction of load may allow the injured tissue to return to a previous level of structure and capacity. At the later degenerative stages, however, there is little capacity for reversibility of the load-induced changes. Overuse injuries of this latter type have been described as becoming chronic, characterized by periods of pain only intermittingly relieved by reduced load or supportive interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511425467">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511425467">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511425467">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511425467">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>To be able to plan sports safety interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511425467">28</xref></sup> in track and field, injury patterns need to be documented. The frequent occurrence of overuse injuries reported from previous studies suggests that recording new injuries among previously healthy athletes does not provide a complete description of the injury burden. Prevalence rates are therefore an important complement to injury incidence in the documentation process because long-term injuries are also accounted for in prevalence measures. Moreover, the temporal pathogenesis model implies that timely adjustment of practice schedules or medical interventions can prevent common load-induced musculoskeletal conditions among elite track and field athletes progressing into chronic stages.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to support the planning of injury prevention at primary (preventing injury), secondary (preventing manifest injuries developing into chronic conditions), and tertiary levels (avoiding performance-limiting consequences from chronic conditions) in a national population of elite track and field athletes. By exploiting experiences from research on chronic musculoskeletal conditions such as back pain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511425467">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511425467">29</xref></sup> both point and 1-year recordings of prevalence have been used to cover for the shifting symptomatology of chronic musculoskeletal conditions in sports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511425467">8</xref></sup> The specific aim of the study was to compare conventional recording of point prevalence with 1-year recall of major injuries (1-year retrospective prevalence) in Swedish adult and youth elite track and field athletes.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This study used a cross-sectional design. Data were collected in April 2009 by a Web-based questionnaire assessing self-reported injury data from athletes. The results were categorized using a modified version of Hauret et al’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511425467">16</xref></sup> matrix for classification of musculoskeletal diagnoses into injury type (diagnosis group), body location, and subgroup of events. Ethical approval was obtained for the study from the Ethical Committee in Linköping in November 2008 (dnr. M-201-08). Informed written consent was collected from all participants. For those under the age of 18 years, approval was also obtained from their parents. This research is part of the Swedish athletics injury study that also includes 1-year prospective injury surveillance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511425467">18</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section2-0363546511425467">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>The population consisted of individuals ranked among the Swedish top 10 adult or youth (age group, 16 years) track and field athletes at the end of the 2008 outdoor season in male or female track and field events. There were 18 arena events for youth athletes and 19 for adult athletes at the time of the study. The events for adult athletes include 5000 m and 10 000 m races, while 3000 m is the only long-distance running event for youth athletes. Four top 10 lists (2 adult and 2 youth) for each discipline were thus compiled by the Swedish Athletic Association (SAA). If an athlete was ranked among the top 10 in more than one discipline, the athlete was only included in his or her main discipline, and the next in rank within the top 25 list was included in the study population. Participants were excluded from the study if they were ranked higher in another discipline or if no postal address was available.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546511425467">
<title>Participant Recruitment</title>
<p>Postal addresses for the adult group were obtained from the SAA or, if unavailable, from the athlete’s local club. For the youth athletes, no such central register exists. The addresses were instead collected from a Web site listing contact information for most Swedish citizens (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.upplysning.se">www.upplysning.se</ext-link>, Berlock Information AB, Enköping, Sweden). Invitations were distributed using the postal service in the period from December 2008 to January 2009 with one reminder in February 2009. Letters were sent to 649 athletes (367 adults and 282 youths). Ten athletes were excluded from the study because of retirement from track and field. Seventy-two percent (n = 461) responded to the invitation, of whom 70% (n = 321) consented to participate in the study. The enrolled study population included 321 individuals, which was 50.5% of the eligible population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511425467">Figure 1</xref>). The athletes were categorized into event groups: throws (discus, javelin, hammer, shot put), sprints including hurdles (100-400 m), middle and long distances including steeple (800-10,000 m), jumps (high, long, triple, pole vault), and combined events.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Prevalence is an indicator of morbidity, accounting for the number of individuals with an existing disease or injury in a given time interval. In this study, both period (ie, 1 year) and point estimates (ie, at a specific time) of injury prevalence were used. For the 1-year prevalence estimate, an athletics injury was defined as a musculoskeletal condition that made the athlete partially or completely abstain from training or competition in track and field for a 3-week minimum injury period during the past year, and for the point prevalence estimate, an athletics injury was defined as a musculoskeletal injury at the time of the survey. Injury prevalence data were collected using a Web-based questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511425467">18</xref></sup> The Web-based system used for the study was based on a commercial product for the collection of survey data (SiteVision v2.5, Senselogic AB, Örebro, Sweden). First, data on demographics and participant characteristics were collected (ie, sex, age, height, weight, experiences from participation in track and field, and main discipline). Thereafter, the athlete was then asked for injury data and for a self-reported diagnosis for each injury.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546511425467">
<title>Data Categorization and Analysis</title>
<p>A group consisting of 1 physical therapist and 3 physicians with a background in sports medicine classified each self-reported diagnosis into a 3-digit diagnosis code (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM]). The physical therapist (J.J.) and one physician (S.N.) independently produced preliminary coding, and any diversity was a subject for clarification. The list was then reviewed by the 2 remaining physicians (P.R., T.T.). To categorize the coded injury data according to injury type (injury nature) and anatomic location (body region), a matrix adjusted to track and field injuries from Hauret et al’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511425467">16</xref></sup> original classification for diagnoses in chapter 13 of the ICD-9-CM (“Diseases of the Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue”) was developed. Injury categories are identified in the matrix by column headings along the horizontal axis (Appendix 1, available in the online version of this article at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/">http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/</ext-link>). Rows represent the categories of nontraumatic injury and traumatic injury at the highest level along the horizontal axis. Traumatic injuries were included from chapter 17 of the ICD-9-CM (“Injury and Poisoning”) into Hauret et al’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511425467">16</xref></sup> matrix. These diagnoses cover acute traumatic injuries with sudden discernable effects. In our version of the matrix, the additional diagnosis of traumatic injury was structured according to Barell et al’s matrix for categorization of traumatic injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511425467">4</xref></sup> An additional row was inserted along the upper horizontal axis, dividing the nontraumatic injuries into those with sudden and gradual onset. The first row of the adjusted matrix displays the injury diagnosis groups according to Hauret et al’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511425467">16</xref></sup> and Barell et al’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511425467">4</xref></sup> matrices. The present modified matrix only includes those ICD-9-CM codes for injuries reported in our study, as we made no attempt to categorize all possible diagnoses that could occur in track and field. Inflammation and pain (gradual onset) consist of injuries that are characterized by inflammation and/or pain, for example, low back pain (code 724.2), patellar tendinopathy (code 726.64), medial tibial stress syndrome (ie, shin splints) (code 844.9), and Achilles tendinopathy (code 726.71), caused by physical damage resulting from low magnitude forces (microtrauma). The second group includes stress fractures (gradual onset); common areas for stress fractures include the tibia (code 733.93) and metatarsals (code 733.94). The third group, sprain/strain/rupture (sudden onset), includes injuries with sudden onset because of acute trauma, possibly in combination with preceding cumulative microtrauma. Examples of sprain/strain/rupture include thigh strains (code 843) or ankle sprains (code 845). The fourth group, joint derangement (sudden onset), includes conditions that involve a joint derangement or dislocation with and without neurological involvement. These injuries result from traumatic forces, sometimes in combination with preceding cumulative microtrauma, and include meniscal tears of the knee (codes 717.0-717.5) and articular cartilage disorders such as intervertebral disc disorders of the cervical (code 722.0) or lumbar spine (code 722.1). The other and unspecified group consists of injuries that are hard to classify to a specific body region from their ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes.</p>
<p>Data are mainly presented using descriptive statistics. χ<sup>2</sup> tests were used to test for differences in proportions between age group and gender. Each athlete could report injuries to several body regions, but only the first injury reported for each body region was used in the analysis. Comparisons between the prevalence measures were made with regard to body region, diagnosis group, and subgroups of events, that is, sprint, jump, throw, and long- and middle-distance running. All tests were 2-sided, and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was regarded as statistically significant. We used Statistica v9 (StatSoft Inc, Tulsa, Oklahoma) for all the statistical analyses.</p>

<title>Injury Prevalence</title>
<p>The overall 1-year retrospective injury prevalence was 42.8% (95%, confidence interval [CI], 36.9%-49.0%). Twenty-one athletes reported injuries to 2 body regions, and 3 athletes reported injuries to more than 2 body regions. The point prevalence of ongoing injury was 35.4% (95% CI, 29.7%-41.4%). Fourteen athletes suffered from injuries to 2 body regions at the time of the data collection, and 2 reported having suffered injuries to more than 2 body regions. Thirty-four athletes reported that they had no injury lasting for more than 3 weeks during the past 12 months, but they were suffering from an injury at the time of data collection.</p>
<p>The 1-year injury prevalence showed a tendency to vary with regard to gender and age (<italic>P</italic> = .11). The highest 1-year prevalence was found in male adult athletes (50%), followed by female adult athletes (47%), female youth athletes (44%), and male youth athletes (29%). The point prevalence varied with gender and age (<italic>P</italic> = .025). The highest point prevalence was found in female youth athletes (45%), followed by female adult athletes (39%), male adult athletes (36%), and male youth athletes (18%). Post hoc comparisons showed that the 1-year prevalence (<italic>P</italic> = .06) and point prevalence (<italic>P</italic> = .025) of injury were higher among female youth athletes than male youth athletes. There was no gender difference in injury prevalence among the adult athletes.</p>
<p>The diagnosis group that displayed the highest 1-year prevalence (20.9%; 95% CI, 16.2%-22.2%) and point prevalence (23.2%; 95% CI, 18.4%-28.7%) of injury was inflammation and pain with gradual onset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546511425467">Table 3</xref>). A higher 1-year prevalence (16.5%; 95% CI, 12.2%-21.4%) than point prevalence (8.5%; 95% CI, 5.5%-12.5%) was recorded for sudden onset injuries in the sprain, strain, and rupture group. The body region displaying the highest injury prevalence in both 1-year prevalence and point prevalence was the knee and lower leg (1-year prevalence, 15.0% [95% CI, 11.0%-19.8%]; point prevalence, 13.7% [95% CI, 9.8%-18.3%]), followed by the Achilles tendon, ankle, and foot/toe (1-year prevalence, 11.7% [95% CI, 8.2%-16.1%]; point prevalence, 11.4% [95% CI, 7.9%-15.8%]) (Appendix 2, available online). No statistically significant difference between the 1-year retrospective and point measures was observed with regard to the prevalence of injuries to different body regions, nor did the measures differ with regard to injury prevalence in the different event categories. No difference between event categories was verified statistically, but throwing athletes displayed the highest point prevalence (49%; 95% CI, 35%-63%) and the lowest 1-year prevalence (35%; 95% CI, 23%-49%).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The International Olympic Committee recently recommended health evaluations be routine in all elite sports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511425467">21</xref></sup> Both measures used in this study revealed a high prevalence of musculoskeletal injuries in elite track and field athletes; the 1-year prevalence of injury lasting for more than 3 weeks was 43% (95% CI, 37%-49%), whereas the point injury prevalence was 35% (95% CI, 30%-41%). Approximately 9 of 10 recorded injuries affected the lower extremities. The point prevalence measure accounted for fewer injuries in the sudden onset sprain/strain/rupture diagnosis group than the 1-year measure. This observation may reflect that strains and ruptures are caused by acute overload, commonly associated with invoking close to maximal muscular strength in competitive situations. Seasonal variations in competition and practice schedules can affect measures of point injury prevalence in track and field. Our data collection was conducted during a period with few competitions, that is, immediately after the indoor season and when the general preparation for the outdoor season had started. If using point prevalence as a measure of the injury burden in track and field, we recommend a thorough analysis of when during a season to implement the data collection because this choice is likely to influence the outcome.</p>
<p>There are few previous studies of injury epidemiology in general track and field populations. The main injury types reported from studies in specific settings have varied: for example, strains and cramps from competitions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511425467">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511425467">2</xref></sup> and ankle sprains from pole vault training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511425467">26</xref></sup> Regarding ankle sprains, low-grade sprains have been found in athletes to result in a higher risk of reinjury than the high-grade sprains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511425467">23</xref></sup> The 43% 1-year injury prevalence observed in our study involving a general athletics population is lower than the 76% reported from an Australian study involving 95 athletes competing in running and jumping events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511425467">6</xref></sup> The latter study used interviews for collection of 1-year retrospective injury data and a 1-week time-loss period to define injury. We used a 3-week definition to minimize the recall bias and include injuries that considerably interfered with practice and competition. An injury causing more than 21 days lost from sports participation has been defined as being severe when time-loss definitions are used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511425467">11</xref></sup> In both studies, injuries to the knee and lower leg were the most common (35%-44%), followed by thigh injuries (21%-26%). No injuries to the upper extremity were recorded in the Australian study. However, it should be noted that the study did not include athletes competing in throwing events.</p>
<p>An important issue in sports injury epidemiology is the lack of a uniform coding system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511425467">24</xref></sup> Our matrix for track and field injuries depicts the nature (type) of injury as diagnosis groups in the columns and the injured body regions in the rows. The categorization of the diagnoses as ICD-9-CM codes and placement in their appropriate cells give substance to the matrix. The origin of the data in this study was athlete self-reports and not clinical examinations. Nonetheless, the results are assumed to be epidemiologically valid at the level of injury type and body region. Regarding injury types, the matrix analysis indicates 2 areas of concern, inflammation/pain and sprains/strains/ruptures, which together accounted for approximately 9 of 10 injured athletes. For further use of this matrix in track and field, we propose use of data from clinical examinations, which would allow these categories to be carefully subdivided to enable more specific groups of diagnoses to be traced. For example, ankle sprains and hamstring strains end up together in the present matrix, even though they represent injuries with different underlying causes and mechanisms. Furthermore, it is necessary to scrutinize the inflammation and pain category, which contains a large variety of injuries. Pain should be considered a symptom rather than a final tissue diagnosis, and many clinical conditions previously assumed to be caused by general inflammatory mediators may today be associated with tissue changes. In future studies, it is necessary to focus on how to methodically analyze these gradual onset overuse injuries to enhance the establishment of a proper clinical diagnosis as a basis for development of more targeted intervention programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511425467">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511425467">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study has limitations that need to be taken into consideration. First, the time-loss period used to define reportable injuries differed between the 1-year and point prevalence measures. It would have been possible to use the 3-week time-loss definition to measure the point injury prevalence at a retrospective date at least 3 weeks before the survey. This strategy would, however, have produced a less intuitive measure of point prevalence. Second, data were collected only on musculoskeletal conditions, which means that several important injury types, such as concussions and burns, were not accounted for. Third, participation bias is a greater threat to the validity of prevalence studies than to studies of associations between exposures and outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511425467">19</xref></sup> The study population was defined as being among the top 10 in Sweden in the 2008 season, implying a risk for a “healthy worker” bias; that is, elite athletes affected by season-long injuries were not invited. Fourth, because this was a total population study of all Swedish elite athletes, no power calculations were performed before the data collection. It is thus possible that some differences between prevalence measures, injury types, or body regions were not discovered. Finally, the validity of self-reported 1-year injury history may be threatened by recall bias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511425467">15</xref></sup> However, Florenes et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511425467">13</xref></sup> and Bjorneboe et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511425467">7</xref></sup> previously compared medical staff prospective registrations with retrospective interviews of athletes in both individual and team sports. Both these studies presented an underestimate of the injury burden in the recording by the medical staff, and Florenes et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511425467">13</xref></sup> actually captured more injuries by retrospective self-reports.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Using 2 different measures, a high injury prevalence was found among elite track and field athletes. The 1-year prevalence definition captured more sudden onset injuries, even though it was associated with a potential recall bias. Most of the recorded injuries were nontraumatic with gradual onset, indicating an association with overuse. This finding implies that in present-day elite athletics populations, there is a particular need for injury prevention at secondary (preventing inflammatory processes developing into chronic conditions) and tertiary levels (avoiding performance-limiting consequences from chronic conditions). Future prospective studies in track and field are needed to identify groups of young athletes at increased injury risk and to develop primary prevention programs for this age category.</p>
