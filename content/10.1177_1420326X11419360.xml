<abstract>
<p>This research investigated resident behaviours in relation to kitchen ventilation in residential buildings in order to improve kitchen indoor air quality (IAQ) in South Korean living spaces. The research involved a survey study of 182 households, which identified resident behaviour with respect to ventilation, their satisfaction level regarding the IAQ, and their use and maintenance of range hoods in the kitchens. This paper describes the kitchen CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations with both natural and mechanical ventilation. The adequacy of the ventilation behaviour was determined by monitoring the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and ventilation behaviours in 10 sampled households of residential buildings. The results showed that natural ventilation was conducted for less than 20 min once a day and that 23.3% of respondents used both natural ventilation and mechanical ventilators. Moreover, the results demonstrated that mechanical ventilators were not properly maintained. In addition, the average CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was greater than 1000 ppm during cooking, and natural ventilation was more effective than were mechanical ventilators. Most residents performed inadequate kitchen ventilation to achieve comfortable IAQ. This study suggests ways to improve the ventilation behaviours of residents. The findings of this research should aid in the development of IAQ standards for Korean residential buildings and may contribute to the establishment of ventilation guidelines.</p></abstract>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11419360" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Increasing numbers of people are leading healthier lifestyles and are becoming increasingly aware of their environmental responsibilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11419360">1</xref>]. Taneja et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11419360">2</xref>] argued that a healthy indoor environment is one that promotes the comfort, health, and wellbeing of the occupants. Indoor air quality (IAQ) is an issue of key concern for a healthy house because individuals spend most of their time indoors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11419360">3</xref>] and, because these days buildings are built to be airtight to increase energy efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11419360">4</xref>]. So, the IAQ in residential buildings can actually affect the health of the residents.</p>
<p>The kitchen is the room in which family and friends often gather to eat, drink, and socialize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11419360">1</xref>]. Kitchens have a high probability for exposure to pollutants such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, food smells, and some harmful volatile organic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11419360">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11419360">10</xref>]. Such pollutants can be generated in a short period of time during cooking. However, information on IAQ in the kitchens of residential buildings is very limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11419360">11</xref>].</p>
<p>The primary objective of this research was to survey resident behaviour in relation to kitchen ventilation and the maintenance of mechanical ventilators in kitchens through a questionnaire. Furthermore, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of indoor air was analysed to elucidate ways to improve ventilation behaviours.</p>
<p>Previous studies relating to IAQ in kitchens have carried out measurements or determined the presence of certain sources to assess the degree of exposure to indoor combustion products. For instance, Tian et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11419360">3</xref>] analysed pollutant concentrations in the kitchen and living room. However, ventilation behaviours must be identified to properly suggest ventilation guidelines, in addition to pollutant measurements.</p>
<p>In a kitchen, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration can be used as an indicator of the ventilation rate per occupant and the adequacy of pollution removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11419360">12</xref>]. Von Pettenkofer stated in 1858 that CO<sub>2</sub> itself was not important, but that it was an indicator of the amount of other noxious substances produced by man. He reported that air was not fit for breathing if the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (due to human respiration) was greater than 1000 ppm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11419360">13</xref>]. Measured indoor air concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> produced by human respiration have been used worldwide as an indicator of inadequate ventilation in schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11419360">14</xref>]. However, little is known about the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations with regard to improved ventilation behaviours in residential buildings.</p>
<p>As the concentrations of other indoor pollutants increase, CO<sub>2</sub> increases proportionally. Therefore, CO<sub>2</sub> is used as a measure of indoor air pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11419360">15</xref>]. Earlier research has shown that CO<sub>2</sub> concentration could play a role as a surrogate indicator of IAQ and ventilation efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11419360">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X11419360">21</xref>].</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X11419360" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>This research is divided into two phases: a kitchen ventilation behaviour survey and a field study to measure CO<sub>2</sub> concentration.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X11419360"><title>Ventilation Behaviour Survey</title>
<p>In the first phase, a survey was distributed to 200 apartment residents in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do in South Korea, with its questions mainly focusing on resident behaviours regarding kitchen ventilation and the maintenance of the mechanical ventilator in the kitchen. Even though IAQ is an interior environmental requirement in all types of housing, including detached houses, the survey was limited to apartment residents. Apartments were chosen not only to exclude the discrepancies that stem from the respective characteristics of different housing types, but also because the apartment represents 53% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11419360">22</xref>] of all housing types in Korea.</p>
<p>The questionnaire consisted of enquiries on demographic and housing-related information, as well as resident behavioural characteristics regarding kitchen ventilation, characteristics for maintaining a mechanical ventilator, and satisfaction regarding kitchen IAQ. After a preliminary survey was conducted, the questionnaire was modified, and the main survey was conducted from 15 October 2010 to 5 January 2011. A total of 182 of 200 questionnaires were collected and used for the analysis. The SPSS WIN program for statistical analysis was used, and the data were analysed using simple statistical analysis, cross-analysis, <italic>t</italic>-test, and analysis of variance.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1420326X11419360"><title>Measurement of CO<sub>2</sub> Concentration in the Kitchen</title>
<p>In the second phase, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was measured in 10 randomly sampled houses among the 182 surveyed apartments. The sizes of the respondent houses were categorized into five types, and two cases were randomly sampled from each type. The house sizes were classified into groups of 20 s, 30 s, 40 s, 50 s pyeong, and greater than 50 pyeong, which were converted into groups of less than 80, 80–100, 100–134, 134–158, and 158 m<sup>2</sup> or larger, according to the general classification standard in South Korea.</p>
<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in each kitchen was monitored from 6 PM to 9 PM, along with resident ventilation behaviours.</p>
<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in each kitchen was measured with a Gray Wolf DS IAQ Plus kit (IQ-610 XTRA), and the data during cooking were saved at 1-min intervals for 10 days from 5th to 15th of January. The CO<sub>2</sub> sensor was placed in the kitchen, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11419360">Figure 1</xref>; it was positioned about 1 m above the floor, at least 1 m from all walls, and 1–1.5 m from the gas range. After measurement, the data were downloaded into version 3.21 of the WOLFSENSE PC Advanced Data Analysis reporting program. Graphs were prepared using Microsoft Office Excel 2007.

<p>The gender, age, and household income of each participant were investigated to analyse the demographic characteristics. The characteristics of the 182 subjects are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11419360">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11419360">2</xref>. Each age group except those in their 60 s comprised about 20% of the total respondents. The most common household income range was from more than 2 million to less than 6 million won. The average monthly income of households in the Korean urban area was about 4 million won in 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11419360">23</xref>]. The majority of respondents could be characterized as middle class. Looking at the housing characteristics presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11419360">Table 2</xref>, 49.4% of respondents were living in 80–100 m<sup>2</sup> living spaces with an average kitchen area of 11.99 m<sup>2</sup>. More than half of the respondents had been living in their current apartments for more than 4 years, and more than 90% of respondents were living in LDK-type houses whose kitchens were fully or partially connected with other living spaces.

Regarding the types of ventilation used, 28.3% of respondents replied that they ran mechanical ventilators (range hoods) concurrent with natural ventilation, while 16.7% used no ventilation, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1420326X11419360">Table 5</xref>.

<p>For the management of comfortable IAQ, the use of natural ventilation is the most economically and environmentally effective method. Increasing the natural ventilation allows residents to enjoy better IAQ and thus a healthier living environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1420326X11419360">25</xref>]. However, when natural ventilation is insufficient, mechanical ventilation is required. Generally, devices for mechanical ventilation, such as range hoods in kitchens, are installed in apartments. Because it is difficult to visually determine the pollution level in a house, it is also difficult to determine the efficiency and propriety of mechanical ventilator function. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse the use and maintenance characteristics of range hoods in order to establish guidelines for improving IAQ.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1420326X11419360">Table 7</xref> shows the degree of range hood use in the surveyed kitchens. The respondents reported moderate use of range hoods. As the respondent age increased, the use of the range hood also increased. In addition, the group in the house size “134 m<sup>2</sup> or larger” used their range hoods more often than did others living in smaller apartments.

<p>Furthermore, periodically checking the performance of a range hood is also essential for efficient maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1420326X11419360">26</xref>]. Only 30.2% of respondents reported checking the performance of their range hoods; that is, two-thirds of respondents did not perform period checkups. Based on these results, it is possible to conclude that residents habitually use range hoods without actually checking the performance. The maintenance of the range hoods shows relationships with respondent age, house size, and household income. As the respondent age and house size increase, respondents show more interest in cleaning range hoods and verifying their performances. However, household income was significant only for range hood cleaning. Consequently, the majority of residents in apartments in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do do not appropriately maintain their range hoods. As a result, mechanical ventilation in the kitchen fails to properly affect the indoor air environment.</p>

The group with spacious apartments showed higher satisfaction for kitchen IAQ. In addition, the total satisfaction for range hood performance was below average, but residents living in apartments “134 m<sup>2</sup> or larger” showed a higher degree of satisfaction compared to those of the other groups. Most respondent satisfaction with the range hood performance was low; therefore, the satisfaction regarding kitchen IAQ after range hood use was also low.

<p>According to the analysis results of the 10 households, the typical cooking time was 30–70 min, and the usage time of the gas range was about 12–60 min. Generally, the residents did not open windows to ventilate the kitchen at the beginning of cooking. Four households utilized natural ventilation in addition to range hoods, and six households ventilated with range hoods only. However, there were no households which used range hoods or opened windows at the start of gas range use (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table14-1420326X11419360">Table 14</xref>). Most of the households utilized ventilation while cooking, but they did not show active participation in ventilation behaviours; in particular, natural ventilation was mainly used at the end of cooking or after. The fact that this research was done during winter might have influenced the occupants’ ventilation behaviours for occupants prefer warmer climates in cold area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1420326X11419360">27</xref>].

<p>The Korean Standard associated with IAQ provides regulations for the contaminants shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table15-1420326X11419360">Table 15</xref>. The relevant regulations for IAQ are stipulated in Building Code, Article 23, and the Public Sanitation and Health Code aimed at buildings equipped with a centrally managed HVAC system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1420326X11419360">28</xref>].

According to the Public Sanitation and Health Code, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in a building must be less than 1000 ppm.

Indoor CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations greater than 1000 ppm are generally regarded as indicative of ventilation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1420326X11419360">30</xref>]; the control of CO<sub>2</sub> is the same as controlling ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1420326X11419360">31</xref>].

When only the range hood was used, the level of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration decreased slightly compared to the levels with no ventilation. When natural ventilation was used, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration decreased rapidly. This revealed that natural ventilation could rapidly improve IAQ by reducing CO<sub>2</sub> concentration than did mechanical ventilation in the kitchens of apartments.

<p>When preparing dinner, the cases of B, D, G, and J in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11419360">Figure 2</xref> were naturally and mechanically ventilated even though both systems were not used at the same time. The rest of the cases, A, C, E, F, H, and I, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11419360">Figure 3</xref>, used only mechanical ventilation. When utilizing natural ventilation, CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were rapidly reduced. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11419360">Figure 3</xref> shows that CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations did not decrease drastically when using range hoods. Unlike the other cases, case H showed considerable change after ventilation was activated. The CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were reduced considerably due to the fact that only one burner of the gas range was used and that the range hood was turned on. In case A, even though the range hood had been on for more than 30 min, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration gradually increased, indicating that the mechanical ventilator was not working properly. These results show that both range hood use and natural ventilation had improved IAQ, although natural ventilation was more effective. In addition, continuous maintenance of mechanical ventilators would be required to assure proper performance.

<sec id="sec14-1420326X11419360"><title>Ventilation Behaviour Survey</title>
<p>As presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X11419360">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1420326X11419360">4</xref>, half of the respondents performed overall ventilation for less than 20 min a day. The revised standard of architectural facility according to the Ministry of Land, Transport, and Maritime Affairs in South Korea states that apartments require an average of at least 0.7 ventilation occurrences per hour. The frequency varies depending on the environmental and situational characteristics, but the National Institute of Environmental Research recommends ventilating more than four times a day for optimal IAQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1420326X11419360">33</xref>]. It is also generally taken for granted that the required ventilation can be achieved by ventilating was with open windows two or three times a day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1420326X11419360">34</xref>]. Therefore, based on the frequency of ventilation observed from the results of the survey, it would be difficult to achieve a healthy indoor air environment.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1420326X11419360">Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1420326X11419360">7</xref> show that the residents in the survey did not actively utilize natural or mechanical ventilation. Previous research has indicated that the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration could be increased during cooking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1420326X11419360">35</xref>]. The CO<sub>2</sub> concentration surpassed the tolerance limit in cases where the gas range was used for more than 5 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1420326X11419360">36</xref>]. In this study, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was greater than 1000 ppm after using a gas range for 10 min. The indoor air pollution decreased when range hoods were operated during the use of a gas range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1420326X11419360">37</xref>]. Considering the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, mechanical and natural ventilation should be utilized together to improve ventilation behaviours.</p>
<p>The surveyed groups that lived in larger houses used the gas range more often and showed a higher level of satisfaction with kitchen air quality than did the other groups. Previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11419360">3</xref>] has stated that people who live in houses with smaller kitchens tend to be influenced by the contaminants resulting from stovetop cooking. Consequently, the smaller area may reduce the satisfaction level with IAQ due to increased pollution level.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important to frequently utilize both natural and mechanical ventilation in order to improve IAQ in small kitchens. In this paper, it was demonstrated that IAQ was influenced not only by house size, but also by resident ventilation behaviours. The results show that residents living in a larger house use range hoods more often and ventilate more actively.</p>
<p>Analysed according to resident age, the oldest group tended to ventilate with more frequency but was still not satisfied with the IAQ. This infers that the elderly are more concerned about their health than are younger people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1420326X11419360">38</xref>]. On the other hand, the group in their 30 s did not ventilate often, even though they were not satisfied with the IAQ. Participants in their 30 s showed high consideration and interest for IAQ, but they find it difficult to ventilate frequently because of their busy schedules with work and child rearing.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec15-1420326X11419360"><title>Measurement of Kitchen CO<sub>2</sub> Concentration</title>
<p>In this field study, none of the 10 households utilized ventilation from the beginning of cooking, and only 4 households used both natural and mechanical ventilation. The range hood use time was shorter than that for the gas range in every household except two.</p>
<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations increased continuously during mechanical ventilation, although the rate was slower. This implies that regular maintenance is not performed on these appliances. Therefore, it is important to maintain and check mechanical ventilators to assure adequate IAQ. In addition, the variation in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration was less in the household in which an induction stove was used. Using appliances that emit lower levels of contaminants is recommended to improve the air quality.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11419360">Figure 2</xref>, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration decreased more rapidly when natural ventilation was used than it did when a range hood was operated. This result implies that natural ventilation is more effective than is range hood use. As a matter of fact, natural ventilation does not require energy consumption; so, it is very useful for energy saving. For more efficient natural ventilation, orientation and accurate opening areas should be provided in the early stage of building [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1420326X11419360">39</xref>]. However, Tian et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11419360">3</xref>] showed that mechanical ventilation is more efficient in reducing indoor pollutants and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over time. Geelen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11419360">13</xref>] recommended upgrading ventilation facilities to ultimately achieve better IAQ.</p>
<p>The reasons why this study shows results that are different from those of a previous study are as follows: first, it was demonstrated that high performance of mechanical ventilation would increase ventilation efficiency. Second, polluted outdoor air quality was shown to decrease the efficiency of natural ventilation. Natural ventilation was found to be insufficient in China because CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of eight Chinese cities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11419360">3</xref>] were greater than the 392.5 ppm found in Seoul [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1420326X11419360">40</xref>]. Because outdoor-generated pollutants are major contributors to indoor pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1420326X11419360">41</xref>], the ventilation type for indoor air should be chosen considering the outdoor air quality.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec16-1420326X11419360"><title>Methods to Improve Ventilation Behaviours</title>
<p>Several methods to improve ventilation behaviour for indoor air comfort are suggested. First, residents should increase the frequency of ventilation and should assure proper ventilation usage. Because residents do not recognize the significance of ventilation or seriously consider IAQ, it is necessary to inform them of the necessity of ventilation. To encourage ventilation, apartment guides should provide information on proper ventilation, and training programs on ventilation should be prepared for apartment residents. More attention should be aimed at residents in smaller apartments because the levels of pollution tend to be higher in smaller spaces. Apartment managers may also use websites and home automation systems to provide periodic information.</p>
<p>Second, better ventilation maintenance systems should be enforced. Mechanical ventilation systems should be maintained by the manager of an apartment building through regularly scheduled tests. These managers need to make sure that their facilities are upgraded and organized. According to our research, ventilation is ineffective if the ventilation device is not well maintained or if the performance is very limited. The organization and assignment of these updated systems will facilitate a sustainably maintained ventilation system.</p>
<p>Third, a CO<sub>2</sub> warning device or an automated mechanical system should be installed in kitchens to alert people when the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration exceeds the tolerance limit. Geelen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11419360">13</xref>] proposed the use of colour to indicate the concentration level. Because residents cannot easily detect indoor air pollution, warning devices will enable residents to modify ventilation behaviours to improve IAQ.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec17-1420326X11419360" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This research surveyed resident behaviour towards kitchen ventilation and measured the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in 10 households of apartment houses in South Korea. The purpose was to investigate the present condition of kitchen IAQ management in South Korean apartment houses. The residents in these apartment houses did not actively or properly ventilate their kitchens to manage indoor-generated CO<sub>2</sub> and achieve adequate air quality. The failure to maintain ventilation devices resulted in lower satisfaction with device performance. Natural ventilation was shown to be more effective in Seoul than was mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p>A variety of sensors mounted onto ventilation systems need to be installed to improve the ventilation behaviours of residents. Residents also need to be educated and informed on proper use of ventilation and its importance in IAQ. Also, it is necessary to actively maintain and test such ventilation systems.</p>
<p>This housing study provided significant information on the behavioural aspects of residents with regard to IAQ. One of the motivations behind this research was related to the difficulty in obtaining meaningful behavioural data based on previous experimental research. In the future, a behaviour survey and observations should be conducted as a follow-up study including a larger geographic region.</p></sec>
