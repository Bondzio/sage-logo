<body>
<p>My professional career started in a regional hospital in south-eastern Ethiopia where no nurse had set foot before. I had to take a bus part of the way and a truck to reach the town as the roads were impassable in rainy season. The hospital had two expatriate doctors and several health assistants. Part of my duty included supervision of the health assistants. The hospital had never admitted inpatients, and it was functioning as an outpatient facility. The beds and the surgical equipment were locked in the store room. With my recruitment, the hospital was expected to admit patients and perform minor surgery as one of the doctors was a surgeon. We set up a medical and a surgical ward and an operating theatre, which was a testing experience for a newly graduated nurse. In this uncharted territory, it is inevitable that ethical challenges and dilemmas would arise.</p>
<p>My first dilemma occurred when I was asked to assist in medical assessment of prisoners for ‘fitness for flogging’ or corporal punishment – a court order that must be complied with. The perplexing questions for me were as follows: should a doctor certify a patient ‘fit for flogging’? Can a nurse assist in such a procedure aimed at causing pain and suffering? Can medical assessment humanise the inhuman and cruel act of torture? I had a feeling of ethical distress that I was involved – albeit in an assistive role – in a procedure intended to cause pain and suffering to people, contrary to the ethical tenets of nursing, which affirm alleviation of suffering as a primary nursing responsibility.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012440215">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>My second ethical dilemma in those early days was related to what we now call ‘task-shifting’ – in which tasks normally performed by a physician are delegated, or shifted, to nurses and those performed by nurses to less qualified health-care assistants.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012440215">2</xref>
</sup> In principle, task shifting improves access to care and is desirable. Yet my training did not prepare me for diagnostic and prescriptive tasks. But in the absence of physicians, I had often to function beyond my scope of practice, particularly during night and evening calls. While ‘delegation’ has been a historical part of nursing practice, the tasks were not delegated to me based on my competence but by default because of lack of physicians. To make matters worse, my education in nursing ethics was limited and lacking in decision making.</p>
<p>I realise now that while nurses in other parts of the world were facing complex challenges related to life and death issues such as euthanasia and end-of-life decisions, my ethical distress was related to everyday issues, including whistle-blowing, scope of practice, staffing levels and access to care, that could have been addressed with proper training in ethics and ethical decision making.</p>
<p>I could easily trace my interest in nursing ethics back to those early days when I faced ethical dilemmas with no support or reference materials. Several years later when I had the privilege to lead the ethics portfolio at the International Council of Nurses (ICN), the nurse in the front line is always on my mind. That is why during my visits to health facilities, I often ask nurses about the ethical challenges they face in their day-to-day practice. I often ponder whether we are providing nurses with adequate training in nursing ethics and with tools and frameworks to help them make ethical decisions.</p>
<p>At ICN, we often get questions from nurses and national nurses’ associations on ethical issues including:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Should nurses refuse to care for patients during epidemics of infectious diseases such as H1N1 (swine influenza), particularly when protective equipment is lacking?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Can a male nursing student be exempted from providing perineal care for religious reasons?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>What do we do if a nurse refuses to administer a blood transfusion to a bleeding patient because of religious beliefs?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Is whistle-blowing an ethical behaviour?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Is violation of infection control practice unethical?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Should patient confidentiality always be safeguarded, or is it a matter of discretion?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Is strike action by nurses ethical?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Is it ethical for developed countries to recruit nurses from developing countries, who have themselves shortages of human resources?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In order to resolve ethical dilemmas, nurses need direction on ethical decision making. That is why some 60 years ago, ICN developed a code of ethics for nurses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012440215">1</xref>
</sup> That is why over 30 years ago, ICN published <italic>The Nurse’s Dilemmas: Ethical Considerations in Nursing Practice.</italic> And that is why ICN published <italic>Ethics in Nursing Practice: A Guide to Ethical Decision Making.</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012440215">3</xref>
</sup> The ethical analysis and decision-making framework outlined in the ICN textbook together with ethical vignettes from around the world provide nurses with direction in dealing with the daily challenges of care.</p>
<p>In today’s health-care landscape, characterised by nursing shortages and economic crises, the demand on nurses to provide competent and compassionate care is causing moral distress as they find they are unable to meet their own or others’ expectations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012440215">4</xref>
</sup> As nurses, we dare to care for all people, all the time and in all settings. Inevitably, we experience ethical distress when we have less and less resources and time for our patients such as when we have 30 patients in a 20-bed unit and when we keep our patients waiting longer and longer before they can access care and treatment.</p>
<p>A situation I suspect you may have encountered often, as I have, is the nagging feeling of moral distress; that negative feeling we experience when faced with problematic ethical and human rights issues. This ‘dual loyalty complex’ (DLC) might arise from competing loyalties between the interests of patients and employers and can occur either willingly or under pressure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012440215">5</xref>
</sup> For example, nurses working in prison services have a primary responsibility of providing health care for prisoners; however, prison authorities may coerce the nurse to assume the role of a prison guard.</p>
<p>Luckily, we have resources such as the<italic> ICN Code of Ethics for Nurses </italic>that provides a clear resolution of dual loyalty by affirming that ‘The nurse’s primary professional responsibility is to people requiring nursing care’ (p. 1).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012440215">1</xref>
</sup> Also, the ICN policy statement <italic>Nurses’ Role in the Care of Prisoners and Detainees</italic> makes it clear that ‘nurses employed in prison health services do not assume functions of prison security personnel, such as body searches conducted for the purpose of prison security’ (ICN, revised 2005).</p>
<p>In visioning the future of nursing and health care, issues such as mapping the human genome, cloning, euthanasia, rationing, access and equity and others will continue to be sources of persistent ethical dilemmas. These issues will continue to complicate nursing responsibilities in health promotion, disease prevention, care, treatment and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>The challenge for ICN, its member national nurses' associations, the International Centre for Nursing Ethics, nurse ethicists and others is to continue to provide direction and leadership in ethical decision making and ethical action. In this way, we can ensure that nursing is grounded in ethical principles compatible with human dignity, quality of life and patient safety.</p>
<p>A magician once proudly said, ‘I can rearrange the stars in the sky, because I have the statistics’. Nurses are not magicians, and we do not have magic wands, but we have the knowledge, versatility and the skills to lead in an ethical direction. We have the numbers – over 13 million of us – to provide ethical voice and ethical policies to transform health systems for the benefit of our populations.</p>

<title>Note from the Editor</title>
<p>Tesfamicael Ghebrehiwet retires from ICN and from the Editorial Board of <italic>Nursing Ethics</italic> in 2012. He has been a passionate advocate and an exemplary role model for ethical health-care practice in a global context. Tesfa demonstrates dignity and integrity as he creates opportunities for dialogue among colleagues from diverse global communities. He will be greatly missed by all of us who work within the nursing ethics community. We wish Tesfa health and happiness in his retirement and look forward to welcoming and working with his successor at ICN.</p></ack>
