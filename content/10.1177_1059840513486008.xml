<abstract>
<p>Seasonal influenza is recognized as a significant health burden to children and is a cause of excess school absenteeism in children. In 2008, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended annual influenza vaccination for all children 6 months to 18 years of age. School nurses influence participation in this recommendation by conducting school-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) programs at their campuses. Knowing the effect of SLIV programs on student absenteeism may motivate school nurses and district administrators to conduct such vaccination programs. This study examines the impact of an SLIV program on elementary school absenteeism in an inner city school district with a predominantly Hispanic population. Using Poisson regression models with robust standard errors, we analyzed data from 3,775 records obtained by stratified random sampling. Results of the study indicate that students vaccinated through an SLIV program have fewer absences than unvaccinated students. A surprising result of the study shows that students vaccinated through an SLIV program had fewer absences than students vaccinated elsewhere. These results are of particular importance to school nurses who work with large Hispanic populations. Our study illustrates one way that a school nurse can assess the effect of an SLIV program on absenteeism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Every year, influenza outbreaks occur across the country. During the first week (December 30 to January 5) of the current 2012–2013 influenza season, 47 states reported widespread geographic influenza activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840513486008">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2013a</xref>). The duration of influenza activity is protracted and coincides with the second semester of the school year. During the past 10 influenza seasons, influenza-like illness (ILI) remained at or above the baseline for an average of 12 consecutive weeks, with a range of 1 week to 16 weeks. During the pandemic, the proportion of visits to physicians for ILI was above the national baseline for a period of 19 consecutive weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840513486008">CDC, 2013b</xref>). Such protracted periods of influenza activity often disrupt school activities and sometimes result in short-term school closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059840513486008">Principi, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>School-aged children are disproportionately affected by influenza and play an important role in the transmission of the illness. They are particularly susceptible to influenza, with annual influenza attack rates ranging from 20% to 50% during interpandemic years and up to 70% in pandemic years. In contrast, the attack rate is only 10% to 30% in adults (Neuzil, 2006). Children are also more likely than adults to be severely affected by the illness. During the first week of the 2012–2013 influenza season, 20 pediatric deaths occurred (Centers for Disease Control Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality). In addition, children play significant roles as vectors, transmitting the illness to other classmates, teachers, and family members. Infected children shed influenza virus for a longer period of time and in greater quantities than adults. They act as amplifiers of influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840513486008">Davis, King, Moag, Cummings, &amp; Magder, 2008</xref>). During outbreaks, there is a sharp increase in school absenteeism. In fact, increase in student absenteeism has been cited as an early indicator for influenza outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840513486008">King et al., 2005</xref>). Influenza-related school absenteeism has academic and economic repercussions. Children miss important academic time in school and their parents miss work to care for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840513486008">King et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The increasing recognition of the severity of influenza in children spurred action to broaden influenza vaccination recommendations. In February 2008, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that all children aged 6 months to 18 years be immunized every year against influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840513486008">CDC, 2008</xref>). Many federal and professional organizations, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the American Academy of Pediatrics, supported this recommendation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840513486008">Hull &amp; Ambrose, 2011</xref>). The 2008 ACIP recommendation of universal vaccination contrasted with earlier recommendations, which targeted narrower age ranges and children with specific health conditions.</p>
<p>The recommendation greatly expanded the number of school-aged children needing annual influenza vaccination and challenged the traditional model of vaccine delivery in medical settings. The CDC recognized the importance of developing and implementing sustainable strategies in nonmedical locations. Schools were identified as prime locations for vaccinations. A school-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) program “provides an opportunity to address the challenges associated with large numbers of children to vaccinate, a short window of time for vaccination, and the need for annual revaccination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840513486008">CDC, 2010</xref>). The SLIV programs may have the added benefit of protecting unvaccinated students by reducing their exposure to the influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840513486008">Hull &amp; Ambrose, 2011</xref>). Although the number of SLIV programs has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840513486008">Ambrose &amp; Sifakis, 2011</xref>), they have not been widely adopted yet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840513486008">Hull &amp; Ambrose, 2011</xref>). Challenges identified include program costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840513486008">CDC, 2010</xref>) and reluctance of educators to support immunization programs in their schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840513486008">Hull &amp; Ambrose, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>School nurses and educators may be motivated to establish and embrace SLIV programs by understanding the effect of SLIV programs on school absenteeism. A literature review summarizing the impact of SLIV programs on school absenteeism supported the conclusion that SLIV programs can reduce student absenteeism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840513486008">Hull &amp; Ambrose, 2011</xref>). In one study, all-cause absence rate was significantly lower for vaccinated students compared with unvaccinated students in the same school. There was a 34%–56% relative reduction in absences for vaccinated students versus unvaccinated students during various periods of influenza activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840513486008">King et al., 2006</xref>). In many states, school funding is dependent on average daily attendance. SLIV programs can decrease the impact of influenza absences on school funding.</p>
<p>The purpose of our study is to expand the knowledge base regarding the impact of SLIV programs on school absenteeism. We provide an impact analysis of an SLIV program on elementary school absenteeism in an inner city school district with a predominantly Hispanic population. Our study is unique in that it focuses on a school population that is 95.6% Hispanic. Prior studies on the effect of SLIV programs on school absenteeism focused on populations, with Hispanic populations ranging from 1.2% to 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840513486008">Graitcer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059840513486008">Wiggs-Stayner et al., 2006</xref>). Because we had records for students vaccinated elsewhere in the community, we were able to compare student absenteeism for students vaccinated through the SLIV program versus students vaccinated elsewhere. To our knowledge, such a comparison has not been previously undertaken. The SLIV program, which we studied, offered both forms of the vaccine, live-attenuated intranasal vaccine (LAIV) and trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV). This allowed us the additional opportunity to investigate whether we could detect a difference in absenteeism rates based on the type of vaccine. All 20 elementary schools in the school district participated in the program, achieving immunization coverage rates of 13% to 42%. We used these varying immunization coverage rates to the study of the indirect impact of vaccination (herd immunity) on absenteeism.</p>
<p>We address several research questions simultaneously: (1) Is school absenteeism significantly lower for students vaccinated through SLIV programs versus unvaccinated students? (2) Is school absenteeism significantly lower for students vaccinated through SLIV programs versus students vaccinated elsewhere in the community? (3) Is there a significant difference in the number of absences for students who received LAIV than for those who received TIV via injection? And, (4) given the vaccination rates achieved, is there an indication of an indirect impact (herd immunity) of the SLIV program on the absence rates of unvaccinated students?</p>

<title>Research Design and Target Population</title>
<p>Our study employs a quantitative research approach known as <italic>existing statistics analysis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840513486008">Kendall, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059840513486008">Neuman, 2011</xref>) in which we sampled existing individual-level data in the form of school attendance and influenza vaccination records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840513486008">Davis, et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059840513486008">Peterson et al., 2012</xref>) from a target population of 14,278 students in all 20 LISD elementary schools for school year (SY) 2011–2012. Attendance records were from LISD’s databases, while vaccination records were from two sources: LISD and the City of Laredo Health Department.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1059840513486008">
<title>Human Subjects’ Approval Statement</title>
<p>Prior to any form of research activities, we applied for and obtained permission from LISD’s Board of Trustees, and the institutional review board (IRB) at Texas A&amp;M International University (TAMIU). Approvals from LISD’s Board of Trustees and from TAMIU’s IRB were obtained on March 27, 2012, and on April 24, 2012, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1059840513486008">
<title>Study Location</title>
<p>The SLIV program we examined has been implemented by the LISD’s coalition program “The Flu Ends With You” since 2009. The program is aimed at improving the vaccination coverage rates for students and staff in a predominantly Hispanic (95.6%), economically disadvantaged (97.2% of the school children receive free or reduced-price lunch, 29.2% of the population is below poverty line, and median household income is $37,245), and medically underserved border community: Laredo, Texas, is designated a Health Professions Shortage Area and Medically Underserved Area (U.S. Census Bureau [USCB], 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059840513486008">Ynalvez, Ynalvez, Torregosa, Palacios, &amp; Kilburn, 2012</xref>). More than a third (35%) of its population is below 18 years of age, while less than a fifth (17.3%) of individuals 25 years and over has completed a college degree or higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059840513486008">USCB, 2012</xref>). Indeed, Laredo’s geographical location and its population’s socioeconomic situation make it a community particularly challenging to vaccine delivery initiatives and vulnerable to seasonal and pandemic influenza.</p>
<p>The LISD’s geographical area is densely populated, and its campuses are mostly located in urban centers. LISD serves an average of 25,000 students in a 13-square mile area and is proximate to the international border. In fact, a segment of its boundary is the Rio Grande river, the border between the United States and Mexico. The SY 2011–2012 marked the third year of LISD’s SLIV program. Last year, the school program achieved a 22% vaccination rate of the entire student population (an increase of 2% over SY 2010–2011). Because LISD is located in a city with a large number of people passing through the border from both sides daily, the coalition’s “The Flu Ends With You” program simultaneously prepares its schools to serve as centers for mass prophylaxis in case of future public health emergencies similar to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic that was retrospectively traced to Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059840513486008">Pourabbasi, Shirvani, &amp; Khashayar, 2012</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1059840513486008">
<title>Sampling Strategy</title>
<p>Data for this study were from an initial random sample of <italic>n</italic> = 4,200 student records. We obtained this from a sampling frame made available by LISD’s Information and Technology Office. This list contained the following information about the students: (1) school name, (2) first and last names, (3) identification number, (4) grade level, (5) gender, (6) birth date, (7) influenza vaccination status, and (8) influenza vaccination date. To protect anonymity of the students, the IRB made provisions for secure storage, confidential, and coded responses. No individual data are presented or published. Code numbers were assigned after sampling was completed. Our sampling strategy involved stratifying LISD’s elementary student population by the following variables: school, gender, and receipt of a vaccine from the SLIV program.</p>
<p>The combination of these three variables resulted to 80 (20 × 2 × 2) strata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840513486008">Cochran, 1979</xref>). In each stratum, we obtained a sample using simple random sampling without replacement with probability proportional to stratum size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840513486008">Cochran, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059840513486008">Yamane, 1967</xref>). For this, we used the PROC SURVEYSELECT facility of the statistical software Statistical Analysis System 9.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059840513486008">SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina</xref>). After data validation, we were able to identify 417 records associated with students who had already withdrawn from school and 8 records that contained missing data. These records, 425 in all, were excluded from our statistical analyses and modeling. Hence, our analyses and modeling were based on an effective sample size of <italic>n</italic>
<sub>e</sub> = 3,775 records.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1059840513486008">
<title>Outcome Measures</title>
<p>In this study, we used three count variables to measure school absenteeism: <italic>week before</italic> (absences 1 week immediately before peak week; this is the week of February 6–10, 2012), <italic>peak week</italic> (absences during peak week; this is the week of February 13–17, 2012), and <italic>week after</italic> (absences 1 week immediately after peak week; this is the week of February 20–24, 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840513486008">Field, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840513486008">Field &amp; Miles, 2010</xref>). These three variables served as our outcome measures, and they denote the numbers of all-cause absences during three selected high-risk weeks in SY 2011–2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840513486008">Davis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059840513486008">King et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840513486008">2006</xref>). As much as we wanted to use data on absences due to influenza-like illnesses as other studies such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059840513486008">King et al. (2006</xref>) did, we were unable to do so because of the unavailability of this information in our databases. Cognizant of this weakness in our measures of absenteeism, we mitigate this by incorporating measures of absences during two randomly selected influenza-free weeks (before and after the start of the school program) as multivariate controls in our regression models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840513486008">Field &amp; Miles, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059840513486008">Ludwig et al., 2012</xref>). Determination of peak week for the 2011–2012 seasonal influenza was made by the City of Laredo Health Department.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1059840513486008">
<title>Main Predictors</title>
<p>Because we wanted to know whether receipt of a vaccine from the school program predicted absenteeism, we included <italic>vaccination status</italic> as a main predictor. <italic>Vaccination status</italic> has the categories: unvaccinated, vaccinated elsewhere, and vaccinated through the school program. For students vaccinated through the school program, we further categorize them as those vaccinated: with unknown type, with TIV, and with LAIV.</p>
<p>LAIV refers to the Flumist (influenza Vaccine Live, Intranasal) vaccine. It is “indicated for active immunization of individuals 2–49 years of age against influenza disease caused by the influenza virus subtypes A and type B contained in the vaccine” (E. Carver, personal communication, January 25, 2012). Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine refers to the Fluzone vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur; influenza virus vaccine) suspension for intramuscular injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059840513486008">Sanofi Pasteur, May 09, 2012</xref>, v0.11).</p>
<p>For some reason, there were vaccination records that did not indicate the route of vaccine administration (intranasal or intramuscular). Our earnest efforts to obtain these pieces of information proved unsuccessful. Those vaccinated with unknown type (<italic>N</italic> = 116) consisted of students vaccinated through the school program for which we could not determine the type of vaccine received, whether it was through an intramuscular injection or through an intranasal spray. And because <italic>vaccination status</italic> is a nominal-level variable, we created four dummy variables with the category vaccinated with LAIV as reference category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840513486008">Field, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In their 2008 article, Davis et al. used number of absences during the influenza-free weeks as a baseline to estimate changes in levels during the influenza weeks. Their work inspired us to include number of absences during two randomly selected low-risk weeks—Baseline 1 and Baseline 2—as additional main predictors in our statistical models. In this study, Baselines 1 and 2 refer to the number of absences in a selected week before (October 3–7, 2011) and after (April 16–20, 2012) the conduct of the school program, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1059840513486008">
<title>Multivariate Control Variables</title>
<p>Besides our outcome measures and main predictors, we included other variables in our statistical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840513486008">Cooper-Robbins, Ward, &amp; Skinner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059840513486008">Longini, Halloran, &amp; Nizam, 2000</xref>). Incorporating multiple control variables—in contrast to bivariate analyses—simultaneously increases the precision in estimating the strength of association between main predictors (vaccination status, Baseline 1, and Baseline 2) and outcome measures (week before, peak week, and week after; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059840513486008">Longini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059840513486008">Lenhart &amp; Horrigan, 2003</xref>). And, including Baseline 1 and Baseline 2 increases the precision in estimating significant differences among the types of vaccines received.</p>
<p>Our control variables are the following: school and students’ age and gender. We are not implying that these statistical controls are exhaustive; however, these are the only pieces of information we could use, given that our data were obtained from what were available from records. Because school and gender are both nominal-level variables, we created a set of dummy variables for use in our statistical modeling. For the variable school, we created 19 dummy variables with School 20 as the reference category. For the variable gender, we had one dummy variable with female as the reference category.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1059840513486008">
<title>Analytical Strategy</title>
<p>In analyzing our data, we used statistical techniques in the form of descriptive statistics (eg, means, percentages, standard deviations, and maximum and minimum values) and generalized linear models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840513486008">Coxe, West, &amp; Aiken, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840513486008">Field, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840513486008">Hilbe, 2007</xref>). Because our outcome measures yield count data, have limited range (i.e., 0–5), and are all positively skewed, the usual normal error regression model is inappropriate and unreliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840513486008">Coxe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840513486008">Hilbe, 2007</xref>). The normal error regression model is also known as the ordinary least squares regression approach, which assumes that the outcome variable has a bell-shaped distribution and has values that range from negative infinity to positive infinity. This is clearly not the case for our outcome measures.</p>
<p>A positively skewed distribution is one with many cases that are near or at zero and few cases possessing large values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840513486008">Coxe et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, we used a family of exponential models in the form of <italic>Poisson regression models</italic> (PRMs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840513486008">Coxe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840513486008">Hilbe, 2007</xref>). However, because diagnostic tests (i.e., Lagranian Multiplier tests) indicated that the positively skewed distributions of the three outcome variables were each significantly <italic>overdispersed</italic>, we used a variant of the PRM that employed robust standard errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840513486008">Hilbe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059840513486008">Long, 1997</xref>). For our analyses, we used the generalized linear models procedure (PROC GENMOD) of the statistical software Statistical Analysis System version 9.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059840513486008">SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Our random sample is 26.4% (3,775/14,278) of LISD’s elementary student population for SY 2011–2012. In terms of gender, our sample consisted of 1,833 (48.56%) females and 1,942 (51.44%) males (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840513486008">Table 1</xref>). And, in terms of grade level, 1 was in early education, 211 in pre-kindergarten (3 years old), 394 in pre-kindergarten (4 years old), 514 in kindergarten, 614 students were first graders, 551 second graders, 485 third graders, 547 fourth graders, and 458 fifth graders.

<p>With regard to vaccination status, 2,337 (61.94%) students were unvaccinated. In all, 952 (or 25.18%) were vaccinated in school, of which 708 (or 18.72%) received the LAIV, 128 (3.39%) the TIV, and 116 (3.07%) vaccine type unknown (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840513486008">Table 1</xref>). The SLIV immunization rate of 25.18% is lower than those (35%–86%) given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840513486008">Hull and Ambrose (2011</xref>, p.36). Clearly, only a minority (38.06%) of the students were vaccinated either in school (25.18%) or elsewhere (12.88%).</p>
<p>In regard to absenteeism (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840513486008">Table 2</xref>), the mean number of absences during Baseline 1 was at 0.10 (95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.09, 0.11]) days; at week before, it was at 0.17 (95% CI: [0.15, 0.18]) days; at peak week, at 0.13 (95% CI: [0.12, 0.14]) days; at week after, it was at 0.19 (95% CI: [0.17, 0.20]) days; and during Baseline 2, it was at 0.15 (95% CI: [0.13, 0.16]) days. Clearly, in the case of this student population, the highest occurrence of absences was not at peak week for the city. Instead, it occurred a week after peak week, with the second highest occurrence during the week before peak week. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059840513486008">Table 3</xref> presents the percentage of students with no absences by vaccination status.

<p>With regard to our control variables, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059840513486008">Table 4</xref> indicates that number of absences during Baselines 1 and 2 are both statistically significant and strong positive predictors of school absenteeism. This is true for all three measures of absenteeism that we used. With respect to gender, there is no significant difference between boys and girls in terms of the number of absences during the week before peak week, peak week, and the week after peak week. In other words, sex is not an influential factor in shaping absenteeism among the students we investigated. Furthermore, although there is a significant negative relationship between age and number of absences during the week after peak week, there is no significant relationship during the week before peak week and the peak week itself.</p>
<p>In regard to the association between vaccination status and number of absences per 5-day school week, our results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059840513486008">Table 4</xref> reveal the following: (1) relative to students vaccinated in school, unvaccinated students had significantly higher number of absences per 5-day school week. This is true for all three selected high-risk weeks (week before: <italic>B</italic> = +0.32, %▵ = +37.03.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; peak week: <italic>B</italic> = +0.43, %▵ = +54.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; and week after: <italic>B</italic> = +0.46, %▵ = +58.61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Put another way, unvaccinated students had ∼37%, ∼54%, and ∼59% more absences than school-vaccinated students during the week before, peak week, and the week after, respectively. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059840513486008">Table 4</xref> also shows that students vaccinated elsewhere in the community had more absences than students vaccinated in school, but this difference is significant only during the week after (<italic>B</italic> = +0.45, %▵ = +56.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) but not during the week before (<italic>B</italic> = +0.30, %▵ = +35.61, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) or peak week itself (<italic>B</italic> = +0.35, %▵ = +41.91, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1059840513486008">Table 5</xref>, we present Poisson regression results similar to those shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059840513486008">Table 4</xref>. However, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1059840513486008">Table 5</xref>, we disaggregated “<italic>vaccinated in school</italic>” by type of vaccine: vaccine type unknown, TIV, and LAIV. This enabled us to estimate the number of absences per 5-day school week associated with TIV relative to LAIV. Our results indicated no significant difference in the number of absences between students who received TIV and those who received LAIV across all three selected high-risk weeks (week before: <italic>B</italic> = −0.60, %▵ = −45.15, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05; peak week: <italic>B</italic> = −0.27, %▵ = −23.49, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05; week after: <italic>B</italic> = +0.22, %▵ = +24.66, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>

<p>Again, in order to increase the precision of our regression results, we included the following variables as statistical controls in our PRMs for <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1059840513486008">Table 6</xref>: age, gender, and number of absences during Baselines 1 and 2. We used the same set of outcome variables as those used in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059840513486008">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1059840513486008">5</xref>. From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1059840513486008">Table 6</xref>, it is clear that the proportion of the school population vaccinated through the SLIV program has no significant association with the number of absences during each of the three high-risk weeks. Nonsignificant results are also observed for age and gender. However, we note that both of our baseline measures are highly significant and positive predictors of number of absences. More specifically, holding all other variables constant, an additional day of absence at Baseline 1 is significantly associated with 49.44%, 40.65%, and 34.31% increase in the number of absences during the week before peak week, during peak week, and during the week after peak week, respectively. Likewise, an additional day of absence at Baseline 2 is significantly associated with a 54.88%, 55.63%, and 56.05% increase in the number of absences during the week before peak week, during peak week, and during the week after peak weak, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our school-based vaccination program reached 25.18% of the population. An additional 12.88% were vaccinated elsewhere in the community. Clearly, a large majority of the student population was unvaccinated. This nonvaccination rate is significantly higher than those of the state of Texas and of the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840513486008">CDC, 2012</xref>). There are myriad possible reasons for this low participation rate such as parents’ fear, lack of knowledge, misconceptions, or negative attitudes about vaccination; children’s fear and negative attitudes toward vaccination; or schools’ inadequate logistic and poor recruitment strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059840513486008">Peterson et al., 2012</xref>). It is also possible that this low participation rate in preventive health care—in this case, vaccination participation—may be explained by a strong “<italic>present-time</italic>” orientation that might be more pronounced and prevalent among Hispanics in this area than those in other locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840513486008">Edelman &amp; Mandle, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840513486008">Giger &amp; Davidhizar, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Indeed, it is important to gain understanding why this is so and to formulate ways to increase vaccination coverage rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059840513486008">Schieber, Kennedy, &amp; Kahn, 2012</xref>). The recent literature suggests several ways to increase participation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840513486008">Ambrose &amp; Sifakis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840513486008">Cawley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059840513486008">Williams et al., 2012</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840513486008">Cawley et al. (2010</xref>) recommended the following strategies: giving incentives to students, educating students and parents, designing parental consent forms to maximize positive returns, and offering both intranasal spray (LAIV) and intramuscular injection (TIV). In LISD’s SLIV program, both types were available. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059840513486008">Williams et al. (2012</xref>) introduced a strategy that focuses on the role of stakeholders and the importance of stakeholder feedback in making SLIV programs successful and efficient. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840513486008">Ambrose and Sifakis (2011)</xref> suggested conducting SLIV programs during school hours, with parental consent forms sent out in advance.</p>
<p>LISD’s SLIV program implemented most of these suggestions mentioned in the extant literature. However, some of the strategies suggested may need recalibration to match local conditions, constraints, and limitations confronting and options available to LISD’s staff, students, and their parents and guardians. These considerations may include cultural and social dimensions such as how do parents, guardians, and children view vaccination? What does receiving a vaccine mean to these individuals? For example, the experience of one of the authors growing up in a developing country reveals that the concept was received with misgivings and that a child being vaccinated was viewed by older people as “being a weakling” or as someone “having a weak natural immune system.” Whether real or imagined, this perception put vaccinated children in that country in a position of being the object of teasing and ridicule.</p>
<p>Our results also reveal that not all vaccinated students received their vaccine through the school program (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059840513486008">Table 1</xref>). In our sample, 468 (12.88%) students were vaccinated elsewhere in the community. Although we do not have data on the exact places these vaccines were received, the literature states those typical alternative locations would be the local health department, family physician’s clinics, or local pharmacies (e.g., CVS, HEB, Walgreen, or Walmart). In the case of a U.S. southern border city such as Laredo, these locations may also include clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies across the border. These facilities may well be in the city of Nuevo Laredo or other locations in Mexico.</p>
<p>In the extant literature, reasons for accessing medical services across the border include the following: (1) short waiting time in clinics, (2) lower vaccination costs, (3) absence of language barrier between parents/guardians and medical service personnel, and (4) perception that medical service personnel in Mexico are more accommodating, caring, and understanding than their U.S. counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059840513486008">Leon, 2012</xref>). However, these reasons come from a sample of the general Laredo population and may need to be verified in the case of the elementary school students we investigated. Essentially, to gain better understanding of the dynamics of child vaccination in this region, we suggest that future research must focus on circumstances and factors shaping parents’ and guardians’ decisions as to where their child/children are vaccinated and the incentives, motivations, and reasons behind these decisions.</p>
<p>In regard to our measures of absenteeism (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059840513486008">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059840513486008">3</xref>), we expected to have the mean number of absences at Baseline 1 (0.10; 95% CI: [0.09, 0.11]) and at Baseline 2 (0.15; 95% CI: [0.13, 0.16]) to be significantly different from zero. This is because our measures included absences of all types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840513486008">Hull &amp; Ambrose, 2011</xref>). This means that number of absences due to influenza-like illnesses was subset of the overall number of absences. We recognize this as a weakness in our measurement scheme and mitigate this weakness by incorporating a set of multivariate statistical controls (i.e., age, gender, school) and by casting the number of absences during the two low-risk weeks (Baselines 1 and 2) as additional predictors in our Poisson regression models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059840513486008">Tables 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1059840513486008">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1059840513486008">6</xref>). As much as we wanted to utilize absenteeism measures with greater precision as other studies did (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059840513486008">Wiggs-Stayner et al., 2006</xref>, in which they had measured absenteeism using the number of absences due to influenza-like illnesses), we were constrained by the method (i.e., existing statistics analysis) available to us and by the information available in the students’ records.</p>
<p>
<italic>What predicts school absenteeism during the three selected high-risk weeks?</italic> In the introduction section, we aimed at answering four research questions: (1) Is absenteeism significantly lower for students vaccinated in school than for unvaccinated students? (2) Is absenteeism significantly lower for students vaccinated in school versus students vaccinated elsewhere in the community? (3) Is there a significant difference in the number of absences between students who received LAIV and those who received TIV? In addition, (4) given the vaccination rates achieved, is there an indication of an indirect impact (herd immunity) of the SLIV program on absence rates of unvaccinated students? Our results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059840513486008">Table 4</xref> help us answer Questions (1) and (2), <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1059840513486008">Table 5</xref> Question (3), and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1059840513486008">Table 6</xref> Question (4).</p>
<p>In response to Question (1), we find that unvaccinated students had significantly higher number of absences relative to students vaccinated in school (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059840513486008">Table 4</xref>). Our result on the effectivity of LISD’s SLIV program is consistent with the studies reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840513486008">Hull and Ambrose (2011</xref>) and more recently with that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840513486008">King et al. (2012</xref>). As such, our results add to the body of evidence, the diversity of examples, and the inventory of experiences regarding the effectiveness of SLIV programs in general and regarding the effectiveness of an SLIV program in a medically underserved urban area in the U.S. southern border region in particular.</p>
<p>As to our response to Question (2), for two measures of absenteeism (at week before and at peak week), there was no significant difference between students vaccinated elsewhere in the community and students vaccinated at school (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059840513486008">Table 4</xref>). But for the number of absences during the week after peak week, students vaccinated elsewhere had significantly more absences than students vaccinated at school. For us, this is intriguing—<italic>why would there be a significant difference between vaccines received from the school program and from those received elsewhere in the community</italic>? We do not have data to answer this question. However, we have a few interesting hypotheses to share.</p>
<p>It could be that the quality of the vaccines used by the school program is different from those used by clinics, pharmacies, or hospitals within the United States and across the border (Mexico). Although vaccines used by clinics, pharmacies, or hospitals within the United States are the same as those used by LISD’s school program, variations in the handling and the storage of vaccines by vaccination service providers may have affected or degraded their efficacy. It could also be the case that students counted as having been vaccinated elsewhere may not have actually been vaccinated. Rather, parents and/or guardians might have simply “produced” certifications through personal contacts across the border. Or, it could simply be the case that these two groups of students differ in terms of their commitment and motivation in coming to school.</p>
<p>Our answer to Question (3), based on the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1059840513486008">Table 5</xref>, there is no significant difference between TIV- and LAIV-vaccinated students. Our results do not corroborate those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840513486008">Ashkenazi et al. (2006</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840513486008">Belshe et al. (2007</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840513486008">Fleming et al. (2006</xref>) who reported significant differences in absenteeism rate between students who were vaccinated through intranasal spray (LAIV) and those vaccinated through intramuscular injection (TIV). This incongruence between these studies and our results may well be due to inherent differences in the populations and the locations studied, the research methods used, or even the analytical strategies employed.</p>
<p>Indeed, our finding seems to provide evidence in support of the claim that intranasal spray (LAIV) and intramuscular injection (TIV) have comparable outcomes in terms of all-cause absenteeism, <italic>but again this may well be due to the inability of our analytical method to detect such differences, given that our strategy—existing statistics analysis—has lesser power when compared to controlled and randomized experiments</italic>.</p>
<p>In consideration of the results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059840513486008">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1059840513486008">5</xref>, the following patterns emerge: (1) number of absences during the two random, low-risk weeks (Baselines 1 and 2) are strong positive predictors of absenteeism during the three selected high-risk weeks, (2) there is no significant difference in absenteeism between boys and girls, (3) unvaccinated students had significantly more absences than students vaccinated in school, (4) there is no significant difference in absenteeism between TIV- and LAIV-vaccinated students, and (5) that LAIV-vaccinated students have significantly lower absenteeism relative to the unvaccinated group across all three high-risk weeks.</p>
<p>With these statements comes an <italic>important caveat</italic>, because our data were obtained from a nonrandomized, noncontrolled existing statistics approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840513486008">Hull &amp; Ambrose, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840513486008">Jordan et al., 2006</xref>), our results should not be construed as having established causality between receipt of an SLIV program vaccine and school absenteeism. Rather, what we have established is the existence of a significant association which provides justification to perform the following: more rigorous studies to establish the internal and the external validity of our results, and studies that take a multivariate approach with appropriate randomization scheme, control and treatment groups, and pretest and posttest. Despite the correlational nature of our study, the number and the type of multivariate statistical controls, including the baseline predictors and modeling technique we utilized, provide us with compelling results that are supportive of the positive impact of SLIV programs in reducing school absenteeism in a large medically underserved Hispanic community during three high-risk weeks in the 2011–2012 influenza season.</p>
<p>With regard to the <italic>indirect impact of the school program on unvaccinated students</italic>, our results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1059840513486008">Table 6</xref> indicate no evidence to support the claim of an indirect impact (<italic>herd effect</italic>) of the SLIV program on the absences of unvaccinated students. This finding, though inconsistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840513486008">Davis, King, Moag, Cummings, and Magder (2008</xref>) and of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059840513486008">Piedra et al. (2005</xref>), does not necessarily falsify these studies. This is because we did not evaluate the school program by way of controlled and randomized experiments and used all-cause absences as outcome measures, not sickness-related absences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059840513486008">Pourabbasi et al., 2012</xref>) or laboratory-verified influenza-related illnesses.</p>
<p>
<italic>So why might our results indicate the absence of indirect impact of the SLIV program on the unvaccinated students of the school population?</italic> Our data indicate that SLIV program vaccination rates ranged between ∼13.6% and ∼38.2% across all 20 elementary school campuses. Rates are higher than this range if the vaccination rates for students vaccinated in school and those for students vaccinated elsewhere in the community were combined. It may be the case that with less than optimum methods (existing statistics analysis or analysis of archival data) we used, we were unable to detect a herd effect. It is also possible that the threshold for indirect protection is higher than the rates we observed. This assertion is based on stochastic simulation models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059840513486008">Longini et al., 2000</xref>) and past empirical records from other illnesses published by CDC on its website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.cdc.gov">www.cdc.gov</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Stochastic simulations conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059840513486008">Longini, Halloran, and Nizam (2000)</xref> suggest that at least 50% of the students would need to be vaccinated to realize an indirect impact on the unvaccinated portion of that population. In the case of vaccines for other illnesses, the threshold for indirect protection was reported to be anywhere from 75% to 85%, inclusive (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.cdc.gov">www.cdc.gov</ext-link>). In consideration of Piedra et al.’s (2005) results, we were unable to test their claim even though the range they reported (20%–25% of children) was well within the range we observed (13.6%–38.2%), because we did not have the data to verify whether there was indirect protection for adults of at least 35 years of age.</p>
<p>Hence, given the rates we observed and the information we obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059840513486008">Longini et al. (2000)</xref> and the CDC, we suggest that schools in the area gradually expand the coverage of their school program to a larger segment of the student population so that a local optimum threshold can be eventually identified. We also suggest that data generated from optimum methods such as controlled randomized experimental designs with detailed trend analysis be employed. The prompt establishment of successful SLIV programs and the identification of an optimum threshold for indirect protection, especially in the U.S. southern border region, are important to local, regional, state, and national public health, given the high volume of traffic and exchanges between Mexico and the United States, which take place in this region.</p>

<title>Implications for School Nursing Practice</title>
<p>School nurses have historically played a vital role in maintaining immunization compliance in students. The role of the school nurse has traditionally been to promote immunization compliance through review of immunization records and through referral to local immunization resources. However, with the 2008 recommendation of universal annual influenza vaccination for children, the nation’s health leaders have turned to schools as prime locations for SLIV programs. The traditional model of vaccination at a medical office simply cannot absorb vaccinating all children against influenza every year. Because of this, the role of the school nurse relative to influenza vaccination is changing from the traditional model of immunization record review and referral to the novel role of immunization provider.</p>
<p>School nurses, as campus health experts, are in key positions to advocate for the establishment and implementation of SLIV programs. By doing so, school nurses maximize the chance that all children in school communities have access to annual influenza vaccination. School nurses can help school communities understand the susceptibility of children to influenza and the role that children play in transmitting the illness to family members and teachers. Resistance by educators to SLIV programs may be overcome by helping them to understand the effect of SLIV programs on school absenteeism. By reducing the incidence of influenza, students can remain in school ready to learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059840513486008">Wiggs-Stayner et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study provides school nurses with additional proof regarding the reduction in all-cause absenteeism for students vaccinated through SLIV programs versus unvaccinated students. During the week of highest all-cause absenteeism, ∼93% of the students vaccinated at school had perfect attendance as compared to ∼88% of unvaccinated students (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059840513486008">Table 3</xref>). The intriguing result regarding differences in attendance and absenteeism between students vaccinated in school and those vaccinated elsewhere opens an additional argument in favor of SLIV programs.</p>
<p>With the rapidly shifting demographics in the country, many school nurses work with large Hispanic populations. School nurses also work with inner city schools where children come from families with a low socioeconomic status. Our study helps school nurses understand that SLIV programs is associated with reduced absenteeism in these populations. Previous research has shown that absences due to influenza are greater in schools with a high population of children with low socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059840513486008">Wiggs-Stayner et al., 2006</xref>). It may be of greater importance for school nurses serving these populations to advocate for SLIV programs, since families in these communities may not have funds or transportation to health providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059840513486008">Wiggs-Stayner et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Knowledge about vaccination programs is critical to local, regional, state, national, and global public health. Empirical studies such as this serve to deepen and diversify our theoretical and empirical understanding of how aspects of population, location, and sociocultural context influence the outcomes of vaccination programs. With this study, we help build the much-needed knowledge base by evaluating the impact of an SLIV program on absenteeism in a large medically underserved Hispanic community.</p>
<p>Using a set of sophisticated analytical techniques, we are able to provide additional evidence regarding the lower all-cause absenteeism rates associated with school-vaccinated students relative to unvaccinated students. The techniques we used include (1) Poisson regression models with robust standard errors, which are appropriate for extremely positively skewed and overdispersed outcome measures, (2) the incorporation of multivariate statistical controls and baseline predictor variables (<italic>two random low-risk weeks before and after the SLIV program</italic>) to increase the precision of estimates, and (3) the use of random sampling with multiple stratification variables to improve external validity.</p>
<p>We conclude that more studies are needed to gain deeper understanding of the dynamics of vaccine delivery to diverse groups of the U.S. population—groups with distinct cultures, practices, sensibilities, and values that need to be taken into consideration in the conduct of health intervention programs such as influenza vaccination.</p>
