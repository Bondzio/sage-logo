<p>Our knowledge of the mechanics and pathophysiology of carpal instability continues to increase. The clinical management of patients with carpal instability has evolved in parallel, through a first phase with a preference for partial arthrodesis, to a second one of capsulodesis, and later to a third one of tenodesis. The results of all these treatments have not been universally satisfactory.</p>
<p>Joint stability is provided by the shape of the bones and the ligaments that tie them together, both intrinsic and extrinsic. But also, crucially, by the muscles that cross that joint controlled by a sophisticated propioceptive system. We are starting to understand how this neuromuscular system works, and this paper makes a contribution to our knowledge of the role of the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) tendon, and its sheath, in stabilizing the carpus. It is part of a series of papers by the authors defining the contribution of different muscles to the stability of the wrist.</p>
<p>The role of the ECU in the stability of the distal radioulnar joint has been studied in the past. This paper quantifies the role of ECU on the dynamic stability of the ulnar side of the wrist and its contribution to pronation between the forearm and hand. The evidence provided constitutes a basis for the design of re-training protocols for patients with dynamic instability that has a radiocarpal or midcarpal supination component, for example, ulnar-sided palmar midcarpal instability.</p>
<p>As we increase our understanding of the role of muscles in carpal stability, a new era of treatments opens up in front of us. If we can train, in a targeted manner, forearm and hand muscles to dynamically stabilize the wrist, patients may be able to control or abolish their symptoms of clinical instability. The therapeutic potential makes this approach very attractive. We may be entering the next phase in the management of carpal instability.</p>
