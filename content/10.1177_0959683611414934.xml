<abstract>
<p>Age-controlled pollen and microcharcoal records from Holocene sediments in Paju Unjeong, Korea, reflect the response of vegetation dynamics to climate changes and human activity. The pollen spectrum shows clear differences between the natural vegetation stage and the land-use vegetation stage. The land-use vegetation stage is further divided into dry-field cultivation and paddy-field cultivation stages. The natural vegetation stage (<italic>c</italic>. 8420–4700 cal. BP, early Neolithic) indicates the presence of dense woodlands consisting of various deciduous broadleaved trees on well-drained hills to uplands during the mid-Holocene period. Early Neolithic foraging peoples occupied the area and collected wild plants and fruits, such as acorns. The land-use stage (<italic>c</italic>. 4700 cal. BP, late Neolithic to Modern) reflects forest transition and, finally, Gramineae-dominated open landscape. During the dry-field cultivation stage (<italic>c</italic>. 4700–2000 cal. BP, late Neolithic to Bronze Age), inhabitants may have used fire as the principal means to open lowland vegetation for occupation, wood reclamation, and artifact making. During the paddy-field cultivation stage (<italic>c</italic>. 2000 cal. BP, Iron Age to Modern), inhabitants’ activities on adjacent open lowland increased. The local area became an extensive open landscape on which the Baekje people (<italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 0–100, first century in Korean chronology) utilized constant fires to manage woodlands at limited levels for more open habitat. Their descendents, the Joseon people (<italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1600, seventeenth century in Korean chronology), utilized strategic management of pine trees as a secondary method to obtain wood material for building houses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The development of agriculture in Korea, as elsewhere, was an important part of land-use regimes and Holocene human adaptation. Korean archaeology can help to clarify the mechanisms involved. Prehistoric activities evidenced by artifacts and paleoethnobotany have been archaeologically documented in the context of agricultural cultivation and ground burned off for expanding dry fields in Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683611414934">Ahn, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683611414934">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683611414934">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683611414934">Crawford and Lee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683611414934">Kim and Yun, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In the last three decades, pollen analyses in South Korea have been carried out to reconstruct the history of natural vegetation responses to climate changes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683611414934">Chang and Kim, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683611414934">Chang et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683611414934">Chung et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683611414934">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683611414934">Jun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683611414934">Yi and Kim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959683611414934">Yi et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683611414934">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683611414934">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683611414934">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683611414934">Yoon, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683611414934">2011</xref>). However, until now, only a few pollen studies with emphasis on paddy- and dry-field farming based on cultivated plant and synanthropogenic habitats have been reported from organic-rich sediments in wetlands in lowland areas (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683611414934">Yasuda et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683611414934">Yi and Kang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683611414934">Yoon et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, no pollen studies examining human disturbances on woodlands have been reported thus far.</p>
<p>Pollen records analyzed from the Paju Unjeong area, which is geomorphologically represented by low hills, have shown drastic changes in pine and oak trees from the Neolithic to the Bronze Ages. The pollen profile showed that the relative frequencies of those two pollen grains did not coincide with climate changes. Oak trees have been used as firewood to cook food and create warmth in Korean underfloor heating systems, a technique still used today in traditional Korean houses. Conifer, especially red pine (<italic>Pinus densiflora</italic>), was a principal architectural material traditionally used to build houses through much of Korea’s history.</p>
<p>Therefore, the pollen frequencies of these two trees (pine and oak) can be potential indicators of woodland disturbances and possible land use in prehistoric times in South Korea. This study interprets the relationship between woodland vegetation changes and human disturbances in Paju Unjeong area.</p>

<title>Study area</title>
<p>The study area belongs, as an administrative district, to Gyoha-eup, Paju-shi, Gyeonggi Province. This area, near a lower reach of the Han River, is located in the lower part of low hills. The Han River is 6 km south of the study area; it flows northwest to Goyang-shi and then meanders northward, flowing into the Yellow Sea. The topography of the study area includes a relatively flat alluvial plain and a small area of low hills in the south; the rest of the area is somewhat mountainous. The flat alluvial plain, with an elevation of less than 40 m above sea level (a.s.l.), is now used as paddy fields, whereas the mountainous area, with an elevation of up to 60 m a.s.l. in the north, is now occupied by forests and residential areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611414934">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Undisturbed sediment of core UJ-10 was obtained in 2007 in the lower part of the low hills (129°56′1.34″E, 35°03′29.43″N), with elevations of 18.7 to 19.3 m a.s.l. The basement rock consisted of a banded gneiss unconformably underlain by alluvium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959683611414934">Lee and Kim, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Because Paju is located between the Gwanghwa and Seoul Meteorological Stations, I used data from both sites. At present, the Paju area experiences a cool-temperate climate. Between 1971 and 2000, the area was characterized by a mean annual temperature of 10.9–12.2°C, with temperatures ranging from a high of 16.1–25.9°C in August to a low of 6°C to −3.0°C in January (Korea Meteorological Administration, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kma.go.kr">http://www.kma.go.kr</ext-link>). Precipitation is relatively high (mean, 1316.7–1344.3 mm/yr), and about 66.9% to 71.6% of the annual precipitation falls in summer, especially from June to August (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611414934">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Today, vegetation of the Paju Unjeong area, which belongs to the central temperate zone of the deciduous broadleaved forest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683611414934">Yim and Kira, 1975</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683611414934">Figure 1C</xref>), is composed of, by elevation, a <italic>Quercus mongolica</italic> community, a <italic>Q. variabilis–Q. mongolica</italic> community, and a <italic>Q. mongolica–Q. variabilis</italic> community. Furthermore, the study area is characterized by a <italic>Q. mongolica</italic> community consisting of hardwood trees of <italic>Q. mongolica, Q. variabilis, Q. aliena, Q. acutissima, Rhus trichocarpa, Prunus sargentii, Acer palmatum, Zelkova serrata, Celtis sinensis, Corylus heterophylla, Magnolia sieboldii</italic>, and <italic>Alnus japonica</italic>; shrubs of <italic>Fraxinus rhynchophylla, Styrax japonica, Lindera obtusiloba, Rhododendron schlippenbachii, Symplocos chinensis</italic> for. <italic>pilosa</italic>, and <italic>Juniperus rigida</italic>; and herbs of <italic>Artemisia keiskeana, Athyrium yokoscense, Dioscorea japonica</italic>, and <italic>Lactuca raddeana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683611414934">Choi, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683611414934">Jeong and Yang, 1999</xref>).</p>

<p>The study profile is approximately 160 cm thick and is divided into seven lithological horizons composed of three distinctive sedimentary units: Unit 1, dark greenish-gray sand with angular pebbles in the upper horizon and grayish-brown sand and granules in the lower horizon (elevation, 17.904–17.144 m a.s.l.); Unit 2, dark gray, coarse sand with some rounded and some angular pebbles in the low horizon (elevation, 18.414–17.904 m a.s.l.); and Unit 3, overlying monotonous dark gray soil (elevation, 18.764–18.414 m a.s.l.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611414934">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Six samples from the core profile were subjected to accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating. The AMS dates of six samples were determined by the AMS Laboratory of the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM), Korea. Two AMS samples taken at the same elevation of 1.104 m yielded two radically different dates, 3135±81 cal. BP (code # IWD070115) and 5019±114 cal. BP (code # ISA080054), respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683611414934">Table 1</xref>). However, the dated fragment of sample (# IWD070115) was a piece of plant’s root, which may penetrate down, i.e. below the level of its actual growth. So, we think that the 3135±81 cal. BP age is not the real age of this elevation. In addition, the dates from all the samples, except that one, are getting older with depth in the linear age to depth model, which looks consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611414934">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore the exceptional age date of 3135±81 cal. BP (code # IWD070115) is not used for our interpretation. All dates were calibrated at the 1σ confidence level using the CalPal2007<sup>online</sup> program by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959683611414934">Danzeglocke et al. (2008)</xref> with CalPal-2007<sub>Hulu</sub> calibration data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683611414934">Weninger and Jöris, 2008</xref>). Calibration ages before present (cal. BP) were applied in the present study. I calculated the average for only those age ranges with the highest probabilities. The full details of the six ages in the present study are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683611414934">Table 1</xref>. The age–depth curve is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0959683611414934">Figure 2</xref>. The dating shows that the age of the sediment samples from the Paju Unjeong site ranged from <italic>c</italic>. 7518 to <italic>c</italic>. 164 cal. BP. The base age of the profile for the pollen study was extrapolated to <italic>c</italic>. 8420 cal. BP on the basis of the overlying horizons of 7518 cal. BP (17.994 m a.s.l.) and 5019 cal.

<p>A total of 57 dried sediment samples of 5 g were used for pollen and microcharcoal analyses at an average 2 cm depth interval. Standard pollen preparation techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683611414934">Moore et al., 1991</xref>) were used. Three exotic <italic>Lycopodium</italic> spore tablets were added to each sample before further preparation to estimate the pollen and microcharcoal concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683611414934">Stockmarr, 1972</xref>). HCl (30%) was used to dissolve calcareous minerals, and HF (45%) treatment was used to remove siliceous materials. The organic matter recovered was separated from undigested mineral detritus using ZnCl<sub>2</sub> (2.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), and acetolysis was used to remove cellulose and humic debris. The residues were strew-mounted on glass slides using glycerin jelly. Pollen grains were counted (up to 300 grains per slide) with an optical microscope, mostly at 400× magnification, except when difficulty in identification required a higher magnification of 1000×.</p>
<p>Pollen identification was aided by the use of published works with illustrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683611414934">Chang, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683611414934">Chang and Rim, 1979</xref>). Pollen grains were mostly assigned to the lowest taxonomical level, usually genus and family. Gramineae pollen grains were classified into two categories based on diameters of &lt;35 µm and ≥35 µm, but the division is not discussed in detail because this threshold-size method is not an entirely precise determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683611414934">Kim, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683611414934">Maloney, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683611414934">Nakamura, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683611414934">Tweddle et al., 2005</xref>). Microcharcoal was identified in classes of 25–50 µm, 100–150 µm, and 150–200 µm. Only charcoals larger than 50 µm in length were plotted on the pollen diagram, as most of the smaller particles could be derived from bigger charcoal fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683611414934">Shu et al., 2010</xref>). Pollen diagrams were constructed using TILIA and TGView software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683611414934">Grimm, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683611414934">1993</xref>).</p>

<p>Zonation was determined based on levels of human activity and environmental dynamics and subzones were determined in light of fluctuations in critical pollen and microcharcoal to facilitate discussion of vegetation changes and human disturbances. Three zones (UD10-I to UD10-III) from 18.764 to 17.954 m a.s.l. were erected using characteristics of the fluctuations in the critical pollen components and CONISS in TGView software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683611414934">Grimm, 1987</xref>). No pollen grains were recorded in a barren zone between 17.924 and 17.154 m a.s.l . Additionally, pollen recorded between 17.714 and 17.684 m a.s.l. was considered to be contamination from sludge during coring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611414934">Figure 3</xref>).

<title>Natural vegetation stage (c. 8420–4700 cal. BP): Early Neolithic</title>
<p>This stage is represented by zone UJ10-I, in which the vegetation community consists of deciduous broadleaved trees, indicating dense woodlands during the mid-Holocene period, closely comparable with the hypsithermal period in adjacent areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683611414934">Jang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683611414934">Jun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683611414934">Park and Yi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683611414934">Yi et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683611414934">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683611414934">Yoon, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The postglacial climate amelioration toward warming and strengthening of summer monsoons enhanced the flourishing of various hardwood trees during the early to mid Holocene in Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683611414934">Chung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683611414934">Jang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683611414934">Jun et al., 2010</xref>). Forests became dense, especially on well-drained hills to uplands, as reflected by abundant levels of oak (<italic>Quercus</italic>) and moderate magnolia (<italic>Magnolia</italic>), elm (<italic>Ulmus</italic>), zelkova (<italic>Zelkova</italic>), and ash (<italic>Fraxinus</italic>), combined with hardwood trees of chestnut (<italic>Castanea</italic>), myrtle (<italic>Myrica</italic>), wild walnut (<italic>Juglans</italic>), and carpinus (<italic>Carpinus</italic>). In addition, riparian, alder (<italic>Alnus</italic>), and willow (<italic>Salix</italic>) inhabited the riverside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611414934">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, favorable environmental conditions contributed to the occupation by early-Neolithic foraging people of the Paju Unjeong area, where early humans preferred to collect the fruits of wild plants such as the abundant acorns. During this stage, oak was the major wood manipulated by humans in the local area; humans may have maintained it for its acorns, an important food resource. This maintenance may have constituted the main effect of early Neolithic foraging cultures on woodlands.</p>
<p>The fluctuation in vegetation during this stage was primarily driven by climate changes rather than by human impact. The decline in deciduous broadleaved forests is clearly marked in the subzone UJ10-Ib, where oak (<italic>Quercus</italic>) and alder (<italic>Alnus</italic>) gradually decrease and are replaced by pine (<italic>Pinus</italic>) and wild grasses of Gramineae (&lt;35 µm) and mugwort (<italic>Artemisia</italic>), indicating a relatively cool and dry climate.</p>

<title>Land-use vegetation stage (c. 4700 cal. BP–Modern): Late Neolithic to Modern</title>
<p>This stage corresponds to the zone UJ10-II to UJ10-III, represented by dramatic fluctuations in critical components of the pollen profile. Overall, this stage is characterized by a marked shift in vegetation from forests to Gramineae-dominated open landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683611414934">Figure 3</xref>). The indications of climate change are overshadowed by those of intense human impact.</p>
<p>Dry-field farming preceded paddy-field production in the Korean Peninsula and continued to be important long after paddy-field systems developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683611414934">Crawford and Lee, 2003</xref>). According to the results of archaeological and archaeobotanical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683611414934">Ahn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683611414934">Crawford and Lee, 2003</xref>), the Neolithic foraging people’s culture changed to settlements on lowland or hills and a farming culture, which developed agricultural cultivation methods such as dry-field or paddy-field farming in Korea. Since that time, human disturbance in woodlands has increased. Hereafter, I will discuss the division of dry-field and paddy-field cultivation stages based on pollen data with the aid of the results of the previous archaeological studies.</p>

<title>Dry-field cultivation stage (c. 4700–2000 cal. BP): Late Neolithic to Bronze Age</title>
<p>The pollen profile of zone UJ10-II shows that oak (<italic>Quercus</italic>) and alder (<italic>Alnus</italic>) trees clearly decrease and constantly decline upward; in contrast, pine (<italic>Pinus</italic>) trees distinctly become more abundant compared with the preceding stage, encompassing zone UJ10-I. Inhabitants may have used fires as a main means to open lowland vegetation for occupation, wood reclamation, and artifact making. This assumption is supported by the increasing abundance of microcharcoal in zone UJ10-II and the gradual and consistent reduction in oak. Moreover, anthropogenic Gramineae (≥ 35µm) occur and show a subsequent dramatic percentage growth. In addition, this stage is characterized by abundant microscopic charcoal.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683611414934">Zong et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683611414934">Innes et al. (2009)</xref> mentioned the retreat of the alder (<italic>Alnus</italic>) community because of human clearance by fire. The main targeted hardwood trees for human management were diverse woods including oak (<italic>Quercus</italic>), alder (<italic>Alder</italic>), wild walnut (<italic>Juglans</italic>), magnolia (<italic>Magnolia</italic>), and myrtle (<italic>Myrica</italic>). The reduced level of microcharcoal in the upper part of the zone may be assumed to have been caused by the shortage of available woods because of the nearly complete removal of forests or by a possible shift in strategies for managing the landscape.</p>
<p>Agricultural activities conducted at or near coasts and riversides during the early Neolithic period spread widely inland for the management of farmland and shelters by deforestation and reclamation during the late Neolithic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611414934">Lee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683611414934">Shin, 2000</xref>). Moreover, because of the low level of land productivity, it may be assumed that the Neolithic people cut down large amounts of adjacent woodlands for the purpose of wide dry-field cultivation. The Neolithic agricultural people used farming tools and logging instruments for forest exploitation in the Korean Peninsula from the early Neolithic period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683611414934">Ahn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683611414934">Cho, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683611414934">Crawford and Lee, 2003</xref>). After 4000 cal. BP, the ancient people developed a practice of reclaiming dry-field areas by burning woodland; furthermore, they strategically developed an agricultural method of leaving land fallow to secure new field areas. Therefore, this kind of new agricultural technology and methods for woodlands increased forest destruction.</p>
<p>Rice-paddy cultivation in Korea began at the commencement of the Bronze Age (3000–2300 cal. BP), which extended from the first step of the Bronze Age to the early Iron Age (2300–2000 cal. BP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683611414934">Cho, 2004</xref>). Bronze Age people further developed techniques for reclaiming rice paddy fields and established irrigation systems and various customs associated with rice paddy cultivation.</p>
<p>The interpretation that these people engaged in multipurpose felling is supported by unearthed Neolithic artifacts, such as a home hatchet, a wheel blade of axe, a saw-toothed blade of an axe, and a large logging axe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683611414934">Ahn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683611414934">Lee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683611414934">Shin, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Paddy-field cultivation stage (c. 2000 cal. BP–Modern): Iron Age to Modern</title>
<p>The pollen profile of zone UJ10-III is characterized by abundant Gramineae (≥ 35µm) and pine (<italic>Pinus</italic>), which apparently decrease in subzone UJ10-IIIa and increase again toward subzone UJ10-IIIb. However, oak (<italic>Quercus</italic>) occurs constantly throughout, and alder (<italic>Alnus</italic>) appears in low levels, as compared with those of the preceding stage encompassing zone UJ10-II.</p>
<p>Human activity increased extensively from the beginning of subzone UJ10-IIIa, when the previous human-induced forest was drastically transformed into Gramineae (≥35 µm) vegetation. The strong human disturbance is well represented by the dominance of Gramineae (≥35 µm) and <italic>Pinus</italic>, the great retreat of <italic>Quercus</italic>, and the first occurrence of buckwheat (<italic>Fagopyrum</italic>) in low levels. During this stage, the local area became an extensive open landscape on which humans mainly utilized constant fires to manage woodlands at limited levels to establish more open habitat. This strategy was presumably successful to meet the needs of a possible population increase, rice food production, and settlement expansion, and thus prompted the prosperity of the Baekje Culture, which is one of the Three Kingdoms in Korean chronology.</p>
<p>In subzone UJ10-IIIb (<italic>c</italic>. 440 cal. BP), pine (<italic>Pinus</italic>) drastically increases, although oak (<italic>Quercus</italic>) and Gramineae (≥35 µm) consistently occur. Pine trees may have been strategically planted as secondary forestation because this tree was used as an essential timber to build houses during the Joseon Dynasty (seventeenth century). This interpretation is supported by Korean history documentation (Annals of the Joseon Dynasty), which explained that the central government encouraged pine afforestation.</p>
<p>From compiled pollen data and artifacts, it appears that Iron Age peoples created diverse agricultural instruments, resulting in enhanced cultivation and deforestation of natural forests, as indicated by artifacts such as wood-processing axes, medium and large wood-logging axes, and big steel axes, which were discovered across the Korean Peninsula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683611414934">Ahn, 2010</xref>). They managed reclamation of woodlands and farming fields by fire and by wood cutting. In the beginning of this historical era, the Baekje people (<italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 0–100, first century in Korean chronology), who occupied the Paju Unjeong area, utilized wood cutting and axes to obtain as much timber as possible. Their descendents, the Joseon people (<italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1600, seventeenth century in Korean chronology), strategically managed pine trees as secondary forestation to obtain wood material for building houses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683611414934">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Age-controlled pollen and microcharcoal records in the 160 cm long core covering the Holocene of the UJ-10 core obtained from the Paju Unjeong site located in the central western Korean Peninsula reflect the response of vegetation dynamics to climate changes and human activity. Pollen profiles clearly illustrate a differentiation between the natural vegetation stage and the land-use vegetation (human-affected) stage. The land-use vegetation stage can be further divided into the dry-field cultivation stage and the paddy-field cultivation stage. The natural vegetation stage (zone UJ10–I, <italic>c</italic>. 8420–4700 cal. BP, early Neolithic) indicates that the dense woodlands, consisting of various deciduous broadleaved trees on well-drained hills to uplands, were caused by postglacial climate amelioration and strengthening of summer monsoons during the mid-Holocene period. The fluctuations in the vegetation were primarily driven by climate changes rather than by human impact. In addition, early Neolithic foraging eoples occupied the forests and collected the fruits of wild plants, such as acorns. The land-use vegetation stage (zone UJ10–II and III, <italic>c</italic>. 4700 cal. BP, late Neolithic to Modern) reflects the forest transition; and finally, the Gramineae-dominated open landscape replaced the former dense woodlands. During the dry-field cultivation stage (zone UJ10-II, <italic>c</italic>. 4700–<italic>c</italic>. 2000 cal. BP, late Neolithic to Bronze Age), dramatic changes in oak, alder, and grass (Gramineae), together with abundant microcharcoal, indicate that inhabitants may have used fires as a main means to open lowland vegetation for occupation, wood reclamation, and artifact making. During the paddy-field cultivation stage (zone UJ10-III, <italic>c</italic>. 2000 cal. BP, Iron Age to Modern), the pollen profile, represented by abundant grass (Gramineae) and fluctuating pine, may imply that the inhabitants’ activities became intense. The local area became an extensive open landscape on which humans utilized constant fires to manage woodlands at limited levels for more open habitat during the time of zone UJ10-IIIa, comparable with the Baekje Culture (<italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 0–100, first century in Korean chronology) in Korean chronology. Their descendents, the Joseon people (UJ10-IIIb, <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1600, seventeenth century in Korean chronology), strategically managed pine afforestation to secure wood for building houses.</p>
