<p>Two of the most significant controlling forces of the world continue to be that of business and polity. This book examines the relationship between these two entities and how their interaction has shaped the history of the world as we know it. The author explains how the said forces are inextricably linked at present and attempts to explore how it historically progressed over the years to the current state and shed light on how this relationship can be formed in future.</p>
<p>This exploration is spread out in the five parts of the book. The first and second parts are an examination of the ties between the early forms of business and political bodies in the ancient civilizations which span out from the Greek and Roman empires to that of Arab, Chinese, Indian and Japanese empires. The author has categorized the empires under investigation into two categories: the ancient period and the Muslim World. In the ancient period, the two empires Greek and Roman have developed in the same manner and share similar traits, but the others are different in character. The author’s analysis shows how good governance can help prosper trade as well as the states. The Greek Empire provided safeguards, citizenship rights to traders and allowed trade, monetization and banking to develop independent of the state. On the other hand, the prosperity of the Roman Empire was threatened by the lack of proper governance. Similarly, Chinese state building was fragmented and provided little help for the advancement of trade. The key role played by religion in guiding and governing trade is significant in the Muslim World.</p>
<p>Part two, on the Medieval World, begins by illustrating the close ties which developed between business, government and religion. While rulers encouraged the growing trade in the Indian Ocean, their increasing wealth prompted them to seek approval and blessings from religion by making offerings. At the same time, temples began to emerge as trading points such as marketplaces and fairs, especially in southern India. Interesting characteristics pointed out by the author with regard to South India are the growing strength of the merchant class who eventually formed merchant organizations and the growing significance of trade as a source of government revenue. The author concludes that the relative laissez-faire system which existed in the Indian Ocean led to civil and non-aggressive trade relations, a factor which led the region to succumb to European powers later. A running theme in the discussion of the Medieval World is the growth of domestic trade. We get glimpses of this in the case of India and China and more extensively, in the case of Japan and Europe. The latter two also saw rapid urbanization, and business growth in these countries has been largely independent of the support of the existing political structures, especially in Europe. There is equal emphasis on the rapid monetization in Europe which provided further impetus to growth. There is an extensive discussion of the trade development in Europe, warranted by the significant role it was to play in shaping business and political institutions all over the world. This discussion provides an understanding of how Europe transformed itself to wield such power.</p>
<p>Part three elaborates on how the relationship between business and polity consolidated in Europe due to warfare in the region. Given the limited capacity of feudal lords, it was the merchants that these countries had to turn to in harnessing physical and human resources. Use of mercenary soldiers as opposed to knights who dedicated their lives for protecting the country, and fiscal borrowings—emperors and princes depending on the merchant class to lend financial resources to fund the war—are two noteworthy concepts which are brought to notice by the author. During the period under discussion, warfare itself became a business, which was outsourced to leading merchants.</p>
<p>The author places a great emphasis on fiscal operations in Europe around the sixteenth century. In order to finance several centuries of war, the rulers had to resort to a tax system, generally consisting of direct taxes on landowners and indirect taxes on international trade and domestic production. Successful lobbying by wealthy interest groups to avoid taxes resulted in increasing the tax burden on the poor through indirect taxes. However, the limited tax base compelled some countries to employ more creative forms of government financing such as the sale of offices—sale and resale of government offices to individuals for a stipulated sum of money. In England, economic privileges such as exclusive trading rights in a particular region were granted to merchants or groups of merchants who contributed to state financing. Later on, increasing public debt led to a strengthening of the power of merchants as state financiers.</p>
<p>Part four examines the use of colonialism as a source of wealth and government financing in the European countries. However, the author highlights the fact that despite the vast wealth created by the colonial engine, government extravagance and warfare eroded any chance of fiscal consolidation, especially in the cases of Portugal and Spain. By the end of the fifteenth century, the Portuguese were controlling the trade routes of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The Portuguese Crown had established a form of state capitalism which encouraged and governed trade in arms as well as valuable commodities and used means of monopoly, commissions and customs duties to extract revenue. However, the author’s analysis shows that this very dominance of trade over the state led to the eventual deterioration of Portuguese colonialism when its naval prowess was rendered feeble by royal extravagance and neglect of the navy, as state building took the backseat to expanding trade. The Portuguese colonial supremacy was passed on to the Dutch. Fuelled by a thriving domestic economy, the Dutch set forth in capturing the Portuguese colonies using the same mechanism as the Portuguese, namely, warfare. Establishment of an independent body, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) which was both a trading corporation as well as an extension of sovereign powers, served to further this cause. The British colonialism began in the sixteenth century led by a naval force which in essence was a public–private partnership consisting of the Royal Navy as well as merchant ships. British trade was centred on the Caribbean islands and evolved into what the author calls the triangular trade, the success of which depended on a continuous supply of slave labour. The author points out that despite the ‘distress’ of the priests and political philosophers over the brutal aspects of this triangular trade, they found ways to rationalize these commercial undertakings and ‘(accept) the reality’ mainly because trade and commerce had turned a blind eye towards ‘moral precepts and rules except those that served their interests’ (p. 276). These commercial ventures such as the East India Company were extended sovereign powers to govern the colonies. However, political issues in the colonies led to an eventual curtail of power leaving them either as commercial or governing entities.</p>
<p>Part four begins by illustrating the prosperity and economic significance of Eurasian nations before European nations found their way into these economies. It briefly touches on colonization of Siberia by Russia, the Ottoman Empire, Safavids, Mughal and Manchu dynasties in India and China, respectively, illustrating the fact that these nations existed in complete isolation from each other and despite their prosperity, had not mastered the art of combining trade and politics like their European counterparts who set out to subjugate them backed by their naval strength. This left them victims of hegemonic European powers, particularly the British hegemony.</p>
<p>In part five, the author indicates that the three pillars of British hegemony were the industrial revolution, ensuring free labour and facilitating free markets. He dedicates a separate sub-section to discuss the rise and fall of the British Gold Standard. By the mid-nineteenth century, many countries within the British Empire were adhering to the Gold Standard, which was sustained by exploiting the resources in India, liquidity in France, and gold production in South Africa. The author cites the collapse of the free market, one of the pillars of British hegemony, as the key reason for the fall of the Gold Standard and consequently, the British Empire. The Great Depression led many countries to adopt protective measures to safeguard their domestic economies and eventually give in to domestic pressure to abandon the Gold Standard. Britain, itself finally abandoned it in 1931 after numerous attempts of upholding it failed.</p>
<p>The rise of the United States as the world superpower has been dealt with briefly in the last part of the book. The author surmises that heavy protectionism, a massive domestic market and the industrial and technological development during World War II to be the prime drivers behind America’s ascent to economic supremacy. This process of US hegemony has been analyzed under three phases. During the first phase, the foundation was laid by the US government for US corporates to expand their hold in global business, a process which has been contrasted to the British colonial regime in which the engine of expansion was the merchant companies. The second phase is characterized by complete conversion of the international finance system into pure dollar standard caused by the country’s involvement in trade and arms. This phase was led by the multinational companies and the US financial system. Both these stages are coupled with a separate analysis of the financial system prevalent at that period. The analysis of the third phase is an emphasis on how the polity and business community of the US are working in tandem to guarantee a never ending accumulation of profit and power to solidify the US hegemony, which has been strengthened by globalization. This part concludes by raising concerns about the possible implications of America’s triumph as the global superpower, which is fascinating given the current scenario in which the US is faced with an economic crisis but its political authority over the world is by no means impinged.</p>
<p>The epilogue briefly summarizes the previous parts. More significantly, it points out that the US hegemony may not be sustainable due to fiscal imbalances within the country, the like of which gave birth to a financial crisis which hindered global growth. It also underlines the need for deviating from ‘one-size-fits-all’ ideology of the US centred on ‘liberty, democracy, private property and markets’ (p. 373). Finally, it recognizes the significance of rethinking the governance and ethics of market capitalism and attaining distributional justice as opposed to concentrating wealth in a few individuals who own businesses and power; it is essential to bring about more concrete agendas by the wealthy and powerful for sustainable employment generation which creates distributional justice. The author’s conclusion is ominous in the sense that he predicts that the existing world order of the business and polity may easily collapse at a ‘pin drop’ unless these issues are dealt with, which is validated by the current wave of uprising from Wall Street to the Middle East.</p>
<p>To sum up, it should be pointed out that the author has provided a reasonably sufficient historical analysis of the two power networks, business and polity, especially given its coverage in terms of geography and time. Although in certain cases the book may resemble a mere historical account of the evolution of business and polity, a keen reader may garner many insights on the relationship between these two entities and implicit lessons learned. The author’s carefully chosen themes allow him to stay on the subject without major deviations: a difficult task to accomplish, given the varied nature of such historical accounts. More significantly, the book appears to be an excellent guide to understanding how the global economy and most individual economies came to be what they are today. Thus, the author has succeeded in his objective stated at the beginning of the book.</p>
<p>One of the drawbacks of this work is the author’s attempt to cover too vast a geographical area and time span and hence too little detail is provided making the reader’s understanding somewhat obscure. For example, the prologue discusses the role played by temples in the Mesopotamian civilization as distributors, regulators and guardians of wealth and the subsequent development of more complex financial institutions such as the House of Elgi offering various financial services. This brief discussion takes the reader from 3000 <sc>bc</sc> to fifth century <sc>bc</sc> within a very short span, diverting on the way to Greek, Asian and Babylonian empires. This work also presumes a certain level of historical understanding on the part of the reader. However, in most instances, the author has provided adequate reference required to bridge any gaps in this regard. There are several instances of sudden geographical shifts and cases where vague mentioning of historical phenomena is brought into the discussion which limits the understanding of the reader. This perhaps is a result of trying to cover a vast extent of history. One feels that the author’s attempt would have been more comprehensive if this book were produced in several volumes.</p>
<p>However, one may point out that Business and Polity remains a fairly comprehensive attempt to investigate the relationship between the two entities under discussion and the reader would greatly benefit from its analysis of the political economy of the world over two and a half millennia.</p>
