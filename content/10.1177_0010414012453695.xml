<abstract>
<p>Empirical studies on representation have been based mainly on the descriptive analysis of levels of political or ideological congruence between MPs and voters. Very few studies focus on explaining congruence, and those that have done so do not explore all the explanatory dimensions. This article contributes to filling this gap by testing whether three theoretical models can explain left–right congruence among European parties. These models explore causality at the micro or individual level (the characteristics of voters and MPs), the meso level (party characteristics), and the macro or system level (party system and institutional characteristics). Based on data from the PIREDEU project, the study examines the party systems of the 27 countries of the European Union with reference to the 2009 European Parliament elections. The findings reveal that MP–voter congruence is best explained at the party level and by key MP candidate characteristics.</p>

<p>Despite the emergence of numerous studies of political representation in recent decades, there is insufficient research about some key areas. In fact, most work in this field is either essentially focused on theoretical matters or, in the case of empirical studies, largely descriptive. Some of these empirical studies comparatively analyze the levels of congruence among European political parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414012453695">Barnes, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012453695">Converse &amp; Pierce, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012453695">Esaiasson &amp; Holmberg, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012453695">Freire &amp; Belchior, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012453695">Holmberg, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010414012453695">Miller et al., 1999</xref>, except for the chapter by Wessels; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0010414012453695">Schmitt &amp; Thomassen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010414012453695">Valen &amp; Narud, 2007</xref>). A few works focus on causality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012453695">Dalton, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012453695">Holmberg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414012453695">Huber &amp; Powell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414012453695">Wessels, 1999</xref>), but as far as we are aware, none attempt a comprehensive theory about what causes higher or lower levels of congruence between parties or party leaders and their voters.</p>
<p>This article attempts to explain the levels of left–right congruence within European political parties. The literature suggests different causes for party congruence that can be organized into three levels: individual, party, and political system. To assess the relative importance of each level, this article uses three explanatory models that compile the predominant contributions in the literature: the Downs–May, Przeworski–Sprague, and Huber–Powell–Wessels models. The study includes the 27 member states of the European Union, or a total of 189 political parties, and thus uniquely provides broad comparative cross-national and cross-party system data about the causes of congruence.</p>
<p>Political parties as instruments of representation is a core feature of the responsible party model, the most frequently used theoretical model for the study of representation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012453695">Converse &amp; Pierce, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012453695">Dalton, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010414012453695">Miller et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0010414012453695">Schmitt &amp; Thomassen, 1999</xref>). In essence, this model requires voters to weigh their vote based on information about the position of parties and to reward or punish incumbents based on their performance; and it requires parties to offer clear and distinct policy options and efficiently carry out the mandate they are granted by voters. On this view, the electoral choices of voters indirectly control political decisions, given that political parties fulfill pledges that supposedly correspond to the will of those electing them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012453695">Converse &amp; Pierce, 1986</xref>, pp. 499-501, 699; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414012453695">Pierce, 1999</xref>, p. 9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0010414012453695">Schmitt &amp; Thomassen, 1999</xref>, chaps. 6-9).</p>
<p>Although the model has been criticized (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414012453695">Dye &amp; Zeigler, 2006</xref>, pp. 180-181, 203-205; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012453695">Esaiasson &amp; Holmberg, 1996</xref>, chap. 15; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414012453695">Thomassen, 1999</xref>, pp. 34-35), it provides theoretical support for the premises of this article. Indeed, the aim here is to center the analysis on political parties as privileged agents of representation and assess the extent to which they constitute an efficient link between voters and leaders. This linking role is generally supported by the literature (for a review of the literature, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010414012453695">Thomassen &amp; Andeweg, 2004</xref>, pp. 48-49, 61), and there is evidence that the features of Europe’s party systems support the responsible party model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012453695">Dalton, 1985</xref>, pp. 270-271). Considering the normative assumptions of the model—that voters tend to behave consistently and that parties perform responsively—the article estimates the extent to which the left–right positions of MP candidates and their voters in the 2009 European Parliamentary elections are congruent, and the underlying causes of that congruence.</p>
<p>Because the left–right variable is a relevant dimension in the political debate as well as for placing individuals and parties in the political arena, being widely understood by political actors and commonly used in research on representation, it is assumed that left–right self-positioning is a suitable variable for our study. Moreover, although methodologically problematic in some ways (see the discussion below), this is one of the few variables that permits broad cross-national MP–voter comparisons.</p>
<p>The article briefly summarizes the most relevant literature on the models to be tested. It then outlines the proposed hypotheses and some methodological issues. Following this, the empirical findings are presented and discussed, offering a preliminary description of party congruence and the causes of congruence.</p>

<title>Explaining Congruence: From Micro- to Macro-Level Models</title>
<p>The study of MP–voter congruence, examined in the seminal work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414012453695">Miller and Stokes (1963)</xref>, lies at the heart of modern theory of democracy for some authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012453695">Esaiasson &amp; Holmberg, 1996</xref>, p. 83; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010414012453695">Held, 1996</xref>, pp. 297-334; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414012453695">Huber &amp; Powell, 1994</xref>). However, it is widely recognized that the empirical implementation of straightforward MP–voter congruence is impossible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414012453695">Pierce, 1999</xref>, p. 25; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010414012453695">Thomassen &amp; Schmitt, 1999a</xref>, p. 19; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010414012453695">1999b</xref>, p. 186). It is also thought that congruence should not be seen as the sole legitimate approach to study democratic representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0010414012453695">Thomassen, 1994</xref>, pp. 238, 257-258). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010414012453695">Pitkin (1967</xref>, pp. 209, 213, 221-224) acknowledges that representation should bind representatives to positions that are congruent with the preferences of citizens, although this does not mean that political decisions may be adopted that are contrary to public preferences if the public interest appears to lie elsewhere. Indeed, MP–voter congruence should not be regarded as evidence of a normatively <italic>superior</italic> expression of democratic representation, but rather as <italic>a means</italic> of looking at representation, and its constraints should be acknowledged.</p>
<p>The theories that can be mobilized to study congruence causality are not new—some have been around for a long time—but they have never been used together to examine why some parties are more congruent with their voters than others. This section discusses the Downs–May, Przeworski–Sprague, and Huber–Powell–Wessels models deployed in this analysis.</p>
<sec id="section2-0010414012453695">
<title>The Downs–May Model</title>
<p>The contribution of the Downsian spatial theory of elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453695">Downs, 1957</xref>) to the study of the process of representation can be summarized in a few sentences. This model assumes that voters prefer the parties that best represent their political positions and that parties seek to maximize their votes so that positions tend to converge. “According to spatial theory, a voter’s utility for a party depends on the distance between the issue position of the party and the position of the voter” allowing the “assumption that the relation between distance and utility is linear” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414012453695">Iversen, 1994b</xref>, p. 50). In addition, in a two-party system with voters evenly distributed along the ideological center, the best party strategy to maximize votes is to target the median voter (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010414012453695">Enelow &amp; Hinich, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414012453695">Iversen, 1994b</xref>).</p>
<p>There is one particularly important criticism of this model (for a review of the critics, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414012453695">Iversen, 1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414012453695">1994b</xref>): that political parties tend to adopt more extreme policy positions than those of their voters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010414012453695">Rabinowitz, MacDonald, &amp; Listhaug, 1991</xref>, pp. 148-157; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414012453695">2003</xref>, pp. 3-5). As shown in the Rabinowitz and MacDonald directional model, and as supported by some empirical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010414012453695">Rabinowitz et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414012453695">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010414012453695">Valen &amp; Narud, 2007</xref>, p. 300), voters choose the party that offers the most intense version of their preferred political positions. Research also shows that voters tend to be more centrist than MPs. This was demonstrated for the 1979 European Parliament election (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012453695">Dalton, 1985</xref>, p. 275) and is generally the case for European party systems over the past decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414012453695">Belchior, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414012453695">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012453695">Converse &amp; Pierce, 1986</xref>, p. 128; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012453695">Esaiasson &amp; Holmberg, 1996</xref>, pp. 92-95; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012453695">Holmberg, 1989</xref>, pp. 19-23; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414012453695">Iversen, 1994a</xref>, pp. 168-175; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414012453695">1994b</xref>, p. 59; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414012453695">Thomassen, 1999</xref>, pp. 46-50). To explain this pattern of divergence, other studies have looked at the structure of voter policy preferences and have concluded that the directional analysis of party competition generally works when attempting to explain how people vote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414012453695">Iversen, 1994b</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the Downsian logic, and as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010414012453695">May’s (1973)</xref> law of curvilinear disparity, the reason underlying MP–voter incongruence lies in the influence of party activists, whose policy positions are more extremist than those of rank-and-file voters or elected party leaders. Activists potentially push their parties to adopt strategic positions that are more distant from those of their party’s voters.</p>
<p>Advocating the use of mixed models to explain electoral behavior, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414012453695">Iversen (1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414012453695">1994b</xref>) is a precursor in testing the effects of this model in an inclusive manner. He used data of West European countries in 1979. His findings support neither Downsian spatial theory, rejecting the existence of a significant proximity between voters and parties, nor May’s theory, since he finds no evidence for a polarizing role of the midlevel elite. Indeed, he simply concludes that “party elites at all levels systematically choose policy positions that are considerably more extreme than those of their own electorates” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414012453695">Iversen, 1994a</xref>, p. 183).</p>

<sec id="section3-0010414012453695">
<title>The Przeworski–Sprague Model</title>
<p>The mainstream view of representation is that public preferences essentially shape the preferences of party elites (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414012453695">Miller &amp; Stokes, 1963</xref>). However, some scholars believe that party leaders mold public opinion (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012453695">Esaiasson &amp; Holmberg, 1996</xref>, chap. 5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012453695">Eulau, 1987</xref>), whereas others state that the influence is reciprocal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414012453695">Hill &amp; Anderson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010414012453695">Hurley &amp; Hill, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0010414012453695">Przeworski and Sprague (1986)</xref> agree that the influence is bidirectional, and in their analysis of the causes of MP–voter disparities at the party level, they argue that party leaders may forego short-term vote maximization when they want to influence public opinion in a certain direction. This is the case of parties pursuing long-term strategies of social mobilization (ideological parties). By contrast, they contend that short-term vote-maximizing party strategies tend to be center oriented (catchall parties) (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414012453695">Iversen, 1994a</xref>, pp. 160, 173-177, 181-183). Catchall parties therefore tend to show higher levels of congruence than ideological parties since unlike the latter, the former do not try to change the views of the electorate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012453695">Holmberg, 1989</xref>, p. 12).</p>
<p>Others state the opposite: Ideological parties tend to produce higher MP–voter consonance than centrist parties since communication with voters is more efficient because of a clearer ideological anchoring (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0010414012453695">Klingemann, 1995</xref>, pp. 197-198, regarding European party systems in the 1970s and 1980s). More recent evidence on European parties did not support this assumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414012453695">Belchior, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414012453695">Iversen (1994a)</xref> is also the main reference in discussing the Przeworski–Sprague model regarding effects on voting behavior. Using the aforementioned data, he supports the model’s expectations regarding its utility for understanding party strategy formation but does not test for the greater efficacy of catchall parties, which is at the core of the model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0010414012453695">
<title>The Huber–Powell–Wessels Model</title>
<p>Despite some controversy (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010414012453695">Ezrow, 2007</xref>, pp. 184-185, 188-189; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010414012453695">Wlezien &amp; Soroka, 2007</xref>, pp. 809-810), the literature focusing on the systemic or macro level generally agrees that proportional systems are more likely to generate high levels of political representation than majoritarian systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012453695">Dalton, 1985</xref>, pp. 287-288, 294; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414012453695">Huber &amp; Powell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414012453695">Powell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414012453695">Wessels, 1999</xref>, pp. 138, 145-146, 158). Representation is increased particularly in large constituencies, and when the party system is polarized and has a large number of parties since voter choice and the possibility of finding a party that matches voter views are greater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414012453695">Huber &amp; Powell, 1994</xref>, pp. 311-315; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010414012453695">Powell, 2004</xref>, pp. 290-291; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414012453695">Thomassen, 1999</xref>, p. 46; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414012453695">Wessels, 1999</xref>, pp. 151-153). In such cases, parties will not be drawn to the median voter as they will be in two-party or majoritarian systems; rather, parties will be spread across the entire political spectrum, given that the key link is between party and party voters, and not the median voter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414012453695">Iversen, 1994b</xref>, pp. 54-55; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414012453695">Wessels, 1999</xref>, pp. 146-147). This is the explanation offered by the Huber–Powell–Wessels model, which is the result of the aforementioned research and, as far as we know, has never been tested as a comprehensive model.</p>
<p>To sum up, according to Downsian logic, congruence arises because rational behavior: Voters choose the party that most closely matches their policy preferences, and parties tend to perform in accordance with their voter preferences since they want to maximize votes. When divergences within parties occur, May’s law of curvilinear disparities states that this is caused by dissatisfied party activists, who push their parties toward the extremes and, consequently, toward divergence with voters. The Przeworski–Sprague model posits that congruence varies across parties as a function of the social mobilization strategies of party leaders (congruence tends to be lower among ideological parties and higher among catchall parties). Finally, at the macro level, the Huber–Powell–Wessels system model indicates that congruence is expected to increase to the extent that party and electoral systems provide a greater variety of party alternatives that represent a broader range of voter preferences. For this reason, polarized proportional electoral systems with a large number of parties are expected to exhibit higher levels of congruence. In what follows, we test the explanatory power of these models as regards left–right congruence within European political parties.</p>

<sec id="section5-0010414012453695">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>Although each model adopts a different perspective, they are not necessarily mutually exclusive. On the contrary, taken together, they provide a broad micro-, meso-, and macro-level understanding of party congruence. As none of them has been tested in the present way, the operationalization is basically new. In what follows, we identify the variables that best operationalize each model to formulate the research hypotheses.</p>
<p>The Downs–May model can be assessed by using a set of variables that measure one of the premises of the theory: the rationality of actors as a factor conditioning the quality of representation. It is expected that the most politically involved and sophisticated voters will make the most rational choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453695">Downs, 1957</xref>). Indeed, it has been found that MP–voter positions are more similar when more politically sophisticated voters are at stake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414012453695">Barnes, 1977</xref>, chap. 8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414012453695">Hill &amp; Anderson, 1995</xref>). Thus, it is assumed that political sophistication and involvement and the level of education of voters will produce higher levels of consonance between voters and parties. Similarly, the more experienced MPs are, the more accurate their perceptions of the position of voters are expected to be and the more congruence one can expect.</p>
<p>The most distinctive factor in the Downs–May model to explain congruence (which is expected to be very high if one considers only the Downs spatial voting theory) is the existence of a midlevel party leadership or activists, who have more extreme positions and produce a lower level of congruence between legislators and voters. Since there are no data on midlevel party elites, we cannot assess the extent to which they contribute to incongruence, so we use intraparty polarization and party cohesion as proxies. The distance of MP from the neutral point on the left–right scale (5) measures party polarization. This variable has already been tested, and as expected it revealed that more polarized MP views produce lower levels of congruence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012453695">Holmberg, 2000</xref>). Party cohesion is measured using the standard deviation of MP left–right positions in the party. It is expected that high intraparty polarization and low party cohesion will produce lower levels of MP–voter congruence (see H1a–H1c in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414012453695">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The Przeworski–Sprague model explores the importance of the nature of party competition, with a particular emphasis on party type (catchall vs. ideological). At the core of the Przeworski–Sprague model is the ideological location of parties (and concomitant party strategies). Operationalizing the model therefore involves not only assessing parties ideological position but also measuring the ideological distance of a party from the neutral center (5), similar to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414012453695">Iversen (1994a</xref>, p. 181) has done. The position of a party in the context of competition between parties is also assessed by looking at the size of the party (which is measured by the number of votes for the party divided by the total population in the country). In addition, to operationalize the model and gain additional information about parties, we use a set of dummy variables to account for party family (communist, special interest, and nationalist as a proxy for ideological parties; and social democratic and Christian democratic as a proxy for catchall parties).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0010414012453695">1</xref></sup> In sum, this model suggests that larger parties and parties closer to the ideological center and belonging to the social democratic and Christian democratic party families tend to exhibit higher levels of congruence with their voters (H2).</p>
<p>The Huber–Powell–Wessels model focuses on party and electoral system characteristics. It claims that the more proportional the system and the more differentiated the political parties, the better voters will be represented by parties. In this case, the independent variables are party system differentiation (measured by the standard deviation of the left–right position of parties according to election manifestoes), the proportionality of the electoral system (as measured by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414012453695">Gallagher, 1991</xref>, index), the fractionalization of the party system (as measured by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0010414012453695">Rae, 1967</xref>, index), and the effective number of parties (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414012453695">Laakso &amp; Taagepera, 1979</xref>). According to this model, higher levels of ideological congruence are likely to be found in the more differentiated and proportional electoral systems (H3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0010414012453695">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since there is no comprehensive theory of what causes higher or lower levels of congruence within parties, and since there is almost no research on the topic, we do not have a clear basis to outline theoretical expectations across models. But we can deduce from general theory that as we go from the micro to the macro level, we can expect the models to increase in explanatory power as broader level constraints will limit the importance of lower level variables (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414012453695">Table 1</xref> for the operationalization of the models and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0010414012453695">Table A1</xref> in the appendix for the studies used and questions posed).</p>

<title>Analysis and Data</title>
<p>In this article, congruence is measured by the distance between the positions of representatives and represented. This is computed using a collective approach since the intention is to compare parties (as in, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414012453695">Belchior, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414012453695">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012453695">Dalton, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012453695">Holmberg, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012453695">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010414012453695">Thomassen &amp; Andeweg, 2004</xref>, pp. 48-49). A simple measure of mean left–right distances between both is used. Congruence occurs if MP candidates and voters share ideological positions, with the distance between them equaling zero.</p>
<p>The left–right dimension generates some difficulties. Left–right self-placement is an abstract ideological exercise, and its results may differ from those obtained using other variables (such as positions regarding substantive public policies). Furthermore, although relatively little information is necessary to identify political actors on the left–right <italic>continuum</italic>, this formula says little about the meaning of this positioning. Comparing actors as different as citizens and elites also raises methodological problems. Unlike MPs, voters are not a coherent collective entity, so their positions have different meanings. For this reason, high correlations between elites’ and electorates’ positions do not necessarily mean greater proximity between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414012453695">Pierce, 1999</xref>, pp. 13-15; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414012453695">Powell, 2000</xref>, p. 94). An additional problem arises when comparing countries: Because it has no fixed definition in terms of substantive policies, the meaning of left and right changes across countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414012453695">Benoit &amp; Laver, 2006</xref>, chap. 6).</p>
<p>Despite these problems, scholars agree that the left–right variable captures the comparative ideological positions of citizens and parliamentarians reasonably well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012453695">Holmberg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414012453695">McDonald &amp; Budge, 2005</xref>, pp. 31-38, 228; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414012453695">Powell, 2000</xref>, pp. 162-163; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010414012453695">Rabinowitz et al., 1991</xref>). In addition, it has been demonstrated that voters place themselves quite accurately on the left–right scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012453695">Freire &amp; Belchior, in press</xref>), and the latter has been used in many studies of mass public and political elites (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414012453695">Barnes, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012453695">Freire &amp; Belchior, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012453695">Holmberg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414012453695">Iversen, 1994a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414012453695">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012453695">Mattila &amp; Raunio, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414012453695">McDonald &amp; Budge, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414012453695">Powell, 2000</xref>). Moreover, even assuming that the left–right dimension has no core role in structuring the political competition across the 27 EU member states, the left–right scale can be looked at as a general cross-country empirical device, that is, a symbolic and subjective ideological reference that allows comparing countries at a higher level of abstraction than if we were using policy issues, which would be the ideal solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414012453695">Benoit &amp; Laver, 2006</xref>, chap. 6). Of course the interpretation of results should consider all these limitations.</p>
<p>We used four data sets from the Providing an Infrastructure for Research on Electoral Democracy in the European Union (PIREDEU) project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.piredeu.eu">www.piredeu.eu</ext-link>) for this analysis: the Voter Survey Data (European Election Studies [EES], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0010414012453695">2009a</xref>), the Candidate Survey Data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414012453695">EES, 2009b</xref>), the Manifesto Study Data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414012453695">EES, 2009c</xref>), and the Contextual Data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414012453695">EES, 2009d</xref>). These studies include the 27 EU member states and were carried out in 2009. The first survey is based on a representative sample of voters, and the second includes the whole universe of MP candidates to the 2009 election to the European Parliament. The study of manifestoes was supported by a content analysis of the party programs issued for the 2009 European election.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0010414012453695">3</xref></sup> Finally, the Contextual Data contain information about political parties that stood for the 2009 European Parliamentary elections and offer a set of party, party system, and institutional variables (for an explanation of the methodology of this data set, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414012453695">Czesnik, Kotnarowski, &amp; Markowski, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0010414012453695">4</xref></sup> It is unusual to find such a broad set of variables covering different levels of analysis to carry out this kind of comparative analysis. Indeed, the opportunity to use such a large sample of parties (144) is unique.</p>
<p>The representatives in our study are candidates for the European Parliament. Although these are not elected representatives, studying them is not unusual (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010414012453695">Thomassen &amp; Schmitt, 1999a</xref>, pp. 17-19). The potential difficulties that can arise from this choice are mitigated because we are dealing with an abstract and structuring issue (left–right position rather than substantive policy issues). In this case, party linkage with supporters is supposed to be stronger and more perceptible. To simplify the presentation and discussion of results, the candidates for European Parliament are simply termed MPs.</p>

<title>Congruence Across European Political Parties</title>
<p>Research generally shows that levels of congruence between voters and parties positions are low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010414012453695">Miller et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414012453695">Pierce, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0010414012453695">Thomassen, 1994</xref>). However, the degree of congruence seems to vary according to the issue at stake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012453695">Dalton, 1985</xref>, pp. 276-277; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010414012453695">Hurley &amp; Hill, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0010414012453695">Thomassen, 1994</xref>, p. 255; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414012453695">Thomassen, 1999</xref>, pp. 45-52; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010414012453695">Thomassen &amp; Schmitt, 1999b</xref>, p. 199). It has been proved that congruence is higher for ideological or highly politicized issues and for left–right positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012453695">Dalton, 1985</xref>, p. 283; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012453695">Holmberg, 2000</xref>, pp. 163-165; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012453695">Mattila &amp; Raunio, 2006</xref>, pp. 437-439; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0010414012453695">Thomassen, 1994</xref>, pp. 254-256; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414012453695">1999</xref>, p. 53).

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414012453695">Figure 2</xref>, which shows the distribution of European party systems regarding MP–voter congruence within parties, suggests three main conclusions. First, the spatial distribution of the European party systems shows a tendency toward concentration in the ideological center. Second, MP positions on the left–right scale appear to be directly and positively related to their voters’ positions, with a significant and quite robust statistical linear relationship. The diagonal positioning is only slightly biased to the left, showing that MPs tend to be relatively further to the left than voters. Although there is generally an ideological correspondence between MPs and electorates within European party systems, there is no absolute congruence. Were that the case, the alignment of the dots would be more parallel to the diagonal line of the diagram. Third, as regards a geographical pattern of congruence, MP–voter congruence seems to be furthest to the left for Southern European party systems and furthest to the right in the Eastern European ones. This is all that can be ascertained in terms of geographical patterns. Indeed, taking a closer look, the least congruent systems are those of Portugal and Malta in Southern Europe, Bulgaria in Eastern Europe, and also Luxemburg. A similar geographical combination of countries is among the most congruent (those closest to the diagonal line).</p>
<p>Indeed, as Holmberg states, MP–voter agreement “seems to be something of a universal characteristic that does not vary too much across different political systems” as confirmed by the concentration of party systems at the center of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414012453695">Figure 2</xref>. Moreover, Holmberg acknowledges that
<disp-quote>
<p>that universal characteristic should probably not be viewed as signalling any high level of congruence since, if we compare our empirical levels of issue agreement with what a purely random model would yield—that is, if parliamentarians were chosen by lot—the random selection method would most often outperform the representative process. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012453695">Holmberg, 2000</xref>, p. 170; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012453695">Esaiasson &amp; Holmberg, 1996</xref>, p. 111)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>So we should not be too optimistic about these findings.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0010414012453695">Figure 3</xref> reiterates the same conclusions at the level of parties. There is a rather strong linear relationship between MP and voter positions within parties, which demonstrates the existence of a significant correspondence between both. The line is also slightly left-leaning, reiterating the tendency for MPs to position themselves further to the left than their voters (except for parties on the right, in which MPs tend to be to the right of their voters). Similarly, MPs to the left of voters were also found in many European parliaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414012453695">Belchior, 2008</xref>, pp. 463-458; 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012453695">Converse &amp; Pierce, 1986</xref>, chap. 19; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012453695">Dalton, 1985</xref>, pp. 283-284; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012453695">Holmberg, 1989</xref>, pp. 19-23; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414012453695">Iversen, 1994a</xref>, pp. 167-171; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0010414012453695">Thomassen, 1994</xref>, p. 255; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414012453695">1999</xref>, pp. 50-53; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0010414012453695">Thomassen &amp; Schmitt, 1999b</xref>, pp. 191, 198-199). This supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414012453695">Iversen’s (1994b</xref>, pp. 60-70) conclusion that the spatial distribution of parties and voters suggests that voters choose parties that offer relatively more intense policy alternatives than their own. This seems to be particularly valid for the ideological left.</p>
<p>The general picture emerging from the two figures above (as well as other studies) supports the contention that moderate to high levels of congruence tend to prevail within European political parties, although MPs are ideologically more extreme, as well as slightly more to the left than their electors. This suggests that the public is not as ideologically committed as the party elite. As various studies have demonstrated, this can be explained partially by citizens’ lower levels of political sophistication as compared to that of elites (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012453695">Converse &amp; Pierce, 1986</xref>, chap. 7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414012453695">Dye &amp; Zeigler, 2006</xref>, p. 3).</p>
<p>European political parties seem to perform well in terms of representing voters ideologically, as parties correspond to the left–right position of voters. In short, party systems reflect the views of their domestic electorates reasonably well. Various studies on this issue have achieved similar results for Europe (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414012453695">Belchior, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012453695">Dalton, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012453695">Holmberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012453695">Mattila &amp; Raunio, 2006</xref>, p. 430).</p>

<title>Explaining Party Ideological Congruence</title>
<p>Most research on representation has shied away from explaining variations between countries and between individual political parties. Moreover, contradictory explanations have emerged as to the cause of congruence. To contribute to the study of this issue, in what follows the reasons for party congruence are explored using the three models.</p>
<p>To compare the importance of the models for levels of left–right congruence, regression analysis was performed for each, taking into account the characteristics of individuals, parties, and electoral systems. The dependent variable is ideological distance, which is computed for each party by subtracting the average position of MPs on the left–right scale from the position of voters on the same scale.

<p>The regression analysis in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414012453695">Table 2</xref> is organized into three blocks and presents the results for the three hypotheses of the Downs–May model. Contrary to the Downsian rational choice argument, the more politically sophisticated, involved, and best educated voters do not exhibit higher levels of congruence with the party they vote for. Education and political information are not significant, and the coefficients for the significant political involvement variables have positive signs, which means they explain incongruence rather than congruence (either way, the magnitude of the coefficients is rather low for both).</p>
<p>These findings contradict the plausible expectation that the more attentive voters would be more able to choose a party congruent with their own ideological self-placement. Indeed, some authors have concluded that “constituents have the capacity to and do in fact hold their members of Congress accountable for roll-call votes” and that “actual roll-call votes directly affect constituents’ beliefs, and those roll-call votes, in turn, have substantial effects on approval ratings and electoral behavior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414012453695">Ansolabehere &amp; Jones, 2010</xref>, p. 596). Notwithstanding the logic of this, the electoral system should be considered when explaining the importance of voters’ political sophistication and involvement. It might be appropriate in the U.S. majoritarian case, in which there is a direct linkage between MPs and voters within constituencies (voters vote for candidates). When this linkage does not exist or is weak, as is the case for most European countries, where proportional electoral systems prevail (although open party lists are common in Europe, parties tend to mediate the representation process), the incentives for voters to be attentive to candidates’ policies and their potential impact for congruence are very weak.</p>
<p>The political experience of MP candidates does not seem to explain MP–voter congruence: The relationship is either insignificant or works in the opposite direction. However, the accuracy of representatives’ perceptions of the position of voters is surprisingly significant and strong, suggesting that the more accurately MPs perceive the ideological placement of voters, the closer they position themselves to voters. This supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414012453695">Miller and Stokes’s (1963)</xref> assumption that the accuracy of the perception of legislators is potentially connected with the quality of political representation (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012453695">Eulau, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>The argument that activists potentially push their parties to position themselves strategically away from their voters does not seem to compensate for the flaw in spatial theory since there is almost no empirical corroboration of this thesis (for a discussion of this topic, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414012453695">Iversen, 1994a</xref>). However, there is evidence that parties with lower levels of polarization tend to produce higher MP–voter congruence (party cohesion does not support the hypothesis).</p>
<p>To sum up, for the Downs–May model, H1a is not supported by the data, suggesting that the political sophistication of voters does not have a significant impact on the level of congruence of parties; and H1b is only partially supported since in the case of MPs only perceptual accuracy seems to have a significant effect on congruence. However, May’s theory seems to play a significant role here since polarization of parties correlate with levels of congruence, which supports H1c.</p>
<p>Contrary to what is suggested by previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012453695">Holmberg, 2000</xref>, on the Nordic countries) and in agreement with the work of other scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414012453695">Belchior, 2008</xref>; Converse &amp; Pierce, 1987, chap. 19), <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0010414012453695">Table 3</xref> shows that parties on the right tend to exhibit higher levels of congruence than parties on the left (although for that we have to accept a level of significance higher than .05, and the coefficients are very small). However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012453695">Eulau (1987</xref>, p. 186) puts it, party ideology is a powerful indicator that constrains the emergence of constituency representation, and its ambiguity does not permit us to infer a clear trend, as the remaining variables in the model confirm.</p>
<p>Following the Przeworski–Sprague model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012453695">Holmberg (1989</xref>, pp. 16-20) detects a tendency toward higher congruence among Swedish parliamentary parties at the center of the ideological spectrum than among parties at the left or right (although there are nuances depending on the issue at stake). For Holmberg this can be explained by the fact that more ideologically extreme parties base themselves more on strategies to transform public opinion rather than to aggregate or articulate the majority views of centrist parties. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414012453695">Iversen (1994b</xref>, p. 59) considers that center parties are generally much closer to the average voter than the parties on the extremes. Indeed, as the distance of the party from the neutral center increases, the level of ideological distance between voters and MPs also increases. We can interpret party dimension similarly: Given the tendency for bigger parties to be closer to the center and for smaller ones to be closer to the extremes of the spectrum, this variable shows that congruence with voters increases with the size of the party. Party family dummies do not support the general expectation, and they are significant only for the social democratic and special interest party families, the latter moving in the expected direction but the former not. But these variables do not seem to be the most significant, since party family does not properly capture the position of parties vis-à-vis the ideological center (which in fact underlies the expectation of the authors regarding catchall parties).</p>
<p>The findings in this model are very suggestive that what explains MP–voter congruence is fundamentally the placement of parties at the ideological center where most of the electorate is located. Political competition plays the essential role, rather than party family or ideology. Radical parties tend to locate themselves away from centrist voters and thus lose voter congruence. This supports the hypothesis of the Przeworski–Sprague model (H2) that political parties competing for the center are more congruent.</p>
<p>The third model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0010414012453695">Table 4</xref> proves to be globally insignificant in explaining party ideological distance between voters and MPs, which leads us to reject H3. It has been demonstrated that it is essentially the diversity of the political choices on offer that affects the quality of political representation and not the number of parties itself that “supports the general notion that the electoral link may be the most important link between representatives and represented in terms of policy representation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414012453695">Wessels, 1999</xref>, p. 157). For this reason, the effective number of parties included in the analysis is considered a good measure of party system diversity,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0010414012453695">5</xref></sup> as are the Rae index of fractionalization and the differences in the ideologies of parties as represented in their election manifestoes. All of these variables proved insignificant.</p>
<p>Even though the sample is very small for this model (27 party systems), except for the Gallagher index of proportionality, all the other variables are far from significant. The results for the Gallagher index are also not encouraging: The more proportional systems do not contribute to higher levels of party congruence as expected; paradoxically, they increase party incongruence. To sum up, more differentiated party systems and proportional representation systems do not generate higher MP–voter congruence than the nondifferentiated, majoritarian systems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0010414012453695">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other research supports these results, showing that macro-level variables do not indicate a clear trend at this level of analysis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012453695">Mattila and Raunio (2006)</xref>, for instance, demonstrate that party system characteristics (number of parties and ideological range) do not affect opinion congruence at the European Union level. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012453695">Holmberg (2000)</xref>, “it is politics—not the structure of the political system—that explains the difference in degrees of issue agreement between parties of the left and the right in the Nordic countries in the 1990s” (p. 170; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012453695">Holmberg, 1999</xref>, pp. 106-107). Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414012453695">Huber and Powell (1994)</xref> found that among the institutional variables used, proportionality is the strongest and most significant predictor of the distance between the median voter and the median party. Similarly, in the Swedish parliament between the 1960s and 1985, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012453695">Holmberg (1989</xref>, p. 12) observed that the increase in the level of proportionality between votes cast and seats received in the parliament led to a higher degree of policy congruence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012453695">Dalton (1985</xref>, pp. 287-288) has also demonstrated that more proportional systems and more differentiated party systems offer improved political representation of voters by parties at the European Union level.</p>
<p>Given this diversity of results, the conclusions of the research presented here seem less disappointing and even make better sense. Indeed, all these results can mean only that system characteristics do not determine the level of MP–voter congruence within parties. This also means that the theoretical expectations that the macro-level model should have greater explanatory power than the meso- and micro-level models are unfounded. In fact, the macro-level model does not seem strong enough (or has no strength at all) to constrain the effect of the lower levels variables, as expected. Explanations for congruence should be looked for at the lower levels, particularly the party level.</p>

<title>Discussion of Results</title>
<p>This article has focused on an issue of political representation that has received scant attention in the literature: the underlying reasons for higher or lower levels of congruence between MPs and voters within parties. The research explored three theoretical models that encompass the various intervening variables at the micro, meso, and macro levels. The article began by establishing the levels of party congruence within the 27 party systems in the sample and then proceeded to explore causes. In what follows, we discuss the main conclusions of the study.</p>
<p>As regards the descriptive analysis of party congruence, the results corroborate what other studies have also noted: that levels of congruence tend to be moderate to high, as shown by the strong correlation between the position of MP candidates and voters within parties, although MP candidates tend to position themselves further to the left than their voters (expect for right-wing parties, in which they place themselves further to the right than those voting for them). Electorates therefore tend to be at the center of the ideological spectrum. This fact is essential for an understanding of the results of research into the causes of congruence.</p>
<p>Of course this finding cannot be overstated: The left–right variable does not correlate the same way with substantive policy positions across countries, and the findings do not allow us to fully support the responsible party premise since congruence is only seldom fully achieved. Moreover, a high degree of ideological congruence between legislators and voters does not guarantee decisional representation. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012453695">Holmberg (1989</xref>, p. 4), policy congruence and decisional representation can act in fully independent ways. Despite these concerns, the findings can be considered positive: Notwithstanding the methodological risks, the left–right dimension is a very relevant variable in the party systems under study, and although it does not guarantee decisional representation, MP–voter consonance has to be acknowledged as positive.</p>
<p>In light of these considerations, the article then focused on whether the three models could explain the structure of left–right congruence within European political parties. The results emphasize the relevance of the Przeworski–Sprague model, which highlights the importance of political party characteristics and their electoral strategies. The main conclusion is that the larger centrist parties evince the lowest level of ideological incongruence between MP candidates and voters.</p>
<p>It is also important to take note of the individual-level variables pointed at in the Downs–May model, namely the perceptual accuracy of MP candidates regarding the left–right positioning of voters, intraparty polarization, and left–right party cohesion. As regards the first, the candidates that most accurately perceive the ideological position of their voters are consistently the most congruent with their electorate. Since MPs tend to think that their voters are close to their positions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414012453695">Belchior, 2010</xref>, pp. 131-133), and because electorates tend to be more centrist than their MPs, when the latter adopt more centrist positions (something that happens with a significant part of our sample), they naturally tend to correctly perceive the views of the electorate at the center and to be congruent with the position of voters. This helps to explain the high percentage of variance in MP candidates’ perceptual inaccuracy (36.2%, the highest of the three models). This is also reinforced by the global results attained when testing the Przeworski–Sprague model.</p>
<p>Similarly, intraparty polarization accounts for a significant percentage of the variance found (19.3%), which indicates that the more ideologically polarized MP candidates tend to be less congruent with the position of their electorates. In the case of the centrist parties, the result of these two variables corroborates the aforementioned explanation: that the center is the territory of ideological congruence within parties. These variables also suggest what May is right when he notes that the extremist intermediary party ranks (polarized MPs) tend to produce less congruence between representatives and voters.</p>
<p>The macro-level model focusing on institutional and systemic characteristics was disappointing and reinforces the ambiguity one finds in the literature regarding the importance of proportional electoral systems or party system differentiation. However, these results are not an unsolvable puzzle. More research should be done on this topic, and the use of substantive policy variables may consolidate (or not) the conclusions reached about the other models, such as unraveling the real significance of institutional norms and the nature of party systems when explaining party congruence. In addition, other independent variables such as the importance of being the government versus the opposition party, the type of government (single vs. multiparty), and the number and salience of the political cleavages should also be added in future explicative models.</p>

<p>The number of political parties that ran in the 2009 European Parliamentary elections and obtained at least 1% of valid votes was also tested in the model, but proved insignificant.</p></fn>

<p>Other potentially relevant variables, used in previous research, were also tested, but proved to be far from significant. The dimension of the country, for instance, was supposed to be relevant for representation because in smaller countries it is easier for MPs and voters to be in personal contact. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012453695">Holmberg (2000)</xref> has proved this relationship among the Nordic countries. Similarly, the number of MPs as a proportion of total number of voters in each country was tested, but it also proved to be insignificant.</p></fn>
