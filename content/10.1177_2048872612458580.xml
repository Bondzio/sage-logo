<title>Background:</title>
<p>The magnitude of improvement of acute heart failure achieved during treatment varies greatly among patients. We examined changes in the plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels of patients with acute heart failure and attempted to elucidate the clinical factors associated with amelioration of acute heart failure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2048872612458580">
<title>Methods and results:</title>
<p>The study population consisted of 208 consecutive patients admitted to our institution with acute heart failure. We measured plasma BNP levels before and after treatment of acute heart failure and evaluated these levels based on median age, body mass index (BMI), creatinine (Cr) level, and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF). Plasma BNP levels before treatment were equivalent between the younger and older age groups; however, plasma BNP levels after treatment were higher in the older age group (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). Plasma BNP levels before treatment were significantly high in the lower BMI group (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) and the higher Cr group (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). Similarly, plasma BNP levels after treatment were high in both the lower BMI and higher Cr groups (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 for both). In the low EF group, plasma BNP levels before treatment were significantly high (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01), while plasma BNP levels after treatment were equivalent to those in the high EF group. A multiple linear regression analysis revealed that Cr was positively correlated and BMI and EF were negatively correlated with plasma BNP levels before treatment; however, the contributions of age, BMI, and Cr in reducing plasma BNP levels were more significant after treatment.</p>

<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The contributions of clinical factors working against amelioration of heart failure vary before and after treatment. Regarding plasma BNP levels, older age, very low BMI, and the presence of renal dysfunction eventually act to prevent amelioration of acute heart failure. Systolic dysfunction does not act against amelioration of acute heart failure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Therapeutic advances in drug development and mechanical support have made the treatment of patients with severe acute heart failure possible. However, in some patients, acute heart failure can be improved only slightly, even with intensive treatment. Various reasons exist to explain the resistance in improvement of acute heart failure. For instance, severe deterioration of cardiac function, including systolic and diastolic dysfunction, is naturally a primary cause. Other clinical factors, including age, body mass index (BMI), and renal function, could also be involved. However, to date, the clinical factors acting against the changes in plasma BNP levels that occur with amelioration of acute heart failure have not been clarified.</p>
<p>B-type (brain) natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a hormone that was identified in 1988.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2048872612458580">1</xref></sup> Plasma BNP levels rise as heart failure becomes more severe. Plasma BNP levels have therefore been utilized for early detection of heart failure and to estimate disease severity and predict prognoses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2048872612458580">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2048872612458580"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2048872612458580"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2048872612458580"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2048872612458580"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2048872612458580"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2048872612458580"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2048872612458580"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2048872612458580"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2048872612458580"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2048872612458580"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2048872612458580"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2048872612458580">14</xref></sup> In the present study, we attempted to elucidate the clinical factors associated with amelioration of acute heart failure by evaluating serial measurements of plasma BNP levels at admission and after treatment of acute heart failure. We used serial BNP measurements because the outcomes of patients with acute heart failure can be predicted using these measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2048872612458580">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2048872612458580">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2048872612458580"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2048872612458580"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2048872612458580"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2048872612458580">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section6-2048872612458580">
<title>Study patients</title>
<p>The study population consisted of 208 consecutive patients hospitalized due to heart failure between 1 January 2007 and 31 March 2010 at Jikei University Hospital (there were 183, 171, and 174 heart failure patients in 2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively, and there are 33 beds in the cardiology ward, including six beds in the coronary care unit).</p>
<p>Plasma BNP levels were measured twice: once during admission and again after intensive treatment of acute heart failure. We excluded patients with myocardial infarction because plasma BNP levels noticeably and rapidly increase during the 24 hours after its onset in a monophasic manner, then transiently decrease, possibly followed by another increase 2–3 days after onset (depending on the degree of ventricular remodelling), thus resulting in a biphasic profile.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2048872612458580">11</xref></sup> Patients who required emergency surgery, including coronary aorta bypass surgery and non-cardiac surgery, during the period between the collection of the first and second plasma BNP samples were also excluded. The study protocol [21–015 (5593)] was approved by the Ethics Committee of The Jikei University School of Medicine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-2048872612458580">
<title>Diagnosis of acute heart failure</title>
<p>Acute heart failure was diagnosed according to the guidelines for treatment of acute heart failure published by the Japanese Circulation Society. The patients with heart failure symptoms [New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes II–IV] underwent several examinations (blood gas analysis, blood sampling, electrocardiogram, plain chest radiograph, echocardiogram) and decided to be admitted to our hospital.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-2048872612458580">
<title>Treatment of acute heart failure</title>
<p>The patients were treated with drugs, such as diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, beta-blockers, nitrates, carperitide (human atrial natriuretic peptide), and, if necessary, catecholamines and mechanical supports such as respirators, intra-aortic balloon pumping, or percutaneous cardiopulmonary support.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2048872612458580">
<title>Blood sampling and measurement of plasma BNP levels</title>
<p>We measured plasma BNP levels immediately after admission (before intensive treatment) and at the time of improvement of acute heart failure (after intensive treatment). In each case, a second sample was collected when the clinical symptoms of acute heart failure improved and the patient’s condition stabilized. Whole blood (5 ml) was collected in tubes containing potassium EDTA (1 mg/ml blood). Plasma BNP was measured with a rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (non-extracted) using an antibody to human BNP (Shionogi, Tokyo, Japan). Serum biochemical analyses of creatinine (Cr) was performed in a central laboratory in our hospital during the study. In order to determine the effects of clinical factors on changes in plasma BNP levels, we divided the patients into two groups based on median age (72.5 years, interquartile range, IQR, 59.0–82.3 years), median BMI (23.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, IQR 21.2–25.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), median Cr level (1.20 mg/dl, IQR 0.90–1.64 mg/dl), and median left ventricular ejection fraction, EF, (39.2%, IQR 28.3–51.9%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-2048872612458580">
<title>Echocardiographic examination and other measurements</title>
<p>An echocardiographic examination was performed in all patients by three expert cardiologists. EF was used as a marker of systolic left ventricular dysfunction. On the basis of height and weight at admission, BMI was calculated as the weight divided by the square of the height.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-2048872612458580">
<title>Main outcome measures</title>
<p>The main outcome measures were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-2048872612458580">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The continuous variables are expressed as the mean±SD or the median. The data of two groups were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test or the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test, as appropriate. Age, BMI, Cr, and EF were analysed by quintiles of plasma BNP levels, and the values of each quintile were compared with those of the lowest 20% using the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. Multiple regression analyses were performed when multiple values were compared. According to a multivariate analysis, natural log transformation was performed on BNP values because they were not normally distributed. The clinical factors affecting reduction of plasma BNP levels after treatment to &lt;200 pg/ml were examined using a multiple logistic regression analysis. It has been suggested that the plasma BNP threshold level critical for predicting prognoses is approximately 180–200 pg/ml.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2048872612458580">11</xref></sup> It is thus generally believed that reducing BNP levels is preferable and that ensuring that plasma BNP levels are &lt;200 pg/ml after treatment of acute heart failure is beneficial for improving prognosis.</p>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 11.5J (SPSS Japan, Tokyo, Japan), and differences were considered to be statistically significant for <italic>p</italic>-values &lt;0.05.</p>

<p>The values of BNP before and after treatment were divided into five groups according to quintiles (Q1–Q5), and age, BMI, Cr, and EF before and after treatment in group Q1 was compared to those in the other groups, from Q2 to Q5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2048872612458580">Figure 3</xref>). In the analysis of age, no significant differences were observed in any quintiles before treatment compared to group Q1, whereas groups Q2–Q5 showed significantly higher values after treatment. This suggests that BNP values of older patients tend to be higher after treatment than before treatment. Regarding BMI before treatment, only group Q5 showed significantly lower values than group Q1. However, BMI after treatment was significantly lower in groups Q2–Q5 compared to those observed in group Q1. Using quintiles revealed that BMI is more likely to be lower in accordance with BNP increments after treatment. Regarding the plasma Cr levels, groups Q4 and Q5 showed significantly higher levels before treatment and groups Q4 and Q5 showed significantly higher levels after treatment, which suggests that plasma BNP levels tend to be higher before and after treatment. The EF values in groups Q4 and Q5 were significantly lower than those in group Q1 before treatment. Notably, no significant differences in EF were observed in any quintiles after treatment compared to group Q1, which suggests that systolic function has no relationship with plasma BNP levels after treatment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we investigated the clinical factors associated with decreases in plasma BNP levels and amelioration of acute heart failure. Improvements in acute heart failure are expected to differ depending on the specific characteristics of the patient, including degree of cardiac dysfunction, underlying heart disease, and the presence of complicating diseases. However, the present study identified standard contributing factors affecting changes in plasma BNP levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2048872612458580">15</xref></sup> Serial BNP measurements are useful in evaluating acute heart failure, and we attempted to investigate improvements in acute heart failure by assessing such measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2048872612458580">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In terms of aging, no significant differences were observed in plasma BNP levels before treatment between older and younger age groups, suggesting that the degree of acute heart failure is not related to aging in the acute phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2048872612458580">Figure 2</xref>). However, the reduction rate was significantly different between the two groups and plasma BNP levels were reduced only slightly in the older age group after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2048872612458580">Figure 2</xref>). Aging was negatively associated with BNP levels &lt;200 pg/ml after treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2048872612458580">Table 4</xref>). Aging was significantly associated with plasma BNP levels after treatment only. These data suggest that aging is a key factor modulating plasma BNP levels after treatment (but not before treatment) and that older age is related to poorer prognoses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2048872612458580">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Plasma BNP levels before treatment were significantly higher in the low BMI group compared with those observed in the high BMI group. The reduction rate was similar and plasma BNP levels remained high in the low BMI group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2048872612458580">Figure 2</xref>). BMI was significantly associated with plasma BNP levels both before and after treatment. BMI was also significantly associated with plasma BNP levels &gt;200 pg/ml, and this result was consistent before and after treatment, which suggests that high BMIs are positively associated with BNP reduction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2048872612458580">Table 4</xref>). This obesity paradox has also been shown in recent studies, thus suggesting that a moderately high BMI may be preferable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2048872612458580">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2048872612458580">18</xref></sup> However, the median BMI was only 23.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in this study, which is quite low compared with that observed in Western countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2048872612458580">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2048872612458580">20</xref></sup> Therefore, the present study may only suggest that nutritional status is important for improving acute heart failure and reducing plasma BNP levels.</p>
<p>A recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2048872612458580">21</xref></sup> demonstrated that the obesity paradox does not exist in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). In that study, all-cause mortality increased in obese patients with diabetes, which suggests that it is necessary to consider the presence of DM when investigating plasma BNP levels in patients with acute heart failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2048872612458580">21</xref></sup> We investigated the clinical outcomes in obese (above median: BMI &gt;23.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and non-obese patients (below median: BMI &lt;23.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with and without DM using a Kaplan–Meier curve for MACE and all-cause mortality. In the patients without DM, those who were non-obese showed worse outcomes than those who were obese in both the MACE-free survival curve (hazard ratio 0.32, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.56, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and the cumulative survival curve (hazard ratio 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.51, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). In patients with DM, no significant differences were observed between non-obese and obese patients in outcomes in either the MACE-free survival curve or the cumulative survival curve (not significant, respectively, data not shown).</p>
<p>Plasma BNP levels before treatment were significantly high in the low EF group compared with those observed in the high EF group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2048872612458580">Figure 2</xref>). However, the reduction rate was significantly higher in the group with an EF below median than in the group with an EF above median. No differences were observed in plasma BNP levels after treatment between these two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2048872612458580">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, a multiple regression analysis showed that the contribution of EF to plasma BNP levels was reduced after treatment compared with that observed before treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2048872612458580">Table 3</xref>). Given the fact that diastolic dysfunction is likely to affect plasma BNP levels after treatment, plasma BNP levels may correlate with diastolic dysfunction. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we evaluated echocardiographic diastolic function parameters [peak mitral inflow velocity and tissue Doppler velocities during early diastole (E and E′)] and plasma BNP levels after treatment in 30 patients who underwent echocardiographic examination in which echocardiographic E/E′ was evaluated. However, E/E′ was not measured in all patients and data for only 30 patients were measured, which was a limitation of this study. Plasma BNP levels after treatment were significantly correlated with E/E′ (<italic>r</italic>=0.51, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) (data not shown). These results suggest that intensive treatment during the acute phase can overcome increases in plasma BNP levels induced by systolic dysfunction and indicate that diastolic dysfunction is probably difficult to treat. EF was not significantly associated with plasma BNP levels &gt;200 pg/ml after treatment, suggesting that EF is not a factor for determining prognosis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2048872612458580">Table 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Elevated plasma BNP levels are associated with renal dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2048872612458580">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2048872612458580"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2048872612458580">24</xref></sup> In this study, plasma BNP levels were significantly reduced in the high and low Cr groups, while the reduction rate was equivalent between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2048872612458580">Figure 2</xref>). A multiple regression analysis showed that plasma BNP levels both before and after treatment were associated with renal dysfunction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2048872612458580">Table 3</xref>). In addition, renal dysfunction was positively associated with levels &gt;200 pg/ml after treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2048872612458580">Table 4</xref>). These results suggest that renal dysfunction is a factor acting against amelioration of heart failure during both acute and recovery phases.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the contributions of clinical factors acting against amelioration of heart failure vary before and after treatment. The most important finding of this study is that plasma BNP levels are associated with systolic dysfunction in the acute phase but not after treatment. This suggests that diastolic dysfunction is hardly improved, even with intensive treatment. Regarding plasma BNP levels, an older age, very low BMI, and the presence of renal dysfunction eventually act to prevent an amelioration of acute heart failure. Systolic dysfunction does not have a negative influence on any amelioration of acute heart failure.</p>
