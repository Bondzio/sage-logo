<italic>Population Ageing in Central and Eastern Europe</italic> involves more than a problem of matching pension and service policies to the needs of a growing number of elderly persons. More interestingly, it reflects the moral and economic struggles of the countries over the last several decades. As this edited volume makes clear, population aging in these countries comes largely from the confluence of two unfavorable demographic trends: sudden drops in fertility and out-migration of young people. Longer life expectancy can also contribute to population aging, but has increased slowly, and in some cases has even decreased.</p>
<p>The demographic trends speeding population aging were exacerbated by the crisis of communism in the 1980s and the shift to democracy and market economies since 1989. As Andreas Hoff says in the preface, “The Eastern European democratization movement of 1989 had a number of ‘unintended side-effects’ that eventually resulted in unprecedently rapid population ageing across the region” (p. xxvii).</p>
<p>Of course, the countries of this region vary in their experiences. The volume has chapters on nine countries in Eastern Europe (Poland, Lithuania, Russia), Central-Eastern Europe (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia), and South-Eastern Europe (Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria). Each chapter contains a wealth of detail in charts, tables, and figures. The chapters present information in accessible form that cannot be easily found elsewhere.</p>
<p>Most readers will find the details of a particular country less interesting than the general pattern of unfavorable demographic change. Still, intriguing nuggets pop up in the reading. For example, in 2006 the Czech Republic enjoyed the first year of population increase since 1993 (p. 79), and of the seven EU members with lowest low fertility (a total fertility rate of 1.3 or below) four (Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, and Romania) come from Eastern Europe (p. 13).</p>
<p>A theme common across the chapters is that governments and policies are not prepared for the relatively quick population aging in these countries. The chapters follow the presentation of demographic statistics with overviews of the problems of the elderly. Again, the economic insecurity brought about by the transition from communism created special challenges. The chapter on Hungary, for example, argues that the labor market reforms of the 1990s have had a long-lasting negative impact on older workers, who tend to have less education and worse health than young people in Hungary and older people in Western countries. Low labor force participation results at below 40 percent for persons 55–64. From the view of older workers, age discrimination in the labor force has increased. The chapters on Lithuania and the Czech Republic similarly identify negative images of aging and age discrimination as a major social problem.</p>
<p>The last section of the volume includes three chapters focussing on the societal implications of population aging. Covering cognitive/physical functioning, family relationships, and population structure, these chapters aim to offer more generalizations across the region than the other chapters. However, the lack of quality data on outcomes other than births, death, and migration limits the conclusions. The chapters tend to focus on a few countries with the best data and note that there is much heterogeneity across nations. While true, both points offer little in the way of a conclusion for readers.</p>
<p>One chapter on the sustainability of demographic trends in the future offers more specifics on the heterogeneity: the former nations of Yugoslavia and Ukraine will face the most significant challenges from population aging. These nations delayed reforms and have institutions that are least prepared for the problems of a large elderly population. Even if, as expected, out-migration of young people moderates in years to come, fertility will likely remain low and the mortality rate will likely improve. The trends will worsen rather than moderate population aging. Solutions are unlikely to come from demographic changes.</p>
<p>How can nations of Central and Eastern Europe respond to the challenges of population aging? On one hand, the countries can use Western nations as models. After all, most of Europe has aging populations. In the past, during the post-communist transition, Eastern and Western Europe greatly diverged. Today, the countries share the problem of population aging.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a crucial difference that Hoff succinctly highlights in the concluding chapter: “Western Europe became affluent before it was growing old—Central and East Europe is growing old before it had the chance to become affluent” (p. 251). Creative policy making will be needed to remake public pensions, social security, and health care under less than ideal economic conditions.</p>
<p>Exploring a new topic in the way that it does, this volume lacks an organizing thesis—other than the fact that population aging is occurring relatively quickly and policies need to address the problem. It presents little theory to explain the diversity across the region in circumstances and policy response. Comparisons across countries are hampered by the lack of high-quality, comparable data on the elderly. Even so, the importance of the topic and the excitement of exploring new questions make up for the weaknesses. There is much to learn about countries of this region of the world.</p>
