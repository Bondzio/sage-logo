<abstract>
<p>This article explores the recent struggles of Northern Ireland to create a legitimate police force that is viewed as responsive to the needs of both the Catholic/nationalist community and the Protestant/unionist community. Three types of legitimacy are explored: democratic legitimacy through popular control, professional legitimacy of trained public officials, and legitimacy through responsive implementation. Based on 102 qualitative interviews with community leaders and key actors within the process of police governance and community relations conducted between 2007 and 2010, this article concludes that progress has been made in establishing all three types of legitimacy but that the remaining deep sectarian divisions within the society, combined with recent economic difficulties, present serious challenges to police/community partnerships that will enhance the legitimacy of the police.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In total, 14 years have passed since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement ended most of the organized, sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. Catholic/nationalists demanded police reform as a condition for entering into the agreement, because, for them, the police had long been an instrument of Protestant/unionist domination. Unionists attached great legitimacy to the existing police structure and were highly resistant to change.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1078087412465581">1</xref></sup> Therefore, the postagreement period has seen a struggle to establish an effective police force that will be seen as legitimate by both communities. The creation of civilian control and consultation mechanisms has played a critical role in the establishment of police legitimacy. Using interviews with key participants in this process, this article explores the processes by which citizen support and legitimacy has been sought and assesses the success of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in achieving it.</p>

<sec id="section2-1078087412465581">
<title>Legitimacy</title>
<p>When applied to governmental authority, the term <italic>legitimacy</italic> means that decisions come from a legally constituted authority that the citizen accepts as having the right to make and to enforce such decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078087412465581">Almond et al. 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1078087412465581">Tyler (1990)</xref> critiqued the idea that compliance with government directives flows strictly from fear of punishment or self-interest and argues for a distinct moral value attached by citizens to obeying legitimate authority. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1078087412465581">McEwen and Maiman (1986)</xref> made a similar argument. Accepting governmental authority as legitimate is, of course, not the same as agreeing with those decisions. Citizens often reluctantly accept decisions that are at odds with their values and expectations, as long as they view the authority that issued those decisions as legitimate. In addition, acceptance of governmental decisions as legitimate does not automatically assure compliance. Citizens may evade or defy governmental authority in specific instances, even as they accept that authority on a deeper level.</p>
<p>However, there often comes a point at which citizens’ disagreement and defiance reaches a level that undermines their fundamental acceptance of governmental authority. The gap between the actions of government and the citizens’ fundamental values and expectations becomes too wide to permit acceptance of its actions. Rejection and resistance are no longer directed at the decisions of a particular leader or regime but at the very authority of the state itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078087412465581">Easton 1965</xref>). At this point, the government has lost legitimacy, and it will encounter great difficulty in enforcing its decisions upon such a restive population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1078087412465581">
<title>Sources of Legitimacy</title>
<p>In modern representative governments, the decisions of public officials historically derive their legitimacy from two important sources: their implementation of democratically mandated services and their professionalism in the delivery of those services. It was a hallmark of the emergence of modernity in Western Europe in the seventeenth century that the basis of legitimacy shifted from the divine right of kings to the notion of the consent of the governed. As democratic institutions spread, the will of the government was increasingly identified as the collective will of the people. Of course, given the unequal distribution of resources among citizens, the reality of popular government always falls short of the ideal. Nevertheless, the notion that, in obeying the laws, the citizen is obeying an expression of the collective will of the people that he or she can have a part in formulating has been critical to the legitimacy of democratic regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078087412465581">Easton 1965</xref>).</p>
<p>For urban governments, the establishment of democratic legitimacy is complicated by their status as subnational units of government. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078087412465581">Caraley (1977)</xref>, urban leaders seek legitimacy through both substantive outputs and symbolic actions that recognize and include important groups within the urban community. However, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1078087412465581">Shannon, Kleniewski, and Cross (1997)</xref>, these governments’ ability to deliver substantive outputs is limited by the fact that their authority is generally subordinated to that of state and national governments. These larger units often impose resource constraints on local governments, and localities must often implement policies enacted by state and national governments. Nevertheless, they endure the direct heat of citizen discontent if these policies are poorly designed. Thus, the legitimacy of local officials may be undermined by laws that they had little hand in creating.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1078087412465581">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>As the scale and complexity of government increased during the nineteenth century, public authority came increasingly to be exercised by trained professionals. These individuals, first of all, claim legitimacy that is derived from the decisions of elected leaders to authorize and fund their activities. However, civil servants also claim legitimacy from a second source, their professional expertise. Their decisions as to how to administer the laws are to be respected because of their professional training and their exercise of professional judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1078087412465581">Mosher 1982</xref>). Citizens are often frustrated when these professionals resist popular demands, but, on a deeper level, there is an acceptance of the need for governments to be managed professionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078087412465581">Goodsell 1985</xref>). In addition, the impartiality attributed to decisions made by professionals has been viewed as a way to restore legitimacy in situations where popular government has been infected with favoritism and corruption. Such was the case with the urban reform movement that emerged in the United States around the turn of the twentieth century. Professionalism in government was advocated as a legitimate alternative to the massive corruption of the political machines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1078087412465581">Judd and Swanstrom 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Both democratic legitimacy and professional legitimacy are linked to the notion of procedural legitimacy articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1078087412465581">Tyler (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1078087412465581">Sunshine and Tyler (2003)</xref>. His research has established that people are more likely to accept the legitimacy of a decision if they view the procedures by which it was arrived at as fair, even when the decision goes against their immediate self-interest. Decisions made through democratic procedures and implemented using professional procedures are more likely to be perceived as procedurally correct and fair.</p>
<p>During the last 30 years, a third source for the legitimacy of the decisions of public officials has received a great deal of emphasis. This is the responsiveness of public officials to citizen needs and concerns during the day-to-day process of implementing the laws. For many citizens, their input into the democratic process through elections seems quite distant from the actions of public officials that directly affect their lives. They may feel powerless to affect these large-scale results, and they have a difficult time tracing the impact of policy decisions down to the daily exercise of public authority. Therefore, from the 1990s on, there have been numerous efforts to make policy implementation more directly responsive to citizens as <italic>consumers</italic> of public services. In the United States, the “Reinventing Government” report issued during the Clinton administration by a task force led by Vice President Al Gore argued that public agencies needed to view their clients in the same way that private firms view their customers—as persons whose needs they are there to serve. This notion of legitimizing the actions of public officials through responsiveness at the implementation stage is now viewed as an important supplement to other forms of legitimacy. As units that directly deliver a range of services, urban governments have a particular stake in establishing legitimacy at this level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078087412465581">Caraley 1977</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1078087412465581">
<title>Legitimacy and Social Inequality</title>
<p>The flow of legitimate authority from an elected government to professional civil servants to the citizenry can be seriously compromised when a minority within the population is subjected to the discriminatory and exclusionary application of laws. This group may be viewed by the majority group as separate and inferior human beings, who do not deserve the same rights as the majority. These views may flow from racial, ethnic, religious, or cultural differences, or some combination of these factors. Majority prejudices will be reflected in the laws created by an elected government, and they will also be present in the attitudes of the professionals who administer the laws, if, as is frequently the case, those officials are drawn from the majority group. In this situation, the authority of the government ceases to be fully legitimate to members of the minority group, and they may respond to this authority with evasion or defiance. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078087412465581">Andrew Goldsmith (2005)</xref> expressed it, the subordinate group develops a shared narrative, reinforced by personal stories and experiences, which views instruments of governmental authority as indifferent or hostile forces within their community.</p>
<p>The initial response of the majority group to minority resistance may be harsher enforcement of discriminatory laws. However, continued agitation by the minority group, supported by members of the majority who believe in the injustice of current arrangements, may eventually force the government to respond to the demands of the minority for inclusion and equal treatment. This is essentially what happened in the case of the American civil rights movement. African-Americans had good reason to fear and loathe the White power structure that oppressed them, and yet the movement did not challenge the basic authority of the government to govern, but, instead, demanded fairer treatment from that authority. The ongoing struggle for racial justice in the United States occurs within a decision-making structure that is, albeit reluctantly at times, accepted by minorities as a legitimate one within which to operate.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Catholic civil rights movement of the late-1960s in Northern Ireland took a different turn. Initially, this movement consciously imitated the values and tactics of the American civil rights movement, and it focused its demands on obtaining fairer treatment within the Northern Ireland polity. Under the Protestant-dominated regime that had existed in Northern Ireland since 1922, Catholics had been subjected to discrimination in housing, employment, and many other areas, and they were effectively excluded from political power through gerrymandering and other tactics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078087412465581">Hennessey 1997</xref>). These grievances were the focus of early demonstrations. However, the movement soon tapped into deep feelings and memories concerning the lack of legitimacy of the Northern Ireland polity. Many Catholics had never accepted the partition of Ireland that occurred in the 1920s (see below), and they believed that the Protestant-controlled government would never grant them equal rights. They were confirmed in this view by the repressive measures that the government took against peaceful demonstrators in the late-1960s. Therefore, even though many Catholics still desired peaceful change, leadership of the movement shifted to an armed group, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), that wanted to overthrow British authority and reunite the province with the Republic of Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078087412465581">Hennessey 1997</xref>). Because of this fundamental disagreement over the legitimacy of the governing authority in Northern Ireland, the struggle, since the Good Friday Peace Agreement in 1998, to establish a mode of governance that is acceptable to both sides of the conflict has been an especially difficult one.</p>

<sec id="section5-1078087412465581">
<title>The Search for Police Legitimacy</title>
<p>Police often find themselves at the center of conflicts over legitimacy. Criminal justice is an arena in which citizens encounter governmental authority within their local communities immediately and forcefully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078087412465581">Fyfe 2001</xref>). Therefore, if the police do not establish legitimacy in the eyes of those who are subject to their authority, they will encounter both passive resistance and open defiance as they seek to enforce the laws. Moreover, the abuse of authority by the police can undermine citizens’ belief in the legitimacy of the entire government. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078087412465581">Goldsmith (2005)</xref> characterized citizen trust in the police as difficult to gain but easy to lose.</p>
<p>In his excellent analysis of the development of modern policing in the United Kingdom, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1078087412465581">Robert Reiner (2000)</xref> argued that modernizing police forces sought to draw legitimacy both from their professionalism and from their responsiveness to citizens. Prior to the movement toward professionalization, police derived authority from a representative government, but such nominally democratic control had often been compromised by favoritism and corruption (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1078087412465581">Walker 2001</xref>). In creating a professional police force in the United Kingdom, Sir Robert Peel and other reformers sought to separate policing from such political influences to make it more effective and legitimate. Their ideal was a force of highly trained, professional officers who would earn the respect of law-abiding citizens and who would, therefore, be able to count on a partnership with these citizens as they sought to exercise control of those who would disrupt public safety (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412465581">Brogden 1982</xref> on police professionalization). These nineteenth century reformers were, thus, relying to some degree on the source of legitimacy—responsive, street-level implementation—that would become prominent in the late-twentieth century.</p>
<p>Of course, social inequality is a serious obstacle to the creation of a police force that is seen as legitimate by all citizens. This was a major problem with the reformers’ model of policing, which Reiner refers to as the “conventional” model. Even in democratic societies, the impact of policing is rarely equitable across differing social groups. The disproportionate influence of privileged groups over public policy ensures that policing serves the function of social control over the less privileged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412465581">Brogden 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1078087412465581">Manning 1977</xref>). According to “revisionist” critics (again, Reiner’s terminology) of the conventional model, police cannot form true partnerships with members of disadvantaged communities, because the intent of policing is not to benefit these communities but to control behavior that might threaten the security and property of higher-status groups. Whereas Reiner focuses mainly on class inequality in his analysis, this same revisionist argument could be extended to police relationships with racial, ethnic, or religious minorities. In many societies, the police have been used by the majority group to reinforce their privileged status through selective enforcement of the laws, so that police harassment becomes a potent symbol of oppression to the minority.</p>
<p>Therefore, demands for the fair and equal protection of the laws by minority groups frequently focus on police behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1078087412465581">Weitzer and Tuch 2006</xref>). In the United States during the 1960s and 1970s, one response to this erosion of legitimacy in many communities was to advocate more direct, citizen control over policing through “citizen review boards.” These entities receive citizen complaints about police behavior that they consider unfair or that they believe involved the excessive use of force. Efforts to establish such boards encountered strong resistance. Majority groups saw them as attempts by minorities to “shackle” the police in dealing with minority crime. The police closed ranks against them and often had enough political clout to stop them. Nevertheless, dozens of American communities established citizen review boards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078087412465581">Bobb 2003</xref>). In the atmosphere of deep sectarian distrust that pervaded Northern Ireland, this idea of making the police accountable to civilian oversight would become very influential.</p>
<p>Looked at in terms of the three mechanisms of legitimacy just described, the movement to establish citizen review boards represents, in one sense, a strengthening of popular democratic control. In addition to their accountability to elected representatives, police are being held accountable to another citizen oversight mechanism that has the legal authority to challenge their decisions. However, in another sense, it represents the third type of legitimacy—intervention in street-level decisions of civil servants to make them more responsive. It reflects a lack of confidence that the professionalism of police will lead to fair and competent law enforcement without additional sanctions for improper behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078087412465581">Goldsmith 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The limitation of this method is that it is only triggered by specific complaints and involves an adversary relationship between the police and those responding to the complaint. Community policing arose as a more comprehensive approach to police–community relations that emphasized ongoing cooperation between police and citizens to resolve potential problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1078087412465581">Skogan 2004</xref>). This new model was more acceptable to police departments and also offered citizens an opportunity to influence police strategies as they were being carried out. However, to understand why community policing became so widely adopted, one must not only to look at general issues of legitimacy but also at changes in police strategy and administration that occurred during the twentieth century.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1078087412465581">
<title>Legitimacy and Policing Strategies</title>
<p>As professional police forces developed, their activities were greatly influenced by the increasing size and spread of cities, coupled with the development of radio technology and automobile transportation. Larger cities required larger police forces, and, to maintain control, police management moved increasingly toward hierarchical command structures modeled after the military. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078087412465581">Fyfe (2001)</xref> argued that policing has always been affected by a tension between the desire of officers on the street to maintain their autonomy and the desire of their superiors to regulate officers’ behavior with greater precision (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1078087412465581">Manning 1977</xref>). The military structure was seen by superiors as a more effective way to exert such control. The advent of radios enabled superiors to demand constant check-ins by officers and it also enabled them to deploy officers according to their priorities, rather than allowing officers on the beat to determine their own priorities. The advent of automobile patrols enabled superiors to move police quickly around the community in response to their enforcement priorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1078087412465581">Walker 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>This trend in professionalization and bureaucratization led police forces to increasingly adopt a “call-for-service” model. In this model, it is the job of police to respond as rapidly as possible to citizen calls for service. If these calls involve criminal activity, then the police are most often arriving <italic>after</italic> a crime has been committed, and they focus on quick apprehension of the perpetrator. Police success is measured in terms of the rapidity of responses and the rates of case closure. The underlying presumption is that successful apprehension of offenders will enhance public safety by deterring future offenders.</p>
<p>In the late-twentieth century, this model of policing came under increasing criticism, as it was recognized that public order maintenance, while certainly requiring the apprehension of offenders, also involves the <italic>prevention</italic> of criminal activity. It further involves police concern with seemingly minor offenses that disrupt public order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1078087412465581">Wilson and Kelling 2001</xref>). Finally, public order maintenance involves <italic>close cooperation</italic> between private citizens and the police. As the police cannot be everywhere, citizen surveillance and informal social controls are as essential to public order as is policing. In short, public safety came to be seen as coproduced by both citizens and police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1078087412465581">Shearing and Johnston 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The movement toward community policing involved a reemphasis on the public order model of policing and on the need for close citizen/police interaction and cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078087412465581">Greene and Pelfry 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078087412465581">Lyons 1999</xref>). Rather than waiting for citizens to call after an incident, police were to become familiar with the communities that they served and to work with citizens to develop safety strategies to address situations that might promote criminal activity. The emphasis would be on <italic>preventing</italic> crimes. This process was seen as particularly vital in restoring trust and cooperation with the police in disadvantaged minority communities, because it would humanize the police and make them seem less like an occupying army. This approach also fit the model of governmental responsiveness to citizens at the implementation level described above.</p>
<p>This was an uncomfortable shift for police officers trained in the call-for-service model. They had honed their skills in dealing with crimes and their aftermath, but they were now expected to acquire new skills in community relations and crime prevention. Many departments created special community policing units, so that the officers involved would have the proper orientation and training. However, this created a rift between the regular patrol officers and the community policing officers. The latter were often viewed as not engaged in “real” police work, and they were labeled “social workers” (a term of opprobrium in police lingo). Thus, there was tension between the activities of regular police patrols and the efforts of community policing units to engage the citizens in crime prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1078087412465581">Wood, Davis, and Rouse 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, community policing puts the police in direct contact with the deep social and economic problems that are the roots of criminal behavior, without necessarily giving them the skills and resources to address these problems. One factor fueling the criticism of call-for-service policing was research showing that decreasing response times and increasing arrests did not reduce crime in urban neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078087412465581">Brogden and Nijhar 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1078087412465581">National Research Council 2004</xref>). The preventive model was supposed to achieve better results, but, while it succeeded in increasing citizens’ perceptions of safety, it, too, often had little impact on crime rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078087412465581">Greene and Pelfry 2001</xref>). Factors such as poverty, unemployment, and family crises fuel criminal behavior, in spite of police and community efforts. Therefore, the police and the community may share frustration and discouragement at the endemic nature of these problems.</p>

<title>Research Design</title>
<p>Research conducted while the author was a visiting scholar at Queen’s University in Belfast, Northern Ireland forms the basis for this article. The research consisted of in-depth, qualitative interviews with a cross section of active participants in community affairs in Belfast, and of a systematic analysis of print media serving Belfast.</p>
<sec id="section9-1078087412465581">
<title>Interviews</title>
<p>The first round of interviews was conducted between September 2007 and March 2008. In total, 75 engaged citizens from a variety of backgrounds were interviewed. An “engaged citizen” is defined as a person who is an active participant in either a public organization, a nonprofit (voluntary sector) service organization, or a neighborhood association. Prior to the interviews, several categories of informants were identified, based on a review of the literature on Northern Ireland. Within the public sector, both civil servants and elected officials were interviewed. Within the voluntary sector, representatives of two types of organizations were targeted: organizations with the explicit purpose of conflict resolution and organizations serving other community needs that would regularly encounter issues of sectarianism. Neighborhood leaders were a fifth category that was intensively targeted. The leaders selected were typically in positions of respect/authority in a formal neighborhood organization, but they came from a variety of backgrounds, including some who had, during the Troubles, been engaged in paramilitary activities. In addition, more limited numbers of interviews with business leaders, religious leaders, and engaged scholars were sought out. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078087412465581">Table 1</xref> provides a detailed breakdown of the types of persons interviewed in 2007 and 2008. Interviews were open ended, with the goal of soliciting participants’ views as to the current and emerging issues affecting Northern Ireland. Each interview began with questions concerning the activities of the organization represented by the respondent. From this discussion, the issues that the subject believed were most important for the future of Northern Ireland would typically emerge spontaneously or, if not, would be solicited by the interviewer. Sectarian issues were approached carefully to avoid triggering defensiveness on the part of the subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1078087412465581">3</xref></sup></p>

<p>During this first round, policing was identified as a critical issue by many respondents, which led to the present study’s focus on policing. In 2010, the author conducted 26 additional interviews to update the information gathered in 2007-2008. These interviews were focused on policing. Subjects were chosen to provide a variety of perspectives. As in the earlier interviews, an effort was made to balance interviews between the unionist and nationalist communities. Interviewees included representatives of the PSNI at several levels of authority and in several different functional units, members of civilian oversight bodies, and neighborhood leaders involved with policing in a variety of formal and informal ways, including, for example, neighborhood advocacy groups, Neighborhood Watch groups, and neighborhood services offices. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078087412465581">Table 1</xref> provides a detailed breakdown of the 2010 interviewees by category.</p>

<title>Newspaper Analysis</title>
<p>A representative sample of 1,556 newspaper reports on local and national issues between 2007 and 2010 was collected. The city of Belfast is served by several newspapers, which, collectively, provide reasonably thorough coverage of local and national issues from a variety of perspectives. Daily papers were examined once or twice a week, whereas weekly papers were examined each time they came out. The purpose of this analysis was not a comprehensive content analysis of newspapers, nor were the newspaper articles regarded as objective sources of information. Rather, these articles provide an overview of the public debate that helps place the interviews in a broader context. The following newspapers were examined:</p>

<title>History and Development of the PSNI</title>
<p>A brief historical overview of policing in Northern Ireland is necessary to provide a context for the subsequent discussion. The final, and ultimately successful, struggle for Irish independence from the United Kingdom occurred between 1916 and 1921. A well-organized guerrilla insurgency eventually brought the British to the bargaining table to negotiate the terms of Irish independence. The Irish Free State was created, which, while still formally subordinate to the British Crown, provided de facto independence. (The Irish Free State would later declare itself the Republic of Ireland.) However, the historical province of Ulster contained large numbers of Protestants who were bitterly opposed to independence, because they feared becoming a beleaguered minority in a largely Catholic state. Therefore, as part of the treaty that ended the insurgency, the province of Northern Ireland was created in 1922, through the partitioning of the six counties with the largest Protestant populations out of the newly formed Irish Free State. (Historically, Ulster contained nine counties but three with larger Catholic populations were not included in the partition.) These six counties remained under British control, and, even though the counties included were selected with the purpose of ensuring a large Protestant majority, a significant Catholic minority resided within Northern Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078087412465581">Hennessey 1997</xref>). The Protestant majority soon seized political control of the province and, as mentioned above, engaged in a wide range of discriminatory practices against the Catholic minority.</p>
<p>After the partition, there were initial attempts to create a representative police force. In 1922, a committee recommended proportional representation of both Catholics and Protestants in the police force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1078087412465581">Mulcahy 2006</xref>). However, as unionists assumed total control over the political apparatus, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) became an overwhelmingly Protestant force. Regardless of the behavior of the police, Catholics would have been disinclined to see the Northern Ireland state as legitimate. However, their perception that police actions were biased toward Protestants deepened their alienation from the government of Northern Ireland. For them, the police were one more aspect of a political system that was rigged to keep them in a subordinate position.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1078087412465581">Chris Ryder’s (2004)</xref> history of the relationship between the police and the Catholic/nationalist community chronicled, the RUC was overwhelmed as sectarian violence escalated during the early-1970s. They lacked the numbers, the training, or the legitimacy to respond to massive social unrest. Catholic neighborhoods became “no go” areas for the police, where social control was exercised by paramilitary groups or citizens acting on their own. The British government was initially reluctant for the British Army to become involved, but eventually, they came to believe that they had no choice. In the early-1970s, Army units assumed the main responsibility for maintaining order, with the RUC acting in an auxiliary role.</p>
<p>The relationship between the authorities and the Catholic community was further strained by two other factors. First, the British government went beyond normal investigative and judicial procedures in countering the terrorist tactics of the Provisional IRA, the group which had taken the lead in the armed struggle. They instituted mass internment without trial of Catholic citizens suspected of IRA ties. They also used extralegal tactics to infiltrate the IRA, and, later in the conflict, the British were accused of instituting a “shoot-to-kill” policy when known terrorists were encountered. The British government believed that the highly organized and secretive violence of the IRA justified extraordinary measures. However, tactics outside the “rule of law” that violated citizen rights to a fair trial further alienated the Catholic minority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078087412465581">Hennessey 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The second factor that strained the relationship was the Catholic perception that the RUC and the Army did not act in an evenhanded way toward Catholic and Protestant violence. As the Troubles continued, many young Protestant men joined loyalist paramilitary groups, which engaged in numerous acts of violence against the Catholic/nationalist community. Even though loyalist paramilitaries were arrested and jailed along with Republicans, there was still a strong Catholic perception that Republicans were disproportionately targeted. Such a perception was reinforced by allegations of collusion between the police and the loyalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078087412465581">Cory 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>As the peace process gathered momentum in the mid-1990s, policing became a major source of contention. Unionists saw the RUC as a bulwark of security against Republican violence, and their rhetoric dwelt upon the tremendous sacrifices of the police during the Troubles (302 officers lost their lives and approximately 9,000 were injured—see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1078087412465581">Mulcahy 2006</xref>). They argued that changes to the RUC would imply that the police had been in the wrong and thus would disgrace the memory of officers who had died. Nationalists, however, demanded radical changes in the police force as a condition for peace. They wanted the old, Protestant-dominated RUC to be rebuilt into a new, nonsectarian force. In agreeing to maintain the RUC in modified form, both sides viewed themselves as having made huge concessions: the unionists by agreeing to any change at all and the nationalists by agreeing to any continuity at all.</p>
<p>The 1998 Good Friday peace agreement did not spell out the precise nature of a new police force. Rather, it called for the creation of an Independent Review Commission to make recommendations concerning policing. The report produced by this commission, named the “Patten Report” after the commission’s leader, laid out the basis for a new social contract between the police and the community. The following recommendations were central:</p>
<list id="list3-1078087412465581" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The name of the force would no longer be the Royal Ulster Constabulary. This renaming was considered essential by nationalists, but a big concession by unionists. Eventually, a new name was settled upon—the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The force would have to include a higher proportion of Catholics.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The police would be held more accountable to the public through the creation of a Policing Board made up of citizens and a Police Ombudsman to investigate citizen complaints.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The police would undertake community policing strategies similar to those that had gained much support in the United States and in the rest of the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078087412465581">Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland 1999</xref>).</p></list-item></list>
<p>Even though <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078087412465581">Brogden and Nijhar (2005)</xref>, writing early in the implementation process, argued that the Patten recommendations were seriously watered down by the subsequent implementing legislation, a longer-term perspective suggests that the ultimate result was a profound transformation of policing in Northern Ireland.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1078087412465581">
<title>Police Culture and Values</title>
<p>The Patten Report stated unequivocally that the composition and culture of the police force would have to change for it to acquire legitimacy among nationalists. Therefore, the transformation of the RUC into the PSNI involved selective recruiting of Catholics. In the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078087412465581">Dr. Maurice Hayes (2009)</xref>, one of the Commission members, “Without their participation, a new body could not be representative, and as such would fail the test of acceptability.” Police legislation established a strict requirement that 50% of all new police recruits must come from the Catholic community. As a result, the percentage of Catholic officers more than doubled between 2002 and 2005, from 8.9% to 18.2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1078087412465581">Mulcahy 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Some news reports in 2007 and 2008 declared the recruitment program a success, with the Belfast <italic>Telegraph</italic> reporting that a record high of 44% of those applying were Catholics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1078087412465581">Thornton 2007</xref>). However, there were ongoing concerns about Catholic recruitment and participation. In November 2007, two Catholic police officers were wounded while off duty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1078087412465581">McKinney 2007</xref>). These attacks were widely attributed to dissident Republican groups. Unionists expressed concern that these attacks would deter Catholic recruitment, and a columnist in the nationalist <italic>Irish News</italic> denounced the response of the PSNI and the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to the shootings as “shamefully inadequate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078087412465581">Feeney 2007</xref>). These concerns reflect a theme that will be discussed more fully below; namely, that although violent loyalist and Republican elements are definitely on the fringes of both communities, their activities still carry the potential to disrupt and destabilize political reconciliation.</p>
<p>In addition to successful efforts to change the composition of the police force, the transformation of the police has involved extensive training in community relations. According to one 2007 respondent from a mediation service involved in these efforts, both new recruits and senior officers had to undergo training, because unless senior officers transform their own beliefs and behaviors, the effects of training on recruits will be quickly dissipated by the established police culture. In this respondent’s words,
<disp-quote>
<p>In the beginning, we trained only new recruits but we found that ineffective because it started with the weakest link in the organization. Our staff began to see this training as “sprinkling shamrock dust.” We went to the top and challenged them to engage, which they did. They developed Future Ways, an internal forum for senior officers. We also trained the police Ombudsman staff.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The police officials interviewed in 2010 continued to stress the importance of recruitment and training in changing the culture of the PSNI. According to one training officer, both the initial training of recruits and the in-service training of officers involves the development of skills in relating to citizens in both the nationalist and the unionist communities. In the words of a retired officer, “The police are moving away from being a paramilitary reactive force. Before they had little training and were out of sync with the political situation.” In addition, there has been a significant generational change within the police, as older officers have been encouraged to retire with generous severance packages. Nevertheless, memories of the conflict remain strong. Even the above-mentioned training officer, who is clearly an advocate for progressive policing, recalled vividly his frightening patrol experiences during the Troubles. This history of conflict can subtly undermine the commitment of the police to change their values and approach, especially as the ongoing activities of fringe groups create genuine new threats for officers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1078087412465581">
<title>Police Governance</title>
<p>The Patten Report espoused the principle of direct and active civilian involvement in police administration. The semiautonomous administrative structure enjoyed by the police in some other developed democracies clearly would not work to establish legitimacy in Northern Ireland. In addition to changing the name, emblems, and uniforms of the police, the Police (Northern Ireland) Act of 2000 created the Northern Ireland Policing Board, along with an Ombudsman to handle complaints against police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1078087412465581">Mulcahy 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1078087412465581">Northern Ireland Policing Board 2006</xref>). This Board includes political leaders and other community representatives from both the unionist and the nationalist communities. The breadth of oversight is reflected in a 2008 review of Policing Board responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1078087412465581">Northern Ireland Policing Board 2008</xref>). They include oversight of recruitment, addressing gender imbalance, monitoring PSNI absences, monitoring the severance plan for regular and reserve officers, recruitment of Police Community Support Officers, the training of officers, and upgrades to stations to make them more accessible to citizens. (Police stations in Northern Ireland had become fortresses during the Troubles.)</p>
<p>In 2003, this province-wide Policing Board was supplemented by the creation of District Policing Partnerships (DPPs), with responsibility for overseeing police–community relationships in each of the 26 districts that are the formal units of local government in Northern Ireland.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1078087412465581">5</xref></sup> The DPP boards consist of both nationalist and unionist representatives, including elected members of the District Council. The purpose of the DPP is to listen to citizen concerns and to require the police to respond. It is also to foster joint public safety planning between citizens and the police. Finally, the inclusion of District Council members gave local government officials more direct involvement in policing, even though it is a provincial government function, rather than a local government function in Northern Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078087412465581">DSPs 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>During the first few years after their creation, participation in the Policing Board and the DPPs was blocked by sectarian conflict. Many unionists were strongly opposed to participation by Sinn Fein (the largest nationalist party) in policing decisions because they viewed it as a violent, lawless organization. However, more moderate unionists agreed to sit on the Policing Board once it was established. In contrast, nationalist parties refused to take their seats, arguing that the legislation creating them was a watered down version of Patten that did not truly reform the RUC. They expressed a general lack of faith that the police had really changed their values and behavior. One Sinn Fein leader described the PSNI as a “tarted up version of the RUC” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1078087412465581">Mulcahy 2006</xref>). Legislation enacted in 2003 strengthened the oversight provisions of the law. This was sufficient to persuade representatives of the moderate, nationalist Social Democratic Labor Party (SDLP) to take their seats, but Sinn Fein still refused to be a part of either the Policing Board or the DPPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1078087412465581">Mulcahy 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the next five years, nationalist opposition softened, as leaders realized that they would lose influence if they did not participate. In addition, the overall political situation in Northern Ireland was stabilizing. In January 2007, Sinn Fein agreed to appoint representatives to the DPPs, a move that a police officer who was interviewed described as “a huge step.” This decision attracted significant coverage by the print media in 2007 and 2008. These included articles dealing with direct participation in governance as well as various statements by politicians representing both communities. A number dealt with the “historic” decision of Sinn Fein members to join the DPPs. Conor Maskey, a Sinn Fein representative, was quoted as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>DPPs are an important accountability mechanism within the overall structure of policing. Sinn Fein representatives will be approaching all those mechanisms with a view to maximizing the potential for transparency and also try to influence policing plans in a way that best reflects the needs of core communities we represent. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1078087412465581"><italic>North Belfast News</italic> 2007</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This statement is a strong endorsement of the legitimacy of the process. In a statement quoted in the <italic>Irish News</italic> in 2007, Sinn Fein Leader Gerry Adams backed up their participation with a general statement of support for the PSNI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087412465581">Graham 2007</xref>). However, some nationalists were still unwilling to support Sinn Fein’s move. Later in 2007, the <italic>Andersonstown News</italic> reported that republican protesters had disrupted a policing meeting in the Markets area of Belfast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078087412465581">Barnes and McManus 2007</xref>). A woman described as a “PSNI critic and veteran Republican” stated to the reporter, “Talk of protests doesn’t surprise me, because nothing has changed with the PSNI. They are still the RUC.” The response of Belfast DPP Chairman and Sinn Fein Councilor, Michael Browne, again reflects the party’s endorsement of the process:
<disp-quote>
<p>What I would encourage protesters to do is, instead of just standing outside with their placards, tell us what you believe the alternative to be. Should we abandon West Belfast to criminals or do we attempt to use the structures in place to improve things? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078087412465581">Barnes and McManus 2007</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In spite of such high-level endorsements, there remained, along with overt expressions of protest such as the one just described, considerable public ignorance about the DPPs and skepticism about their efficacy. Public opinion polls conducted for the PSNI from 2007 to 2009 show that a stable and significant percentage of respondents (ranging from 38% to 40%) were not even aware of the existence of a DPP in their area. However, of those that were aware, approximately 80% had at least some confidence in the efficacy of those boards. Interestingly enough, there was almost no difference between Protestant and Catholic respondents in their assessment of their DPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1078087412465581">Northern Ireland Policing Board 2009</xref>). Of course, any mechanism of citizen participation is subject to a certain amount of ignorance and indifference. Nevertheless, the lack of knowledge reported in these polls suggested that many citizens had not made a connection with the entities set up to reflect their concerns.</p>
<p>By 2010, both interviews and the media coverage reflected the fact that multiparty participation in policing institutions had become an accepted fact. Attention had turned, instead to the effectiveness of these institutions in shaping police behavior and in responding to citizen concerns. According to the 2008-2011 Corporate Plan of the Northern Ireland Policing Board (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nipolicingboard.org.uk">www.nipolicingboard.org.uk</ext-link>), the mission of the Policing Board is “to secure the delivery of an effective, efficient, and impartial policing service for the entire community of Northern Ireland.” Clearly, this statement is aimed at creating police legitimacy at all three levels—citizen oversight, professionalism, and responsiveness to the community. The Board appoints the chief constable, who is the chief executive officer for the PSNI. The chief constable must set objectives for the PSNI that are compatible with the Corporate Plan of the Board, and he or she must submit regular reports to the Policing Board concerning the accomplishment of those objectives.</p>
<p>In addition, the Policing Board oversees the operation of the DPPs. A staff member of the Policing Board described this function as follows in a 2010 interview:
<disp-quote>
<p>The Policing Board has 10 political members [party representatives], while 9 are appointed. They oversee the District Policing Partnerships. The DPPs are funded 75% by the Policing Board, 25% by the Council. Their monitoring framework consists of 5 goals: 1. Consult with the community to identify priorities. 2. Develop a local policing plan. 3. Negotiate with the local community. 4. Engage the community and gain their cooperation. 5. Monitor police performance. Each DPP must hold six community forums each year—the Policing Board monitors this. They also monitor equality issues. The DPPs identify issues to be brought to the Policing Board.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the seeming responsiveness of the structure just described, citizen concerns about both the Policing Board and the DPPs now center on the perceived distance between the activities of these entities and the day-to-day concerns of ordinary citizens. A nationalist community representative raised concerns about both the representativeness of the DPP process and the functioning of police within it:
<disp-quote>
<p>DPP meetings are a complaining forum. They are often a waste of time. Police must respond to all questions raised but they sometimes do so in ways that are not helpful—they appear to be stonewalling. Only community activists attend these meetings.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another respondent who was critical of the DPP process complained that the presence of elected officials on the boards led to political posturing, rather than genuine attentiveness to citizen concerns. However, DPP members who were interviewed expressed frustration at the difficulty of getting citizens motivated to participate. One commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s hard to get people involved in the DPP. People are lethargic about issues and won’t engage. You could name in advance who will show up to the meetings. Ordinary citizens could get DPP action if they were to seek it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This dynamic of citizen complaints about unresponsiveness coupled with leadership complaints about citizen apathy is characteristic of local government entities that try to address citizen concerns in many democracies. Effective citizen engagement beyond a few activists is very difficult to sustain, regardless of the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1078087412465581">Murphy and Cunningham 2003</xref>). However, the combined impact of the Policing Board and the DPPs is to institutionalize police accountability to citizen bodies. The contrast with the American experience is striking, where citizen oversight has been strongly resisted by many police departments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078087412465581">Bobb 2003</xref>). In Northern Ireland, the compelling need for the police to establish a new basis for legitimacy led to acceptance of such oversight.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1078087412465581">
<title>Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs)</title>
<p>At the same time that the Policing Board and DPPs were being established, a parallel structure was set up to address public safety concerns. This consists of the CSPs, which, since devolution (to be discussed below), are under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Justice for Northern Ireland. According to one former loyalist paramilitary member who was interviewed, one impetus for these partnerships was the desire to engage former combatants in constructive efforts to enhance public safety. During the Troubles, paramilitaries often exerted an informal policing function in their respective communities. In the absence of an effective police presence, they were called upon to settle disputes and to punish ordinary criminals. A number of respondents from all backgrounds noted that, throughout the peace process, former paramilitaries who have become committed to peace have fulfilled an important leadership role in lowering the level of conflict. In the eyes of many working class citizens, these individuals have earned credibility through their sacrifices in the conflict. Therefore, when they speak in favor of peace and reconciliation, they are listened to.</p>
<p>CSPs have been given significant funding to carry out projects that enhance public safety. According to one local government official who was interviewed, the CSP focuses on engagement on the ground by different agencies. This includes joint involvement in parading issues, in enforcement of alcohol laws and education efforts such as “Get Home Safely.” Thus, the CSPs are distinct from DPPs in that they are not as exclusively focused on police oversight but rather on community safety as a whole. However, there is inevitable overlap between their activities, and they compete for citizen involvement and loyalty. Some of the citizen respondents in both communities expressed more confidence in the CSPs than in the DPPs, because they viewed them as more integrated into the community and less prone to the formal posturing that they saw in DPP meetings. In contrast, respondents who were heavily involved in DPPs expressed resentment that the CSPs were often better funded than DPPs.</p>
<p>Given that citizen energy is a scarce commodity, a strong argument has been made for combining the CSPs and the DPPs. Several 2010 respondents expressed support for this move. A government committee was appointed to explore this option and they recommended a blended structure that would encompass the activities of both. However, the Committee for the Administration of Justice (CAJ), a nonprofit advocacy group involved in policing issues, issued a statement expressing serious reservations about combining them. Their concern is that the direct police oversight duties of the DPPs will become diluted and de-emphasized in an entity that also has broader community engagement functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078087412465581">CAJ 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This debate over the roles of the DPPs and the CSPs clearly illustrates the dilemmas of police governance and engagement. Maintaining a safe community involves a range of educational and social interventions that extend well beyond traditional law enforcement. If the police are not involved in this larger effort, then law enforcement may be compromised by lack of community knowledge and trust. At the same time, it may be tempting for the police to spend time on noncontroversial community education efforts (e.g., educating elderly people on placing more secure locks on their doors) without directly addressing the actions of police patrols that enhance or detract from citizen confidence. An argument could be made that police oversight, while cognizant of larger community issues, should be just that—the monitoring of activities unique to the police.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1078087412465581">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Devolution</title>
<p>The escalation of the Troubles during the late-1960s and early-1970s led to the increasing ineffectiveness of the provincial government, the Northern Ireland Parliament. Therefore, in 1972, the British government instituted direct rule of Northern Ireland from London. (The government in London is generally referred to as “Westminster” by British sources.) The 1998 Good Friday Agreement established a new Northern Ireland Assembly based on power sharing between unionists and nationalists. However, between 1998 and 2007, the Assembly functioned for only a few months, because of bitter wrangling between the two sides. It took the signing of an additional agreement at St. Andrews, Scotland, in 2006 to establish the conditions for a functional Assembly. The first Assembly elected under the new agreement took office in May 2007, and it has continued to function ever since.</p>
<p>All provincial governing functions were turned over to the Northern Ireland Assembly and its cabinet, the Northern Ireland Executive (NIE) <italic>except</italic> for policing and criminal justice. The controversy over the devolution of this final area of authority from 2007 to 2010 reflected the intense passions that these issues raise in Northern Ireland. Much of the resistance of unionist political leaders came from their reluctance to give Sinn Fein more power. According to one loyalist activist, “The DUP [the largest unionist party] played on fears that Sinn Fein would take charge of policing.” While nationalists demanded devolution, unionists kept saying that the province was “not ready” for it. In the fall of 2008, the debate paralyzed the NIE, as participants refused to meet to make ongoing governance decisions. This raised fears that the whole government might collapse, but eventually, in early 2009, the NIE resumed its activities. Finally, in February 2010, an agreement signed at Hillsborough Castle paved the way for the creation of the Northern Ireland Department of Justice. Significantly, the individual appointed as Minister of Justice, David Ford, was from the Alliance Party, a smaller party that takes a stance of neutrality in the sectarian divide.</p>
<p>One might expect that the effects of devolution would immediately ripple down through the entire structure of police governance. However, many of the 2010 interview respondents viewed the devolution struggle as a fight among politicians with little relevance to their day-to-day activities and issues. A nationalist community worker said the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>I see no real change as a result of devolution. There may be changes in structures, but this doesn’t change how people feel. Sinn Fein argued strongly for the benefits, but residents don’t see it. The managers will tick boxes, but the perpetrators and victims won’t see the effects. The police need to be both accountable and effective.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nevertheless, most of the respondents felt generally positive about devolution. As one said, “It makes no sense for policing to still be controlled at Westminster.” Another, who is involved in resolving conflicts at the “interfaces” (boundaries between Protestant and Catholic neighborhoods), said, “Devolution is good for interface conversations . . . it will make people more accountable.” However, since the interviews were conducted only three months after its implementation, most respondents believed that it was too soon to tell what its long-term effects would be.</p>

<title>Community Policing</title>
<p>The broad measures of citizen control of and engagement in policing that have just been described have obviously had a profound impact. The accountability structure has gone a long way toward building citizen support and a belief in the legitimacy of the police. However, over the long haul, the legitimacy of the police depends on the day-to-day decisions that they make when enforcing the law. Do citizens view them as fair and effective? Are citizens willing to cooperate with the police in taking action against antisocial elements within their communities? It is at the street level that the vision of a partnership between the police and the community that is central to community policing is truly implemented. The following street-level issues will be important to the future of genuine community policing in Northern Ireland:</p>

<title>Effectiveness and Responsiveness</title>
<p>In other societies, such as the United States, where the police are distrusted by minority groups, ongoing issues of police–community relations often involve a concern with police heavy handedness—the excessive use of force and the tendency to escalate encounters with minority citizens in a way that would not occur with members of the majority. (U.S. minority groups have also protested police ineffectiveness, which, paradoxically, can coexist with heavy handedness, but the most emotional issues, for example, the beating of Rodney King that triggered the 1992 Los Angeles riots, have concerned “police brutality.”) However, in Northern Ireland, it is clear from both media accounts and interviews that the main citizen concern is with the <italic>lack</italic> of effective response by the police to criminal incidents, not with responses that are too heavy handed. Citizens complain that the police ignore their complaints, show up too late when services are requested, and do not conduct follow-up investigations effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078087412465581">Barnes 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078087412465581">Fearon 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078087412465581">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1078087412465581">McHugh 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Some respondents believe that citizens have unrealistic expectations of the police. At the end of the Troubles, there were 13,000 police officers in Northern Ireland, creating a per capita police presence many times larger than in the rest of the United Kingdom. Since then, the force has been cut to less than half that number. These cuts have meant that police resources have been spread thin, and citizens have not received a rapid response to every incident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1078087412465581">McCann 2007</xref>). However, as research from many countries has shown, police must appear to be responding effectively to citizen complaints to maintain and enhance their legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1078087412465581">National Research Council 2004</xref>). A member of a DPP expressed the nature of the police balancing act clearly:
<disp-quote>
<p>People have high expectations of policing. They tend to believe they can solve every problem. It’s a learning process. People need grounding in what a modern police force can deliver. They need to learn the process and the legal restrictions that police operate under. At the same time, the police need to step up, to be aware of the law and of community needs. They need to see themselves as a police service, not a police force. Community perceptions of safety are very important.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Citizens’ unfulfilled expectations of the police interact with another serious challenge for police legitimacy—the ongoing role of paramilitary groups in policing their neighborhoods. During the Troubles, the enforcement of justice against ordinary criminals by paramilitary groups was an important source of power and legitimacy, and some have been reluctant to give it up. Moreover, if citizens believe that the police will not respond effectively, then they may turn to the paramilitaries, who are not as constrained by legal niceties as are the police. During the three years covered by this research, there were several incidents of paramilitary groups handing out punishments to drug dealers and other criminals, ranging from public humiliation through tar and feathering to the outright murder of an offender in a North Belfast Protestant neighborhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1078087412465581">Morris 2008</xref>). In a 2008 article based on extensive interviews with the police and community representatives, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1078087412465581">John Topping (2008a)</xref> concluded that the failure of the civilian policing oversight entities to engage with informal systems of neighborhood justice seriously limited their effectiveness. The comments of one former community worker whom I interviewed in 2010 reflected an ongoing struggle in this regard:
<disp-quote>
<p>In Mt. Vernon [a North Belfast unionist neighborhood], the struggle has been to create a postparamilitary leadership that is pluralistic, an alternative to the UVF [Ulster Volunteer Force.] The difficulty is shown by the public, brutal murder of Thomas Devlin. The murderers had been put out of the community by the UVF, but it is still hard to get a good dialogue going on this incident. It wasn’t clear the extent to which the community sheltered the killers. The community saw it as a tragedy but as parallel to their other sufferings. They are very uneasy with the police. [Our community group] . . . tried a dialogue between the mother of Devlin and other mothers who had lost sons, but there was no meeting of the minds, because there was too much emotion. It is hard to achieve pluralism. The ex-combatants believe they should be the voice of the community, and people are reluctant to challenge them as there is still some fear of their military capacity.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, other respondents from both nationalist and unionist areas suggested that many present and former members of paramilitary groups were eager to get out of their law enforcement role and turn these activities over to police as the legitimate arm of the law. One respondent, who has worked closely with community groups in East Belfast, suggested that the willingness of paramilitaries to renounce this role varied between different areas of the city:
<disp-quote>
<p>Loyalists in East Belfast are working closely with the police. They say, “Don’t phone us, phone the police.” They are involved in community development. They realize that change is necessary. They can no longer control the community as they once did. They are getting older and want to improve their lives. In North Belfast, the UVF is more in control. They murdered Bobby Moffet in broad daylight on the Shankill Road. Some can’t let go of the conflict . . . Loyalist areas tend to be very insular—they are angry at the state and they lack confidence.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Of course, the “Catch 22” in all of this is that police will not be effective in solving crimes without the cooperation of citizens in serving as witnesses and in refusing to harbor offenders. Distrust breeds lack of cooperation that reduces police effectiveness that in turn enhances distrust. One DPP member, who has been heavily involved in setting up Neighborhood Watch programs, highlighted the importance of citizen cooperation:
<disp-quote>
<p>You can’t solve crime without community help. If criminals know they won’t get succor, their activities will decrease. In the past, cooperation was equated with informing. An increase in reported crime can mean increased neighborhood confidence in the police. Sometimes it’s hard to get community support when police are judged on a case-by-case basis. Police must be careful in setting targets, as they receive criticism for not meeting them. Neighborhood Watch is coordinated with the police. It gets people to come out when they wouldn’t go to the police. They have fought to keep police in the same neighborhoods.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section18-1078087412465581">
<title>Neighborhood Policing and Incident Policing</title>
<p>Based on his interviews with PSNI officers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1078087412465581">John Topping (2008b)</xref> concluded that while the stated philosophy of both the Policing Board and the PSNI command was to promote community policing, there had been little serious effort to train police officers in community policing, so that they were being asked to do something that they really did not know how to do. The 2010 interviews conducted for the present study revealed a more complex situation. Staff at the Police College, the new police training institution that has been created in Northern Ireland, emphasized the availability of community policing training to all new, and many existing, PSNI officers. In addition, neighborhood policing units consisting of trained officers have been created in many areas, and they work hard to establish close knowledge of and ties with the community.</p>
<p>However, respondents portrayed a complex relationship between the police who are assigned to neighborhood work and the response teams that react to crime reports. One nationalist community worker described the response teams as “ninjas” who swoop in to deal with incidents of crime but are not in regular contact with the community. Members of the incident teams have not always had training in community policing, so they may deal with citizens insensitively, thereby undermining the work of the neighborhood officers. A neighborhood police officer stated the differences as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>The purpose of neighborhood officers is community engagement to solve long-term problems. The response teams deal with immediate problems. The neighborhood team picks up the pieces. The response crews have no time to engage.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, neighborhood officers are sometimes reluctant to get involved in aggressive enforcement, for fear of alienating the neighborhood they work in. One respondent, a scholar engaged in advising the police, says this is changing:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the past, neighborhood officers thought they needed a kid glove approach, to avoid negative enforcement. However, due to reduced police numbers, all officers have to support enforcement. They receive info about crime from neighbors, and the neighbors can see results in arrests. The community is reassured by arrests. Both the community and the police have the will to change, but there are still organizational and cultural obstacles. Resources are a huge issue.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As noted above, the tension between enforcement activities and community outreach activities appears to be a universal dilemma in the implementation of community policing. As in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1078087412465581">Wood, Davis, and Rouse 2004</xref>), the traditional informal police culture in Northern Ireland—what one respondent called the “canteen culture”—tends to view crime fighting as “real policing” and community policing as “touchy feely stuff.” Some interviewees perceived a growing understanding and positive relationship between responding officers and neighborhood officers, whereas others perceived an ongoing lack of understanding. While the situation they described was not as bad as the almost total nonpenetration of street-level police culture by community policing values described by Topping, there certainly seemed to be uneven training in and uneven valuing of community policing within the PSNI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1078087412465581">
<title>Sectarian Violence</title>
<p>It has been a tremendous accomplishment of the Northern Ireland peace process that sectarian violence has moved to the fringes of society, carried out primarily by dissident republican who will settle for nothing less than the reunification of Ireland. While these groups have been disavowed by mainstream nationalist groups such as Sinn Fein, and while they are widely perceived as representing only a tiny minority, their activities have still caused difficulties for police legitimation. They have especially targeted police in a variety of ways: for example, intimidating Catholic police officers in 2007, killing two police officers in 2009, and setting off a bomb at a police station in Derry in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078087412465581"><italic>Belfast Telegraph</italic> 2010b</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1078087412465581">7</xref></sup> These incidents compel the police to carefully consider their own security, including, in some cases, moving back into the armored Land Rovers and fortress police stations that they had been cautiously abandoning.</p>
<p>In addition, dissidents have, in some cases, succeeded in fomenting violence in nationalist communities, for example, the Ardoyne riots of 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078087412465581"><italic>Belfast Telegraph</italic> 2010c</xref>). Residents of the nationalist Ardoyne neighborhood staged a sit-down protest in front of a unionist parade during the traditional July 12th celebration, and their removal by the police set off car burning and rock throwing. Some observers criticized the police for not taking more aggressive action against the rioters, but most respondents who commented on the incident praised the police for their restraint. A Policing Board member commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>The police were criticized for their handling of . . . [the riots]. However, there were no deaths and few injuries, and arrests were made later. They were able to contain the problem. If they had been heavy handed, it would not have worked.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Two other respondents noted an ominous tendency for younger nationalists to ignore the efforts of more “establishment” Sinn Fein leaders to calm the riots. They suggested that because Sinn Fein has chosen to work within the political system, they have lost the respect of some working class youth, making the youth easier targets for dissident recruitment. As a police officer commented, “Sinn Fein is playing an active role with the police, but they don’t always control younger people in their neighborhoods. Many street-level leaders have moved to Stormont [the Northern Ireland Assembly building].”</p>
<p>This incident illustrates how sectarian tensions within Northern Ireland can resurface to threaten police/citizen cooperation and police legitimation. Northern Ireland is still deeply divided along sectarian lines. These divisions are, for the most part, being expressed through peaceful political competition, but they can be exploited by extremist elements. Both the 2007-2008 interviews and the 2010 interviews included representatives of organizations that are actively working for genuine sectarian reconciliation, and many of the respondents from these groups expressed frustration at the difficulty of truly overcoming these divisions. Thus, the police find themselves constantly negotiating with competing groups to maintain progress.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1078087412465581">
<title>Underlying Social Problems</title>
<p>In Northern Ireland, working class Protestant and Catholic areas are often cut off from the mainstream economy. A large percentage of adults in these areas have left school “without qualification,” the British equivalent to lacking a high school diploma in the United States. They may be unemployed for extended periods, living off the still generous British welfare system. The rapid economic growth that both the Republic and Northern Ireland experienced prior to the current world recession largely passed them by, and what employment they had has been negatively affected by the recession. In the words of a loyalist activist, speaking about her own community:
<disp-quote>
<p>Basic economic and educational issues have not been tackled. There is intergenerational educational underachievement. In inner East Belfast, 4/5 leave school without qualification. They tend to fall behind after they transfer from primary school . . . Unemployment among the 18-25 group has increased. [Some of] . . . the brighter ones emigrate to Britain, the EU, or Norway.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As in other countries, youth who lack prospects in the mainstream economy are attracted to criminal activity such as selling drugs. In Northern Ireland, sectarian paramilitary groups are also available as alternative sources of identity and pride for some of these youth.</p>
<p>The PSNI encounters a range of problems generated by disaffected young people, ranging from antisocial behaviors, such as public drinking, noise, and vandalism, to more serious criminal activities. Incidents involving youth garner considerable media coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078087412465581"><italic>Belfast Telegraph</italic> 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1078087412465581">Martin 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1078087412465581">2008b</xref>) and the communities they deal with are very concerned about these behaviors. Citizens clearly expect the police to respond effectively. A response to antisocial behavior is certainly an important part of the “order maintenance” activities that are given priority under almost any community policing model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1078087412465581">Skogan 2004</xref>). However, law enforcement often has a limited impact on these activities, as long as underlying social factors are pushing youth in that direction. In addition, too vigorous a police response may generate a negative community response, and it certainly results in more youth being sucked into the criminal justice system, which can have a negative impact all its own on their life chances.</p>
<p>In those neighborhoods that are already inclined to distrust the police, the perceived ineffectiveness of the police response to public order issues may undermine the residents’ faith in community policing. As several respondents expressed it, neighborhoods may simultaneously expect too much and too little from the police, leading to chronic discontent. Those who advocate community policing in Northern Ireland have pointed out the need for police to network with a variety of other community agencies and organizations to create a multifaceted strategy for dealing with community safety. However, the creation and maintenance of such networks is a tall order for police officers who are stretched thin just dealing with law enforcement. The extent to which such networks have been engaged by the police appears to be quite uneven across policing districts within Northern Ireland.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The struggle to establish legitimate policing in Northern Ireland clearly involves all three levels of legitimacy outlined earlier—legitimacy through democratic representation, legitimacy through professionalism in public service, and legitimacy through “street-level” responsiveness to citizen concerns. With regard to democratic representation, civilian control mechanisms have not only been institutionalized but have also gradually secured multiparty participation and acceptance as “the way business is done.” In carrying out both planning and administration, the PSNI is directly accountable to the Policing Board, which is composed of elected and appointed representatives from all segments of the community. With regard to professionalism, there have been intensive efforts, beginning with the Patten Report in 1999, to change the culture and image of the police force. Police recruitment and training is slowly changing the PSNI from a militaristic, sectarian force to one that is deeply engaged with both the unionist and the nationalist communities. With regard to street-level responsiveness, mechanisms for citizen involvement have been created through the DPPs and the CSPs, and these entities are directly linked to the democratically representative Policing Board and to a Ministry of Justice that has been newly empowered through devolution of criminal justice to the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
<p>The effort to empower citizens to become partners with police in promoting community safety is, of course, bedeviled by the same problems encountered with citizen participation in other democratic societies. It is difficult to get citizens to actively engage in community policing institutions because of lack of knowledge, cynicism, or because of the competing demands of job and family. When citizens do become engaged, it is difficult for them to develop realistic expectations as to what the police can and cannot accomplish. Remaining bureaucratic inertia by the police also limits their responsiveness. Finally, the social and economic problems of working class communities run so deep that many of the factors negatively affecting public safety are beyond the capacity of police/citizen partnerships to effectively address.</p>
<p>In addition to these “generic” problems with citizen engagement, sectarian tensions are never far below the surface in Northern Ireland. Sectarian violence has moved from mainstream unionist and nationalist groups to fringe groups, but its periodic eruptions exacerbate intergroup tensions, and, by plunging the police back into their violence control mode, they make it more difficult for policing to become fully integrated into the two communities. The appeal of fringe groups is intensified by the economic and social disaffection of youth in nationalist and unionist working class communities. Until some measure of economic progress can be made in these communities, it will be difficult to eliminate violent elements.</p>
<p>In a small political entity such as Northern Ireland (1.8 million people), there is no clear separation between the municipal and provincial levels of government that there is in the United States between local and state governments. Policing is a function of the provincial government, yet it is still implemented at the community and neighborhood level. Therefore, the activities of the police are viewed by citizens very much in local terms. It seems clear that success at achieving cooperation in implementing community safety locally has had a positive impact on the process of legitimizing the provincial political process. However, as shown by the protracted battle over devolution of policing, issues of democratic legitimacy at the provincial level have an important, longer-term impact on the legitimacy of local implementation by the police. Devolution can either add greater legitimacy to policing, by taking the direct role of the British government out of it, or it can open the door to a greater negative impact on policing of sectarian conflicts within the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive. Moving forward, one can only hope that the achievements of the people of Northern Ireland in ending 30 years of violence and creating a functioning, legitimate polity can be preserved.</p>

<p>In a small polity such as Northern Ireland, the gap between the provincial and local government is not great and the same individuals will typically be involved in policy making at both levels of government. It should also be noted that local government councils were reduced to very limited powers during the Troubles, and policing is not included in their purview. However, even though the police force is organized at the provincial level, policing is seen as very much a local community issue in Northern Ireland (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078087412465581">Hays 2010</xref> for a more detailed discussion).</p>
