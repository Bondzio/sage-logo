<abstract>
<p>The study uses qualitative research methods to investigate how Canadian youth construct collective memory in relation to the War on Terror, and deals with the memories and understandings of 99 university students. I find that the landscape of collective memory is both material and social in its composition because it involves not only a human agent who remembers but also a collectivity of significant ‘others’ and material technologies of memory. The study concludes that significant, complex, uneven and mutually constitutive relationships between these features result in the construction of multiple and contested collective memories within a single compass.</p>

<p>This study is a part of a growing body of work exploring the internal dynamics of collective memories that make them, ‘dynamic, interactive, and therefore potentially changing, in flux – contested’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750698011419121">Kuhn, 2010</xref>: 299), and ‘more than just a personal act’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1750698011419121">Misztal, 2003</xref>: 6). The idea of mapping the landscape of collective memory in relation to the War on Terror occurred to me in 2007 when I saw a group of people near the Highway of Heroes, CFB Trenton, Ontario. They were collectively remembering the Canadian soldiers who died in Afghanistan and producing a commemorative narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750698011419121">Zerubavel, 1995</xref>) through acts of commemoration. They were involved in the construction of collective memory by collectively grieving the deaths of unknown soldiers and sharing a common narrative of the war that account for this remembrance. People gather over the bridge above the Highway, whenever the military convoy with soldiers’ bodies passes by, and mark the site with Canadian flags in their hands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698011419121">Burnett, 2008</xref>). Practices like this link individuals through collective remembering that involves a commonly shared past. My concern was not their practices but the factors involved in the construction of a commonly shared past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750698011419121">Kuhn, 2010</xref>) or the formation of collective memories of the war in this case.</p>
<p>This article attempts to understand the internal dynamics of collective memory by exploring how Canadian youth construct collective memories in relation to the War on Terror. It deals with their memories and understanding of the event, yet has nothing to do with what the war is. Rather, I use the war as a vehicle to get to my larger argument about how the landscape of collective memory is constructed when 99 university students remember and interpret the war from its beginning until 2008. This study is thus a test case for the larger understanding of the factors involved in the construction of collective memory that has been a matter of concern for many scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750698011419121">Bell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750698011419121">Kansteiner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750698011419121">Olick, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1750698011419121">Poole, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750698011419121">Roediger and Werstch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750698011419121">Zerubavel, 1995</xref>). This investigation is important because the collapse of time, space, and territoriality associated with globalization, the media and communication technologies are changing the internal dynamics of collective memories in the 21st century. They are becoming more dynamic, multiple, shared and contested in their nature.</p>
<p>The first section of this article lays out the conceptual framework and the methodology. The next section presents findings of the study that map the features of the landscape of collective memories in relation to the war. The concluding part suggests that a society can have multiple versions of an event situated in the landscape of collective memories because of a complex construction process.</p>
<sec id="section1-1750698011419121">
<title>The construction of collective memory</title>
<p>When I started to conceptualize this study, my first introduction to the concept of collective memory came from Emile Durkheim who discusses briefly the social structure of collective memory without using the term itself. My interests have actually deepened as a result of one of his students, Halbwachs’ work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698011419121">1980</xref>), who expands the idea and mentions that collective memories, ‘are recalled to us through others even though only we were participants in the events or saw the things concerned. In reality, we are never alone’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698011419121">1980</xref>: 23). He suggests that memories are constructed within social structures and institutions but does not explain how they are constructed within the same social group and then pass on from one generation to the next. His theory represents the human agent as an agency-less factor and gives us no explicit sense of the fact that ‘social groups are made up of a system, or systems of communication’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698011419121">Connerton, 1989</xref>: 38), or how collective memory is transformed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750698011419121">Zerubavel, 1995</xref>). This gap is in part explained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750698011419121">Pierre Nora (1998)</xref>, who claims that groups construct collective memory by selecting certain dates, material objects and people to commemorate, while deliberately eliminating others from representation. We know that a range of individual acts of recollection or shared rituals of commemoration is provided to remember an event with an already established interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750698011419121">Browne, 1999</xref>). What we do not know is how groups construct collective memory. For some, it is a lateral sequence of repetitions, with no objective emplotment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1750698011419121">Vivian, 2002</xref>). These approaches do not explain the role of contestation and mediation in the construction of collective memory and how people establish interpretations of an event that is not necessarily a part of their personal experience.</p>
<p>In my quest to understand how this interpretation that in turn makes collective memory multiple and contested is established, I used a wide variety of work relating to the commemoration activities and material objects of memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698011419121">Bell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750698011419121">Maier, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750698011419121">Novick, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750698011419121">Osborne, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750698011419121">Spillman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1750698011419121">Winter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1750698011419121">Winter and Sivan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750698011419121">Zerubavel, 1995</xref>). These studies have made valuable contributions in building the alphabets of a new language that can be used to write the narrative of collective memory, yet they do not imply that collective memory resides in commemoration activities or material objects of memory. Collective memory is substantiated or fuelled by these activities and objects, but the question remains as to how they fuel distinct and sometimes contradictory versions of memory for two different communities or nations. At this point, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1750698011419121">Sturken’s (1997)</xref> theory is quite helpful in understanding that collective memory is ‘produced through objects, images, and representations. These are technologies of memory, not vessels of memory in which memory passively resides’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1750698011419121">1997</xref>: 9). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750698011419121">Basu (2011)</xref> has discussed that collective memory is ‘never made by politicians, monuments or individual media representations alone, although both media and politics (or power relations) are essential to their existence; they are formed and develop through a tangle of relations that reaches back and forth across time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1750698011419121">2011</xref>: 33). Basu focuses on the relationship of media, temporality and power in the construction of collective memory. Even so, the process is more complex and we need an in-depth exploration of its internal dynamics that turns collective memory into ‘a multiple-sided jigsaw puzzle that links events, issues, or personalities differently for different groups’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1750698011419121">Zelizer, 1998</xref>: 3). I am indebted to many scholars’ work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750698011419121">Campbell, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750698011419121">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1750698011419121">Sturken, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1750698011419121">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1750698011419121">Sutton, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1750698011419121">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1750698011419121">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1750698011419121">Zelizer, 2008</xref>) in conceptualizing this study. In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1750698011419121">Wertsch’s (2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1750698011419121">2008</xref>) theory provides the foundation for the conceptual approach I use to explore the factors involved in the construction of collective memory because he deals with the formation of collective memory as a process and not as a product in the form of commemorative narrative or memory objects.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1750698011419121">Wertsch (2002)</xref> explores the process by which collective memory is materially constructed. He explains that the construction of collective memories is a material, mediated and dynamic process for the reason that collective remembering is a process of mediation between human agents and different cultural tools or technologies of memory available in a particular socio-cultural setting. His theory focuses on human agents and a toolkit involved in the construction of collective memories. Human agency implies consciously made decisions and directed actions, which may act as an inner resource that enables human beings to develop a perspective or understanding of the issue. Wertsch says that collective memories are grounded in a shared ‘tool kit’ that shapes what people thought and said instead of research. A tool kit is made up of a variety of technologies of memory such as museums, films, monuments, photographs, textbooks, documentaries, the internet, images, commemorative narratives, public holidays, sites of memory, the media, and so forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1750698011419121">Wertsch, 2008</xref>). Nonetheless, there is a lack of detailed evidence in his work on how tool kit or schematic narrative templates form, consolidate and transform memories at community levels and despite the fact that he deals with actual narratives as forms of collective memory, his approach lacks a narrative/discursive theory guiding the analysis. He mentions that human agents as group members consume and interpret textual resources but the problem is that human beings are members of many groups at the same time and the groups exert different levels of influence on their agency. He focuses on the material components involved in the construction of collective memory, which left me to grapple with questions such as whether human agency is sufficient enough to build meanings around material technologies of memory; or is there any other force that influences the processes of appropriation, negotiation or resistance in textual consumption.</p>
<p>Wertsch’s discussion helped me in part to understand why to some extent the representations of the past appear to have multiple meanings for two communities. However, what his theory does not explain explicitly is that which comes in between a human agent and material technologies of memory that influences the construction of multiple collective memories. Although he mentions that ‘groups operating at levels other than the state will play new and more important roles’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1750698011419121">2002</xref>: 175) in memory construction, but there is a lack of evidence in his work about the nature and roles of these groups.</p>
<p>A difference between Wertsch’s study and mine is that he sought to understand collective memories in connection with a body of empirical evidence from Soviet and post-Soviet Russia. In Russia the dominant narratives available through the tool kit were directly controlled by the state, while I seek to explore the construction of collective memories in connection with a body of empirical evidence from Canada. The Canadian governments use their authority to control the consumption of resources for collective memory construction differently from the Soviet Union. An in-depth exploration of the construction of collective memory thus seems to me to be a crucial aspect of the work of memory studies, precisely because today’s media generation’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1750698011419121">Roberts and Foehr, 2008</xref>) material and social worlds have become borderless, flexible and more complicated than the previous generation’s world, and their collective memories are mediated within national, regional and global frameworks at the same time.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>To explore how a diverse group of 99 university students (18 to 27 years old) construct collective memories of the War on Terror, the following three methods of data collection were used: written narratives; in-depth interviews; and demographic questionnaires. My methodological approach is driven from the theories that consider narratives fundamental to achieving an understanding of collective memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698011419121">Létourneau, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1750698011419121">Wertsch, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1750698011419121">Wertsch (2002)</xref> focuses on narratives and their role in remembering settings, actors and events of the past. A central point in this study is the role of narratives in the organization of information required to make sense of the sequence of events and the line of argumentation. I consider narratives as instruments by which the conflicting claims of the War on Terror can be mediated in a discourse. Different scholars have used narratives as a means to study collective memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750698011419121">Goldberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750698011419121">Létourneau, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750698011419121">Penuel and Wertsch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1750698011419121">Wertsch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1750698011419121">Wertsch and O’Connor, 1994</xref>) as remembering takes place through actions and narratives in public space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750698011419121">Campbell, 2006</xref>). My rationale to use narratives as the main instrument of data collection is mainly situated in Létourneau’s argument that students’ narratives reflect a historical collective memory. I have borrowed my methodological approach mainly from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698011419121">Létourneau (2004)</xref>, who used narratives of young French Canadians to understand their representations of the collective history of Quebec and found that practically all students used a narrative that is at odds with the official narratives available in Quebec.</p>
<p>My participants were enrolled in large introductory first-year undergraduate courses offered by different departments of a large urban university in Ontario. The majority of them were in middle schools and some were in high schools when 9/11 happened. They had vivid memories of 9/11, and how the war started and unfolded as a result of these events. I asked them to write answers to the following questions:</p>
<list id="list1-1750698011419121" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Write a short essay on the course of the War on Terror from its beginning until today, the way you see it, you remember it and you experienced it.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How has the war affected you?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>From where did you get your information about the war?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Which sources are the most important for your understanding of the war?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The analysis of my participants’ answers provides me with valuable insights into the internal dynamics of collective memories. This article revolves around the answers of questions 3 and 4 to explore the factors involved in memory construction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1750698011419121">
<title>Collective memories of the War on Terror</title>
<p>I attempt to provide the ‘application’ of much needed distributed theories in current memory studies. I believe that these theories are essential for exploring the ways in which cultural, social and technological environments interact with individual memories to shape collective memories of major political events. The evidence I review in this section reveals three major patterns of collective memory in relation to the War on Terror. The first pattern (a justified war) appears in 26 out of 99 responses and is reflected in the following response from participant 24:
<disp-quote>
<p>I remember how Muslim terrorists attacked us on 9/11 and then we went in Afghanistan and then Iraq to destroy them. I watch CBC and read newspapers sometimes to get information about this war. I believe that the War on Terror needs to be fought.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This text reflects a single committed perspective, ‘I believe’, and no patience for ambiguity or multiple truths about the war. The participant constructs a web of meanings around the war invested in the communication by the media. The process of constructing collective memory entails a selective attitude here that makes it difficult to imagine, let alone overtly introduce, other information or competing perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1750698011419121">Wertsch, 2002</xref>). The participant uses an important mechanism to construct a collective identity by couching a personal voice as the voice of an imagined community while switching over from ‘I’ to ‘we’. The second pattern (a justified war in the beginning but not now) appears in 51 out of 99 responses and is reflected in the following response from participant 79:
<disp-quote>
<p>I remember when the war started after 9/11. It seemed to be the right action in the beginning. Then as I grew older and started to read multiple sources of information, I realized that this war is as cruel and disgusting as other wars in the past. Whenever I will remember this war, thousands of innocent faces would appear in front of my eyes, who died on the name of crushing terrorism with terror.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participant’s voice surfaces overtly instead of reflecting others’ voices. A critical collective memory has been developed because of a dialogic engagement between the narrator as an active agent and the information available through different sources. The third pattern (an imperialist war) appears in 22 out of 99 responses and is reflected in the following response of participant 1:
<disp-quote>
<p>What happened on 9/11 was terrible but it was not the first event of its kind in history. They have killed thousands of innocent Muslim civilians to show their might and superiority. America used the event of 9/11 to expand its imperial project in the world. When America killed thousands of people in Nicaragua, or when Israel killed Palestinians in Gaza with phosphorus bombs, it was not terrorism, it was their right because might is right.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this text, the narrator selects some particular events to establish an interpretation of the war, and actively shows a resistance towards the official narratives of the war by declaring it an ‘imperial project’. This pattern of memory appears to be embedded in the knowledge of alternative, unofficial histories contributing to the production of an alternative narrative. In the following section, I offer examples from data to explore the factors involved in the formation of these patterns of collective memory.</p>
<sec id="section4-1750698011419121">
<title>Human agent</title>
<p>A human agent, who remembers, selects relevant tools, and knows how to use them, is the most important factor involved in the process of memory construction. The following excerpt taken from the answer of participant 31 highlights the presence of an active agent:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I remember how this war started, I feel nothing but compassion for those countries along with Iraq who now must end up with an ignorant global view. The media can only influence the dumb, ignorant people who blindly believe in things that they try to feed them but if you have any common sense and you believe in yourself as a responsible person who can compare the facts, then you can see the things as really they are.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this passage, a human agent appears who is the possessor of memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750698011419121">Radstone and Hodgkin, 2003</xref>), and has the agency to unlock the process of remembering. He asserts his agency by denying the general legitimacy of the encoded mass media representation of the war. As an active agent, he acknowledges his responsibilities to have a dialogue with the media representations. This process of mediation is evident in the following excerpt taken from the answer of participant 59:
<disp-quote>
<p>I like to collect facts from different sources and then form my own opinion. I try to be critical of whatever I read or heard. Being a student of political science and philosophy as majors that is what we are expected to do. I carry that into my everyday life and to use the cliché ‘I take everything with the grain of salt’. I have a sort of internal dialogue whenever I am reading something or watching something, I constantly ask questions in my mind.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participant is not just a spectator or an impotent onlooker of the encoded representation around the event; rather he makes choices and asks questions in relation to the messages embedded in the representations. As an active agent, he selects or rejects different resources and a hidden dialogue occurs between him as a consumer and multiple resources while negotiating between different versions of the narratives of the war. Human agency plays a particularly important role in the selection and the particular use of a technology of memory. Nonetheless, there is always an irreducible tension between human agents and the technologies of memory they employ to think and remember (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1750698011419121">Wertsch, 2002</xref>). The existence of such tensions ultimately forges change in collective memory. The following answer from participant 51 reveals this tension:
<disp-quote>
<p>Actually how do we perceive reality depends upon who we are, not on the sources of information. If you buy into certain things from a particular source, you will choose from the one that works according to your views. It is always important what your extremes are. Reality is whatever you make out of the different stuff according to your extremes … All you know is what other sources are telling you. You just have to understand that actually you do not know anything.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This participant talks about the limitations of mediation and the importance of using multiple sources inductively. This statement also reflects the boundaries of human agency. Human choices are situated in special interests and identities. Human beings like to select sources and construct collective memory according to their own assumptions. When they draw upon selective criteria, their collective memory does not represent a sophisticated reality, but establishes a set of meanings that articulates and reinforces a particular ideological stance. The following answer from participant 29 shows that an active agent appears who wants to explore different sources of information to organize comprehension of the past:
<disp-quote>
<p>I feel a lot of information on the war on terror is hidden from the public. To declare that someone is a terrorist does not fully explain the reasons for committing terrorist attacks. I think that the public opinion on the war on terror cannot be more substantial without more unbiased information from different sources. It is our duty to search historical facts about the driving forces behind the terrorist attacks, otherwise, how we will be able to prevent the world from terrorism. I believe that hiding the information is extremely wrong. I also feel that more cultural acceptance and understanding should be promoted among young people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this text, a human agent appears that refuses to consume incomplete, and non-sophisticated mapping of the past. From the perspective of mediated action, the participant believes in using multiple sources, in a way that contributes to the agency, to reposition and to establish a solid moral footing in the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750698011419121">Goldberg et al., 2006</xref>). In this statement, the desire to recover a comprehensive narrative of the War on Terror is a major motivating force in the construction of collective memories. This young Canadian emphasizes the creation of a collective memory of the war without detaching it from broader historical context. The next section focuses on the sources of information mentioned by this participant and their role in the construction of collective memory.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1750698011419121">
<title>Material technologies of memory</title>
<p>Another important factor involved in the construction of collective memory relates to Wertsch’s point that whatever is remembered individually and collectively depends in part on material technologies of memory or the toolkit. The role of different sources of information or technologies of memory in the production, consumption and negotiation of the collective memories is evident in almost all participants’ responses. For example, an important technology of memory appears in the answer from participant 89:
<disp-quote>
<p>The way I will always remember this war will be the permanent memories of video footage shown on the television. I remember the journalists and people with personal cameras who were being engulfed in fumes and smoke on public streets. The stories of fire fighters who lost their lives and thousands of people who died on September 11 are still in my mind.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This response shows some selected reconstructions of the memories of the events of 9/11. The participant symbolizes the event through a process of dialogue with the encoded meanings supplied through different camera images of the events of 9/11 that constitute a significant technology of memory. These video footages are central to the interpretation of the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1750698011419121">Sturken, 1997</xref>) when the participant remembers how the war started, and mediates through specific images that fuel collective memory of the war. Nonetheless, the landscape of collective memory has become more broad and interconnected, which encompasses a global framework as evident in the response of participant 75:
<disp-quote>
<p>I remember I was visiting my relatives in England, and everything was under a high security after 9/11. I was watching a British TV channel. He was actually a Brazilian and did not have citizenship. So he was running. They chased him to the subway, hawked him and shoot him. And then in the paper it was like a diagram. This war is taking civil out of everything … I don’t have any personal links to the war but can’t escape from it because our media is full of the stories of terrorist, terrorism, and Canadian soldiers’ contributions in Afghanistan … I read journal articles and watch the popular media as well. I do watch TV, and listen to the CBC Radio. I try to pick up newspapers but that does not happen very often. I try to read a couple of newspapers like <italic>National Post, Globe</italic> and <italic>Mail</italic>. I do not like to get information from just one source of information because they are so biased. I find the CBC as the only viable source with regard to national news. I also try to catch BBC to get international perspectives.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participant relies on multiple sources of information such as journal, newspapers, TV, radio and the internet. An interaction takes place between him as an active agent and different types of text and images of the war available in the media. This passage represents some of the ways in which not only the local but the global media representations engage, produce and embody distinctive kinds of memory discourses as the participant constructs memories with the help of both the Canadian and British media networks. A global framework for the construction of collective memory also appears in the following excerpt taken from the answer of participant 41:
<disp-quote>
<p>I remember the war against terrorism became a part of common lexicon after 9/11. To hear the world terrorism, honestly the memories of 9/11 come into my mind. It is one of those things that I can easily remember. Whenever I heard the word terrorism, the images of the tower collapsing, the plane flying and hitting the tower flash in my mind. It became a sort of the focus of news … with regard to national standard ovations. I guess it only became a major issue for the West after 9/11. However, it started long before that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This passage reflects how the participant remembers the beginning of this war and what sorts of images come to his mind during the process of remembering. Here collective memory is produced by and through images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1750698011419121">Sturken, 1997</xref>). The following response of the same participant shows other sources he uses to construct memories of the war:
<disp-quote>
<p>No … not any specific. I think … I prefer to use the internet to gather information about anything because a variety of information is available on the internet. I mean you can always find different perspectives about any issue. Um … I do not mean that whatever is available on the internet is correct or you can trust it, but at least it does not give you one-sided version … Sometimes I watch YouTube or some other websites too. I watch Al-Jazeera television, Fox News, and CBC sometimes but as I said earlier I do not have much time to watch television.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This participant talks about a number of technologies of memory available in his sociocultural setting such as the internet, the national, local and the global media networks that represent the war with different rhetorical styles and distinctive kinds of narrative discourses. Al-Jazeera (Arabic channel), Fox News (American channel), and CBC (Canadian channel) offer different and sometimes contradictory frameworks of collective memory. Their frameworks determine which aspects of the war can become more central to the construction of collective memory and which are assigned to oblivion, which events of the war can be commemorated as highly significant and which can be ignored. These statements reflect a landscape of collective memory constructed within a localized and a globalized framework at the same time. The analysis so far indicates that collective memory is constructed through a process of mediation between a human agent and technologies of memory or in our case mostly the news media, but I find that the landscape of collective memory is not bi-polar. Another factor appears frequently in this landscape as evident in the answer from participant 66:
<disp-quote>
<p>A lot of information is coming from media. Media is not the best place to get real information. But you cannot turn off whenever something happens, it [media] just goes on and on for weeks. I guess a lot of interesting information is found in documentaries. A lot of discussion in our class is also a source of information. I also listen when my parents discuss about this war.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This passage shows the role of technologies of memory including the media and documentaries in the formation of personal webs of information. Media’s selected representations, ‘their structure, and the rituals of consumption they underwrite may represent the most important shared component of peoples’ historical consciousness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750698011419121">Kansteiner, 2002</xref>: 195), but here we can see that a third element, ‘parents/peers/teacher’, appears side by side with material technologies that should take the credit for remembering and meaning making around the war. This factor is not an agent in its own right, however, but plays an active role when a human agent mediates with technologies of memory.</p>
<sec id="section6-1750698011419121">
<title>Social groups</title>
<p>We remember with and in response to other people and their needs and histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750698011419121">Campbell, 2008</xref>). Some important ‘others’ emerge as a dynamic force in the responses of my participants when they remember the war. They play a vital role in shaping their memories and interpretations of the War on Terror. In the majority of the cases, my participants mediate texts and images of the war provided by material technologies with the help of these groups. I discover that there is a strong communication network between my participants as active human agents, technologies of memory and <italic>social groups</italic>. These groups include parents, teachers, peers, friends or relatives. They play an important role in the construction and transmission of collective memories as students’ attribution of significance to past events is always mediated by family and ethnic collective memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1750698011419121">Seixas, 1994</xref>). The role of this group as a mediator is evident in the following answer from participant 19:
<disp-quote>
<p>The key sources of information that I use are people of authority. My dad is an essential part to help me determine what I do feel about this War on Terror. I always look, listen and observe [my] professors and teachers in my high school and close friends too. In terms of the media, I only listen for the facts [gotten] through news on TV and newspapers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participant’s attribution of significance to the war is mediated by three different social groups: parents, teachers and friends. They play a significant role in establishing certain meanings about the war and thus in the construction of collective memory. Collective memory is constructed at a point where both material and social axis intersect each other. Some may argue that teachers may be considered as an agent of the state whose role as the architecture of collective memory is diminishing in the 21st century, not to say disappearing. Yet, the role of teachers as mediators and interpreters is still vital and can be seen in a rather long answer from participant 49:
<disp-quote>
<p>I can vividly recall the day when 9/11 occurred. I was in grade 10 and thus relatively ignorant of the world, I had to ask my teachers: where and what were the two towers, and even, what is a terrorist attack? Every classroom in the school was set up with a television on that day, and we all watched the news with both horror and confusion. None of us really knew what it meant – except what we were told by our teachers: it is an act of terrorism; terrorists come from the Middle East; and that it is a horrific thing. In retrospect, indeed it was a very tragic event; but in the next coming years, I have had some good teachers. They helped me to see the war in its historical perspective. When I remember whatever has happened in Iraq and Afghanistan on the name of fighting terrorism, my history teacher’s lessons about the relationship of wars and propaganda come into my mind.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This participant’s memories in relation to the beginning point and then development of the war are constructed at the point where the texts and images from the media, and debates/interpretations provided by the teachers intersect each other. The participant’s collective memory of the war is the result of an interplay between her agency, the media representations, and an important social ‘other’ in her life. Teachers play an important role in the interpretation of facts presented through textbooks, images, museums or the news media. This statement reveals the construction site of collective memory where an intersection between material and social forces occurs during the process of remembering the collective past. Her memories are mediated through media images and texts in the beginning, but then another important factor appears in the terrain that works to construct or transform the character of collective memories of the War on Terror.</p>
<p>Human beings are not independent agents in all circumstances or, in other words, their agency is not unconditional. They are a part and parcel of many social groups at the same time, but each group cannot necessarily influence the construction of memories in the same manner. How influential the groups are depends on the nature of their membership in a group and the authority invested in the group. It is important to bear in mind this point when we read the responses of those participants whose friends or relatives are in the Canadian army and in particular are/were deployed in Afghanistan. The army as a social group has always played an influential role in shaping people’s collective memories of wars. The following answer from participant 10 reveals the interplay between her agency and the authority invested in the military and the impact of this intersection on the construction of collective memory:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have learned a lot about the war on terror because my boyfriend’s father is a major in the Canadian Army and spent 6 months in Afghanistan. I do not think [that] people have the knowledge to know when we should pull out until they have gone over there and experience what our militaries are really doing.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participant’s belief in a particular social group’s interpretations of the war is very strong and influencing. This statement reflects the impact of human interaction and in particular personal relationships with a group of high moral authority on our individual and collective imagination. A major point that distinguishes her from other participants is that the voice of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1750698011419121">Wertsch, 2002</xref>) emerges in this account of the war. The strong influence of the military as a social group on the construction of collective memory of the war can also be seen in the answer from participant 91:
<disp-quote>
<p>I suppose my recollection of the memories of the war on terror began on September 11, 2001. I was in grade 9 Geography class while my teacher had gotten wind of what happened and hooked up a cable TV. The entire class sat and watched the events unfolded in front of our eyes. My memories are filled with images of burning rubble and dead bodies. I think I was a bit young to comprehend what was happening, but as I grew older and made friends who are in the military, I began to learn more from them and expanded my knowledge about this war. I am dating with someone who is in the military and waiting for his deployment in Afghanistan. I appreciate our military’s protective role in this war as they are sacrificing their lives to protect us from terrorists.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The initial part of this passage depicts the same sort of interaction between a human agent and the news media representations of the war and its outcome in the form of the memories of the events of 9/11, as we have seen in the quotes given above. The second part of the passage reflects that military’s authority in representing and reconstructing the narrative of the war goes straight to the heart of collective memory. The process of remembering the war draws strength from the authoritative role of the Canadian army as a mediator. The willingness to accept the authority of the representations of the war provided by the military persons also stems from the close personal relationship with or membership of the group. It is important to remember that all social groups are not always capable of forcing the human agent to read resources in one way or another, and the nature of collective memory as a result of their varying influence is not always predictable.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The emergence of three patterns reveals that Canadian youth’s collective memories in relation to the War on Terror are multiple, and the results of both remembering and forgetting, affirmation and opposition, or suppressing and revising. During the process of remembering, Canadian youth uncover some aspects of the war or shift them from the margins to the center of the landscape of their collective memories, while marginalize or fade other aspects into oblivion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750698011419121">Zerubavel, 1995</xref>). For example, there is an absence of the representation of Afghan people in their collective memory of the war. Not even once do the deaths of thousands of Afghan people or Afghan characters appear with individuality in their landscape of collective memory. Their collective memory emerges out of a deep concern for a distinct national identity from the American nation. The issues of Canadian soldiers’ deaths and continuity of an image as a peacekeeping nation are central to these young Canadians’ collective memories and their vision of the future.</p>
<p>Their memories concern not only the past, but also the present, and the relation between the past and the present is not given but depends on human agency as well as on mnemonic tools, technologies and databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750698011419121">Middleton and Brown, 2005</xref>), and their interpersonal relations with different social groups. During the process of remembering, they show a tendency to mediate with the representations of the war provided by the media or important sociocultural forces in their lives. In most of the cases, instead of either linearly consuming or resisting them, they engage themselves in a kind of dialogue with these representations to construct collective memory of the war. During the process of construction, contestation occurs at both material and social dimensions. The study discovers that significant and mutually constitutive relationships among human agency, material technologies of memory (in this study mostly the news media) and interpersonal relations with important ‘others’ play a vital role in meaning making and thus in the construction of collective memory within a single compass. The social dynamics also influence people’s decision to choose and then utilize certain resources. Within all social networks a range of relationships is formed, some of them are closer and more influential than others. The interpersonal relationships with friends, teachers and family are integral to the processes of mediation and interpretation of resources available through different technologies of memory. This dynamics can be extended beyond the informal networks to the formal networks inside offices or schools.</p>
<p>These features are distributed unevenly in the landscape of collective memory, and link events and characters involved in the War on Terror. A non-linear interrelationship among these three features make collective memory dynamic, fragile, multiple, contested and distinct from individual memory. A slight change in the relative positions or nature of different features of a geographical landscape may have a determining influence on the nature and character of the whole place. The same rule applies when human beings construct collective memories. Any change in the nature and relative positions of either material or social features may have a determining influence on the nature and character of collective memory. That’s why, ‘reading a still photographic image is not quite the same as reading a film’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750698011419121">Kuhn, 2010</xref>) about the same event. The findings help us to understand that the multi-dimensional relationship among these features helps people to escape the gravitational pull of powerful master narratives and construct collective memories in new formats.</p>
<p>The study also finds that collective memories are mediated not only in a national or regional framework, rather in some cases within a global framework. Nonetheless, the process of mediation has certain limitations. First, everyone does not have the same access to the global networks of knowledge. Second, the process of mediation occurs within certain boundaries drawn by a human agent’s already existing assumptions and worldviews. Third, the influence of interpersonal relationships on the process of mediation is neither linear nor predictable.</p>
<p>Another important finding of this study appears to be the relative roles and influences of particular voices in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1750698011419121">Zelizer (1998)</xref> calls the struggles to claim an authoritative voice in collectively remembering the past. Different sources have more or less claims to authority and legitimacy in the larger culture; however, the issue of ‘authority’ invested in the military appears as an influencing force that plays a vital role in the production of collective memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1750698011419121">Vivian, 2002</xref>). The armed forces appear as a highly influencing group in the responses of those participants who have interpersonal relations with this group. The ‘authority’ emerges in the form of the voice of ‘other’ in their accounts of the war. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750698011419121">Bakhtin’s (1984)</xref> view, authority is based on the assumption that utterances and their meanings are fixed, not modifiable as they come into contact with new voices. The presence of ‘other’ is so striking in their narratives that one is readily tempted to ask ‘Who is doing the speaking’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1750698011419121">Wertsch, 2002</xref>: 161).</p>
<p>It has been claimed that that collective memory ‘is always negotiated at the interface between the imposition of a public dominant narrative and the reaction of the private individual’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1750698011419121">Ryan, 2011</xref>:154); however, I conclude that the location of collective memory is more complicated and is the one constituted precisely through the point of intersection between human, material and social forces, the unity of which is simply given through their structural interconnectedness. Collective memories are constructed by human agents but they move through different nodes of material technologies and social groups before appearing in the form of memory performances such as commemorative narrative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750698011419121">Zerubavel, 1995</xref>), memory objects such as museums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1750698011419121">Schudson, 1995</xref>), or collective memory of Americans for Abraham Lincoln (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1750698011419121">Schwartz and Schuman, 2005</xref>). The presence of different narratives of the War on Terror is not problematic because this is what the memories of a collectivity are. The whole network of collective memory represents collectivity: it is a big and complex construction.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study maps the distinctive dimensions involved in the complex and highly structured construction of collective memory. These dimensions are affective, material, interpersonal, historical, political and cultural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1750698011419121">Sutton, 2009</xref>). Canadian youth relate, select, interpret and construct memories, in relation to the War on Terror, at a point where these dimensions intersect each other. Its complex construction, resistant to any simple categorization or characterization, encompassing of both subjective and objective elements, and interconnected features, all suggesting that the landscape of collective memory is both material and social in nature. It incorporates activities straddling brains, bodies, social and material dimensions of life. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1750698011419121">Sutton (2006)</xref> says, ‘ a wider extended cognitive-affective system is formed across the group and the artifacts: this allows the ongoing social negotiation of the past, bringing certain events to the joint attention of people with quite different perspectives and stakes in the earlier events’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1750698011419121">2006</xref>: 284).</p>
<p>The study provides evidence that certain social forces shape the coloring of my participants’ readings from different material technologies, and even sometimes play an important role in the selection of a technology itself. Yet, the analysis reveals that social groups are neither the sole, nor at all times the strongest mediator of collective memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750698011419121">Goldberg et al., 2008</xref>). Collective memory neither exists exclusively in the form of processes such as communication between subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1750698011419121">Welzer, 2010</xref>), participation in traditional rituals and the exchange of family stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750698011419121">Ramos, 2010</xref>), nor can it be grasped solely through concepts of individual agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1750698011419121">Narine, 2010</xref>). The social groups, material objects, commemoration activities, and an agency to mediate resemble to the nodes of a network. The nature of connection among these nodes decides the shape of a network. This network is big, complex and uneven, and represents the collectivity of my participants’ memories.</p>
