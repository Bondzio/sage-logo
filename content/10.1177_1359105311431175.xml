<abstract>
<p>This two-wave longitudinal study examines the ability of pessimistic attributional style and coping strategies to predict depressive symptoms in a sample of 99 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). After the cardiac episode, the globality dimension of this style was associated with increased depressive symptoms, and this association was mediated by the low use of effective coping strategies. Stability and globality dimensions of pessimistic attributional style could also predict depressive symptoms eight weeks later. Cardiac intervention programmes should include the treatment of these symptoms and promote effective coping strategies as well as the modification of these stable and global attributions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Coronary heart disease (CHD: myocardial infarction and angina pectoris) is the main cause of death worldwide, and one of the leading causes of premature disability. According to the World Health Organization deaths from this cause represent 12.6% of the total mortality rate, which is about seven million deaths each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1359105311431175">WHO, 2007</xref>). Given these figures, ample research is needed to identify both physical and psychosocial variables that influence the onset and progression of these diseases.</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of a cardiac event involves considerable personal adjustment, the onset of psychological distress, such as depressive symptoms, would be expected. In fact, studies have found that depressive symptoms are common among patients with CHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311431175">Koivula et al., 2010</xref>), and that the prevalence of major depression in this group is higher than in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311431175">Carney et al., 2002</xref>). Detecting and treating these symptoms is important since different studies have found that their presence doubles the risk of a new cardiac episode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311431175">Blumenthal et al., 2003</xref>), and of cardiac mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311431175">Meijer et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Coping strategies are one of the psychosocial variables that affect psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311431175">Auerbach et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311431175">Folkman and Moskowitz, 2000</xref>). It is well established that in controllable situations, the best strategy is active coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311431175">Anderson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1359105311431175">Stanton et al., 2007</xref>). The direct confrontation of problems not only increases the possibility of solving them, but it is also associated with decreased emotional distress, for example, depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>When problems are uncontrollable, the most effective coping strategies to reduce emotional distress are acceptance of the problem and positive reappraisal of the situation. Denial of the disease, avoiding facing up to it and focusing on negative emotions are related to the development of emotional distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311431175">Anderson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311431175">Brincks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311431175">Garnefsky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311431175">Litman and Lunsford, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105311431175">Sanjuán et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>We must consider that the disease experience includes controllable aspects (basically those related to the treatment, like changes in diet and exercise), but also involves uncontrollable ones (mainly those related to being chronically ill and the limitations this may involve). Therefore, effective coping with cardiac disease would include the use of strategies focused both on primary control, which involves modifying the situation, and on secondary control, which involves modifying self-assessment of the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311431175">Heckhausen and Schulz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105311431175">Rothbaum et al., 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>Explanatory style is a cognitive personality variable that reflects how individuals generally explain the events that happen in their lives. The relatively stable tendency to explain negative events with internal (situation is attributed to something about oneself), stable (situation is a result of long-lasting causes) and global (cause affects different life areas) causes has been labelled as pessimistic attributional style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311431175">Abramson et al., 1978</xref>). Studies on this style were originated from the attributional reformulation of the learned helplessness theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311431175">Abramson et al., 1978</xref>) and its revision, the hopelessness theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311431175">Abramson et al., 1989</xref>), which proposed it as a vulnerability factor for developing depression when people are confronted with stressful situations.</p>
<p>The large number of studies conducted from both theoretical frameworks has shown that this style is linked to development of depression and depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311431175">Alloy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105311431175">Rueger and Malecki, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105311431175">Sanjuán and Magallares, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1359105311431175">Sweeney et al., 1986</xref>), as well as to poorer physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311431175">Dykema et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105311431175">Peterson et al., 1988</xref>). In relation to CHD, pessimistic attributional style has been shown to increase risk in older men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311431175">Kubzansky et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Some studies, failing to find effects when pessimistic attributional style has been used as a predictor, have however shown that different dimensions of this style are related to health when taken separately. Thus, high scores on stability dimension predicted death from CHD in men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311431175">Buchanan, 1995</xref>), and high scores on the globality dimension were associated with the highest risk for early death, especially among men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311431175">Peterson et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the features that define pessimistic attributional style, researchers have proposed that people manifesting this style may think that nothing can be done to diminish the likelihood of negative events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311431175">Peterson and Bossio, 2001</xref>), thus, dealing with situations ineffectively. The few studies that have been carried out, with healthy samples, have shown that pessimistic attributional style was negatively associated with active coping strategies and positively linked to ineffective emotion-focused coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105311431175">Reilley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1359105311431175">Sellers and Peterson, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers in this field have also proposed that one of the mechanisms linking pessimistic attributional style to poorer physical and psychological health may be coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105311431175">Peterson and Bossio, 2001</xref>). In fact, one study found that relationships between this style and depressive symptoms were mediated by the ineffective coping strategies used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105311431175">Sanjuán and Magallares, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In brief, pessimistic attributional style is associated with depressive symptoms and poorer physical health, including CHD. Said style is also related to use of ineffective coping strategies, which greatly affect the development of depressive symptoms in stressful situations. Moreover, depressive symptoms, which are common among heart patients, may worsen their prognosis.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, although pessimistic attributional style is an important predictor of depressive symptoms, and these worsen the diagnosis of CHD patients, the influence of this style on patients’ depressive symptoms has not yet been studied. Nor have the relationships between pessimistic attributional style dimensions and coping strategies been analysed in a sample of cardiac patients. Therefore, our main objective was to analyse the relationships between different pessimistic attributional style dimensions, coping strategies and depressive symptoms of people who had recently suffered a first episode of CHD.</p>
<p>According to the evidence and suggestions presented above, we expected different dimensions of pessimistic attributional style to be positively associated with depressive symptoms and ineffective coping strategies, and negatively related to more effective coping strategies. We also expected effective and ineffective coping strategies to be negatively and positively linked respectively to depressive symptoms. Moreover, we hypothesized that positive relationships between pessimistic attributional style dimensions and depressive symptoms would be mediated by coping strategies.</p>
<p>Given that pessimistic attributional style dimensions are considered as relatively stable features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105311431175">Reivich and Gillham, 2003</xref>), their effects would be expected to continue long after the cardiac event. Therefore, we also wanted to analyse, from a longitudinal perspective, the effects that the different attributional dimensions had on reported depressive symptoms of cardiac patients at a second time, eight weeks after the first data collection. We also expected different attributional dimensions to predict depressive symptoms at Time 2, even after controlling for Time 1 depressive symptoms.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1359105311431175">
<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>One hundred and sixteen people who had recently suffered an episode of CHD were recruited from the cardiac rehabilitation unit at a hospital in Madrid (Spain) on the first day of their cardiac rehabilitation programme. Patients who voluntarily chose to participate in the study were interviewed by one of the authors to collect socio-demographic data and rule out psychiatric disorders. Patients were included only if they had no history of psychotic symptoms (based on a structured face-to-face interview). Other serious illnesses were discarded before being referred to the cardiac rehabilitation unit. The hospital’s bioethics committee approved the protocol and a voluntary written informed consent was obtained from each participant after interview. Of these 116 patients, 17 were excluded, one for having a previous psychiatric history, and 16 for not speaking Spanish correctly. Thus, at Time 1, the sample was finally composed of 99 patients (13 women and 86 men), whose mean age was 54.2 (SD = 10.9), ranging from 22 to 81. The time between diagnosis and entry into the cardiac rehabilitation programme, when data were collected, ranged from 11 to 210 days, with a mean average of 37.1 (SD = 32.1).</p>
<p>Among the participants at Time 1, 27.2% had finished elementary school, 35.4% had finished high school and 37.4% were holders of a university degree; 18.2% were in employment; and 98% lived with their family (partner, children and/or other relatives).</p>
<p>Of the 99 participants at Time 1, only 92 (12 women and 80 men), answered the questionnaire at Time 2. The mean age of the sample at Time 2 was 54 (SD = 11.2), ranging from 22 to 81.</p>
<p>Participants who completed both phases of the study were compared, on demographic and psychological variables, to those who did not complete the Time 2 questionnaire. There were no significant differences in these variables between the groups (all <italic>p</italic>’s &gt; .2).</p>

<sec id="section4-1359105311431175">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>At Time 1, on the first day of their cardiac rehabilitation programme, and after signing informed consent forms, the patients were handed a booklet with the following questionnaires: <italic>Depressive Symptoms Subscale of Symptoms Check List Revised</italic> (SCL-90-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311431175">Derogatis, 1977</xref>; Spanish adaptation: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311431175">González de Rivera et al., 1989</xref>), <italic>Brief Coping Operations Preference Enquiry</italic> (B-COPE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311431175">Carver, 1997</xref>; Spanish adaptation: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105311431175">Pérez and Sanjuán, 2011</xref>), and <italic>Explanatory Style Questionnaire for Chronic Patients</italic> (ESQ-CP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105311431175">Sanjuán and Arranz, 2009</xref>). At Time 2, on the last day of the cardiac rehabilitation programme, eight weeks later, they were asked to report only their depressive symptoms again.</p>
<sec id="section5-1359105311431175">
<title>Depressive Symptoms Subscale of Symptoms Check List Revised</title>
<p>This subscale contains 13 items which assess affective, cognitive and behavioural components of depressive symptoms. Participants were asked to report how they felt over the past week in seven-point type Likert scales ranging from ‘0’ (‘Nothing’) to ‘6’ (‘very much’).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1359105311431175">
<title>Brief Coping Operations Preference Enquiry</title>
<p>This self-report assesses 14 coping strategies through 28 items. Participants were asked to report how often they used these different strategies to cope with their disease in four-point scales ranging from ‘0’ (‘I haven’t been doing this at all’) to ‘3’ (‘I’ve been doing this a lot’).</p>
<p>Although coping has traditionally been conceptualized as either problem-focused or emotion-focused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311431175">Lazarus and Folkman, 1984</xref>), recent research has found that coping strategies do not have a different impact on problems or emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311431175">Litman and Lunsford, 2009</xref>). Moreover, factor analytic studies have shown that COPE scales do not clearly load on problem- or emotion-focused factors. In particular, one of the factors obtained includes strategies oriented both towards primary (planning and acting), and secondary control (acceptance and more positive re-evaluation) of the problem. The other factor includes disengagement strategies (denial, avoidance and amplification of emotions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311431175">Carver et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311431175">Litman and Lunsford, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1359105311431175">Yi-Frazier et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In accordance with these proposals and results mentioned above, as well as the results of the factorial analysis carried out with current data, two scores labelled as effective (active coping, planning, positive reframing and acceptance) and ineffective coping strategies (venting, self-blame, denial and behavioural disengagement) were computed by averaging item scores corresponding to subscales which were included in each of these factors.</p>

<sec id="section7-1359105311431175">
<title>Explanatory Style Questionnaire for Chronic Patients</title>
<p>This self-report instrument is an adaptation of the Attributional Style Questionnaire by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105311431175">Peterson et al. (1982)</xref>, which contains six negative situations that chronic patients usually have to face. For each situation, subjects decide what they believe to be the major cause of the event. They then indicate the extent to which they would attribute these events to internal, stable and global causes on three separate seven-point scales. A rating of ‘1’ on the scales indicates an external (totally due to other people or circumstances), unstable (the cause will never again be present) and specific (the cause influences just this particular situation) attribution, while at the other end, a ‘7’ reflects an internal (totally due to me), stable (the cause will always be present) and global (the cause influences all situations in my life) attribution. Three scores were computed by averaging the six items corresponding to each of the dimensions (internality, stability and globality).</p>

<p>To test whether coping strategies were mediating variables linking attributional dimensions to Time 1 depressive symptoms, the procedure outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311431175">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref> was followed. According to the requirements of this procedure, only mediation effect of effective coping strategies on the relationship between the globality dimension and Time 1 depressive symptoms could be tested.</p>

<p>According to these results, the model finally accounted for 17% of the variance of Time 1 depressive symptoms. It can also be said that the positive relationship between the globality dimension and Time 1 depressive symptoms was mediated by the low use of effective coping strategies. The association between the globality dimension and depressive symptoms was reduced, but non-zero, indicating that effective coping strategies are a partial mediator.</p>
<p>To test whether the reduction in the relationship between the globality dimension and Time 1 depressive symptoms was significant, when effective coping strategies were included as a mediating variable in the regression model, the procedure outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1359105311431175">Sobel (1988)</xref> was followed. <italic>Z</italic> obtained through this test was 1.49 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Therefore, the positive relationship between the globality dimension and depressive symptoms was significantly reduced with the inclusion of effective coping as a mediator.</p>

<title>Attributional dimensions as predictors of long-term depressive symptoms</title>
<p>Several hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine whether attributional dimensions predicted Time 2 depressive symptoms after controlling for Time 1 depressive symptoms. Since globality maintained significant correlations with depressive symptoms at both times, we could test its predictive power. In another way, predictive ability of stability dimension was also tested because although it did not significantly correlate with symptoms at Time 1, it did at Time 2. Thus, Time 1 depressive symptoms were entered into the equation on Step 1, and stability and globality dimensions were separately entered on Step 2. The results of these regression analyses have been summarized in the last three columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1359105311431175">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>According to these regression analyses, the model that includes the globality dimension accounted for 45% of the variance in Time 2 depressive symptoms, while the model that includes stability accounted for 44% of the variance of these symptoms. The results show that globality significantly predicts the persistence of depressive symptoms at Time 2 after controlling for symptoms at Time 1. Stability also does, but only marginally.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main purpose of the current study was to determine the impact of the different pessimistic attributional style dimensions and coping strategies on the development of depressive symptoms in patients who had recently suffered an episode of CHD.</p>
<p>Our results showed that depressive symptoms both at Time 1 and 2 were negatively related to effective coping strategies, whereas they were positively associated with ineffective coping strategies and the globality dimension of pessimistic attributional style. Moreover this dimension was negatively related to effective coping strategies. Results that showed the positive relationship between globality dimension and Time 1 depressive symptoms to be partially mediated by low use of effective coping strategies were of greater interest, due to their novelty. On the other hand, our results also showed that stability and globality attributions predicted depressive symptoms maintenance at Time 2, after controlling for symptoms at Time 1.</p>
<p>In relation to coping strategies, these findings confirm, in a sample of CHD patients, that the use of active coping, the acceptance of illness and the positive reappraisal of the situation are associated with decreased depressive symptoms. While denying the existence of the disease, focusing on negative emotions, avoiding dealing with the disease and self-blame are related to the increase of these symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311431175">Auerbach et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311431175">Gallo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311431175">Garnefski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1359105311431175">Sanjuán et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding the globality attributions, the highest scores on this dimension are related to the highest scores on depressive symptoms at Time 1. This relationship was partially mediated by the reduced use of effective coping strategies. In other words, patients who make global attributions believe that when a negative life-changing situation, like suffering a cardiac episode arises, they usually expect further negative events to happen. This globality attribution is associated with reduced use of effective coping strategies, which, in turn, lead to increased depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is important to note that stability and globality attributions are associated with the maintaining of depressive symptoms in the medium term. Given that even low levels of depressive symptoms can be harmful, particularly among those with established disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311431175">Meijer et al., 2011</xref>), it is important to detect and treat these symptoms, as well as those factors that contribute to their development and maintenance. In this sense, the intervention should be aimed not only at reducing depressive symptoms, but also at the implementation of more effective coping strategies, such as active coping, acceptance and positive reappraisal. Similarly, the intervention must also be aimed at replacing stable and global attributions of negative situations with more unstable and specific explanations.</p>
<p>The fact that our results indicate that the globality dimension predicts depressive symptoms in both the short and medium term, seems to suggest that the association between the globality dimension and the highest risk for death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311431175">Peterson et al., 1998</xref>) could be mediated by depressive symptoms, although this proposal should be looked at in future research.</p>
<p>As in other studies that have separately analysed attributional dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311431175">Buchanan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105311431175">Peterson et al., 1998</xref>), in our study, internality has not been associated with depressive symptoms. Furthermore, although the correlation did not reach statistical significance, the association between internality and depressive symptoms moved in the opposite direction, that is, internal attributions tended to be associated with less reporting of depressive symptoms. We think that these inconsistent results in relation to the internality dimension could be due to its relationship with the control perception of the situation. Some findings suggest that only pessimistic attributions, which are also perceived as uncontrollable, are associated with depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311431175">Bruch and Belkin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311431175">Janoff-Bulman, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1359105311431175">Sanjuán and Magallares, 2009</xref>). Thus, internality, stability and globality attributions may be accompanied by either perception of or lack of control. The lack of relationships between internality and depressive symptoms in this sample could be due to the fact that patients who believed the cause of their illness to be internal could also be led to believe they had some control over it. Future studies should test not only whether controllability has a positive effect on depressive symptoms, but also whether it is differentially related to distinct attributional dimensions.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no doubt that pessimistic attributional style and depression are related. However, there is still controversy about whether pessimistic attributional style is one of the causes of, a consequence of or even a scar left by depression. In this context, it is possible that interpreting situations using a pessimistic attributional style can lead to uncontrollability feelings, helplessness and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311431175">Abramson et al., 1978</xref>). However, depression primarily brought on by ruminative thought, which interferes with problem solving, can also lead to uncontrollability feelings and pessimistic attributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311431175">Lyubomirsky and Nolen-Hoeksema, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Research in this area has shown that people free from depressive symptoms, but with a pessimistic attributional style, are more likely to develop these symptoms over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311431175">Alloy et al., 2006</xref>). But on the other hand, some studies seem also to support the idea that pessimistic attributional style could be a concomitant feature of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311431175">Gutkovich et al., 2011</xref>). Our current data do not allow us to shed a lot of light on this issue, because although we have shown that some attributional dimensions at Time 1 could predict Time 2 depressive symptoms, we do not know whether attributional dimensions scores remained stable, or if instead these dimensions decreased when the depressive symptoms were lower. Longer-lasting future studies, including more measures at different stages, measuring pessimistic attributional style at each of these stages, could help to clarify this controversy.</p>
<p>This study was subject to other mention-worthy limitations, besides those above. First, it would be advisable for future research to examine a larger sample of women. The current sample accurately reflects the actual proportion of men and women with CHD in Spain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1359105311431175">WHO, 2008</xref>); however, given that women reported more depressive symptoms than men, the study of analysed variables in a representative women sample could show the relationships among these variables much more clearly. Second, only self-reports have been used. Future studies should include more objective measures which may clarify whether attributional dimensions not only have an effect on depressive symptoms, but also on both disease development and recovery.</p>
<p>Despite these main limitations, this study provides new and interesting data about different effects of attributional dimensions and coping strategies on depressive symptoms in people with CHD.</p>
