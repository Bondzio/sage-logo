<abstract>
<p>In this article, the author critically examines <italic>The New York Times</italic> (<italic>NYT</italic>) representation of the Israel–Palestine conflict in the recent political contexts presented by US President Obama’s Cairo speech in 2009 and leader of West Bank, President Mahmoud Abbas’s, imminent claim to nationhood at the UN in 2011. The purpose of the case study is to establish a theoretical framework for the connection between media representation of conflicts and influence on intercultural communication and relations between various cultural groups. The analysis of the editorials, op-eds, and letters to the editor reveals that media representation of conflicts has deep implications for intercultural communication and relations, that representational politics allows for overrepresentation of dominant groups in the Israel–Palestine conflict context, that discursive use of conflict terms like ‘peace,’ ‘victim,’ etc., constructs particular identities that privilege dominant groups, and that there is unconscious projection of cultural expectations of the dominant groups in the discursive representation of the conflict.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The nature of conflict has become more complex, visible, connected, and creative in the world in the last two decades. Many of these conflicts arise from cross-cultural tensions, cross-border differing political goals, and presence of multi-ethnic, multi-religious populations contained within specific geographic boundaries. Media representations of these conflicts have, at the same time, become more sophisticated, instantaneous, multi-focal, predictable, hegemonic, ethnocentric, and ideology-laden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748048512454823">Hutcheson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748048512454823">Ross and Bantimaroudis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748048512454823">Roy and Ross, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748048512454823">Snow, 2007</xref>). Although there is more awareness for the necessity of peace journalism today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748048512454823">Hanitzsch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748048512454823">Lee and Maslog, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748048512454823">Lynch and McGoldrick, 2005</xref>), western media have continued to traverse a path of exacerbated conflict representation, negative portrayal of ‘others,’ excessive dramatization, disproportionate dependence on social and political elites, and perpetuation of war journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748048512454823">Roy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748048512454823">Roy and Ross, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Media representation influences various social aspects including politics, economics, and culture. As the world shrinks more and more with ever evolving technology, as communication about and across cultures become more accessible, media representations have significant power to shape opinions and influence perceptions about groups around the world. Scholarly debate has addressed influences of media representation in general (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748048512454823">Hall, 1997</xref>) without specific attention to intercultural communication in the context of conflict representation. This article addresses the gap in literature by conducting a critical discourse analysis of editorials, op-eds, and letters to the editor in <italic>The New York Times</italic> (<italic>NYT</italic>) in the context of the Israel–Palestine conflict representation in the newspaper as a case study. The purpose of the case study is to establish a theoretical framework for the connection between media representation of conflicts and influence on intercultural communication and relations between various cultural groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1748048512454823">
<title>Literature review</title>
<p>Representation is the complex process that symbolically embodies concepts, ideas, and emotions in order to produce, construct, and transmit meanings in society. Representation is one of the central practices that produce culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748048512454823">Hall, 1997</xref>). As part of the meaning-producing nature of representation, certain meanings are deployed at particular times and places, constructing knowledge about particular topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748048512454823">Foucault, 1972</xref>). This type of knowledge construction, often done through language use, is known as discourse. Discourses are effectively used by powerful groups and institutions in society to regulate conduct, construct identities and subjectivities, and describe how certain things should be thought about, practiced, and studied. Media organizations are one such powerful institution that has the power to influence knowledge, beliefs, values, social relations, and social identities.</p>
<p>The influence of media representations on social relations has a direct impact on intercultural communication and relations in society. This influence hegemonically facilitates particular identity formations within the contexts of history, economics, politics, and discourse. Moreover, media representation encompasses processes of ‘othering’ at strategic moments in their discourse. ‘Othering’ plays up differences between groups labeling the self as superior and the other as inferior and reinforcing and reproducing positions of domination and subordination. It is precisely at this intersection of media power, discourse, and intercultural communication that this study is situated. This study examines media representation of conflict to determine what types of influence it has on intercultural issues such as elements of identity formation, relations of power, uses of histories and political contexts, methods of ‘othering,’ and privileging of some cultures over others. These complex international issues that affect specific local cultures are problematic to begin with. In times of conflict, they become more convoluted and edgy with institutional, national, and international interests clouding representations. This study, thus, examines media representation of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in recent international political contexts as a case study to determine the types of group representations that are made available, the particular histories of the involved groups being recalled, and the discursive processes of representing relationships between and among groups involved in the conflict.</p>
<p>Based on Edward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048512454823">Hall’s (1976)</xref> work in establishing a valuable relationship between language and culture, it is useful to note that language helps define our cultural experiences mainly because it is hailed for its formal completeness and because individuals unconsciously project underlying expectations embedded in languages into their cultural experiences. Used in media representational practices, language imposes a kind of formality and unconscious embedded expectations of the dominant groups that create an added level of complexity to the discourses generated. This study helps uncover such formality of language and unconsciously projected western cultural expectations in the representations of the conflict between Israel and Palestine in the United States.</p>

<sec id="section3-1748048512454823" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The method used to analyze the data for this study is critical discourse analysis (CDA). Discourse analysis goes beyond the grammar and semantics and enables the capture of broader social, political, and cultural ideas communicated by a text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748048512454823">Fairclough, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1748048512454823">Wodak and Meyer, 2001</xref>). CDA is particularly useful as a methodological tool in unpacking textual data because it offers the researcher ways to incorporate the contextual and social issues within which texts reside. CDA is not only a tool of analysis but it is also a theory that acknowledges the constitutive nature of discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748048512454823">Fairclough, 2000</xref>). Discourses, such as of national identity, racial/ethnic/cultural superiority, etc., deploy particular meanings, values, and beliefs that contribute to the reproduction of social and cultural lives and reification of the status quo. For this study, analysis of the text needs to take into consideration the complex interplay of contexts including decades-old conflict between Israel and Palestine, many unsuccessful interventions by the United States, media representation in a US-based newspaper, and taut intercultural relations between the various stakeholders.</p>
<p>Media representation in the US is being analyzed in this study because ‘US media have long been understood to sculpt and lead global media discourses on international issues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748048512454823">Roy and Ross, 2012</xref>: 197). Editorials, op-eds, and letters to the editor in <italic>The New York Times</italic> (<italic>NYT</italic>) serve as the data for this study. The <italic>NYT</italic> is chosen for this study mainly because it has long been considered the US national newspaper of record influencing content in smaller newspapers across the United States and the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748048512454823">McCombs, 2004</xref>). The <italic>NYT</italic> serves as an important source of international news, providing an authoritative, elite voice in the matters of economics, politics, and cultural interactions and complexities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748048512454823">Sassen, 2001</xref>). Editorials are the site of the newspaper’s institutional ideological viewpoint with deep influences on public opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748048512454823">Zaller, 1992</xref>). Op-eds are written by selected contributors and generally appear opposite to the editorial page. The process of selection of contributors and appearance of articles is contingent on the newspaper’s ideological bent. Thus, both editorials and op-eds constitute influential discourse that needs examining within particular contexts. Letters to the editor are not examined as frequently as editorials and op-eds are. For the purposes of this study, letters to the editor serve as a rich source of discourse play in response to the editorials and op-eds examined. Although the appearance of letters to the editor in the newspaper is a nod to the value of public discussion in a democratic society, those that do appear exemplify representational politics inherent in media publications. The analysis of these letters to the editor takes into consideration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748048512454823">Jorgensen’s (2002)</xref> findings about the four rules for selection of letters to be published. They are the rules of relevance (if the responses align with what is already on the newspaper’s agenda), brevity (if the response encapsulates the most important points in fewer than 300 words), entertainment (if they deliver the punch), and authority (if they are written immaculately).</p>
<p>In order to examine how media representation of conflict has implications for intercultural communication, the data for this study come from two periods of intense debate in the Israeli–Palestinian dispute in recent years. The first time period covers four months commencing from the date President Obama gave a speech in Cairo, Egypt, seeking a new beginning with the Muslim world and questioning the legitimacy of the Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. The second time period covers four months from the week Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel visited the US at a time when West Bank President Mahmoud Abbas’s claim to Palestinian nationhood at the UN was looming. The flurry and intensity of the debate over these two contexts waned after the initial four months. Data for this study are analyzed at the level of the word, sentences, paragraphs and paragraph placements within the articles, the headlines, the descriptions of the op-ed authors, intertextuality, and the overall topical placements within each text selection. The dates for the first time period are 4 June–4 October 2009, which yielded two editorials, seven op-eds, and 40 letters to the editor, totaling 49 texts for analysis. The second time period covers 16 May–16 September 2011, which yielded four editorials, two op-eds, and 17 letters to the editor, totaling 23 texts for analysis. Overall, there are a total of 72 texts analyzed for this study.</p>

<sec id="section4-1748048512454823">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The editorials and op-eds identified for this analysis elicited a wide range of reactions in the form of letters to the editor from readers of <italic>The New York Times</italic>. The data reveal three discursive strands that demonstrate the ideological boundaries within which the texts operate. These three coded categories are strategic victimization, undefined peace, and we, they and the ‘Other.’ In order to clarify particular nuances in the text, the author has added emphasis in the samples of text in the following sections.</p>
<sec id="section5-1748048512454823">
<title>Strategic victimization</title>
<p>Although the immediate political context of the two periods of data collection is not the same, the editorials, op-eds, and the letters to the editor represent either Israel or Palestine as victims of the conflict situation at one point or the other. However, there were far more instances of Israel being represented or claimed as the victim in all three types of texts. The long-term suffering of the Israeli people, first, during the Holocaust and, now, as a result of an intractable state of conflict with Palestine, is made overt in a multitude of ways throughout the texts.</p>
<p>In the <italic>NYT</italic> op-eds as well as the letters responding to these op-eds, the idea of Israel as the victim is discursively used to justify three main issues. First, Israel and its people have been historically wronged and this alone justifies Israel’s reluctance to give in to most conflict negotiation conditions posed by Palestine or the international community. This is especially brought into the picture when there are suggestions for removing/retracting/dismantling the Israeli settlements in the West Bank area. For example, in an op-ed piece, the op-ed writer criticizes President Obama’s speech in Cairo and reminds everyone that,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>With all his references to the history of Islam and to its <italic>(questionable) ‘proud tradition of tolerance’ of other faiths</italic>, Mr. Obama never said anything about those Jews whose ancestors had been living in Arab lands long before the advent of Islam but <italic>were its first victims once rampant nationalism swept over the Arab world.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748048512454823">Aciman, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The discursive implication of the text is that Jews were persecuted the moment nations and national identities were established in predominantly Arab countries in Africa and the Middle East. The word ‘rampant’ works to belittle and delegitimize claims to feelings of nationalism people in the Arab populated countries could possibly have. In opposition, the text legitimizes nationalistic feelings Israelites have as victims of a world blind to their plight. Simultaneously, the text calls into question the idea of Islam being a tolerant faith.</p>
<p>The same sentiment is discursively reflected in the letters of response to the op-ed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748048512454823">Aciman (2009</xref>). ‘One cannot forget that nearly half the population of Israel is made up of refugees from Arab countries and their descendants’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748048512454823">Roumani-Denn and Roumani, 2009</xref>). In the big picture of international politics, economics, and culture, it makes strategic sense to designate/identify Israelites as refugees, a status of desperate, cornered, uprooted people who have the right to grow roots in the land now known as Israel.</p>
<p>Second, while the idea that Israel is the victim has been repeatedly used to elicit sympathy, provide discursively legitimized justification for venturing into disputed land also claimed by Palestinians, and recall specific cultural histories of persecution at the hands of Arabs, the idea that Palestinians are victims has been used in a strongly negative sense against them. According to the analysis of the text, Palestinians are portrayed as perpetually claiming victimhood as a crutch to get what they want in the dispute with Israel. The discourse indicates that the refugee status is unfairly used by Palestinians to precipitate anti-Israel feelings and deny Israel its rightful existence. This is evident in the following excerpt from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748048512454823">Harris’s (2009)</xref> letter to the editor in response to an op-ed article that was making a case for international attention toward the Palestinian refugee status:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>But the Palestinians became refugees, in <italic>large measure</italic>, because of <italic>bad choices they made</italic>, especially rejecting the 1947 United Nations partition plan and <italic>joining a war to destroy the new state of Israel</italic>. <italic>Has any war not produced refugees</italic>?… A separate definition of refugee eligibility has been created for Palestinians, <italic>allowing their descendants, without limitation,</italic> to fall under the purview of Unrwa, <italic>thus perpetuating a culture of victimization</italic>.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Deft and strategic use of language is found in this instance to construct the idea of victimization in a completely opposite sense to the one where Israel is deemed or claims to be the victim. In the text, ‘in large measure’ indicates how Palestinians should be held <italic>mainly</italic> responsible for contributing to their own misery. It is <italic>their</italic> ‘bad choices’ that lead them to the path of uncertainty that they find themselves in now. The implication of the word ‘choice’ is enormous. It subtly introduces the idea that Palestinians have all along had choices, that their conflict-ridden, desperate status need not have been and that this status is not a result of force and war brought on by Israel. It is a very powerful word that negates responsibility of Israel in contributing to the present condition of the Palestinians. There is also explicit accusation leveled at Palestinians in this text. They have chosen to wage war, ‘destroy the new state of Israel,’ made an unethical decision to pursue violence, and, thus, are inextricably associated with all the negative connotations that come with acts of violence. The reference to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) is a criticism directed at the international community that allows the resources and efforts of a world organization to be dedicated to the perpetuation of the idea of Palestine as the victim. There is a hint of sarcasm in this reference to suggest that UNRWA is being deliberately fooled into believing that Palestine is indeed the victim while victimhood is only a ruse to maintain unfairly manipulated, sympathetic world attention. Finally, the suggestion that Palestinians are ‘perpetuating a culture of victimization’ is a way to ascribe an identity inseparable from a number of very damaging associations. A perpetual victim gets his/her own way by making everyone else around them carry the burden of guilt for what has happened to them or what has been done to them unjustly. This becomes part of their identity and they fail to be proactive in seeking solutions to their own problems as a result. A culture of victimization then breeds entire generations of people who are happy to claim the identity of the victim in order to gain sympathy and help on a long-term basis. Since the Palestinians have settled into such a culture of victimization, the larger implication is that they will do nothing to bring peace to the conflict with Israel.</p>
<p>Overall, the discourse of victimization suggests strategic use of the idea to claim identities that suit Israel’s need for pathos from the international community and Israel’s need to blame Palestine for the lack of progress in resolving the conflict. All the uses of this particular strategy come from texts written by Israelites or Jews residing in the US and other countries. The <italic>NYT</italic> texts during the two timeframes of this study have no representation of the Palestinian viewpoint on the idea of victimhood. In the case of Israel, the identity of victim is avowed while the same identity is ascribed to the Palestinians to attain different political and ideological purposes and goals. In the next section, an unfinished, undefined discourse of peace is identified in the text to problematize textual and contextual manipulation prevalent in the data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1748048512454823">
<title>Undefined peace</title>
<p>In the text analyzed in this study, the two conflicting parties – Israel and Palestine – have repeatedly made reference to peace. Although the Palestinian voice is highly muted in this dataset, the few that are there refer to peace often. Given the very frequent presence and use of the word throughout the texts analyzed, a generally understood definition of peace could be expected to emerge. However, that is not the case. The term ‘peace’ turns out to be this amorphous, intangible, elusive, chaotic idea that none of the involved parties could seem to grasp.</p>
<p>Both in the first as well as the second context within which the data lie, peace is strategically left undefined. There are four different stakeholders who suggest peace as a way forward in resolving the conflict – the Americans, the Israelites, the Palestinians, and some Arab nationals. Representing the American viewpoint, one <italic>NYT </italic>editorial indicated pride in President Obama’s stand in the Cairo speech suggesting that he was responsible for ‘nudging Israel and the Palestinians into serious peace negotiations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748048512454823">
<italic>The New York Times</italic>, 2009</xref>). The editorial is critical of Israel, Palestine, and other Arab countries for dragging their feet in bringing peace to the region and full of praise for the American president for ‘nudging’ the parties to act. The term ‘nudge’ recalls imagery of a parent poking his/her belligerent child in public to rectify the child’s behavior. The metaphor suggests that the United States is this exasperated parent/adult who needs to constantly keep an eye on and correct the behavior of child-like nations. However, in all this, the focus on peace is lost. The focus is more on praising the American effort and proving once again how America is the one responsible party in this conflict.</p>
<p>The idea of peace is also used abundantly by Israelites residing in Israel, the US, and other parts of the world as represented in the <italic>NYT</italic> dataset. In fact, the texts from those claiming to be Israelites are much more forceful than the American viewpoint in their accusation of the Arab world and Palestine in botching peace processes historically and in denying Israel its existence. For example, one letter to the editor states, ‘It would put the focus for peace in the Middle East back where it belongs – on the failure of most of the Arab countries to recognize Israel’s right to exist and end incitement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748048512454823">Lewy, 2009</xref>). The discourse here suggests that Israel’s actions in terms of expansion of settlements and use of force can be viewed only as retaliatory and not as a cause of conflict. The real cause of the conflict is ‘incitement’ and provocation by Arab nations and their lack of investment in and failure of recognition of peace. Then again, there is no clarity on the issue of peace. It is a floating idea open to any interpretations mainly by economically, politically, militarily strong, and privileged countries such as Israel and the US.</p>
<p>In all the 72 texts analyzed in this study, there are only two instances of Arab writers from outside the US being featured. One of them, Prince Turki al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia, garners attention in the <italic>NYT</italic> op-ed entitled ‘Land first, then peace.’ He clearly points out that ‘Israel has never presented any comprehensive formulation of a peace plan’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048512454823">al-Faisal, 2009</xref>). This is the first and only mention of the lack of a definitive peace plan from Israel. In responding to calls for Saudi Arabia to lead a Sadat-like move to extend an olive branch to Israel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048512454823">al-Faisal (2009)</xref> writes,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt went to Israel in 1977… only after Sadat’s envoy… was assured by the Israeli foreign minister… that Israel would withdraw from every last inch of Egyptian territory in return for peace. Absent a similar offer today from Israel to the leaders of Palestine, Lebanon and Syria, there is no reason to look at 1977 as a model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The op-ed author provides description of what could constitute, in his opinion, a viable peace option and reciprocation between Saudi Arabia and Israel in order to accomplish part of a long-term path to peace in the region. The reference to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat’s visit to Israel in 1977 and the ensuing 16 months’ negotiations overseen by US President Jimmy Carter that culminated in the signing of a peace accord between Egypt and Israel at Camp David elicited a flurry of responses from readers in the form of letters to the editor. The discursive strategy of these responses is to discredit al-Faisal’s right to representation in the <italic>NYT</italic> and heavily critique Saudi policies instead so that attention is shifted from the requirements of an Israel–Arab peace plan to that of the banes of Saudi culture and society. One such letter states, ‘Prince Turki al-Faisal doesn’t mention another possible obstacle to Sadat-like reciprocal peacemaking visits by Saudi and Israeli leaders: the Saudi law banning visits to Mecca by non-Muslims’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748048512454823">Teaneck, 2009</xref>). This is an example of a red herring fallacy where the irrelevant topic of Mecca visits by non-Muslims is introduced in order to divert attention from the original issue of proposing alternative peace plans. The basic discourse suggests an attempt to ‘win’ the argument against anything written by al-Faisal. There is a derogatory dismissal of the suggestions made by al-Faisal as coming from someone who does not deserve respect due to the fact that his country does not demonstrate secularism and acceptance of other faiths in the Mecca grounds. Peace remains elusive in the readers’ response.</p>
<p>Finally, in the later period of data collection, there is a particular instance of back and forth between op-ed and letters to the editor that exemplifies the discursive trend of this particular category of findings where selective use of history leaves peace undefined, unqualified. In the entire dataset, there is only one representation of an op-ed written by a Palestinian. This distinctive honor went to President Mahmoud Abbas, leader of the West Bank and the Fatah movement. In this op-ed, President Abbas gives reasons as to why Palestine is about to claim nationhood at the UN General Assembly and what, according to him, is the correct interpretation of the conflict between Israel and Palestine:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Contrary to what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel asserts, and can be expected to repeat this week during his visit to Washington, the choice is not between Palestinian unity or peace with Israel; it is between a two-state solution or settlement-colonies. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748048512454823">Abbas, 2011</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are forced options in this discourse where the op-ed author proposes only strategic, selective choices that could lead to peace. Peace is used here as an alternative to the Palestinian claim for nationhood uniting the two parts, the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This is a presumption on the part of Mr Abbas about the Israeli approach to conflict resolution or, in other words, putting words in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s mouth. Such intertextual, discursive strategy renders the statement believable even if it is not articulated directly by the Israeli prime minister. In the process, the contingency of peace becomes more prominent and Israel’s stance rendered unreasonable.</p>
<p>In response to this op-ed, there were many strong words published in the letters to the editor. For example, one such letter states ‘I am surprised that you gave space and dignity to Mahmoud Abbas’s Op-Ed article. He talks about friendly, peace-loving nations, when his own people have, to this day, no intention of living in either friendship or peace with Israel’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048512454823">Klewansky, 2011</xref>). In this text, both friendship and peace remain undefined. The letter ridicules the <italic>NYT </italic>decision to publish the op-ed as if it is an inconceivable action on the part of the newspaper. In the process the letter also denigrates Mr Abbas suggesting that his voice is not worthy of ‘dignity.’ There is a sarcastic reference to the idea of ‘peace-loving nations’ as it is pitched directly against claims that the Palestinians are an unfriendly and violent lot. In this selection, peace remains scattered in meaning, utilized as a point of rebuttal and deployed to accuse and stereotype the people of Palestine.</p>
<p>The discursive utilization of peace throughout the texts examined for this study indicates that although there are no defined approaches, very few polemic plans, and lack of consistency offered by almost all of the stakeholders, the term is overwhelmingly used for the purposes of insinuation, selective recall of histories, and metaphorical and literal references to unfinished political processes of the past. In the next section, the texts reveal discursive separation between identities of Israelites and Palestinians in ways that privilege one and negate the other. Also incorporated in this discourse is the American and American-Jewish identities that provide a key element of differentiation affecting all involved parties.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1748048512454823">
<title>We, they, and the ‘other’</title>
<p>Issues of identities as represented in the data reveal a complex picture that has several discursive strategies in use at once. Several different permutations and combinations of identities come to the surface, several remain subtle and underlying but, all have political and cultural purposes and goals and ideological alignments. The identities can be divided into three groups – those who claim to be the ‘we’ are Americans, Jewish-Americans, Israelites residing in the US, and Israelites residing in Israel; those who are part of ‘they’ are Jewish-Americans referring to Israelites in Israel and other Arab countries, Israelites referring to Americans, and Americans, Israelites, and Jewish-Americans referring to Palestinians; and those who are referred to as the ‘other’ by all parties (except Palestinians) are almost always the Palestinians in general and the political group Hamas in particular.</p>
<p>The American identity association with ‘we’ demonstrates a forceful discourse in the texts examined. The identity exudes the confidence of leadership, the strength of economy of the country, the reach and clout the country enjoys in international politics, and the arrogance of an unchallenged, self-proclaimed superpower. For example, one editorial epitomizes these American identity associations. ‘The Americans have decided that a freeze is needed to show Palestinians and other Arabs that Israel’s conservative government is serious about peace’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748048512454823">
<italic>The New York Times</italic>, 2009</xref>). Here, the text suggests that the global leader America makes the most significant global decisions that the rest of the countries need to follow. It is the undisputed leader and others are mere followers. Here the unconscious projection of US cultural expectation to lead the rest of the world becomes evident in discourse. America is the spokesperson for Israel and Israel is content to play second fiddle as long as it is to Israel’s advantage. If the Americans are happy to step into the limelight and make grand announcements partially supporting Israel in front of a global audience, then it is to Israel’s advantage:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Israel’s political elite would breathe an unmerited sigh of relief, having once again pulled the wool over the eyes of its paymaster. The United States would be humiliated in the eyes of its friends, not to speak of its foes. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748048512454823">Judt, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While this op-ed is critical of American policies with regard to the Israel–Palestine conflict, it makes clear who is overall in charge of the situation. It is dismissive of Israel and puts the nation firmly in a subservient position by referring to America as the ‘paymaster.’ Moreover, the frustration indicated in this text does not emanate from the continued stalemate and lack of progress in the resolution of the conflict in the region but from the assumption that America will be negatively perceived in the world. What is of utmost importance is the embarrassment of being made a fool by Israel. This sentiment is reflected in a number of responses in the letters to the editor. One such letter talks about how America should ‘fashion regional policies in keeping with broader American strategic interests in the Middle East’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048512454823">Ayoob, 2009</xref>). The letter writer makes no attempt to mask the role of America in the region, upholding the leader, father-figure, supervisor identities.</p>
<p>Israelites in the US who feel it necessary to segregate themselves from the American identity are sometimes critical and sometimes laudatory about the relationship between the two countries depending on personal and group ideological, political, and cultural alignments and goals. Moreover, this type of discourse is reciprocated by Americans who are critical of Israeli policies in the West Bank:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It is strange that our president, a man so versed in history and so committed to the truth, should have omitted mentioning the Jews of Egypt. He either forgot, or just didn’t know, or just thought it wasn’t expedient or appropriate for this venue. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748048512454823">Aciman, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This extract is from an op-ed article entitled ‘The exodus Obama forgot to mention.’ The title gives a big hint that the rest of the article is about Obama’s omission in his Cairo speech in addressing Egyptian Jews, who were also displaced from their homeland. The reference to displacement as an ‘exodus’ provokes recall of biblical meanings associated with the word giving it more discursive power. The idea that the president simply forgot to mention the Jews in Egypt, sarcastically points to the callousness of the president and the brand of politics being played. It is a distinct effort to draw attention to the omission and create a position of separation with the American identity even while referring to the president as ‘our.’</p>
<p>Those who are part of the ‘they’ group would in other studies belong to the ‘other’ group. In this study, this group is an intermediate group accommodating the identities of Jewish-Americans referring to Israelites in Israel and other Arab countries. The strongest evidence of this identity play can be found in a letter to the editor in the context of Mahmoud Abbas’s demand for nationhood for the Palestinians:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It is not only a Palestinian state that is long overdue, as the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas rightly claims, but also a declaration of independence by American Jews that we will no longer be silent supporters of the Israeli policies of occupation that so clearly violate not only common sense, but also the ethical values of Judaism. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048512454823">Bender, 2011</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The discourse expresses the frustration of the Jewish-Americans who are critical of the Israelites in Israel. This text is one of the very few that is out and out critical of Israel especially in the letters to the editor dataset. In this text selection, there is an underlying admission of guilt for keeping silent about Israel’s handling of the settlements issue over the years. Evoking ethical considerations like good common sense and moral obligations of Judaism, the letter asserts Palestinians’ right to nationhood. Here again is an instance of unconscious cultural expectation projected through language. The writer feels the need to explain in clear terms his/her deliberate separation from the Israelites in Israel because, for the writer, there is an underlying cultural need to show support to fellow Jews worldwide no matter what his/her individual national affiliation is.</p>
<p>There are Americans referring to Israelites in the data where the Israelites are part of the ‘they’ group but, in this case, they show a more friendly and even-toned approach to criticism. For instance, one letter to the editor states,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It is obvious that there was a direct connection to what was happening in Palestine/Israel, with the great catastrophe being endured by the Palestinians who had been forced from their homes. This is not to say that the treatment of the Jews in Egypt was justified; two wrongs do not make a right. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748048512454823">Fike, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this text, the Israelites are held responsible for the Palestinian predicament quite gently. In fact, in the following sentence, the responsibility is discursively mitigated by highlighting the plight of the Israelites when they were displaced from Arab countries. The writer then carefully points to the fact that while the Palestinians may be suffering in the conflict, that does not justify actions by the Arab countries to make the Israelites suffer as well. This kind of justification reduces the impact of the Palestinian suffering to the reader.</p>
<p>The final group in this section is the ‘other.’ Different strategies of discursive ‘othering’ are employed in the texts analyzed. The main strategy used is to equate Palestinians with Hamas, label Hamas as an extremist and terrorist group, and denigrate the entire group based on that negative association. In response to the op-ed written by Richard Goldstone, the UN head of the Fact-Finding Mission on the 2006 Gaza Conflict, letters to the editor that were published in the <italic>NYT</italic> indicate the use of these strategies. Goldstone’s op-ed is very critical of Israel’s use of heavy shelling in the densely populated areas of the Gaza Strip during 2006:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>More disturbing, the Goldstone report has set a new standard for equating the behavior of democratic nations and terrorists. He makes no moral distinction between Israel, a United Nations member state, and Hamas, a terrorist organization that violently seized control of Gaza two years ago from the Palestinian Authority. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748048512454823">Sideman, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The letter refers to all Palestinians in the Gaza Strip as terrorists, has no mention of the Palestinian civilian casualties, prods Goldstone to make a moral judgment about the distinction between the good Israelis and the terrorist Hamas group, all the while equating Palestinians to members of Hamas. There is an intense process of negative stereotyping at play here.</p>
<p>Similarly, when Abbas’s op-ed is published in 2011 where he states that he is about to claim nationhood for Palestinians, there are letters to the editor that destroy the legitimacy of Abbas’s claim, belittle his promise to negotiate once they are acknowledged as a nation, and subvert the purpose of Abbas’s argument in order to blame all Palestinians as liars in essence. One such instance is when a letter writer uses a direct quote from Abbas’s article and ridicules the statement. ‘He adds that “once admitted to the United Nations, our state stands ready to negotiate all core issues of the conflict with Israel.” If you buy that one, I’ve got some unicorns for sale’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048512454823">Landa, 2011</xref>). The accusation here is that the lie told by Abbas that the Palestinians will negotiate with Israel when they become a nation attains fantasy proportions and can be equated to someone claiming to sell unicorns, a mythical horse-like animal. This discursive dismissal is used effectively as a strategy to ‘other’ Palestinians and has far-reaching implications for their identity development.</p>
<p>In this findings section, the various members who consider themselves to be part of a ‘we’ and who address particular groups as ‘they’ and the ‘other’ attach and detach themselves strategically to specific groups in order to continue an overall distinction between America/Israel and Palestine/Hamas. The first two are authentic nations while the last two are extremist, dangerous groups in disguise. The next section provides an overall discussion of these findings and concludes with implications for intercultural communication.</p>

<sec id="section8-1748048512454823">
<title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>There are three main threads of discussion that emerge from the findings. First, primary representational issues dealing with the <italic>NYT </italic>selection of op-eds and letters to the editor reveal an unbalanced, unequal relation of power between and among the various identities revealed in the texts. The editorials maintained a discourse of status quo throughout these two time periods. Second, during times of conflict, media representation strategies include utilization of conflict-related issues and terms to discursively construct positive self and negative ‘other’ identities, some of which stem from unconscious cultural expectations projected through language in discourse. Third, the discursive representation of identities of Israelites demonstrate that they enjoy a much wider latitude to go back and forth between several identity choices while the same is not afforded to the Palestinians. There are attempts to fix the Palestinian identities to two or three strategic ones that privilege Israel and America within the context of the conflict.</p>
<p>The op-eds and the letters to the editor predominantly represented the American or the Israeli points of view. There are very few voices from Palestine or any commentary from Palestinian-Americans. This representational politics suggests two things. First, the presence of so many Jewish-Americans and Israelites writing in to or for the <italic>NYT </italic>constructs an image of these people as part of the educated, elitist readership and contributors who are significantly more interested in issues of international politics and invested in the future of their respective homelands compared to people of other nationalities. Second, the near absence of Palestinian voices either as contributors or as readers responding to the editorials and letters paints the opposite picture of the group, where it seems disinterested, uneducated, and unworthy of opinions or responses. This type of strategic binary has the potential for deep and problematic influences in society, constructing specific stereotypes about particular groups, silencing the diversity of voices, and breeding more discontent and conflict orientation in the process. As a result, such media representational politics impacts intercultural relations and conflict negotiation in the long run.</p>
<p>Media representations through language project unconscious cultural expectations of the dominant groups on the meanings of particular conflict-related terms such as peace, victim, enemy, terrorist, etc. These terms absorb meanings specific to the dominant culture that has the power to deploy them. When used in media representation these meanings get precedence over all others. Since most of the writers encountered in the dataset are Israeli-Jews or American-Jews, it is their cultural takes on the terms that are privileged in media discourse. With different involved parties not privy to the cultural expectations of the other parties, the conflict negotiations and identity constructions remain permanently incomplete and intercultural relations are damaged heavily. One way to avoid misunderstanding of these unconscious cultural expectations is to make the democratic forum of letters to the editor a more diverse space for response to the institutional comments of the newspaper. The op-ed columns too need to incorporate a significant diversity of opinion instead of just those that are ideologically aligned to the newspaper. These efforts would truly contribute to the improvement of intercultural relations among diverse group members in the US and the world and, with the improvement of intercultural relations, mutually beneficial conflict negotiations can be accomplished.</p>
<p>Finally, all three discursive themes of the findings demonstrate that Israelites and Americans were able to slip in and out of various identities that strategically privilege them in particular contexts within the conflict. This leverage is not available to the Arabs and Palestinians, whose identities were pinned to a few negative ones ascribed by the Americans and the Israelites. There is religious, racial, and national identity privileging at work here. During different phases of conflict, privileging of one group’s identities over another in media representation has detrimental consequences for overall conflict negotiation purposes. Through such strategic reportage, inequality of relations is perpetuated and conflict situations get aggravated.</p>
<p>Based on the findings of this case study, it is clear that US media representations of conflict have significant implications for intercultural communication and relations between groups involved in the conflict both in the US and in the respective countries of the various groups involved in the conflict. Dominant groups and strategic alignments with dominant groups allow certain groups more access to positive representation compared to groups that are discursively ‘othered.’ Even usage of conflict terminology is strategic and laden with underlying unconscious cultural expectations of the newspaper and its contributors. Such discourses enhance chances of misunderstanding between groups already in conflict with one another. Powerplay and politics of representation underscore any discussion in media discourse. However, as the nature of hegemony goes, this same power and politics can be turned on its head to provide media consumers with the opportunity to push for inclusion of discourses from diverse groups that allow for greater democratic debates, more creativity in seeking conflict solutions, and deeper levels of engagement with and among people from different cultures. This article demonstrates that such an opportunity exists for both media owners/practitioners and media consumers to reduce the use of discursive practices that hinder conflict resolution and adopt ones that foster intercultural respect and understanding. With the growing presence of newer forms of media representation, there is hope for positive implications of media’s conflict representation on intercultural communication in the future.</p>
