<p>The two Asian giants, India and China, are undoubtedly the force to reckon with. After their long hibernation out of plundering colonial setbacks, these two nations are now retrieving their civilisational glory. With many commonness and of course differences, relation between India–China stands on antagonistic constructs…historically very close until the defiance of trust by China in 1962 that permanently fixed a big ‘if’ in the psyche of Indians. Though with enhanced aspirations in new world order, both India and China are constructively heading to defy all the adverse obstinate impediments, with wider framework to usher in a special kind of relationship, primarily based on economic interests. Indeed it’s a way forward to cope with the swiftly changing geo-politics…time now is to revisit the history, politics, economics and culture of these two superpowers with new insights but without burying the old prudence.</p>
<p>Raghav Bahl (Journalist, founder of Network18 Media) did this superbly with his scintillating views and meticulous documentation that easily led the readers to comprehensive realities of the race of dominance between the two powerful neighbours. This book, <italic>Superpower? The Amazing Race between China’s Hare and India’s Tortoise</italic>, presents the narratives, how India and China are going to make history within their own set of rules. China’s monolithic political system and India’s vibrant democracy, both with their pros and cons, are occupying a stout functional feet to show the resistance at global platform. Preface marks the distinction of Indian growth, which is statistically sluggish than China’s achievements…the title says it better, why don’t they get India?</p>
<p>Prologue of the book <italic>China and the Art of Escape Velocity?</italic> has a demystifying hold. Napoleon’s quote, which is an all time super remark, vehemently define China, and its inclusion completely fit here. Paul Krugman’s <italic>The Myth of Asia’s Miracle: A Cautionary Fable</italic> gives an ample back up for consideration on Raghav’s insistence over knowing closely the intricacies of Chinese miracle vis-à-vis the leaders of world economy. Albeit it will be overestimation to anticipate by the assumptions that who’s going to be swift and finally on crest—China’s Hare or India’s Tortoise…here is need to be adequately judgmental.</p>
<p>Which way will history turn? Raghav is exactly right in reminding the readers that history unfolds over several decades, perhaps even in fractions of centuries, and a search of perfect match of growth between these two countries will be an abrupt proposition. If China rebounded post financial meltdown with huge debt and vicious deflation side-by-side the weak demand and prices, India’s experience was much better with lower debt and modest inflation. It will be also worthwhile to know that India’s nominal GDP grew twice as fast as China’s for a few quarters; remarkably, it is a first such experience in last three decades. So, the notion of India, ‘who?’ seems eroding with a positive worldview for India story. Goldman Sach’s brainchild, BRIC (2001) strengthened the worldviews for India’s slot only next to the US and China in the years ahead…this sounds realistic, even when the author himself acknowledges the many odds in the way, but China is also not immune from adversities. For knowing better the fragility of Chinese growth, reading of Premshankar Jha’s scripture like work on China, <italic>Managed Chaos</italic>, gives the appropriate scenic realities behind the China’s miraculous growth!</p>
<p>‘The Race Begins’ is a catching nomenclature of a chapter inside the book which precisely relates to what the term exists between India and China. With big markets and sound indications, China and India have emerged as ‘shock observer’ after the global financial meltdown—may be their ties will shoot up, at least in economic arena, but chances are feeble that China will give India any space within the ambit of its ‘Asian solidarity’ block. This closeness of China naturally evolves the doubting stances over its intention but the aspiration for material growth is stronger than any other tantrums, so it is possible that China will maintain balancing ties with its closest competitor—India. Quotation of M.J. Akbar, ‘The language of conflict has passed its sell by date. The poor want to be part of the “Indian Rising Story”’ can be maximised here in Chinese context too.</p>
<p>The chapter ‘A Hare on Steroids’ delves with China’s downside of growth and its complex consumerism that yields many grave concern generally surpassed under the China’s complacent indicators. The next chapter, ‘A Tortoise with new Muscle’, inquisites the structural edge of India’s growth; here Stephan Rouch’s views give sublime touch. The next chapter, ‘Rule of Law, Rule by Law’, searches the base of Chinese Law in ‘Patriotism’—in fact, the Chinese state uses laws as policy instrument unlike Western democracies, where the principle of law is believed as supreme and all public policy to be implemented within the law. Here, a missing link is quite evident from China’s own experiment with a liberal system in 1912, after the fall of Qing dynasty…today China hardly carries even a tint of liberal vision of Sanayat Sen. Ahead of this, Raghav beautifully dwells with India’s democratic experiments along with a full overview of the Indian constitution. References of Bhagalpur incident of late 1980s and Olga Tellis (1981, Bombay) protests against the BMC ruling of eviction for pavement dwellers, present the uncomfortable face of our democracy. Next, a fine delineation has been made over the China’s story of virtual justice and the state of corruption in both the country…byline is too much sultry—My Scam is better than your Scam!</p>
<sec id="section1-097492841106800108">
<title>Geo-politics</title>
<p>Niall Ferguson’s brainchild CHINMERICA or Journalist Joshua Ramo’s coined term ‘Beijing Consensus’ to draw the attention on how China has maximised its stature and outgrew the ‘Washington Consensus’ in investments, aid and trade to Africa appears too much apprehensive from Western perspectives. China gave lease to such expectations by spending over $55 billion during the 2010 Shanghai World Expo to remind the world that its economy remained unscratched from the grave financial recession of 2008. Undoubtedly, such showing of China and to an extent of India has rearranged the world of an Eagle (USA), a Dragon (China) and Elephant (India).</p>
<p>Though this book adequately covers India’s landmarks in foreign and strategic affairs, it scrimps on a detailed take of China’s potential role in India–Pakistan and India–Nepal relations. China’s Cold War era complexes are hardly fading away despite all the progress; it should be India’s primary concern to leverage China for an all-round collaboration because it is alone, and China tolls around half of India’s strategic attention. India knows much better that the tag of ‘Sleeping Tiger’ is a thing of the past for China under the new ambition and feeble moral restraint.</p>
<p>The third part of the book ‘Entrepreneurs, Consumers and English speaking’ is naturally Indiacentric; remarks of George Soros on India are as follows:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Your entrepreneurs have built world class companies which I simply don’t see in China…such views are common placed. India also has edge with demographic dividend and systemic transparency…the worst thing happened in China that its communal enterprise turned into cronyism. Still India is away from such large scale coercive methods to achieve quick and visible success…noticeable is the fact, era of Sanjay Gandhi never repeated in India unlike the Deng Xiaoping’s tracts that kept flowing relentlessly in China. China’s capitalism is complex and ambiguous; most of its enterprise is in state control or owned by the party organs and theirs command.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The fourth part of the book ‘Urbanization and Infrastructure’ presents a sound comparison between India and China on very important issues. Here, China has lead with its single-minded strategy on building infrastructure…India is now too following the big dreams with emphatic eagerness, the next few years will bring some level playing in this regard. The concluding part of the book revolves around ‘Social Infrastructure’—Raghav has succeeded to make his point that Chinese consumerism is on peak under the better equitable economic arrangement of China. The Indian case is of 50-50 market, which leading historian Ramchandra Guha said on India’s experiment with market reform…book ends with such conclusion.</p>
<p>At some front, China has edge but it is grappling with many serious systemic flaws unlike India, where democracy is vibrant and freedom of action is inherent. Years ahead will be very vital for both India and China…these two nations are now naturally placed to lead the world. If these two nations can collaborate in fresh spirits, their dominance will be enhanced many folds. More and more understanding of Chinese policies are needed…work of Raghav Bahl is promising in this regard—addition of knowledge on China will be remain worthwhile from Indian perspectives…after all, we are now aspiring for new dimensions in our relationship.</p>
