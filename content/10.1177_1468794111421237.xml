<p>This human, humane and graceful monograph reflects upon what we do ‘as seen through the eyes of another human observer intent not only on helping us to see but helping us to understand’(Wolcott, 2009: 104). Walcott writes ‘not for professional writers but for professionals who must write’(p. 3), and in that phrase he seems to sense the anxieties and uncertainties of researchers who know that they must inevitably write, write better or write more. In response, he is both practical and reassuring. This is an important aspect of the book’s usefulness and appeal, that Wolcott articulates the dissatisfaction and self-doubt that can afflict researchers who have to write. Behind the conversational style there is no indulgence but an understanding of situations and of the need for occasional implied admonition. Although he will continue to make a strong appeal to researchers who are still finding their way, he also distils the wisdom and accrued knowledge of a long career into new insights and perspectives for more experienced professionals. As well as taking a refreshingly direct approach to known processes, practices and problems he also reassesses orthodoxies and (for me at least) raises what former Defence Secretary Rumsfeld termed ‘things we don’t know that we don’t know’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468794111421237">US Department of Defence, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The scope of the book reflects the breadth of the target audience, from encouragement to begin writing at the earliest stage of research – or even earlier – to preparation for publication and, indeed, rejection. Wolcott is ready to shine helpful light into the darker, less fulfilling aspects of what we do; ‘never allow yourself the luxury of total despair’ (p. 153) such as may follow a publisher’s rejection. His advice to write early before seeking a publisher is, as he acknowledges (p. 157), at variance with Woods, whose advice ‘to seek whatever guarantees of publication may be on offer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468794111421237">Woods, 2006</xref>: 153), feels more pragmatic and somehow safer.</p>
<p>That this book has wide usefulness and applicability from novices to more seasoned professionals is clear from its appearance in a third edition, about which Wolcott is touchingly modest: ‘manuscripts can always be improved (yes, this one too; how many more editions to get it ‘just right’?)’(p. 108). The appeal of the book, since usefulness and applicability are excellent but not of themselves sufficient, lies in its relatively informal style and the persona of the narrator. Wolcott warns us that we may find his style ‘casual, occasionally meandering, perhaps at times disconcerting’ (p. xiii). Reading this in the preface feels almost like a mischievous invitation, but towards the end of the book he reflects, ‘I have tried to avoid the authorial voice or tone of the textbook writer that might make this monograph read like a classroom text’ (p. 165). The success of his efforts is pretty much guaranteed when he can write, ‘Some of the best advice I’ve ever found for writers happened instead to be included with the directions for assembling a new wheelbarrow’ (p. 93). This is almost literally down to earth. In other places the informality is more studied: ‘let me suggest’, ‘I was amused to discover in Howard Becker’s neat little book . . .’ (p. 12) but it is no less engaging for that. The point is made early on when he says, ‘Although I do not write with natural ease, I have learned what it takes to produce (final) copy that may make you think I do.’</p>
<p>The narrator persona, then, approaches us with informality and integrity, showing us, if we care to look, how it might be done, establishing trust and confidence in a guide who has clearly achieved a degree of eminence and recognition (‘I command a vista of trees and hills’) but who (like us?) used to write ‘with a Bic pen on yellow lined paper’ (p. 10). The tone and the persona are essential to the delivery of a practical, encouraging and trustworthy approach, which early on declares, ‘I am not going to try to convince you that writing is fun’ (p. 5). The tribute to Harry F Wolcott is that we stick with him beyond this, not least because he also enacts the humanity that he enjoins upon the rest of us.</p>
