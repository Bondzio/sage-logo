<p>How can teachers best help their students understand harmony and how it works? Here are some basic strategies that have worked well in Colorado.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A large part of a person’s ability to enjoy the aesthetic qualities of music is the degree to which he or she understands the elements of music.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0027432112469539">1</xref></sup> Among the elements required to develop a comprehensive understanding of music, a student’s ability to perceive, recognize, and label the harmonies he or she hears is essential.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0027432112469539">2</xref></sup> Whether you are a teacher who conducts a large ensemble, a music theorist, a general music teacher who teaches beginning aural skills, or anything in between, you more than likely have thought about how to increase your students’ understanding of functional harmony. Regardless of the instructional setting, the ability to effectively teach students to recognize and manipulate elements of functional harmony remains elusive for many music teachers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0027432112469539">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Harmonic dictation is among the strategies that teachers have traditionally chosen to help their students develop harmonic awareness. However, the highly idiosyncratic ways that students approach harmonic dictation have often left music teachers at a loss for well-developed strategies to make this a transparent task for students. As noted by theory pedagogue William Lake, teachers should be aware of the potential for students to use varying dictation and perception strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0027432112469539">4</xref></sup> Among the dictation strategies suggested by Lake is to teach students to use arpeggiated singing to identify functional chords heard during dictation exercises. Building on this idea, this article seeks to expand the strategies available to secondary music teachers by presenting (a) a system of singing arpeggiated chords to guide and increase student accuracy through harmonic dictation exercises, (b) a set of part-writing procedures to help students cognitively organize common part-writing strategies, (c) a brief review of the research that supports the strategies described, and (d) potential applications of this model in large-ensemble instruction. The ultimate goal of this article is to help teachers demystify the process of how to teach harmonic awareness as an essential tool to improve students’ musicianship in music theory courses and performance ensembles.</p>

<title>Arpeggiated Singing</title>
<p>Arpeggiated singing is a strategy that has been recommended by many experienced aural skills teachers to enhance a student’s ability to hear and internalize harmonic patterns;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0027432112469539">5</xref></sup> the system discussed here focuses on the solfège singing of inverted arpeggiated functional chords that emphasize the tonic pitch of a key. In an effort to keep students aware of where tonic is, harmonies are sung one pitch at a time, starting with the note closest to the fundamental pitch of the key. What follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0027432112469539">Figures 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0027432112469539"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0027432112469539"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0027432112469539"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0027432112469539"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0027432112469539"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0027432112469539"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0027432112469539">8</xref>) is a list of all seven basic triads and seventh chords using this system.</p>

<p>Listed here is a suggested step-by-step sequence for applying this method, which can be shortened or lengthened depending on how well the students grasp the concepts.</p>
<list id="list1-0027432112469539" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Step 1 (Weeks 1–2):</italic></bold> Students, as a part of daily sight-singing, hear the teacher play I–IV–V–I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0027432112469539">Figure 1</xref>) on the piano, tonicising the key they will be singing in (i.e., establish tonic–subdominant–dominant relational awareness). Students concurrently sing the representative arpeggiated harmonies (see previous figures) that match what they are hearing the teacher play on the piano.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Step 2 (Weeks 3–5):</italic></bold> After introducing basic theory fundamentals including key signatures and treble and bass clefs, the teacher introduces all seven basic major arpeggiated harmonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0027432112469539">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0027432112469539">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0027432112469539">7</xref>) listed previously (including V<sup>7</sup>), always having the students sing as a group while they hear the harmony being played. From this point on, students should sing all seven basic major harmonies daily as a class as the teacher plays them on the piano. The teacher should frequently model alone before the students sing each arpeggiated harmony at this point. Gradually, the timing or “exercise” shifts to where the students sing with the teacher and then eventually without the teacher. It is important that students start doing simple root-position (I–IV–V<sup>7</sup>–I) harmonic dictation exercises while singing at this point. During the first few weeks, students need only to write the Roman numeral of the chord, notate the bass and soprano notes, thus starting with only the outer shell.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Step 3 (Weeks 6–10):</italic></bold> After introducing basic part-writing techniques (e.g., use of four-voice harmony in treble and bass clefs, voice leading to the nearest tone, and avoiding voice crossings), the teacher introduces part-writing procedures (see the following) gradually as the students encounter them in their harmonic dictation exercises. The part-writing procedures are meant to give students a framework to use while doing four-part dictation. Students begin to part-write all four voices during harmonic dictation. Pair weaker students with stronger ones at this point and allow them to work slowly to develop an understanding of unknown clefs, spelling triads, and singing of harmonies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Step 4 (Weeks 11–13):</italic></bold> Teacher introduces all seven basic arpeggiated basic minor harmonies listed previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0027432112469539">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0027432112469539">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0027432112469539">6</xref>) and has students sing them daily. The same process is repeated for minor as for major during week 3, restricting the students to only introducing basic minor harmonies. The teacher should at this point alternate major and minor exercises, completing four to five exercises per class period. During week 7, the length of harmonic dictation exercises should increase from two measures to four to eight measures.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Step 5 (start Week 3):</italic></bold> Using Roman numerals, students begin to label basic underlying harmonies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0027432112469539">Figure 1</xref>) for sight-singing exercises they sing in class, increasing in complexity as the students become aware of more chords. Teacher introduces the singing of seventh chords in minor keys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0027432112469539">Figure 8</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>Step 6 (Week 14 and beyond):</italic></bold> Students continue to encounter longer and more complex harmonic dictation exercises. During this time, inversions are introduced during harmonic dictation. By this point, students should know all part-writing procedures and feel comfortable hearing, singing, and labeling all seven basic arpeggiated harmonies in major and minor. Starting during this time, students should be gradually required to sing arpeggiated harmonies alone, followed by the class echoing the harmony sung by the individual using a call-and-response format.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The approach described previously is a moveable <italic>do</italic> system with the minor patterns starting on <italic>la.</italic> While many ways of teaching harmony have merit, this system appears to work best for beginners because it promotes the stable recognition of melodic intervals between major and minor tonalities. For example, “<italic>do</italic> to <italic>mi</italic>” is the same major-third interval in major as it is in the relative minor key. The fact that the syllables hold the same relative position between major and minor tonalities helps students develop a strong sense of relative pitch. Additionally, by holding intervals between scale degrees in both tonalities consistent, this system emphasizes scale-degree recognition.</p>

<title>Part-Writing Procedures and Arpeggiated Singing</title>
<p>Another strategy that can assist students in their ability to succeed while doing beginning and intermediate harmonic dictation is to introduce a set of part-writing procedures. The following system of four procedures complements the arpeggiated singing system by emphasizing the holding of common tones when possible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0027432112469539">
<title>Procedure 1</title>
<p>When two chords in root position have their roots a fourth or a fifth apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0027432112469539">Figure 9</xref>),</p>
<list id="list2-0027432112469539" list-type="alpha-upper">
<list-item><p>Keep the common tone, and move the other notes stepwise to the nearest chord tones of the nearest tones of the second chord.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>Keep the common tone in the same voice, and let the third of one chord skip to the third of the other. This is particularly common in Bach chorales.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Give up the common tone, and let the second chord have three roots and a third.</p></list-item>

<title>Procedure 2</title>
<p>If a chord is repeated, the soprano usually changes and the inner voices may skip anywhere as long as they maintain correct doubling and spacing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0027432112469539">Figure 10</xref>).</p>

<list id="list3-0027432112469539" list-type="alpha-upper">
<list-item><p>Keep both common tones. The other voice goes stepwise to the nearest tone in the second chord.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Give up the common tone and let the three upper voices move in contrary motion to the bass.

</fig>
<p>When students can sing arpeggiated syllables representing the harmony that they hear, they can apply that knowledge as a foundation to understanding the aforementioned part-writing procedures. For example, in procedure 1A it says to keep the common tone and move the other three voices in contrary motion to the bass. If the chords are I and IV, then the student sings (<italic>do–mi–sol–mi–do—do–la–fa–la–do</italic>) and recognizes that the common tone is <italic>do</italic> and that <italic>mi</italic> and <italic>sol</italic> move in contrary motion to the bass. The melding together of the two systems, one aurally based and the other analytically based, beautifully combines to form a comprehensive understanding of harmonic function that can be used to enhance a student’s ability to do harmonic dictation and to listen to voice leading in other parts when performing in an ensemble.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0027432112469539">
<title>Chunking</title>
<p>The effectiveness of this strategy is supported by research done by cognitive psychologist John Sloboda, who highlights an individual’s cognitive ability to combine large amounts of tonal information into manageable pieces in a process that he calls “chunking.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0027432112469539">6</xref></sup> As stated by music theorist Elizabeth Marvin while synthesizing the work of Sloboda:
<disp-quote>
<p>Musicians are conditioned to chunk melodies by harmonic function even when they practice arpeggios on their instruments—a common technical exercise. Although this cognitive strategy might not be explicitly articulated to music students in their early years of instrumental study, continued involvement with the harmonic language of tonal music in performance, sight-reading, and memorization enables experienced performers not only to infer a tonal center from a melody as it is heard, but also to be able to group leaps within triads and even to infer implied harmonic progressions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0027432112469539">7</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Marvin concluded that “students need to develop a flexible memory retrieval system that is capable of both interval and scale-degree information.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0027432112469539">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, cognitive psychologist Jay Dowling found that musicians with moderate experience used a scale-degree system when dictating melodies and tended to use an approach that was flexible between interval and scale-degree identification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0027432112469539">9</xref></sup> The harmonic system proposed here provides a strong strategy for scale-degree identification.</p>
<p>By combining the elements of tonal center, melodic interval in a harmonic context, and the consistent treatment of triads between major and minor tonalities, first- or second-year students are presented with an opportunity to develop a strong aural understanding of basic harmony. For example, by singing inverted chords rather than chords in root position, the listener keeps the tonic as a strong point of tonal reference and can travel to subsequent chords while still hearing the tonic pitch. Second, chunking occurs when students sing arpeggiated syllables that represent a single harmony played on the piano. Third, when using a <italic>la</italic>-minor and a <italic>do</italic>-major, students learn a system that keeps syllables consistent between tonalities rather than using different syllables to represent identical intervals, as is the case when using <italic>do</italic> for both the starting pitches in major and minor.</p>
<p>Three elements of this approach to harmonic awareness can assist students’ musical skills in a variety of settings. First, the vast majority of tonal melodies have recognizable implied harmonies. Psychologist and cognitive scientist Lola Cuddy found that even listeners’ ability to detect errors “in intonation in a melody” or “melodic intonation” is affected by their ability to perceive underlying harmonic function.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0027432112469539">10</xref></sup> Marvin explicitly calls for arpeggiated singing in the following statement:
<disp-quote>
<p>Classroom exercises designed around arpeggiations of triads and seventh chords in functional harmonic progressions reinforce scale-degree representations; they explicitly teach students to hear the underlying function of melodic arpeggiations, and teach students to group pitches by harmonic function.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0027432112469539">11</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The second element that assists in the recognition of scale-degree recognition is the singing of discrete pitches when singing arpeggiated harmonies. For example, when singing V<sup>7</sup> (<italic>ti, sol, ti, re, fa, re, ti</italic>), the fact that the top note of this arpeggiation is <italic>fa</italic> helps the listener to recognize it as a distinct aural image. It has been my experience that <italic>fa</italic> is one of the hardest scale degrees for students to hear when dictating melodies or sight-singing. This way of singing arpeggiated harmonies provides the student a useful strategy for hearing a difficult pitch in a common harmony. An additional benefit here is that since the V<sup>7</sup> arpeggio centers around <italic>ti</italic>, the tritone distance between <italic>ti</italic> and <italic>fa</italic> can become apparent. If students can be trained to hear scale degrees while using implied harmonies, they have begun to develop the tools needed to be musicians with strong listening skills.</p>
<p>Third, chunking can also serve as a means for increasing musical memory through the use of broken-chord singing. As you can see in the following melodic example of “Greensleeves” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0027432112469539">Figure 13</xref>), the first nine notes of the melody can be “chunked” into two chords; minor I (<italic>la–do–mi</italic>) and major VII (<italic>ti–sol–ti–re–ti</italic> in E natural minor) or major V (<italic>ti–sol–ti–re–ti</italic> in G major) if you analyze the melody as modal mixture. Either way, with the strategy of arpeggiated singing in place, students can increase their musical memory by “chunking” nine discrete pitches into two manageable, harmonically informed parts.</p>

<sec id="section8-0027432112469539">
<title>Students Sing Together</title>
<p>One of the unique aspects of having students singing together is that students with a more developed sense of tonal perception lead the way, providing less developed students with a model for self-improvement. This strategy of group singing uses what Russian-born psychologist and prominent learning theorist Lev Vygotsky calls the zone of proximal development, or ZPD.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0027432112469539">12</xref></sup> The ZPD refers to a range of tasks that are too difficult for an individual student to master alone but that can be mastered with the guidance and assistance of adults or more skilled peers. Thus, the lower level of the ZPD is the level of problem solving reached by a student working independently. The upper limit is the level of thinking the student can accept with the assistance of an able instructor or peer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0027432112469539">13</xref></sup> By having students sing together, the student with a less developed ability is more likely to perceive harmony simply by participating in the same harmony-finding task with a more developed student. If there is no student who has the ability to perceive harmony, the teacher can fulfill this role until a student emerges with this skill. It is likely that most students from grade 4 through the sophomore year in college would have the ability to perceive harmony by using arpeggiated solfège singing. However, students must be taught to sing using solfège and be introduced to arpeggiated solfège singing for at least a couple of weeks prior to this strategy becoming useable.</p>
<p>This is not to say that students should always sing as a group. Students must be expected to demonstrate the ability to sing alone and to individually demonstrate the ability to sing arpeggiated harmonies after reasonable exposure and group drill. Students who can sing even basic arpeggiated harmony have demonstrated that they have internalized the ability to perceive harmony and with further practice can develop the skill of individually recognizing and notating harmonies. A useful strategy once students have internalized the ability to sing at the very least I–IV–V<sup>7</sup>–I is to have the students start to verbally improvise different harmonic progressions by adding ii or vi chords. For example, asking the students to choose a chord to fill the harmonic progression in the following example can dramatically help to develop their perception and recognition of tonal harmony.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I (<italic>do–mi–sol–mi–do</italic>)—IV (<italic>do–la–fa–la–do</italic>)—[Fill in the blank]—V<sup>7</sup> (<italic>ti–sol–ti–re–fa–re–ti</italic>)—I (<italic>do–mi–sol–mi–do</italic>)</p>

<p>When compared with specific music theory instruction, the availability of time to include music theory concepts during large-ensemble instruction can certainly be limited. However, the incorporation of a limited amount of arpeggiated singing (e.g., steps 1, 2, and 5 listed previously) in an ensemble context may produce benefits well beyond what might be expected. For example, music researcher Gary McPhereson found that weaker musicians have more difficulty connecting the sounds they hear to the sounds that they perform on their instrument.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0027432112469539">14</xref></sup> Enhanced harmonic awareness as a result of arpeggiated singing may indeed help students develop musicianship and performance skills by strengthening aural connection. Moreover, students that are attentive to harmony can better discern tension and release when listening to melodic lines<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0027432112469539">15</xref></sup>—an implication that could help develop the phrasing ability of ensemble members.</p>
<p>Perhaps the widest possible application of developing music theory knowledge, of which harmonic awareness is one part, would be to help ensemble teachers address the more neglected National Standards (i.e., Standards 3–6).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0027432112469539">16</xref></sup> Developing a knowledge of harmony could help to scaffold students’ ability to achieve Standard 3 (improvising melodies, variations, and accompaniment) by giving students the tools to construct accompaniments for simple melodies, Standard 4 (composing and arranging music within specified guidelines) by teaching students how to recognize and label harmonies, Standard 5 (reading and notating music) by encouraging audiation as well as the ability to label harmonies, and Standard 6 (listening to, analyzing, and describing music) by developing analytical skill. Incidentally, regardless of the depth of the student’s understanding, developing harmonic awareness can benefit a student’s ability to understand, perform, compose, improvise, read, and experience music on a deeper level.</p>

<title>Sing It First!</title>
<p>In terms of teachers enhancing harmonic awareness and understanding of their own students, Marvin states that “in cases where a particular strategy is clearly more effective, teachers need to guide students toward that strategy.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0027432112469539">17</xref></sup> The combination presented here of aural arpeggiated singing and analytic part-writing procedures is one such strategy. The strength of this approach is in the connection that it makes with what a developing musician hears. The student tries out a sung harmony to attempt to match what he or she is hearing, and if it does not seem to match, a search goes on until one is found that does. Even when progressing to intermediate chromatic harmony, students can still rely on their in-depth understanding of basic harmony as a signpost or marker in which to refer. Once, a young musician went to a clinic given by trumpet player Randy Becker. When it was time for the student to play for him, Becker said, “Sing what you want to play.” The student hesitated, and Becker stated, “Never once in all of my years as a musician have I been asked to play something and I didn’t have the opportunity to sing it first. Singing is where it’s at.” Common to the understanding of most instrumental, choral, and music theory teachers, singing is where it’s at for developing musicianship, and the framework offered here is a powerful tool for the development of harmonic awareness and aural musicianship skills.</p>
