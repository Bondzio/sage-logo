<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, technology has become an important resource in our everyday lives. Technology also plays a role in interaction, specifically in institutional settings. Early studies on interaction and technology date back to the late 1980s and early 1990s where, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750481313476776">Heath (1986)</xref> looked at computers in doctor–patient interaction and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750481313476776">Whalen (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750481313476776">Zimmerman (1992)</xref> looked at interaction between a caller and call-taker at emergency dispatch centres where the call-takers managed talking and operating the dispatch centre simultaneously. Today we see how new technologies are manifested in talk all around us.</p>
<p>Not only new and advanced technologies play a role in today’s workplace; nurses fill in their patients’ charts while talking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750481313476776">Jones, 2009</xref>), anthropologists are moving around colour cards while asking questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750481313476776">Goodwin, 2000</xref>) and beauty parlor employees are plucking eyebrows while telling stories to customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750481313476776">Toerien and Kitzinger, 2007</xref>). How human beings seem to be capable of performing multiple activities simultaneously, but also how participants orient to physical objects such as a computer that play a major role in any number of workplace settings, are questions that will keep conversation analysts at work. In a world where technological tools and applications are ever increasing, it is necessary to understand how speakers interact with – or use technology – in talk to accomplish social action.</p>
<p>One such setting where computer tasks are combined with talking is the Dutch police interrogation setting. In the Netherlands, the officer types up the suspect’s story while interrogating. Dutch interrogations with suspects differ from those in the UK or Australia as they are often not tape- or video-recorded (e.g. UK: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750481313476776">Haworth, 2006</xref>; Australia: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750481313476776">Heydon, 2005</xref>). Dutch interrogations also differ from, for example, American interrogations as the police record is typed up during the interrogation, and not afterwards (US: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1750481313476776">Shuy, 1998</xref>). The interrogations that were used for this research were not recorded by the police, but were only recorded by the researcher for research purposes.</p>
<p>Different institutional tasks are being accomplished in the Dutch police interrogation: from filling in required paperwork, to getting the confession on paper, to editing the text in order for the suspect to agree with the written statement. All these different phases have different goals and go hand in hand with different typing practices. The intertwining of these activities in the various phases is of interest because it demonstrates that these two activities and the way they influence and structure each other in interaction are related to the institutional goal of that phase. Subsequently, this may have an effect on the product that is being constructed – the police record.</p>
<p>Before we look at how talk and typing are intertwined, I will first describe the data and method used, and then elaborate on the different phases of the police interrogation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1750481313476776" sec-type="methods">
<title>Data and method</title>
<p>This study is based on 14 police interrogations that were recorded in 2007 and 2008 in the Netherlands and the police records that were drawn up based on these recordings, as well as additional material from Komter that was recorded in the late 1990s (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750481313476776">Van Charldorp, 2011a</xref>, for an elaborate description). This material, which has been carefully prepared through extensive transcription and anonymizing practices, allows me to study the interrogations and their records from a conversation analytic perspective. Conversation analysis (CA) is a method that was established in the 1960s and 1970s and is based on the work of the sociologist Harvey Sacks and colleagues, who were inspired by ethnomethdology (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750481313476776">Heritage, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750481313476776">Ten Have, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Sacks started out analysing phone calls to the Suicide Prevention Centre in the early 1960s. In analysing these calls, he found that callers and call-takers are constantly performing activities. In his analyses he shows how participants accomplish these social actions, such as greeting, complaining, telling a story, agreeing, and disagreeing. Participants produce and orient to such actions through <italic>sequences</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750481313476776">Sacks, 1987</xref>). By studying sequences we notice that many actions in talk are paired: a greeting generally receives a greeting, a storyteller receives an acknowledgement or surprise token. How participants design these actions and how the local context creates contingencies upon which these actions take shape, is what conversation analysts aim to describe.</p>
<p>Central to CA is how the participants interpret each other and how they give meaning to each other’s utterances. Participants demonstrate in their next turn how they have understood the previous utterance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750481313476776">Sacks et al., 1974</xref>). Through this mechanism, also known as the ‘next-turn proof procedure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750481313476776">Sacks et al., 1974</xref>), researchers study the organization of talk and aim to describe how social actions are produced and understood by the participants themselves.</p>
<p>In order to be able to see how the orderliness of interaction is constructed on a moment-to-moment basis, conversation analysts use naturally occurring data. Only such data shows how participants construct meaning and accomplish social actions. Although analysis is based on audio- or video-recordings, in order to make the data manageable and workable, transcripts are made (for transcription conventions, see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1750481313476776">Appendix</xref>).</p>
<p>The analyses were done based on the original Dutch data. However, for publication purposes, the Dutch material has been translated into English. Translating spoken text, however, can be quite problematic (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750481313476776">Bucholtz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750481313476776">Nikander, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750481313476776">Ten Have, 2007</xref>, for a discussion). The translations in this article are loose translations, in which I have attempted to maintain the conversational style and tone of the original talk.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1750481313476776">
<title>Phases of the police interrogation</title>
<p>Since the police interrogation consists of different phases where the typing activity varies, I will first describe these phases. The participants themselves make the phases that I distinguish here relevant. In his frame analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750481313476776">Goffman (1974)</xref> writes that speakers provide cues so that hearers understand which frame is now being employed in the conversation. In this particular institutional context, institutional frames are constantly created or projected by the professional (the police officer), which allows both participants to follow the structure of the police interrogation (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750481313476776">Heydon, 2005</xref>). For example, by saying ‘okay, now we move on to the case’, the police officer makes known during the interrogation that they move from phase to phase or, in Goffman’s terms, from ‘frame’ to ‘frame’. The following phases make up the Dutch police interrogation structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750481313476776">Van Charldorp, 2011a</xref>): 1) preliminary actions and social talk; 2) form-filling; 3) the police caution; 4) the social interrogation; 5) the case-related interrogation; and 6) exit activities.</p>
<sec id="section4-1750481313476776">
<title>Preliminary actions and social talk</title>
<p>When the suspect is brought from his temporary or police cell to the interrogation room, the officer and suspect meet.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1750481313476776">1</xref></sup> Preliminary actions such as logging into the computer system and filling in information in the system take place during this time. Following the greetings, some officers take their time to conduct some social talk with the suspect. During this kind of social talk, the suspect is made to feel at ease and the officer can get to know the suspect a little before beginning the interrogation and before beginning to type.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1750481313476776">
<title>Form-filling</title>
<p>The second phase concerns the form-filling. Through certain prompts that the officers respond to on the screen, the first part of the police record is automatically generated. These fields include the suspect’s name, date of birth, postal address, etc. This information appears at the top of the police record once it is printed out. The system does not allow for the document to be printed without this information. Most fields are filled in at the beginning of the interrogation; in fact, most information is filled in before the suspect arrives at the interrogation room. These fields are filled in automatically when the case code is entered, depending on whether the suspects’ information is already in the system. When information is missing, the officer will ask the suspect for this information.</p>
<p>The interaction that goes on during this part of the interrogation generally consists of rapid question–answer adjacency pairs, where the answers are codeable features of the institution (also see Raymond and Zimmerman’s ‘codeable events’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750481313476776">2007</xref>: 37–38). Typing sounds are short as abbreviations such as ‘J’ for ‘<italic>ja</italic>’ (‘yes’) are required in the fields. Other field entries generally consist of one or two words.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1750481313476776">
<title>The caution</title>
<p>There are three legal requirements concerning the Dutch police interrogation that are spelled out in section 29 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The second requirement states that ‘before the interrogation starts, the suspect is told that he is not obliged to answer’. Telling a suspect that he has this right is known as the police caution. The written version of the caution automatically appears in the police record when the officer fills in ‘yes’ or ‘J’ in the appropriate field on the form-filling screen. Therefore, there is very little typing involved in this phase.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1750481313476776">
<title>Social interrogation</title>
<p>The social part of the interrogation is concerned with obtaining the social background of the suspect. The police officer asks questions related to the suspect’s family life, education, housing, financial situation and past experiences with the police. By asking about such social matters, the question–answer interaction starts out rather informally. Whereas one officer clearly spends time discussing the social life of the suspect without typing, the other begins typing up the social interrogation answers right away. During this phase officers begin to combine the tasks of talking, listening and typing simultaneously.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1750481313476776">
<title>Case-related interrogation</title>
<p>When a social interrogation has taken place, officers move on to questions relating to the case. The case-related interrogation requires more complex questioning and answering regarding the facts of the case for which the suspect has been arrested. The police officer has as his/her main project ‘truth finding’, whereas the suspect is occupied with telling the story about his previous actions in such a way that he hopes will get him in the least trouble possible. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750481313476776">Kidwell and González Martinez (2010</xref>: 70) describe interrogators and suspects working at ‘cross-purposes’. They explain that ‘while it is in the interest of the interrogator to get an admission and/or information that could incriminate the subject, it is not in the interest of the subject to provide such’.</p>
<p>Officers are constantly asking questions, listening and typing. Suspects are constantly listening, answering questions and waiting for the typing to end. The case-related part of the interrogation is mostly about storytelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750481313476776">Van Charldorp, 2011a</xref>). Officers frequently begin with an open-ended question such as ‘what happened’, which is then followed by more specific questions concerning the details of the event.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1750481313476776">2</xref></sup> The specific questions are related to place, time, and who and what was involved. During the case-related phase, the interrogation generally becomes more tense and the interaction more emotional. There is more at stake for both officer (who tries to find out what happened) and suspect (who is arrested for being suspected of a certain offence).</p>
<p>Throughout the case-related phase we see different kinds of typing activity. This is also related to the writing style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750481313476776">Van Charldorp, 2011a</xref>) that officers demonstrate in the police record. Some officers first question the suspect without typing and write some notes on paper, whereas others start typing right away.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1750481313476776">
<title>Exit activities</title>
<p>The interrogation ends with a number of exit activities. The officer edits and cleans up the lay-out before printing the document. The suspect reads through the entire police record and can ask for changes to be made. When the officer has made the changes, the document is printed again. Both the suspect and the officer now sign the document and the suspect initials every page.</p>
<p>Every police officer handles these exit activities differently. In a couple of cases the suspects are hurried, whereas others have lots of time to read and readjust the written text. After this final step, the suspect is brought back to his (temporary) cell.</p>
<p>The various institutional goals presented above are paired with different talking and typing activities and result in different text on the screen. I will now demonstrate that the talk and typing activity is different in each phase and show how talking and typing are intertwined and how they influence each other in the various phases of the interrogation.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1750481313476776">
<title>Typing in the various phases of the police interrogation</title>
<p>In each of the distinct phases typing has different consequences, not only for the interrogation, but also for the police record. The form-filling beginning of an interrogation is a very rapid succession of questions, answers and typing. Form-filling results in one-word answers on a form, whereas the social interrogation answers are based on the individual suspect where the individual stories vary and the answers are less projectable, causing the typing activity to begin later. This often leads to paragraphs written in full sentences. The case-related interrogation usually becomes more tense, as this concerns the reason why the suspect has been arrested. This is considered a crucial part of the interrogation, where there is a lot at stake for both parties. The case-related section in the police record is much more detailed and elaborate and may include the questions as well as the answers either in question–answer format or in a recontextualization phrase format (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750481313476776">Komter, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750481313476776">Van Charldorp, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750481313476776">2011b</xref>). Exit activities concern the reading of the record by the suspect and editing by the police officer. Here, typing becomes a background activity as the suspect tells the officer what to do and thereby inverses the role of agenda-setting.</p>
<p>I will show some prototypical ways in which talk structures typing and typing structures talk in four different phases of the police interrogation where typing also takes place: form-filling, social interrogation, case-related interrogation and exit activities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1750481313476776">3</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section11-1750481313476776">
<title>Form-filling</title>
<p>I will begin by demonstrating how typing and talking are coordinated and oriented to by police officer (P) and suspect (S) during the form-filling phase of the interrogation.</p>
<p>Example 1 (MKint07min00)</p>
<graphic id="img1-1750481313476776" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1750481313476776-img1.tif"/>
<p>From the beginning, the officer and suspect verbally and interactionally step into their roles of institutional police officer and layperson being interrogated. We notice this when P, who just sat down behind her computer (not shown here), starts the interrogation with ‘let’s see’ (line 1), some typing sounds (line 2) and then immediately poses her first question when she stops typing (line 3). This question, which is a declarative without a rising intonation, consists of just three words (two words in Dutch). As P starts typing right away in overlap with her last syllable, S initiates a repair after a few typing sounds, ‘first names?’ to which the officer confirms that this was indeed her question. S then answers in an institutionally appropriate manner (lines 9–11): he provides his three first names in three separate intonation units – as if they need to be written down. In this way, S fully orients not only to the institutional setting of P asking questions, but S also orients to the typing that P will do after he has provided his answer. We therefore see that S already orients to the typical Question–Answer–Typing (QAT) structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750481313476776">Komter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750481313476776">Van Charldorp, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750481313476776">2011b</xref>) from the very beginning of the interrogation. The predetermined and institutionalized pre-allocation of turns therefore does not just include question–answer sequences, but also includes the typing, suggesting that there is a pre-allocation of activities.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, P does not make a lot of typing sounds. This could mean that the information was already on her screen and she is merely fact checking, rather than filling in the form. We see this again with the next question, which is asked in lines 14–17: ‘your da-’, ‘you were born?’, ‘birthdate?’. Again, S answers in staccato intonation in two separate intonation units of which only the last has a falling intonation. When P repeats the year in which he was born, this indicates that this was the information she was trying to retrieve. These two numbers may have been the only two numbers that were missing from her record. P now softly hits the keyboard three times. With these three keystrokes she could not have typed up the entire date of birth of the suspect. This suggests that P already has a lot of the information in her record and is either fact checking or adding missing details.</p>
<p>In sum, both the police officer and the suspect are oriented to the typing. The interaction almost perfectly follows the typical QAT structure. P sets the agenda and self-selects after the typing to initiate the next question. The questions are posed as if she is working through a list: short declaratives with no additional introduction or explanation. S also orients to the typing. From the very first answer onwards he provides short, to the point answers. He says his answers as if to be typed, in a staccato intonation where the last intonation unit always has a falling intonation contour. An institutional task is being completed: a form is filled in where the answers from the layperson are written up by the professional. The form, which is partly made visible to the suspect through typing sounds, structures not only the turn-taking system, but also structures what is being said and how it is being said. At the same time, the answers provide a space for the typing to begin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1750481313476776">
<title>Social interrogation</title>
<p>The social interrogation may seem to be less concerned with completing a typical institutional task since the officer tries to get to know the suspect. Although this may suggest a more conversational style, the answers still need to be typed up in the police record. While the social interrogation is not typed up in a pre-structured question–answer form, there is still an institutional task that needs to be completed on the computer. The next example demonstrates this. This example is taken from a social interrogation with a minor and illustrates a typical interaction within a social interrogation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1750481313476776">5</xref></sup> Questions about age and whether or not the suspect lives with his parents are very common.</p>

<p>There has been no spoken interaction for 50 seconds until P finishes typing and asks the first question of the social interrogation. The suspect, who does not have access to the screen, has no knowledge of what has just been written up on the screen. When the officer finishes his long solo typing activity, he self-selects and asks how old the suspect is (line 4). P immediately starts typing, deviating from the typical QAT structure. The typing (‘I am’) begins before the suspect has responded, suggesting that the answer is syntactically projectable. S replies, in concurrence with the typing, that he is 14 years old. The officer hits two keystrokes in line 7 and then halts his typing to repeat the answer in line 8, demonstrating that he has heard the suspect. P hits some loud and some single keystrokes, editing a part of his document before typing up the remaining ‘14 years old.’, and starting with the answer to the next question. The suspect does not self-select but waits until he is asked the next question after the typing is finished. The officer structures his own talk with his typing activity.</p>
<p>Immediately after finishing his typing activity, P asks the next question in line 10, which follows a story-telling pattern in the written document. P demonstrates a typical police interrogation structure in which P controls speakership and not only sets the agenda, but also controls the typing and therefore the police record. In line 10 we see that the physical activity of speaking is dependent on the projectable ending of the physical activity of typing. Again, we see that the typing structures the officer’s talk. The suspect, however, does not wait for the typing to end. His talk then is not so much structured by the typing but by the questions posed. Both participants are very much oriented to the task at hand: writing up the police record.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1750481313476776">
<title>Case-related interrogation</title>
<p>Here, I will move on to questioning about the case. The case-related phase of the interrogation is conducted in varying ways. Police officers have different ways in which they ask questions, do or do not type and how long they talk or type. In general, officers switch between ‘interrogating’ and ‘writing up the record’ in this phase. Interrogating is concerned with truth-seeking, confronting the suspect with evidence and eliciting a confession. Writing up the record is the end goal of the interrogation. In practice, writing down the statement and interrogating are interwoven. I will not be able to illustrate all the different ways in which talk and typing are oriented to during the case-related phase. However, the next example shows elements of both: interrogating and writing up the record.</p>
<p>In Example 3 we see how the officer is seeking information and therefore asking specific questions and writing down the answers. Here the 19-year-old suspect is thought to have stolen a motorbike. He claims to have just ‘borrowed’ the bike for a short ride from a guy from the street, Ziggi. The officer is now asking questions about Ziggi.</p>

<p>In this example, we see that the officer writes up the question as well as the answer. She starts typing right after her own question in line 4. Here she writes the first part of her question: ‘You ask me.’ S repeats the question and then replies that he knows ‘little’ (line 7) about the other suspect. Rather than a third-turn receipt token or an additional question to prompt the suspect, the officer continues typing up the question. This takes approximately eight seconds (lines eight–9). Only when she is finished typing up the question does she provide a repeat (line 10) which S confirms (line 11); P then evaluates (line 12) and S again confirms (line 13). This demonstrates that the officer’s typing structures her own talk by providing a response token only after 8 seconds when the typing is done. At the same time, the officer’s talk structures her own typing since the officer only begins to type up her question when she has finished asking the question (lines 5–6). The suspect’s second pair parts (lines 5–7, 11, 13, etc.) strictly follow the officer’s first pair parts.</p>
<p>The officer then asks a more specific question since her open-ended question did not result in a lot of information. She asks the suspect if he knows Ziggi’s last name (line 14). When the suspect says that he does not, the officer moves on with the next question right away. The suspect’s negative response is not typed up and does not end up in the police record. Her next question concerns Ziggi’s age. Again, the suspect provides a negative answer. But this time, the officer asks the suspect to make an estimate. Unlike a last name, an age can be guessed. This is what the suspect does, he compares Ziggi to himself and after P’s suggestion ‘nineteen’, S confirms that it could be ‘somethin like that’. During the ‘interrogating’ phase, the officer does not type. When she does begin typing, she translates the interaction to ‘I think that he is 19 years old’: words which she not only initiated, but also transformed (‘somethin like that’ is changed to the active verb ‘I think’). Here we see that typing only begins when a somewhat specific answer is agreed upon; the typing was halted during the interrogation phase.</p>

<title>Exit activities</title>
<p>In the previous three phases we have seen how the officer structures the suspect’s talk and how the officer structures his or her own talk and typing by performing the activities sequentially according to P’s agenda. The way the participants orient to the talking and typing activities suggests that the institutional goal of writing up the record is of large importance in this setting. The suspect has played a very minor role in the agenda setting or turn-taking system. However, in the exit activities phase the suspect can play a role in what is being typed when. This example is taken from the same interrogation as Example 3. P has been editing the record while S has been reading through it.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this excerpt we see that S self-selects his turn to announce that he has found some minor spelling errors. This is one of the few occasions in the data collection where S self-selects the next turn after P has been typing. S announces this by saying that he ‘has’ a couple of mistakes. After P announces that she will make the changes because it will look ‘neater’, S announces his first change.</p>
<p>The negotiation about the changes (lines 12–17) takes place ‘in the clear’, without P typing except for two very quiet keystrokes (line 14). The actual typing begins in line 21 after P has announced her change in activity from talking to typing, with ‘ohkay’ in line 18 and an actual statement of her beginning the activity in line 20 ‘I’ll do that quickly’.</p>
<p>We now see the two activities of talking and typing concurring. As P is editing, S keeps talking about how he doesn’t mind the changes but finally argues that it would look neater – words that P uttered earlier (see line 10). His changes are embedded in not only a pre-announcement (line 2) and an agreement (line 17), but also in very careful wording about it not being an important matter after he has provided the changes (in lines 22–27). S’s account for why the officer doesn’t really need to make the changes is quite elaborate.</p>
<p>This example demonstrates how the roles have been reversed in the institutional setting. Instead of P continuously self-selecting, taking the floor with typing activity, setting the agenda by asking the next questions and structuring the talk through typing and questioning, S now self-selects and tells the officer what changes she needs to make. The typing is slow and P barely talks, allowing S to interject the typing with his talk. S now has some minor control over what is changed in the record. However, S does this very carefully, with pre-announcements and later providing an account for why it is not that necessary to make the changes. For the suspect’s talk to therefore structure the typing activity is not only physically impossible as the suspect does not have access to the keyboard, but interactionally it also takes a lot more effort than the other way around.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In this section I demonstrated that within the institutional setting of the police interrogation, the participants display different orientations to the talking and typing activity in the various phases of the interrogation. As each phase consists of different goals for both police officer and suspect, the typing and talking take on different levels of involvement. It was noticeable that during both the form-filling phase and the social interrogation, both participants oriented to the main institutional goal at hand: writing up the record. The suspect even answers ‘for the record’ in the form-filling phase. During the case-related phase, where ‘interrogating’ becomes more prominent, we saw that typing is halted when concrete facts are sought. This suggests that when the communicative goal becomes more difficult (truth-seeking combined with writing up the record), the activities of talking and typing are separated. What happens when the officer can truly focus on interrogating while another officer types up the talk?</p>

<sec id="section16-1750481313476776">
<title>When tasks are divided</title>
<p>The management of and orientation to typing changes when two officers interrogate a suspect. When this is the case, we generally see that one officer does all of the typing and the other officer does most of the questioning. This way, the questioning officer can focus mainly on the talk.</p>
<p>In this Example 5 I want to take a closer look at part of a case-related interrogation where there are two officers present. For readability purposes I will provide two separate versions of this example marked as 5a (the original transcript in Dutch) and 5b (a translated version in English). Here, we see that the participants sometimes orient to the typing sounds, but often the interaction solely takes place between the questioning officer and the suspect. The typing then no longer interjects the talk, but becomes a background noise. The words spoken by the suspect and the interrogating officer (P1) are displayed in the first column. The typing done by the typing officer (P2) is displayed in the second column (when typing occurs in the clear, the length of typing is indicated in the first column). What was typed when is displayed in the last column. The suspect’s phone has been tapped and therefore the police have information about the suspect’s whereabouts during the time of the crime. The suspect is now denying that he had the phone (simcard) at that moment in time.</p>
<p>Example 5a (TCint07min03)</p>
<graphic id="img2-1750481313476776" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1750481313476776-img2.tif"/>
<p>Example 5b (TCint07min03)</p>
<graphic id="img3-1750481313476776" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1750481313476776-img3.tif"/>
<p>During this interrogation, the officers already had some questions typed up in a separate document beforehand. Police officers call this the ‘interrogation plan’. This suspect had already been interrogated before and therefore the officers knew that they specifically wanted to find out more about the mobile phone and its whereabouts. Their ‘prepared’ questions therefore are very focused on trying to attain this information. The typing officer is copying and pasting already typed-up questions from another document into the police record screen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1750481313476776">7</xref></sup> This is what she does at the beginning of this excerpt (lines 1 and 4–9).</p>
<p>Whether or not P1 is reading the question from the screen in lines 3–5 cannot be said. What we can note is that P1 is oriented to the typing during the beginning of this excerpt. This becomes clear in line 9. The suspect just provided an answer to P’s earlier question ‘just me and my cousin’. After this answer, neither S nor P1 self-selects to take the next turn. There is a significant 2.5 second pause, while P2 continues typing in the background. Only after 2.5 seconds does P1 offer a response token ‘nnoo:’ in line 10. This shows that the interrogating officer, P1, is oriented to the typing and not to the suspect’s talk at this point. Typing by P2 therefore structures P1’s talk.</p>
<p>However, from this point on the interaction becomes much more sequentially aligned. The officer poses a multi-turn question from lines 11 until 16, after which the suspect answers in line 19. The typing officer, P2, is keeping up with the conversation. However, the other participants are no longer oriented to her, but rather, to each other. P1 is providing continuers such as ‘yes’ (line 21), ‘mnn’ (line 23), ‘yes?’ (line 26) and ‘hmnn mnn’ (line 31). Between the suspect’s answers and the officer’s response tokens there are almost no pauses. The continuers allow the suspect to tell his story, which he does throughout the excerpt. The story is not halted by interjecting typing as P1 and S are oriented towards each other, focusing on one activity only.</p>
<p>What this example shows us is that when an officer can focus solely on questioning while the other officer makes a record by typing it up in the computer, the sequential alignment of the conversation is mostly maintained. When there is misalignment, it could be due to the questioning officer orienting towards the typing, rather than the talk. Furthermore, the text that is produced in the police record is very similar to the talk that was produced. The typing officer quite literally writes up the answers as she is listening to the interaction between S and the interrogating officer. Especially when the questions are already written up in the document, the officer only needs to add short versions of the suspect’s answer.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the analyses we have seen that the intertwining of talk and technology take place throughout the various phases of the police interrogation. Although the phases have different goals, the end goal – writing up the record – remains prominent in the interaction between officer and suspect. We have seen how officers sequentially align their typing and talking activities and how suspects answer for the record (form-filling phase). Although typing often interjects the talk and creates a new interactional structure (QAT), suspects stick to producing second pair parts based on spoken first pair parts (and not based on typing activity). It is the officer then who is mainly concerned with his or her greater institutional task: producing the record. When the interrogation becomes truly about interrogating, we see that these activities are difficult to combine. Typing makes way for interrogating. Only when a recordable answer is given does the officer begin typing. The record therefore shows the outcome of the interaction and not the interaction (or negotiation) itself. This effect can be reduced when there are two officers present so that talking and using technology can be separated. In the end this will most likely result in more accurate end products.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The analyses demonstrate that the officers have multiple activities that they need to accomplish and orient to during the interrogations. However, in the police training literature this is often overlooked. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1750481313476776">Sliedrecht (forthcoming)</xref> shows that, for example, the Dutch advice literature does not mention typing at all (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750481313476776">Van Amelsvoort et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1750481313476776">Van den Adel, 1997</xref>). In the international police training literature the focus lies mostly on interrogating techniques and not the representation of the spoken stories (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750481313476776">Milne and Powell, 2010</xref>). When typing is mentioned, it is listed as a separate activity that is performed after the interrogation (as is the case in other countries and in some cases in the Netherlands). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750481313476776">Bockstaele (2011)</xref> does mention in his training manual for Dutch and Belgian police officers that it would be wise for an additional officer to type up the interrogation in another room whilst another officer is interrogating the suspect. This advice implicitly suggests that typing may interfere with the interrogation process. This would, however, require an audio equipment system and a separate room with a computer (which is not always available). I would suggest, along with Sliedrecht, that the police interrogation training literature should take into consideration that typing can have an effect on the interrogation. More specifically, each institutional phase may be affected differently. The analyses in this article suggest that at least during the case-related phase of the interrogation it would be helpful to have another officer present who can do the typing.</p>

<p>There can be one or two police officers present in the interrogation. When there are two officers, one of them generally asks the questions and the other generally types.
