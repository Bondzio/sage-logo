<abstract>
<p>Recent years have witnessed the growth of the so-called “pulling-levers” approach to reducing gang and gun violence, and more recently, to eliminate overt drug markets. Research has indicated promising results, at least in terms of impact at a community level, yet much remains to be known about the theoretical foundation of these interventions. The current research utilizes an approach developed in the cognitive sciences to examine these theoretical foundations. Specifically, the “mental models” approach to developing graphical representations of how people know, perceive, make decisions, and construct behavior is applied to the drug market intervention strategy as originally developed in High Point, North Carolina. In-depth interviews were conducted with police officials, social service providers, and community partners to better understand how this strategy was developed and what these “experts” believe are the foundation of the strategy. The findings indicate a complex logic model undergirding the strategy with multiple theoretical components.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Open-air drug markets have had devastating effects on poor and minority neighborhoods. These markets have accelerated an already disturbing breakdown in community social control and order, characterized by disorder, crime, and fear of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022042612436653">Meares, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022042612436653">Weisburd &amp; Mazerolle, 2000</xref>). As drug dealers exert control over public spaces, residents withdraw, related crimes rise (such as violent offenses, gun charges, and prostitution), and the overall community condition deteriorates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022042612436653">Robinson &amp; Rengert, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022042612436653">Skogan, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022042612436653">Wilson &amp; Kelling, 1982</xref>). At the same time, four decades of punitive drug enforcement has resulted in a disastrous cycle of numerous young drug dealers being incarcerated only to be replaced by a new group of young people drawn to perceived economic rewards and the “glamorous” lifestyle of drug sales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612436653">Anderson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022042612436653">Tonry, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The traditional law-enforcement approach to open-air drug markets has not only led to the large removal of young men and women from affected communities, but it has also reinforced the divide between law enforcement and poor and minority neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612436653">Kennedy, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612436653">Kessler &amp; Borella, 1997</xref>). Many of these communities have come to view the police as having little regard for them as a valued constituency. Conversely, many police agencies perceive these neighborhoods as safe harbors for drug dealers and are uninterested in improving the socioeconomic status of their community. These factors have led to an adversarial relationship marked by a lack of trust on both sides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022042612436653">Conner &amp; Burns, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612436653">Kennedy, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612436653">Kessler &amp; Borella, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, the emphasis of traditional enforcement approaches on the sellers, who are typically from local minority populations, and not the buyers, often Whites from outside the neighborhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022042612436653">Beckett, Nyrop, &amp; Pfingst, 2006</xref>), has reinforced the negative relationship between these communities and law enforcement.</p>
<p>The drastic toll of open-air drug markets on affected communities has received considerable attention from government officials and policy makers at the state and federal level leading to a number of interventions that attempt to close these markets or at least control their negative effects on local communities. One of the most recent and seemingly promising interventions is the drug market intervention initiative (DMI). The strategy was developed by a group of High Point, North Carolina, law-enforcement officials working with John Jay College’s David Kennedy. This article presents a novel method, mental models research, of evaluating this intervention strategy that focuses on the theoretical and practical aspects of the intervention from the perspective of expert practitioners involved in the DMI. The promise of the mental models approach is that it provides a methodology for understanding team decision making, and the common, overlapping or potentially conflicting cognitive representations of the intervention strategy and the various roles and tasks associated with the strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612436653">Cannon-Bowers, Salas, &amp; Converse, 1993</xref>). The mental models approach has rarely been used in criminological research but seems particularly promising for understanding interventions whereby the individuals involved (e.g., police, social services, and community members) come from wide-ranging professional cultures and affiliations with varying individual experiences around issues of drug use, sales, and enforcement.</p>

<title>DMI</title>
<p>As suggested in the “Introduction” section, numerous intervention strategies have been developed to address the issue of open-air drug markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612436653">Mazerolle, Soole, &amp; Rombouts, 2007</xref>). The DMI is one such intervention that appears to hold great promise in reversing the effects of these markets. The DMI grew out of previous programs that focused on gang and gun violence such as the Boston Gun Project, Strategic Approaches to Community Safety Initiative, and Project Safe Neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022042612436653">Klofas, Hipple, &amp; McGarrell, 2010</xref>). Although first implemented in High Point, the DMI has now been implemented in a number of communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612436653">Hipple, Corsaro, &amp; McGarrell, 2010</xref>) and follows a problem-oriented policing approach grounded theoretically in focused deterrence or “pulling levers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612436653">Corsaro, Brunson, &amp; McGarrell, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612436653">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612436653">Kennedy, 2009a</xref>).</p>
<p>At its core, the DMI strategy builds on the fundamental principles of problem-oriented policing with a focus on identifying specific crime problems and concerns in a variety of community situations and related contexts. Problem-oriented policing strategies encourage police agencies to develop and implement, often in collaboration with community members, proactive responses to the underlying conditions that cause the targeted crime problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612436653">Braga et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022042612436653">Goldstein, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612436653">Klofas et al., 2006</xref>). Emphasis is placed on identifying and analyzing specific crime problems, responding to these problems, and assessing and adjusting the response in an iterative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612436653">Braga, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612436653">Braga, Pierce, McDevitt, Bond, &amp; Cronin, 2008</xref>). Problem-oriented policing approaches have been found to be effective in combating fear of crime and concerns with community order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612436653">Braga, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612436653">Braga et al., 2008</xref>), and in reducing crime and other behaviors associated with drug markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612436653">Mazerolle et al., 2007</xref>). Given that crime is generally clustered in relatively small geographic locations within a city, research findings in the growing problem-oriented policing literature suggest that police interventions are most effective when they are highly focused on the people, places, and contexts driving the problem in that specific location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612436653">Braga et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612436653">Eck &amp; Weisburd, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612436653">Hipple &amp; McGarrell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022042612436653">National Research Council, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022042612436653">Sherman &amp; Weisburd, 1995</xref>). An enforcement strategy that uses this approach is focused deterrence or lever pulling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612436653">Kennedy, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612436653">2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>The pulling-levers focused deterrence strategy is a problem-oriented policing approach originally aimed at reducing gang and group-involved violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612436653">Braga et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022042612436653">Braga, Kennedy, &amp; Tita, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612436653">Corsaro &amp; McGarrell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612436653">Decker, 2002</xref>). This multistage approach typically consists of six steps: (a) focusing on a specific crime problem; (b) creating an interagency working group of relevant law-enforcement agencies; (c) a systematic identification of key offenders, groups, and behavior patterns; (d) developing a clear deterrent message to offenders and groups of offenders, which employs a wide-ranging suite of sanctions (pulling levers) to persuade them to cease their deviant behavior; (e) focusing social services and community resources on targeted offenders and groups to complement law-enforcement efforts; and (f) directly, clearly, and repeatedly communicating to offenders why they are receiving this special attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612436653">Braga et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022042612436653">Kennedy, 1997</xref>). Initially used in the Boston Gun Project, the pulling-levers approach has shown promising results in reducing violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022042612436653">Braga et al., 2002</xref>). Replication of the pulling-levers strategy has also found success in cities such as Baltimore, Maryland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022042612436653">Braga et al., 2002</xref>), Chicago, Illinois (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022042612436653">Papachristos, Meares, &amp; Fagans, 2007</xref>), High Point, North Carolina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022042612436653">Coleman, Holton, Olson, Robinson, &amp; Stewart, 1999</xref>), Indianapolis, Indiana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612436653">McGarrell, Chermak, Wilson, &amp; Corsaro, 2006</xref>), Los Angeles, California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022042612436653">Tita, Riley, &amp; Greenwood, 2003</xref>), Lowell, Massachusetts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612436653">Braga et al., 2008</xref>), Minneapolis, Minnesota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612436653">Kennedy &amp; Braga, 1998</xref>), and Stockton, California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612436653">Braga, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022042612436653">Wakeling, 2003</xref>). The approach has been modified in the DMI to address the issue of open-air drug markets. The DMI has adopted the pulling-levers model by focusing on specific drug markets and the small group of individuals working in those markets (i.e., distributors, street-level sellers, and look outs) that are driving the problem, and directly communicating a deterrence message to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612436653">Hipple et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612436653">Kennedy, 2009b</xref>). Beyond the theoretical underpinnings of the pulling-levers model, the DMI has an extensive focus on restoring the relationship between the police and the community. This emphasis on normalizing relationships between affected communities and the police largely sets apart the DMI from other law-enforcement strategies for addressing open-air drug markets.</p>
<p>As noted previously, starting in 2003, the DMI was first implemented in High Point, North Carolina. Since this initial implementation, the strategy has been employed in a number of cities across the country. This includes a number of “early adopter” cities such as Rockford (Illinois), Providence (Rhode Island), Hempstead (New York), and Nashville (Tennessee). Given the hopeful reports from High Point and other early adopter cities, in 2007 the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) provided funding for Michigan State University, American University, and John Jay College of Criminal Justice to train nine initial jurisdictions in the DMI approach as well as a subsequent group of nine other jurisdictions. This includes large cities such as Chicago and Dallas, medium-sized cities such as Milwaukee, and smaller cities such as Ocala (Florida) and Middletown (Ohio; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612436653">Hipple et al., 2010</xref>, for a list of participating cities). A central part of these trainings is a nine-step logic model that was developed in consultation with High Point officials and their research partners. The nine steps involved in the DMI can be divided into three phases and closely mirror the multistage approach of the pulling-levers method, particularly Steps 1 through 5 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022042612436653">Table 1</xref>). Despite the similarity between the DMI and other pulling-lever methods, the process is still a relative black box to the research, policy, and practitioner communities. We have a strong grasp on the theoretical underpinnings of the program and an idea of how the program works in broad strokes; however, we lack in-depth knowledge of how the DMI is implemented in practice.</p>

<title>Initial Research on Effectiveness of the DMI Model</title>
<p>Despite the recent development of the program, there has been some research examining the effectiveness of the DMI. Initial studies conducted on the DMI strategy in High Point, North Carolina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022042612436653">McGarrell, Corsaro, &amp; Brunson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612436653">Frabutt, Shelton, DiLuca, Harvey, &amp; Hefner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612436653">Hipple et al., 2010</xref>); Winston-Salem, North Carolina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612436653">Frabutt et al., 2009</xref>); and Rockford, Illinois (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612436653">Corsaro et al., 2009</xref>) have found it to be promising in reducing violent, property, and drug crimes as well as other behaviors associated with drug markets. In their assessment of the process and impact of the High Point DMI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612436653">Hipple and colleagues (2010)</xref> compared trends in violent, property, and drug/nuisance offenses for 37 months pre- and post intervention and found that violent crimes declined an average of 7.3% following the intervention, property crimes declined 9.1%, and drug and nuisance offenses declined 5.5%. Although these time series estimates were modest, they were statistically significant and sustained over time. A follow-up analysis comparing neighborhood trajectories of crime before and after the DMI intervention shows the initial two DMI neighborhoods to have sustained reductions in levels of crime compared with other High Point neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022042612436653">McGarrell et al., 2010</xref>). An examination of the Nashville pulling-levers DMI found a statistically significant reduction in property, narcotic, and drug equipment offenses and a decrease in calls for service in the target area and adjoining contiguous areas. These changes were not found in other parts of Nashville providing evidence of the effectiveness of the intervention. The decline in offense rates at and near (contiguous areas) the implementation site of the intervention indicates that there is no evidence of immediate displacement of drug markets, and possibly a diffusion of benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612436653">Corsaro et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612436653">Corsaro and colleagues (2009)</xref> found a statistically significant reduction in property crime, drug, and nuisance offenses associated with the pulling-levers strategy in targeted areas of Rockford. The results of these studies are consistent with residents’ impressions of the effectiveness of the DMI in the affected neighborhoods. Interviews conducted with residents from these study sites found that they perceived less serious violent and drug-related crime after the DMI strategy was implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612436653">Corsaro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612436653">Hipple et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings have been supported by a process and outcome analysis of the DMI in High Point and Winston-Salem using interviews with law enforcement and key community stakeholders and focus groups of residents in the affected neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612436653">Frabutt et al., 2009</xref>). Law-enforcement officials find that the most important aspects of the process are the data-driven approach of identifying a target area, initial engagement of the police, and meaningful contact with the offenders’ families. Law enforcement and community stakeholders state that the police–community collaboration and community engagement are essential to the process and success of the DMI. Residents from the focus group report that they feel safer and more confident in the police after the intervention was implemented; they also felt empowered by providing insight into the problems that affected their neighborhood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612436653">Frabutt and colleagues (2009)</xref> suggested that to sustain the benefits received from the DMI strategy, the following conditions need to be present: successful implementation of the model, clear police–community communication, and consistent implementation of the stated consequences for offenders.</p>

<sec id="section4-0022042612436653">
<title>The Mental Models Approach</title>
<p>The results from these studies on the DMI are promising; however, a fuller understanding of the intervention, its impacts, and its processes are needed to better evaluate the program and to subsequently implement it in new jurisdictions. This seems particularly true for “unpacking” interventions focused on closing down illegal drug markets. Prior research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612436653">Mazerolle et al., 2007</xref>) suggests that the most effective strategies for addressing overt drug markets involve problem-solving approaches and multiagency and stakeholder involvement. This is very much a characteristic of the DMI approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612436653">Hipple et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612436653">Kennedy, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612436653">Kennedy &amp; Wong, 2009</xref>). As noted previously, drug enforcement has generated considerable conflict in the United States. This is true at the policy level and at the community level. Police and prosecutors are likely to come to an initiative such as DMI with very different perspectives, language, and symbols than social service providers, neighborhood leaders, and young people involved in the drug trade. Even within the community, there are likely to be divergent understandings and concerns around crime, drugs, and drug enforcement ranging from perceived police neglect to perceived police oppression. These cultural, experiential, historical, organizational, and political factors may make it very difficult to reach common understanding on the goals of the DMI, the theoretical and causal pathways, the various roles and tasks to be fulfilled, and the language used in discussing the intervention strategy. Yet as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612436653">Frabutt et al. (2009)</xref> noted, clear communication and consistent implementation of the model are critical for understanding what the DMI is, how it can affect drug markets and associated crime and disorder, and how it can be replicated and evaluated. This is where the mental models approach may offer benefits in criminological research.</p>
<p>Mental models are essentially graphical representations of how people know, perceive, make decisions, and construct behavior in a variety of environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612436653">Gentner et al., 1983</xref>). Mental models go beyond “schema” or “images,” however, by providing constructs that are “manipulable, enabling people to predict system states via mental manipulation of model parameters” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612436653">Cannon-Bowers et al., 1993</xref>, p. 226). The theoretical foundations of mental models are found in the cognitive sciences and the examination of how humans make sense of their environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612436653">Craik, 1943</xref>). Over the past decade, there has been growing use of these models to develop a greater understanding of complex systems that feature multiple stakeholders, particularly systems that include interactions between expert managers and a lay public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612436653">Morgan, Fischhoff, Bostrom, &amp; Atman, 2002</xref>). Examples of such mental models work can largely be found in the context of the natural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612436653">Bostrom, Morgan, Fischhoff, &amp; Read, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022042612436653">Zaksek &amp; Arvai, 2004</xref>) and the management of hazardous compounds such as radon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612436653">Bostrom, Fischhoff, &amp; Morgan, 1992</xref>). However, despite the lack of work applying mental models in a criminal justice context, we believe that it is a research method that could prove of value to the field.</p>
<p>Our examination of the DMI and the related research rationale provide an ideal condition for the use of mental models research. The DMI is a multifaceted system with multiple lay and expert stakeholders that features complex interactions among actors, which we do not completely understand. Mental models provide a systematic and empirically based tool for the examination and analysis of such systems. Of particular interest for this research project is the development of an expert mental model of the DMI. Expert models represent an exhaustive representation of the system in question based on the available knowledge in the scientific literature and open interviews with experts on the topic. The resulting model is refined by repeat consultation with the experts until it adequately covers all aspects of the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612436653">Morgan et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In the case of DMI, the mental models approach may prove beneficial from theoretical, strategy replication, evaluation, and training standpoints. Review of the existing literature on DMI suggests several theoretical foundations of the intervention. These include focused deterrence, informal social control, collective efficacy, and procedural justice. That is, the DMI is described as employing a focused deterrence approach that increases the risk of apprehension and sanction on specific individuals involved in the drug trade. It also seeks to increase informal social control and collective efficacy at the neighborhood level by improving police–citizen relationships and coproducing order, and increase commitment to prosocial norms and values through a fair and respectful process. The mental models approach offers a methodological approach to assessing whether these concepts, or other theoretical concepts, are found among the people responsible for developing and implementing the DMI. Understanding these theoretical foundations and the core components of the strategy becomes critical if the intervention is to be successfully replicated in other jurisdictions or by other implementation teams. Similarly, if the DMI is to be evaluated, particularly in multiple jurisdictions, it becomes critical to “unpack” the black box of the strategy so that evaluation outcomes can be assessed according to model fidelity and dosage intensity. Finally, if the mental models approach can be used to uncover the theoretical foundations and critical steps and tasks of the DMI strategy, this would appear to be of value in future training on the DMI approach.</p>

<title>Research Question</title>
<p>This lack of a deep understanding of the components involved in the actual implementation of the DMI program and its theoretical foundation is problematic for future implementation of the program. Thus, the central research question is whether the mental models approach as developed in the cognitive sciences can be fruitfully utilized to construct an expert-based logic model of the DMI strategy for addressing overt drug markets. The rationale for this exploratory research project is to better understand the logic model of the DMI initiative and the theoretical frames underlying the thinking of the architects of the model. Our central goal is to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how the DMI operates from experts (in the police and the community) who have successfully implemented the program. As noted previously, beyond the descriptive nature of this work, the hope is that the information developed in this mental model research will aid in the future development of a systematic evaluation of the DMI for the purposes of ascertaining what is needed for successful replication of the program or parts of the program in other jurisdictions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022042612436653" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>To address the study’s central research question, a mental models methodology was implemented to develop an expert mental model of the DMI.</p>
<sec id="section7-0022042612436653">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Expert participants recruited for this study were the set of individuals who were responsible for the implementation of the DMI in High Point, North Carolina. We consider this group of individuals to be experts in terms of implementing the DMI based on their early adoption of the program, their demonstrated ability to successfully implement the DMI in multiple sites, and a commitment on their part to sustain the program’s results. Eight individuals were identified and interviewed as key participants in the DMI efforts in High Point. The interview questions were developed using information obtained from an interview with John Jay College’s David Kennedy, a key architect of the DMI program. Two of the participants are high-ranking officials in the High Point police department responsible for the coordination and implementation of the DMI. One of these high-ranking officials has been involved since the initial development and implementation of the DMI in 2003 and has participated in trainings in the DMI approach across the country. The other high-ranking official was supervisor of the Vice and Narcotics Unit when the DMI was first implemented. These two participants identified two key community members who were subsequently interviewed, the coordinator of the local religious community’s effort in relation to the program and the current chair of the High Point Community Against Violence organization. Both of these individuals have been involved in the DMI from the community perspective in High Point since its inception and have developed close working relationships with the High Point police department. The high-ranking officers also placed the researchers in contact with two social service providers intimately involved with the program, in terms of provision of services to the call-in candidates, which were also interviewed. The final two interviews were with line officers in the High Point police department who have participated in the DMI since its inception. One of the officers is currently a patrol supervisor, but at the start of the implementation of the DMI was a patrol officer in the Daniel Brooks neighborhood (a community targeted in the initial DMI programs). The other officer was a detective in the Major Crimes Division at the time of the interview but had been a detective in the Vice and Narcotics Unit when the DMI started in High Point.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, a central purpose of this research is to develop an expert-based logic model of the DMI strategy. In light of this consideration, the model did not include the perspective of offenders that have participated in the DMI. Despite being a central part of the program, the offenders, unlike the experts identified and interviewed as a part of the research, lack systematic knowledge of how the DMI is implemented. However, the perspective of offenders in regards to the DMI is important to continued evaluation of the program and should be the focus of future research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022042612436653">
<title>Design</title>
<p>In line with other efforts to develop an expert mental model, this research utilized extensive open-ended interviews with the identified experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612436653">Morgan et al., 2002</xref>). Each of the interviews were approximately 60 to 120 min in length and were recorded and subsequently transcribed. The interviews were then coded for major themes related to the DMI using the qualitative software NVivo. The coding process proceeded in multiple stages. Each interview was coded by two primary coders. To ensure high intercoder reliability, a third coder checked for coding differences between the two primary coders, and significant discrepancies were addressed in conference with all coders.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022042612436653">
<title>Analysis and Results</title>
<p>The expert mental model was constructed using the themes identified in the interviews with supplemental information provided by a white paper examining the DMI efforts in High Point, North Carolina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612436653">Hipple &amp; McGarrell, 2008</xref>). The model is a modified influence diagram that was constructed using Analytica. After the initial model was constructed, it was refined in recursive consultation with the experts from High Point. The full model is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022042612436653">Figure 1</xref>. The model provides links (as symbolized by arrows) between different variables in the DMI program. These variables include organizations, individuals, concepts, and actions.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022042612436653-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>The model has been coded to group-related variables into subsystems of the full model. The model consists of nine major subsystems:</p>
<sec id="section10-0022042612436653">
<title>Police</title>
<p>One of the two central focuses of the mental model is the role of implementing police agency in the DMI as a response to open-air drug markets. The police are responsible for initiating the program, developing, and to some degree maintaining the other subsystems in the model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0022042612436653">
<title>Community and nongovernmental organization (NGO)</title>
<p>The other central focus of the model is the role of the local community (the neighborhood being targeted in the DMI) and organizations that represent the community’s interests (such as the High Point Community Against Violence Group). The DMI requires strong community “buy-in” to be effective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022042612436653">
<title>Community/police relationship</title>
<p>As mentioned earlier in the article, a unique aspect of the DMI is the restoration of a trusting relationship between the police and the community, which is represented in this subsystem.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0022042612436653">
<title>Politics, city services, and media</title>
<p>Beyond the police and the community, it is important that local politicians who largely control the priorities for city services needed for the DMI (such as drug treatment programs) to be a part of the DMI and understand the goals of the program. It is also important to develop a relationship with the media that will be covering the success or failure of the program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0022042612436653">
<title>Partner law-enforcement agencies</title>
<p>The successful implementation of the DMI relies on the development of working relationships between the implementing police agency, partner law-enforcement agencies, and the local court system. Specifically, these entities should have foreknowledge of the program and understand and agree with the goals of the DMI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0022042612436653">
<title>Theory</title>
<p>The DMI is based on the application of sociological and criminological theory, in particular deterrence theory supported by concepts developed in procedural justice, collective efficacy, social capital, social control, and social disorganization theory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0022042612436653">
<title>Targeting the drug market</title>
<p>This subsystem focuses on the steps the police take to target a specific open-air drug market. The first four steps in the conventional logic model of the DMI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022042612436653">Table 1</xref>) are a central part of this subsystem.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0022042612436653">
<title>Drug market</title>
<p>This aspect of the mental model focuses on the members of the targeted drug market and whether they are selected for participation in the DMI (street-level members without violent records) or traditional enforcement methods (mid- and upper level members and street-level members with violent records).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0022042612436653">
<title>DMI implementation with call-in candidates</title>
<p>The most visible aspect of the DMI to the community and general public is the actual call-in community meeting with offenders selected for the program. This subsystem outlines this part of the model, which is highly dependent on the other aspects of the model being already developed to support it.</p>
<p>In addition, potential risks to the successful implementation of the program have been placed in the model. An example of such a risk is a lack of sustained commitment to the DMI by implementing police agency.</p>
<p>The expert DMI mental model provides greater insight into the practical implementation of the program and the ideas and concepts that motivate the theoretical aspects of the program. One of the most immediate aspects of the DMI conveyed by the model is the complexity of the program. The initial logic model of the DMI (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022042612436653">Table 1</xref>) fails to adequately portray the intricate nature of the program. The expert mental model suggests that the DMI relies on the coordinated effort of multiple stakeholders from different sectors of the government (local and federal), various law-enforcement agencies (local and federal), and the community (neighborhood and citywide). Beyond this notion of complexity, the mental model has a number of other lessons that we believe to be of value to academic and practitioner audiences. The remainder of the analysis focuses on three aspects of the mental model in greater detail to aid in future evaluation of the DMI and similar interventions: theory, political and media support, and resiliency and redundancy.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0022042612436653">
<title>Theory Matters</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022042612436653">Figure 2</xref> provides a more detailed view of the portion of the mental model that focuses on the theoretical concepts that the experts directly or indirectly reference as being a part of the implementation of the DMI program. As we suggested in the “Introduction” and “Analysis and Results” section, the DMI intervention is grounded in theoretical assertions associated with deterrence theory, specifically focused deterrence or the pulling-levers strategy. The role of focused deterrence and its importance to the DMI is expressed in the interviews by not only the law-enforcement leaders but also those from the community and line officers. The following quote from an interview with a line officer illustrates this point:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>And I’ll always be a believer in it because it all goes back to a few people do this stuff, do the crimes, do the stuff they say. And to me, it’s just about being transparent with the community. I mean, the carrot and stick approach to me is identifying the bad people, bringing them in, telling them we know what you’re about, we know what you’re going to do, take this or else. It makes so much sense to me. It makes so much sense to me. Because we’re not going to arrest our way out of any crime at all. We’re not going to do it. We’re not. And if people sit there and think about it, I mean I love putting handcuffs on people, however, we can’t do it. You can’t arrest your way out of all of this. You can’t. And some people change. And they do. And I’d rather people be a productive part of this community then end up in twenty years in federal prison.</p>

<p>We find the expression of these theoretical principles of interest for several reasons: They are an implicit indicator of trust and cooperation, they show the areas of the program that require attention that are not explicitly addressed in the current DMI logic model, and they show the importance of theory in a practical world. The idea of focused deterrence is relatively well established in the law-enforcement community and is a central component of the enforcement aspects of the DMI, which makes its espousal by the police experts unsurprising. However, the community experts’ demonstration of knowledge and understanding of the theory suggest that the High Point police have done a good job of communicating core aspects of the program to their community partners. Furthermore, the fact that aspects of focused deterrence were mentioned without prompt by community experts when discussing the program implies that there is a level of trust and cooperation between the police and the community in terms of sharing information and working together (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022042612436653">Table 3</xref>).</p>

</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>In addition to focused deterrence, the expert interviews indirectly reference a number of other theoretical principles, such as collective efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022042612436653">Sampson, Raudenbush, &amp; Earls, 1997</xref>), social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612436653">Cohen, 1985</xref>), social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022042612436653">Putnam, 2000</xref>), and social disorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612436653">Bursik, 1988</xref>). Reference to these theories suggests the significance of ideas that are currently not explored in the DMI logic model or trainings. For example, the expert interviews revealed the significance of building social capital to repair the relationship between the police and the community. In addition, social capital build between the police and the community can be used to repair rifts that already exist in the community that could threaten the success of the DMI (such as the gulf that often appears between homeowners and renters in a neighborhood). The following statement from one of the interviews with a law-enforcement expert shows this point:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If you improve your relationship with the community and how you work with them, then you open the doors to everybody in the community and they feel you’re transparent and there’s a trust that’s built there and you have the support of the community.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, these experts appear to recognize that beyond the individual-level effects of the focused deterrence strategy, ultimately the intervention’s success is contingent on addressing community disorganization and reestablishing levels of informal social control and collective efficacy necessary to prevent the drug market from reemerging in the target neighborhood (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022042612436653">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Similarly, the “carrot and sticks” message of the call-in meetings, whereby the deterrent message is combined with offers of social support, also draws on criminological theory. The delivery of the message to a group or a network of offenders involved in a drug market is grounded in the theoretical assertions of differential association theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022042612436653">Sutherland, 1974</xref>). As indicated in the following quote from a community member’s interview,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We have offenders that sell drugs because their mama makes them sell drugs. They’ve never known another lifestyle. They come up in a lifestyle that you can’t just change overnight. So we look more in depth at that and connect them with whatever they need to be successful.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The offer of social support seeks to provide legitimate opportunities as suggested by strain theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022042612436653">Agnew, 1992</xref>) and addressed by one the community members in an interview:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We found that you can’t just say, “Okay, go to a staffing agency,” or “These are some of the employers that are hiring,” because number one some of them have never ever had a job, some of them have never completed middle school, they can’t read, they’ve never done an interview . . . so in finding out some of the things that they run into, we better prepare them by sending them through training.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The link between the risk communication themes of deterrence and social support appears to draw on procedural justice theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612436653">Greenberg &amp; Folger, 1983</xref>). That is, drug dealers and members of the community hear a message along the lines of the following:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Although we could prosecute you now, we are offering you another chance and the following services and supports. The [drug] dealing, however, must stop.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although prior DMI evaluations have largely focused on the community-level impact of this deterrence strategy, the mental models suggest a much broader theoretical foundation. These theoretical assertions, from an academic perspective, also suggest the importance of theory as a bridge between researchers, practitioners, and lay people. Similarly, measurement of constructs based on these theories could be an important aspect of theory-driven evaluations that may be able to clarify varying impact across different DMI interventions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022042612436653">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Political and Media Support</title>
<p>While the role of theory, particularly focused deterrence, is implicitly stated in the current DMI logic model (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022042612436653">Table 1</xref>) and training programs, this does not hold true for the political and media aspects of the intervention (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022042612436653">Figure 3</xref>). A clear theme during the expert interviews, highlighted by the mental model, is the importance of developing political and media support for the DMI as shown in the following quote:</p>
<fig id="fig3-0022042612436653" position="float">
<label>Figure 3.</label>
<caption>
<p>The political and media aspects of the intervention</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022042612436653-fig3.tif"/></fig>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In the very beginning . . . I’d get the political legitimate support. So your city government, then your prosecutors, probation, parole, and any large service agency that you can identify up front that you knew were going to be key.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite having its roots in community policing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022042612436653">Skogan &amp; Hartnett, 1997</xref>), the DMI represents a fairly radical change to traditional law-enforcement responses to open-air drug markets. Specifically, the effort placed on diverting and rehabilitating low-level, nonviolent drug offenders outside of the penal system have been labeled at first blush as being soft on crime or as a “hug-a-thug” approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022042612436653">Schoofs, 2006</xref>). One of the experts who were in police leadership explained as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Obviously, those who oppose this could spin it real negatively. So anybody who’s involved may get bad press. The manager got a couple negative editorials saying the city is giving jobs to dope dealers and people with good records are out of work. And the police department isn’t arresting anybody. The Hug-a-Thug thing. And a service provider may run a risk of somebody being critical and saying, “Well, I’ve been on the list for a job interview for X number of weeks and that drug dealer just got put ahead of me.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To avoid these comparisons and to help frame the DMI message to the public, it is important that the media be included in the planning stages of the intervention as shown by the following quote:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The other thing I think was key that we did was we realized that this story is way too complex for one reporter to tell it. In one article. Or one twenty-second spot on the evening news. So we cut a deal with the editor of a local paper and said you can follow us for six months. You can chronicle everything we’re doing. And if you promise not to print anything until it’s time and you promise to do it in a series article, where people can really understand it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The media also plays a significant role in sharing the success of the program with a wider audience and spreading the focused deterrence message of the call-in to individuals in the community (including participants in the open-air drug market) who are not present at the actual meeting. One expert describes how media attention has had a positive effect on the public’s perception of the program:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>So you can definitely tell a difference in people’s response, or I guess their perception maybe of how we do things. And they’ve done a good job department-wise and everything of getting that out too. There’ve been many articles in High Point paper, Greensboro paper, lots of places where they’re touting this thing and showing them hey, this is why things are better. This is why we made these changes and some things we did to make things better.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to the media, it is critical that the political infrastructure of the jurisdiction where the DMI is being implemented is notified of the intervention and provided with a chance to participate in the execution of the program. Political support is often directly tied to fiscal support of the DMI, enhanced access to social services provided by the jurisdiction, and cooperation from the local prosecutor. The success of the DMI can hinge on the ability of law enforcement to get buy-in from the political infrastructure to support a novel approach to crime that has the potential for huge reward but not without some short-term risk. One expert explains his or her approach as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We met with the city manager individually. We explained to him the theory behind what we wanted to do and asked for his support, would he support it. He said absolutely. Totally. Then we met with small groups of city council . . . and we told them this is what we propose to do, here’s how we want to do it, here’s what we need from you. We need your public support on this. And we got that.</p>

<title>Resiliency and Redundancy</title>
<p>As suggested at the beginning of the section titled “Analysis and Results,” the expert mental model of the DMI illustrates the complexity of the program as a whole. A large amount of this complexity stems from the provision of services to the call-in candidates. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022042612436653">Figure 4</xref> focuses on this aspect of the DMI. A central part of the DMI is reintegrating mid-level, low-level, and nonviolent offenders (i.e., the call-in candidate) into the community. The following quote shows the range of services and support that a candidate may require:</p>
<fig id="fig4-0022042612436653" position="float">

<p>Note: The web-like aspect of the figure emphasizes the resilient and redundant nature of the program’s service system.</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022042612436653-fig4.tif"/></fig>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We have clothes closets that provide clothing, suits, ties, whatever they need to be presented at an interview. We link up with job links at GTCC [Guilford Technical Community College], churches and various organizations that provide them with whatever they need along those lines before we send them for a job. Some of them have a job but don’t have a place to stay. Some of them need drug addiction services. Some of them just need somebody to talk to and understand what they’ve been through. Their mind is not right really to go on a job because they haven’t dealt with what has happened to them. . . . So we look more in depth at that and connect them with whatever they need to be successful.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To provide such a wide range of services, the candidates need access to an array of support mechanisms. To ensure adequate provision of these services, multiple providers who have the capability of providing overlapping (redundant) services are needed to create a resilient service ecosystem.</p>
<p>The concept of resilient and redundant ecosystems originates in the ecological sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022042612436653">Peterson, Allen, &amp; Holling, 1998</xref>) and posits “that ecological resilience is generated by diverse, but overlapping, function within a scale and by apparently redundant species that operate at different scales, thereby reinforcing function across scales” (p. 6). This redundancy allows the system to withstand shocks that may result in the loss of species and their related function by having related species fill the vacated niche. This ecological pattern has a social analogue in the DMI in terms of multiple service providers available to provide slightly overlapping services to the candidates at different scales from different sectors of society (the state, private agencies, and local nonprofit organizations). For example, access to counseling from city social services, the religious community, and ex-offender mentoring groups provides redundancy but at different scales and specialization. In other words, the city social services may be the best option for drug counseling; however, the religious community and ex-offender mentoring can provide for spiritual needs and a connection to a candidate’s local neighborhood. Previous research shows the importance of resilient and redundant social services in programs similar to the candidate rehabilitation aspect of the DMI. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612436653">Rich and colleagues (2001)</xref> suggested that HIV-positive offenders released from prison are most successful in following a treatment plan when they are provided with multiple options for medical services.</p>
<p>Although multiple service providers are important in providing redundant and resilient services for clients, for them to be effective, the service providers need to be committed to the clients and the program:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>With your agencies, you may have somebody at the table that’s only there because their job tells them that they have to be there, so there’s no reaching out compassion . . . the worst thing is to send an offender somewhere and that connection is not there or it’s broken . . . making promises that they can’t keep.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One expert demonstrates the importance of having and maintaining a relationship with the client as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I know I’m identified as a resource provider because I’m the food guy for one thing, for this whole thing, for the whole city practically. Supplying food and groceries for the offenders and their families. I’ll do anything I can, right up to Grandma. You know, go to Grandma’s house with groceries. Because that’s caring. That’s wrapping the arms around a little tighter. You know, it’s one thing to care for you, but I care for your grandmama too. That’s support . . . That’s important. That lets them know it’s not just a fleeting little thing. It’s very important. So again, my role is providing resources, whatever that may be, of encouragement before during and after the call-in. Particularly after the call-in because that’s the maintenance phase. Very important.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is also important for the service providers to follow through as one expert explains,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We actually have to do what we say. If we say we’re going to get groceries in your house, or we say we’re going to provide transportation. If we say we’ll give you a few job leads . . . whatever we say we’re going to do, we better do it. And if we don’t we start losing credibility, and rightfully so. That’s one of the obstacles. If you get a person involved in your group and it’s all this, and none of the walking but the talking, they don’t need to be a part of it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For the program to work effectively, it is important to have resilient and redundant services with providers who are connected to clients and follow through with services. However, it is also important that these service providers understand that this is a long-term commitment:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>So that’s probably the weakness in this, is that people need to understand that once you start it you don’t pull out. And there’s been an agency that asked us, “What’s the exit strategy?” There is no exit strategy . . . But it’s hard to get people out of the old mindset that this is a project and when you’re done with a project you pull out and move on to the next thing.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>We believe that this research provides an enriched understanding of the DMI from an implementation and theoretical standpoint. Specifically, the expert mental model produced by this project demonstrates the complexity of the DMI, which is lost to some degree in the current logic model of the program, and highlights areas of the DMI that are of particular interest to law-enforcement agencies and community partners that plan to implement the program in the future. Specifically, the mental model draws attention to the importance of developing a resilient and redundant social service system for the call-in candidates; the role of theory in implementing and evaluating the DMI and the need to partner with local political and media organizations.</p>
<p>In our view, a particular value of the mental model approach is the extent to which it provides a method for uncovering theoretical foundations and the interplay of theory and practice. With the exception of David Kennedy, the architect of the program, the experts that participated in the interviews were all professionals or community members drawn from law enforcement, social services, and community, including representatives of the faith community. Although not using terms such as collective efficacy or procedural justice, these individuals were able to point to criminological theoretical constructs involved in the DMI strategy. By “fleshing out” the theoretical foundations and the specific components of the DMI strategy associated with implementing the intervention, the mental model results generate hypotheses subject to future test. For example, a central component of the DMI is the focused deterrence approach whereby a high-risk group of street dealers receive a direct message with credible certainty of punishment (reinforced by examples drawn from the prosecution of individuals within their social network). This may be the component that generates the so-called “light switch” impact of the pulling-levers model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612436653">Kennedy, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612436653">McGarrell et al., 2006</xref>). However, this component alone may be more akin to the immediate but short-term impact of police crackdowns (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022042612436653">Sherman &amp; Rogan, 1995</xref>). The finding that these experts also emphasized the importance of concepts associated with building informal social control, increasing collective efficacy, and compliance through procedurally just process, may explain the apparent sustained impact from the DMI strategy, at least as suggested in the High Point, North Carolina, context (Corsaro et al., in press). Although the mental models approach does not provide a vehicle for “testing” these theoretical hypotheses, the framework does support future research tests of theory.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the study has introduced the methodology of mental models to the field of criminal justice which will be useful in future related research queries on the DMI strategy as well as potentially for other crime prevention and control strategies. Our team plans to develop mental models of various stakeholders of the DMI, such as community members in which the DMI is being implemented, the call-in candidates, and other members of the open-air drug markets being targeted by the program. These mental models will be compared with the expert mental model to determine what elements of the program resonate with each constituency and how lay perception of the program differs from experts. A particularly important question is the extent to which there is congruence between the perceptions of drug dealers and the police and social service providers involved in the DMI. We also plan to use the expert mental model in the implementation and evaluation of the program at other sites. In essence, it can serve as a de-facto checklist for aspects of the program that need to be present for the intervention to be successful. Similarly, the mental model should support theoretically driven evaluations of DMI and the broader pulling-levers strategy that may help identify the components of these strategies most important in producing crime reduction at individual and community levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612436653">McGarrell, 2010</xref>). Along these same lines, it would be valuable to develop a mental model of a failed implementation of the DMI to compare with the current model to identify potentially critical areas of the program. Such a study would help identify the components of the program that must be present for it to be successful and allow for a contrast with contexts where the DMI appears not to have its intended impact on individual and neighborhood crime, victimization, and quality of life.</p>
