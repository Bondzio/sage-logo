<abstract>
<p>We evaluated the outcome of pyrocarbon arthroplasty for proximal interphalangeal joint osteoarthritis in 18 arthroplasties carried out by a single surgeon using the Ascension prosthesis (Ascension Orthopedics Inc., Austin, Texas) in 15 patients after a mean of 6.2 years. Significant and maintained improvements in pain scores at rest and on active movements were achieved for surviving implants, and the range of motion was comparable with preoperative measurements. The radiographs, which were evaluated for evidence of ongoing migration and potential failure, were of concern in 10 out of 18 joints. Two patients required implant removal.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hand affects over 4 million people in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412437630">Arden et al., 2008</xref>). Although less frequently involved than the distal interphalangeal joint, degenerative change at the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) results in greater functional impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412437630">Murray, 2007</xref>). Treatment of PIPJ arthritis when symptoms are uncontrolled with nonoperative measures remains difficult. Arthrodesis, although effective in reducing pain and providing stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412437630">Pellegrini and Burton, 1990</xref>), does so at the expense of motion.</p>
<p>Silicone interposition arthroplasty has been used as a treatment for many years and provides effective pain relief, but does not address range of motion or deformity well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412437630">Takigawa et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, these implants have limitations in their lateral stability and are prone to problems of implant fracture and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412437630">Drake and Segalman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412437630">Pellegrini and Burton, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412437630">Takigawa et al., 2004</xref>). The use of anatomically designed pyrocarbon surface replacement arthroplasty with minimal bone resection allows preservation of the collateral ligaments, potentially resulting in improved stability and balance of tendon forces across the joint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412437630">Minamikawa et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412437630">Murray, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Early results reported at mean follow-up times between 9 and 37 months have so far been encouraging in terms of pain relief and patient satisfaction, if less so in terms of improving motion and with respect to cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412437630">Branam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412437630">Bravo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412437630">Chung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412437630">Tuttle and Stern, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412437630">Wijk et al., 2010</xref>). Complication rates are reasonably high, with instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412437630">Bravo et al., 2007</xref>), deformity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412437630">Branam et al., 2007</xref>), dislocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412437630">Chung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412437630">Tuttle and Stern, 2006</xref>), and squeaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412437630">Tuttle and Stern, 2006</xref>) reported. Further surgery may be required in up to 28% of patients. In addition, when radiological outcomes are reported, migration, lucency, and frank loosening are seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412437630">Bravo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412437630">Tuttle and Stern, 2006</xref>). The relevance of these changes in a well-functioning joint without gross deformity or bony destruction has yet to be established, but raises questions about the ability of these implants to achieve stability. In addition, there remains a lack of longer-term data to determine the place for pyrocarbon arthroplasty in the PIPJ of the hand and use of this treatment remains controversial.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the medium-term outcomes of pyrocarbon PIPJ replacements for OA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1753193412437630" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Between 2001 and 2008, the senior author (NC) performed 18 PIPJ replacements in 15 patients using the Ascension pyrocarbon PIP Total Joint (Ascension Orthopedics Inc., Austin, Texas). Patients were enrolled in the study prospectively; the criterion for inclusion was the presence of significant symptomatic OA resistant to nonoperative management. The primary outcome was preoperative and postoperative pain, assessed both at rest and on active movement using visual analogue scores. Stability and range of motion at the PIPJ were also recorded.</p>
<p>The operation was done through a dorsal incision over the PIPJ, splitting the extensor tendon longitudinally. Joint surfaces and medullary canals were prepared with powered burrs and broaches. Postoperatively, the joint was immobilized in full extension for 14 days. Active gradual flexion was then started, supplemented by dynamic splinting, if required, until a plateau of maximal flexion was achieved.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis of the pain visual analogue scale scores and range of motion was done using the Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were analyzed according to our classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412437630">Figure 1</xref>). For grading purposes, the worst score for either component in either radiographic projection was used.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Eighteen joints in 15 patients were included in the study. There were four men and 11 women. Mean age was 61 (range 45–81) years at operation, and the latest clinical and radiographic assessments were done at a mean of 6.2 (range 2.1–8.8) years postoperatively. The joints replaced were three thumb IPJs and five index, five middle, three ring, and two little finger PIPJs. The diagnosis was primary OA in 13 and post-traumatic OA in five joints. No patients were lost to follow-up.</p>
<p>The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412437630">Table 1</xref>. There was significant improvement in pain scores, with all patients with surviving implants being pain-free both at rest and on activity. The mean arc of motion was not significantly improved compared with preoperative values, but there was a marked variation postoperatively, with a range of 0–90° total arc of motion achieved. A comparison of this latest follow-up with the values at 1 year postoperatively was not significantly different (mean arc of motion 45° vs 48°, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.49). Two patients had a preoperative deformity in the coronal plane corrected by the procedure. Two patients had residual coronal deformities after the operation of 5° and 10°, respectively. Only one patient, who had the middle finger PIPJ replaced, had demonstrable instability with deformity on pinch grip.</p>

<p>Two patients required additional surgical procedures. One required a tenolysis at 14 months for stiffness and now has an excellent arc of motion of 90° at 4.1 years. Another patient had an exploration for stiffness and was found to have a disrupted extensor mechanism. Now at 5.8 years after operation, this patient has an arc of motion of only 10°.</p>
<p>Two implants in two patients required revision. One patient initially presented with extreme pain and features of complex regional pain syndrome following a previous fracture at the base of the middle phalanx. He had persistent pain and stiffness postoperatively despite a good radiographic outcome. He declined further intervention and elected to have an amputation at 7 months rather than an arthrodesis. The second patient had an IPJ replacement of the thumb revised to an arthrodesis at 20 months for persistent pain. He has since had a successful IPJ replacement for the opposite thumb.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Surgical treatment of symptomatic arthritis at the PIP joint remains an unsolved problem. Arthrodesis provides good pain relief and stability at the expense of motion, whereas silicon interposition maintains motion at the expense of stability. Pyrocarbon arthroplasty for the PIPJ was developed to attempt to address both of these issues by preserving the soft tissue stabilizers and providing a better balance of forces across the joint.</p>
<p>In our patients, pyrocarbon PIPJ replacement gave pain relief that was sustained over the medium term with levels of implant survival comparable with silicone implants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412437630">Takigawa et al., 2004</xref>). We did not perform specific functional scores on our patients, as we felt it would be difficult to isolate the effect of a single joint on the complex function of the hand using these methods. The arc of movement, although not improved, is preserved and maintained in the medium term. This, combined with the good stability of all but one implant in our patients, suggests a satisfactory functional result from the arthroplasty, and may make the procedure preferable to arthrodesis, which remains a good option for revision surgery. Although the groups are not directly comparable, the postoperative range of motion, pain relief, and revision rates appear similar to those reported with silicone interposition arthroplasty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412437630">Lin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412437630">Takigawa et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Interpreting radiographs is complicated by the fact that the pure carbon surface is a radiolucent material. Prostheses are only visible because they have a graphite core containing tungsten. As a result, the implants appear undersized with a surrounding lucent line. Our grading system identified joints that may be at risk of failure, but only looked at stem position. Those scoring 0–2 are not causing any local destruction and would need serial radiographs to monitor any progression. A score of 3–4 indicates migration of the prosthesis and potential for failure. Sixty-three percent of implants in our series fell into this latter category. The natural history of these changes has yet to unfold, but with pain relief in all patients with maintained range of motion, no revisions are currently planned.</p>
<p>We now use intraoperative fluoroscopy with a mini C-arm to aid accurate sizing and positioning of implants. Bone collected during preparation of the joint surfaces is used for impaction grafting of the prosthesis, which is inserted with minimal force. Once the prosthesis is in place, the tension should be such that manual distraction at the joint is possible, to avoid postoperative stiffness and any cam effect from the eccentric insertion of the collateral ligaments, which may lead to excessive rotational torque on the components. Finally, a postoperative regimen of splinting in slight flexion to prevent problems with hyperextension is now our preferred method, and it is worth adding that a good outpatient hand therapy service is essential. These procedures must be regarded as experimental and continued follow-up of these patients is mandatory in order to identify any developing problems.</p>
