<body>
<p>This is not a totally unbiased commentary; I was on the medical advisory committee in the AFFIRM study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512451947">1</xref></sup> and have been using natalizumab both in trials and clinical practice for 10 years. I had a patient on natalizumab who developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML; having been previously treated with mitoxantrone) and who was severely disabled as a result.</p>
<p>What many older clinicians know is that, prior to the introduction of effective therapies, patients died from highly active relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) in their 20s and 30s. I still have memories of such cases in the 1970s and 1980s. Multiple sclerosis shortens overall life expectancy by 10 years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512451947">2</xref></sup> but this figure hides the minority of patients who died within 5–10 years of onset. In a cohort of MS patients dying in the period 1951–1993, 75% of the 521 deaths of MS patients in the age group &lt;40 years of age in Denmark were attributed to their disease process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512451947">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>We do not see these devastating effects of MS today, simply because we can treat such cases effectively. Yes, there are deaths and disability due to the effects of therapy, including PML due to natalizumab and leukaemia due to mitoxantrone, but the overwhelming benefit of natalizumab in the management of highly active MS in preventing early death due to MS is obvious to any neurologist who managed this disease 20 years ago.</p>
<p>As Per Soelberg Sorensen describes, we now have a coherent risk management system for using natalizumab. Patients and physicians are fully informed of the relative risks by taking into account John Cunningham virus (JCV) antibody status, duration of natalizumab therapy and previous immunosuppression. In clinical practice the decision taken often relates to the patient’s perception of risk. Many of my patients, aware of how well their RRMS is controlled on natalizumab, find a PML risk of 1:300 acceptable compared with the much greater risk of loss of control of their RRMS by stopping therapy; some, previously treated with mitoxantrone and JCV antibody positive, accept a PML risk of 1:100. There was a greater acceptance of risks of natalizumab therapy by patients than by neurologists in a German survey, however many of the neurologists surveyed were relatively inexperienced.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Despite the well-argued points of the learned and experienced Pierre Duquette, I am afraid I must disagree with him; natalizumab is a very important therapy for highly active MS and, when risks are fully assessed, it is a very useful tool to prevent disability and death due to multiple sclerosis.</p>
