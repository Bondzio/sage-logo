<p>This edited book challenges occupational therapists to continue to push traditional practice models beyond illness and disease to an occupation-based view of health and well-being that applies to all humans whether living with acute illness, chronic disease, serious life serious life stresses, or the challenges of growing or aging. ADD ‘or’ because is it the ‘challenges of growing OR aging’ (challenges of aging and not living with aging). It also challenges occupational therapists to think beyond an individual focus of occupation to community, societal, and environmental views and to ask probing questions about whose occupations matter, and in what circumstances and why.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three parts: background to and philosophy of occupational therapy and emergence and reemergence of occupation-focused practice; current examples of emerging practice for occupational therapists; and future of the profession. Occupation-based practice is explored in the context of large organizations, such as academia, primary health care, community-based cardiac care, disability-focused employment service, a Travellers Education Service, and community development. The last chapters examine policy and government drivers and set future directions.</p>
<p>The authors of the various chapters come back repeatedly to role-emerging placements as an opportunity to explore and develop new occupation-focused opportunities. Three chapters are about these placements explicitly, two others implicitly. Much information is provided about the value and the challenges of role-emerging placements, and lessons learned from all vantage points. As the editors and chapter authors come from Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, there is an appealing interplay from one chapter to another about the challenges and opportunities that are possible when occupation is truly the focus of practice and when the context for the practice is nontraditional. Similarly, as students in role-emerging placements are often the ones who “make real” these emerging roles through their own explorations and practices, there is a stimulating reflection from students integrated with chapters from academics and practitioners about role-emerging practice and the contexts of role-emergent placements.</p>
<p>I found this book a stimulating read but also confusing at times. Was this book about role-emerging placements or about role-emerging occupational therapy? The two were clearly intertwined, but it might have been clearer to organize this book into these two parts.</p>
