<abstract>
<p>Professor Thomas Lehner is one of the most distinguished oral and dental researchers to have come out of the UK. Over the past 40 years, he has made an astonishing number of discoveries which have had an impact on our understanding of the pathogenesis of a variety of mucosal diseases. He has consistently practiced both basic and clinical research and built an integrated group of clinical and non-clinical researchers, which allowed him easy transition from the laboratory to the clinic. Tom Lehner was among the early scientists studying mucosal immunology, initially exploring oral diseases, with special emphasis on the immunobiology of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, leading to active and passive vaccination against dental caries. He was the first to demonstrate cellular immunity as the immunopathological basis of periodontal diseases, recurrent aphthous stomatitis, and candidiasis. Over the past 20 years, his expertise in mucosal immunobiology has been applied to the immunology of HIV/SIV infections. His seminal contributions include regional innate mucosal immunity, prevention of SIV infection in macaques by secretory IgA antibodies, up-regulation of CC chemokines, and the first demonstration of protective CCR5 antibodies. Arguably, his leadership, his students, and the establishment of immunology applied to oral mucosal diseases will be his greatest legacy. His contributions continue unabated.</p>

<title>Introduction and the Early Days for Oral Immunology</title>
<p>Thomas Lehner continues his research with undiminished enthusiasm, and this tribute recognizes the impact of his first 45+ years at the forefront of oral and dental research (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034513482140">Fig</xref>.). I was first influenced by Tom Lehner in 1968, when he changed the course of my career, having attended a lecture that I gave on my student research on dental anatomy and Von Korff fibers. He easily persuaded me that the new field of immunology was an opportunity that could not be missed, and how right he proved to be. Tom Lehner came to Guy’s Hospital Medical &amp; Dental School as a Nuffield Fellow in the 1960s, having already accumulated medical and dental degrees, an MD (a higher post-graduate degree in the UK), and the FRCPath (fellowship of the Royal College of Pathologists). Indeed, at this time he was a practicing pathologist performing <italic>post mortems</italic> on a weekly basis. By the time that I worked for him, he had already constructed the classic classification of candida infections of the oral cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034513482140">Lehner, 1964a</xref>).</p>

<p>Tom Lehner had undertaken dental followed by medical degrees at University College London but saw the light (!) and moved to Guy’s Hospital in 1963. Guy’s is the <italic>alma mater</italic> of Hodgkin, Bright, and Addison, among others, and has a fine history of investigative medicine, which suited Tom Lehner exactly. He joined the Oral Medicine department under Professor Martin Rushton (the first UK President of the International Association for Dental Research [IADR] in 1966), the first and most distinguished department of its kind. Brian Cooke and Rod Cawson were fellow members of the department. At this time, most research in dental schools centered on pathology departments, since they were among the few disciplines to have laboratories.</p>
<p>Guy’s Hospital Dental School demonstrated a capacity for innovation with the creation in 1970 of the first Department of Oral Immunology anywhere, and appointed Tom Lehner as Head of Department and Professor of Oral Immunology. Unfortunately, there was very little available room, and the whole department was crammed into a tiny space. His first PhD student, Mark Wilton, was housed along with centrifuges in a small garden shed at the base of the fire-escape stairs! Nevertheless, the application of immunology to oral and dental diseases led to a most productive time for Tom Lehner and his team over the next decade, where immunology was applied to an understanding of the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases with Lida Ivanyi and Mark Wilton, the immunology of caries in humans and vaccination in monkeys with Stephen Challacombe and Michael Russell, recurrent herpes labialis with Edward Shillitoe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034513482140">Lehner <italic>et al</italic>., 1975a</xref>), and to oral carcinoma as well as experimental gingivitis (Crispian Scully). From 1972 onward, a stream of innovative papers emanated from this department under Professor Lehner’s direction, demonstrating that enthusiasm for research could overcome any limitations of physical surroundings. Perhaps teamwork was actually enhanced by the close proximity of all his staff.</p>

<title>The Immunology of Dental Caries and Periodontal Diseases</title>
<p>Perhaps the work that became best known was that on the immunology of dental caries and the attempts to produce a vaccine, which took place over three decades from 1970. The new field of immunology was applied with enthusiasm to dental caries, initially in humans, and soon after as animal experimentation with the rhesus monkey model. Some reviewers of early papers seemed stunned by the concept that antibodies might protect against a disease long perceived as being ‘outside’ the immune system. Mucosal immunology was still in its infancy. However, the overriding principle was to treat dental caries as any other infective disease (like influenza, tuberculosis, or candidiasis, for example). These studies, with whole cells and antigens of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, revealed that dental caries was indeed a microbial disease that stimulated immune responses in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034513482140">Challacombe <italic>et al</italic>., 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034513482140">1973</xref>). It was Tom Lehner’s vision that real progress in the field required the expertise of a team of both clinical and non-clinical scientists. Thus, it was that Michael Russell became the first of many non-clinical scientists to join the team in 1972 and went on to unravel the main antigens of <italic>S. mutans</italic> and to the discovery of antigen I/II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034513482140">Russell and Lehner, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034513482140">Russell <italic>et al.</italic>, 1980</xref>). Later, Charles Kelly continued this work and identified the epitopes within SA I/II and the structure of SA I/II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034513482140">Kelly <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Tom Lehner decided that the most relevant model for human dental caries was the rhesus monkey. Contrary to expectations that any protection would be mediated <italic>via</italic> saliva and the mucosal immune system, the results in fact firmly established that protection was related to serum IgG antibodies and that systemic immunization against <italic>Strep. mutans</italic> could reduce caries by over 75% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034513482140">Lehner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1975b</xref>,c). This led to various studies in which Cecil Czerkinsky and Lee Rayfield played an important part in elucidating the potential mechanisms, including the inhibition of adherence and of glucosyltransferase activity. Charles Kelly produced peptides from SAI/II which could be shown to inhibit the colonization of <italic>S. mutans</italic> in humans (the first demonstration in humans of <italic>in vivo</italic> peptide inhibition of bacterial colonization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034513482140">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034513482140">Kelly <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Julian Ma followed with the demonstration that passive application of monoclonal antibodies to teeth of volunteers would also inhibit colonization of <italic>S. mutans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034513482140">Ma <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034513482140">1998</xref>). (This work was also a first in demonstrating that human flora could be modulated by passive immunization). The construction of complete molecules of secretory IgA antibodies against SAI/II in transgenic tobacco plants followed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034513482140">Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034513482140">Ma et al., 1995</xref>). In the light of subsequent progress in this field, it is interesting to note that the first human application of passive vaccines produced in plants was for dental caries.</p>
<p>Discussions between Cecil and Tom were often a source of amusement to the rest of the department. As with many Frenchmen, Cecil utilized both arms to make his points, frequently substituting hand movements, shoulder shrugs, and guttural noises for words. While the intent was clear to most, it frustrated Tom, who preferred a more classic mode of communication!</p>
<p>With Lida Ivanyi, Tom Lehner embarked on a series of ground-breaking observations on the immunology of periodontal diseases and gingivitis. They were the first to demonstrate a role for cellular immunity in the immunopathology of periodontal diseases in humans, but also demonstrated serum-suppressive factors in patients with severe disease (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034513482140">Ivanyi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1973</xref>). Once again, the close proximity between laboratory-based research and experiments on patients was demonstrated with a series of novel and important observations in experimental gingivitis, that dental plaque could have systemic effects on the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034513482140">Lehner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1974</xref>). This fundamental finding has been built on with today’s analysis of the role of oral disease on systemic health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034513482140">Hasan <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Tom Lehner’s innovative work in periodontology was recognized by his selection in 1976 for the Distinguished Scientist Award from the IADR. Later work with Frank Ashley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034513482140">Booth <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>) showed that the application of monoclonal antibodies against <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> in humans could lead to the inhibition of colonization in humans.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that Tom Lehner really established immunology as a basic discipline applied to oral and dental diseases at an international level. Recurrent aphthous ulceration (RAS) and Behçet’s disease were the first conditions to which Tom Lehner applied the new discipline of immunology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034513482140">Lehner, 1964b</xref>). He went on to determine the role of antibodies, cell-mediated immunity, heat-shock proteins, immune complexes, cryoglobulins, and HLA in the pathogenesis of RAS and in Behçet’s syndrome (<italic>e.g</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034513482140">Hasan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). As ever, however, he did not restrict his activities to laboratory-based investigations, but embarked on what still remains one of the few double-blind trials of therapeutics in RAS, using levamisole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034513482140">Lehner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the best examples of translational research is his demonstration that patients with Behçet’s syndrome reacted <italic>in vitro</italic> to specific epitopes of heat-shock protein 70. When the peptide containing this epitope was injected into a rat model, uveitis, a feature of Behçet’s, was induced. Feeding the animals the same peptide produced oral tolerance and protection against subsequent challenge. With characteristic bravery, Tom Lehner went straight to humans. Behçet’s syndrome patients were treated with the immunosuppressants to get their disease under control and were then fed the peptide. Patients were subsequently able to remain in a stable condition without any immunotherapy for periods up to two years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022034513482140">Stanford <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). This was not only a fine example of translational research but also the first demonstration that the phenomenon of oral tolerance could be successfully applied to a mucosal disease. He was made Honorary Life President of the International Society for Behçet’s Disease in 2000.</p>
<p>He was always a believer in a combination of basic and applied research and continued to pursue fundamentals of the immunology of the oral cavity, the mucosal immune system, and T- and B-cell regulation (Jonathan Lamb and Ed Zanders) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034513482140">Lamb <italic>et al</italic>., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034513482140">Lehner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1981</xref>). Throughout his career, he has successfully pursued both applied and basic research into the mechanisms of disease. Indeed, when he was appointed to a joint chair between Guy’s Hospital Medical and Dental Schools in 1987, it was as Professor of Basic and Applied Immunology, a title which was most appropriate and represented both his work and his philosophy.</p>

<title>Mucosal Immunity and HIV/SIV</title>
<p>Within the oral and dental research community, Tom Lehner is probably best known for his innovative and huge contributions to dental caries, periodontal diseases, and basic biology of the oral cavity immune systems. Outside dental research, he is equally well-known for his novel approach to mucosal vaccination against HIV. At a time when most might be satisfied with their enormous contributions to the immunology of oral diseases, from 1990 onward Tom Lehner embarked on a new, innovative, and productive area which is arguably his most successful yet. He turned his attention to the tricky question of immunity to HIV using the SIV model in non-human primates. He has produced, with his colleagues, another stream of outstanding contributions to the literature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034513482140">Lehner <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034513482140">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022034513482140">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034513482140">Peters <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034513482140">Pido-Lopez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022034513482140">Whittall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), demonstrating both the efficacy of mucosal immunization using the SIV model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034513482140">Lehner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>) and the fundamental immunological mechanisms of peptide and antigen handling within the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034513482140">Lehner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022034513482140">Seidl <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), including in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034513482140">Peters <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). He explored the critical importance of adjuvants in eliciting innate immunity, by demonstrating that CD40 and CCR5 are receptors for HSP70. For most of this work, he was supported by Lesley Bergmeier, who joined him as a technician, achieved a PhD, and eventually left to become a lecturer elsewhere.</p>
<p>Recently, he established <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> that the anti-viral factor APOBEC3G can be up-regulated by activating the CD40 and CCR5 molecules, and that APOBEC3G is significantly maintained <italic>in vivo</italic> in CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T-cells in macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022034513482140">Seidl <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022034513482140">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). He also demonstrated, in women, that systemic or mucosal alloimmunization may elicit <italic>ex vivo</italic> significant protection against HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034513482140">Peters <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). He continues this work at the same intensity today and is the project director of the international consortium of vaccination against HIV/SIV, supported by the Gates Foundation, and director of a European Union consortium to develop a mucosal allogeneic vaccine against HIV-1.</p>

<title>Impact on Oral and Dental Research</title>
<p>Tom Lehner’s enormous contributions include 350 original peer-reviewed papers of outstanding quality published in the highest impact journals (e.g., more than 35 <italic>Nature, Science, PNAS</italic>, and <italic>Lancet</italic> papers). His work has ranged from the early classification of oral and systemic candidiasis, (the classification of which is still extant today), to mucosal vaccines against HIV on which he still works. Thomas Lehner has comfortably straddled the medical/dental divide and has peppered the literature with archetypal examples of translational research where laboratory observations are taken with relative speed into human trials. The number of novel findings and their applications is astonishing.</p>
<p>Tom Lehner continues to work at the same enthusiastic pace, and generations of his PhD students, and indeed the field at large, have cause to be grateful to his continuing expertise and enthusiasm. It is not all work: In spite of having various keen sportsmen among his team and students, Tom showed no apparent interest in sport until attending a conference in Colorado. Already in his fifties, he was invited to ski and found to his surprise that he enjoyed it. He has skied regularly since, and added regular running to his ‘keep fit’ regimes. He reports that keeping fit helps his work! One of Tom Lehner’s greatest gifts to his junior staff was to imbue them with the confidence to present their work not only at IADR meetings but also in specialist immunology meetings. He can be justifiably proud of his 30+ PhD students, ten of whom are now full professors but alas two of whom are deans of other dental schools! The fact that no fewer than eight of his PhD protégés (to date) went on to run departments of their own is a lasting tribute to the success of that approach, and thus his impact on the field has been as great through his example and inspiration of others as his own considerable contributions. Not only is his son Paul a full professor at Cambridge University, researching in, guess what? – immunology – but also, like his father, he has been recognized as a Fellow of the UK Academy of Medical Sciences.</p>
<p>Tom Lehner not only brought oral and dental disease to the attention of immunologists but also laid the foundation of the principle that oral and dental research is very much part of medical research and can contribute to it. Tom Lehner has received numerous awards, including the CBE in 2003 and the FKC (Fellowship of King’s College London) in 2004, the Distinguished Service Award of the IADR in 2005, and honorary fellowship in the Royal Society of Medicine in 2008, in recognition of his broad and sustained innovative contributions to the field of basic and applied immunology, and, in particular, his contributions to dentistry and oral medicine and the field of oral immunology, which he established virtually single-handedly. What contributions! Long may they continue.</p>
