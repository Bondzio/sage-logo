<abstract>
<p>Methylphenidate is a short-acting stimulant. In this article, the authors report a 7-year-old male patient who presented with orofacial and limb dyskinesia after his first dose of methylphenidate treatment for a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; he was also receiving sodium valproate treatment for epilepsy. Orofacial dyskinesia appeared 5 hours after methylphenidate administration, persisted for 10 hours, and had completely resolved within 2 days. Although limb dyskinesia after methylphenidate is a commonly reported side effect, to the authors’ knowledge this is only the second reported case to develop both orofacial and limb dyskinesia in the acute period after the first dose of methylphenidate. This case is reported to emphasize the potential side effects of methylphenidate, individual differences in drug sensitivities, and drug–receptor interactions via different mechanisms.</p>

<body>
<p>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) begins in childhood and may be followed by a lifelong expression of symptoms, including inattention, excessive motor hyperactivity or restlessness, and poor impulse control. As a result, inattention or hyperactivity inconsistent with the maturity level of the child is observed. It is the most common neurobehavioral disorder of childhood, and usually presents in the first 3 years of life. Because the school age period is expected to foster the development of the child’s attention span and concentration, most children are diagnosed during this period.</p>
<p>Incidence of ADHD varies between 4% and 10%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812449905">1</xref></sup> Psychostimulants like methylphenidate are widely used in the treatment of ADHD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812449905">2</xref></sup> Increased use of these drugs also increases the frequency of undesirable side effects. The most common side effects include headache, irritability, tics, chorea, psychosis, and, more rarely, dyskinetic disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812449905">3</xref></sup> Although dyskinesia of the limbs is a common side effect in the literature, orofacial dyskinesia has been reported as a side effect only rarely.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812449905">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The authors report herein a 7-year-old male patient presenting with orofacial and limb dyskinesia after the first dose of methylphenidate treatment for a diagnosis of ADHD; he was also receiving sodium valproate for epilepsy.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073812449905">
<title>Case Summary</title>
<p>A 7-year-old male patient presented with the chief complaints of lip smacking, lip licking, hyperactivity, and finger movements as if playing a piano. The birth history showed that he was born following an uneventful pregnancy and delivery. His mental and motor development was normal. He had a history of congenital dislocation of the hip, bilateral ear tube insertion, and tonsilloadenoidectomy. One year ago, he experienced partial spells during sleep. His sleep electroencephalography performed in another hospital revealed epileptiform activity in the left hemisphere frontocentral area. He was diagnosed with epilepsy and treated with sodium valproate. At presentation to the hospital, he was still receiving valproic acid therapy at a dose of 250 mg twice a day. Two days prior to presentation, he had been admitted to the Child Psychiatry Clinic with complaints of hyperactivity and inattentiveness, and was diagnosed with ADHD according to the fourth edition of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>. He was prescribed methylphenidate 18 mg, offered as a single daily dose. He received the medication for the first time on the morning of admission, and involuntary movements started about 5 hours after taking the medication.</p>
<p>On physical examination, he appeared in good general condition, with a body temperature of 36.4°C, pulse 114/min, blood pressure 90/60 mmHg, body weight 25 kg (75th percentile), and height 124 cm (75th percentile). An approximately 4 × 3 cm depigmented area in the areola region, bilateral dimple on the sacroiliac region, low nasal root, increase in lumbar lordosis, and proximal origin of the thumbs bilaterally were noted on the examination. The rest of the physical exam was normal.</p>
<p>Lip-licking, lip-smacking and tongue-rolling movements were continuous throughout the physical examination. Continuous dyskinetic tongue movements inside and outside the mouth and involuntary bilateral arm swinging while sitting and standing were noted. He was opening and closing his fingers without complete extension, with occasional repetitive movements of the feet, such as beating them against each other while sitting. Orofacial and limb movements were assessed as dyskinesia. Other neurological examination findings were normal.</p>
<p>The patient was hospitalized because of the orofacial and limb dyskinesia. Because dyskinesia and excessive mobility had occurred 5 hours after the first methylphenidate dose, it was decided to follow the patient until the end of the half-life of the drug. The blood level of valproic acid and other biochemical values were normal in the laboratory examination.</p>
<p>On cranial magnetic resonance imaging, an arachnoid cyst measuring 33 × 20 × 30 mm in the right anterior cranial fossa, causing minimal compression of the anterior portion of the temporal lobe, was detected and considered an incidental finding. About 10 hours after the hospitalization (about 15 hours after methylphenidate intake), both hand–mouth movements and excessive mobility had significantly resolved. The medical team decided not to begin treatment for the dyskinesia because the intensity of the movements was decreasing. Dyskinetic symptoms had completely disappeared on the second day of hospitalization, and the patient was discharged.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Dyskinesia caused by stimulant drugs is classified into 2 categories based on the time lapsed since administration of the drug. In the first category, the dyskinetic movements occur several weeks after the first drug intake and continue despite discontinuation of the drug. They may completely disappear in a few months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812449905">5</xref></sup> Most cases in the literature are included in this group. Hypersensitivity to dopamine receptors is implicated in the pathogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812449905">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the second category, dyskinetic movements occur shortly after the drug ingestion and rapidly disappear with discontinuation of the drug. Including the current report, 6 cases in this category have been reported in the literature thus far, including 3 children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812449905">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812449905">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812449905"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812449905">8</xref></sup> Neurological side effects following administration of methylphenidate, such as headache, irritability, crying, tics, chorea, dystonia, psychosis, and, rarely, paroxysmal kinesthetic dystonia, have been reported. In addition, drug-induced tardive dyskinesia is noted as a side effect with the use of methylphenidate. Rapid-onset dyskinesia is thought to occur as a result of excessive stimulation of dopamine receptors caused by high blood levels of methylphenidate. Methylphenidate can block dopamine transport, which may lead to a dopamine agonist effect. In recent years, in addition to the dopaminergic agonist effect of methylphenidate, a basal ganglia sensitivity theory has also been considered as an etiologic factor in children with side effects. Connor et al suggested that children with basal ganglia pathology have a sensitivity to the use of methylphenidate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812449905">9</xref></sup> In this case, no retardation in motor or developmental milestones was determined. Similar acute dyskinetic side effects after the use of methylphenidate were reported in the literature in an 8-year-old patient with a diagnosis of organic brain syndrome under treatment with diphenylhydantoin and phenobarbital and in a 3-year-old patient under treatment with multiple antiepileptic therapy (phenytoin, phenobarbital, and mephobarbital).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812449905">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812449905">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Antiepileptic therapy may increase the sensitivity to the side effects of methylphenidate. Gara et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812449905">10</xref></sup> suggested avoiding the addition of methylphenidate therapy in patients being treated with sodium valproate, after an experience of rapid and severe dyskinetic side effects in 2 of their patients who were receiving sodium valproate treatment for epilepsy. According to this database, this case is only the second case worldwide in which orofacial and limb dyskinesia were detected in the acute period following administration of the first dose of methylphenidate, and the first such case in Turkey. Senecky et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812449905">6</xref></sup> reported isolated orofacial dyskinesia after the first-time use of 10 mg methylphenidate in a 6-year-old patient.</p>
<p>In 2007, Balázs et al reported the second case of orofacial dyskinesia in a 6.5-year-old male patient after administration of methylphenidate on the first 2 days as 5 mg and for 3 days as 10 mg, and both orofacial and limb dyskinesia were seen in this case.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812449905">4</xref></sup> The dyskinetic side effects resolved after discontinuation of the drug in both cases.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the authors believe that it should be kept in mind that prescription of psychostimulant drugs such as methylphenidate may lead to orofacial dyskinesia in the acute period after administration of the first dose; therefore, side effects should be monitored, and especially the families of children on antiepileptics should receive appropriate anticipatory guidance regarding this possible adverse reaction. The authors believe that the differences in and the timing of the appearance of undesirable side effects are related to individual drug sensitivities and a different drug–receptor interaction. Further genetic and pharmacokinetic studies are required to clarify the issue.</p>
