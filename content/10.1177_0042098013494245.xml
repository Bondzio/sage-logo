<p>You-tien Hsing’s <italic>The Great Urban Transformation</italic> contributes uniquely to the growing scholarship on China’s urbanisation. As Hsing writes (p. 23), her central questions are: “how does the state and society shape and become shaped by the unprecedented urban transformation of post-Mao China?” and “how does space, in the form of territoriality, play a role in these contested processes?”. These are ambitious questions and Hsing treats them more as starting points than challenges to be answered. Incomplete as its answers to these questions must be, the book nevertheless offers a profound and original interpretation of what political meaning land and built space hold for China’s rapidly urbanising society.</p>
<p>From a theoretical perspective, it is especially interesting to see how Hsing applies to China a framework influenced by Manuel Castells’s and others’ critique of ‘land-centred’ capitalist regimes of accumulation in the West. The book focuses on the dislocation and disenfranchisement (deterritorialisation) of both inner-city residents and farmers<disp-quote>
<p>While much of the debate over China’s farmland loss has focused on its implications for national food security, it is the process of land rights transfer that exerted the most immediate and violent impacts on people’s livelihoods. … The new logic of urban expansion seemed to be based on dispossession, which triggered increasingly explosive and widespread social unrest (p. 2).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this context, Hsing essentially asks: what are the conditions for civic (non-governmental collective) action in response to deterritorialisation and in what ways is urbanisation an emergent, socially ‘bottom–up’ process, despite the near-ubiquity of the state? Without dismissing the power of the state, Hsing reveals how actual outcomes of any given conflict over land are essentially unpredictable, and negotiated according to local relations and histories, which can vary significantly from place to place.</p>
<p>Hsing addresses these questions in three parts, each dealing with a different spatial zone of the typical expanding Chinese city, in an historically meaningful sequence: the redeveloping urban core; formerly agricultural villages absorbed into the expanding metropolitan region; and the rural fringe. This sequence follows the actual course of urban expansion which has shaped the politics of land development in China. Each part begins with a chapter describing the governmental and economic forces and stakeholders driving spatial change in that zone, and the projects and conflicts that result. The next chapter then describes how residents and local community groups respond, resist and either ‘reterritorialise’ themselves, or find themselves ‘deterritorialised’ in the process. The advantage of this sequence of presentation is that Hsing thereby reveals in dialectical fashion the evolving meaning of territory to Chinese society. Each zone represents something of a stage in the spatial urbanisation process; its policies and politics are to some extent informed by what has happened in previous stages of development.</p>
<p>To fully appreciate Hsing’s contribution, readers should probably be already familiar with a wide swath of the related recent literature, including books and compilations by other geographers such as Kam Wing Chan, Chengri Ding, George Lin, Laurence Ma, Fulong Wu and Yu Zhu; anthropologists such as Gregory Guldin and Li Zhang; political scientists such as Vivienne Shue, Dorothy Solinger, Lily Tsai and Susan Whiting; and urban planning scholars such as John Friedmann, Annette Kim and Weiping Wu, to mention just a few. Yet even without this background, readers will find Hsing’s book an engaging and rewarding read and perhaps as good an introduction to the subject as any—not because she provides the most thorough review of this literature, or the most complete explanation of land policy or the state of urban growth throughout the country (she does not), but because the book’s robust, empirically rich narrative and fresh-but-lucid vocabulary helps it to transcend particular disciplinary perspectives and tell a complex story through the experiences of stakeholders as well as the histories of policies and social movements and their dialectical relationships.</p>
<p>Hsing is more interested in explaining the changing political meaning of territories in the process of urbanisation than in measuring the process’s spatial dimensions. Property appears not only as a legal concept, but also as a rhetorical device in fast-changing but historically influenced political-moral conflicts. Likewise, the book is relatively untroubled by the struggles that many geographers undergo to describe the Chinese situation and make it in some way internationally comparable using terms that have emerged in other contexts (‘suburb’, ‘metropolitan region’, ‘<italic>desakota</italic>’, etc.). Her reference to Junde Liu’s concept of a ‘jurisdictional economy’ (p. 12) is especially interesting in this regard, as it highlights how administrative territories play an unusually crucial economic role in the Chinese context. <italic>The Great Urban Transformation</italic> also contributes to political-scientific/philosophical debates on the possibility of civil society and the limits of state power in China—without getting bogged down in the back-and-forth of this debate up to this point. Instead, focusing on the bureaucratic-territorial constitution of the state itself, Hsing coins the term ‘civic territoriality’ to describe the popular, non-state spatial alternatives to central-state developmentalist power. As for ‘deterritorialisation’—a term used fairly widely to discuss spatial power and resistance in Taiwan, but much less so in China—Hsing borrows and adapts the concept from Deleuze and Guattari. In this book, it suggests intriguing possibilities for the understanding of what spatial and social change mean in an historically densely populated agrarian landscape undergoing rapid urbanisation.</p>
<p>Unavoidably, a book on this topic today faces the problem of describing a fast-changing situation. Many relevant and important new developments have emerged even since the book went to press 2–3 years ago. Yet Hsing’s attention to the historical dimensions of the cases and problems she presents allows the book to transcend current affairs and it offers a framework for understanding ongoing change. Many of the policy reforms and political events that have occurred since the book’s printing reinforce the story it tells (for example, ongoing commodification of rural land and resource rights). Still, there are some implications of these changes which the book could have articulated more explicitly. Increasingly, the meaning of property and the politics of land development are shaped by public concerns about environmental and food quality and social security, in ways that the book only suggests, or discusses rather cursorily.</p>
<p>As the book describes, ongoing reforms of the dual urban–rural distinction in both land administration and household registration (<italic>hukou</italic>) are intended “to separate peasants from their land” and have the effect of weakening “the material base of village collective organization” (p. 223). Yet still peasants see their land as the only reliable form of social security. While central policy continues to focus on physical infrastructure investment, restructuring of access to rural land and resources, and stimulation of domestic consumption of manufactured goods, there are growing movements that question this mode of ‘urban–rural integration’. In cases where ex-urban land is highly valued for its agricultural use, as in the city of Chengdu, municipal <italic>hukou</italic> reforms are moving towards allowing peasants to maintain their agricultural land rights even as they are allowed to own urban residences and enjoy access to urban schools, health care and other amenities. It is not certain whether this will accelerate the sale and consolidation of peasant land holdings, and thus also the trend towards deterritorialisation of the peasantry, or lead to some other social outcome.</p>
<p>It is precisely that kind of uncertainty that makes the situation as politically dynamic as Hsing describes. Meanwhile, in rural areas both near to cities and in poorer remote regions, the central government’s Socialist New Countryside Construction programme—a response to the “three agricultural problems” (decline of agricultural output, deterioration of rural villages and destitution of peasants) (p. 100) that does not assume peasant relocation—is still viewed critically by increasing numbers of academics, policy analysts and social entrepreneurs and activists who feel it is too oriented to physical construction, increasing rural communities’ dependence on urban markets and, ultimately, to culturally ‘urbanising’ the rural population in ways that are both socially and ecologically degrading and destabilising. Expressions of this criticism include the New Rural Reconstructionist movement, which strives to enhance the collective self-reliance and self-determination of rural communities, and various urban–rural mutual aid projects, which seek to increase trust and understanding between city dwellers and peasants and even to ‘ruralise’ urban culture, to the extent that this would ameliorate the detrimental effects of rapid urbanisation on individuals and the society as a whole. In other words, whatever the logic and intentions of governmental policy towards rural land and peasants, the reform process itself has opened up political space to debate the policies and their underlying assumptions about the goals and meaning of development.</p>
<p>Hsing discusses some of these debates, but there is a sense that the book comes rather hurriedly to an end. For example, the conclusion mentions a remark by the New Left scholar and critic Qin Hui that sums up an important lesson of the book’s many cases, but does not then discuss how this lesson should influence further scholarship on land development: that the distinction between public and private ownership is less fundamental in China than it is in the West, because the very nature of ‘public’—and specifically the ‘public interest’—are not well defined and cannot be defined under the existing power structure (p. 222). Until this more fundamental problem is resolved, property has a very different meaning in China than it does in societies whose legal institutions are more stable. Hsing focuses on how current reforms actually strengthen existing power relationships and “sustain the land-centred regime of accumulation” (p. 223). However, the various ways that the concept of property may also subvert this regime need further reflection and analysis.</p>
<p>The stakes are high, and extend to the fundamental social contract that China’s revolution-forged regime has with its people. Hsing does point out in the preface that<disp-quote>
<p>China’s triple movement of industrialization, urbanization, and marketization over the past three decades hardly provides a case of gradualism, a word often used to compare China’s reforms with Russia’s ‘Big Bang’ reforms in the early 1990s (p. 3).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The full significance of this observation is only implied in the remainder of the book. The ‘gradualism’ Hsing mentions is not only a descriptive term, but also key to the regime’s political justification of the inequalities and disruptions of market-oriented development (expressed, for example, in Deng Xiaoping’s slogan “Let some people get rich first”). Such ‘gradual’ development is only acceptable in China’s revolutionary ideology if the predictable end of development is to enrich everyone. Yet as Hsing’s story suggests, the very process of land-centred accumulation involves both self-reinforcing power structures as well as forms of resistence and negotiation.</p>
<p>How does the tension between power and resistance then produce new definitions not only of property, but also of ‘development’, ‘urban’ and ‘rural’? On the one hand, urban–rural regions, including services, industry and agriculture, may have to be more spatially integrated in China than anywhere else in the world. I believe Hsing is correct to see the current model of ‘integration’ to be a threat to the peasantry in the senses referred to earlier. More than that, as she wonders in her concluding sentence, “the long-term modernist impulse toward the territorial integration of urban economy, polity and society” may ultimately defeat even the most successful current examples of village community survival that she describes in this book: the southern lineage-based corporatist villages-turned-shareholding-companies discussed in chapter 5. Yet as mentioned earlier, there are other models of village-based resistance and development. Given the age of China’s agrarian social-ecological systems and the density of population in the rural ‘fringe’ of cities, integration suggests a role for ‘the peasantry’ as stewards of regional urban-rural ecology as well as a source of cheap industrial labour.</p>
<p>These should be exciting times for urbanisation theory, but the extremes of historical continuity and discontinuity, population size and density, cultural-geographical diversity and speed and scale that characterise China’s development, intimidate efforts to describe the phenomenon, much less explain it. In the face of these challenges, You-tien Hsing has crafted a broad but concise, coherent but open-ended narrative. Readers who make <italic>The Great Urban Transformation</italic> their introduction to China’s urbanisation will gain much from this book, even if they do not see all the implications of its findings and insights. Readers who have worked in the field for some time will find this book suggestive of promising new directions for research and action.</p>
