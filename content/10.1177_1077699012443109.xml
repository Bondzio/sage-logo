<p>This is a recent product of the two-decade-old Euromedia Research Group, which sponsors cross-country research on all aspects of European media, both print and electronic.</p>
<p>The chapters in this volume (each reviewed by at least two peers) appear in two unnamed sections, the first of which is focused on current assessments of the press, radio, commercial television, and online media, plus two overview chapters. The idea is to provide an up-to-date survey of ongoing developments and trends across the Continent.</p>
<p>The second part of the collection turns to essays on overarching topics of concern across Europe. These include assessments of the deficits and potentials of public spheres, the varied ways that media are generally serving democracy, the trend from media regulation to democratic media self-governance, changing media industries, the ongoing trend from pubic service broadcasting to advertiser-supported public service media, changing journalism practices, European media and ethnic minorities, and Europe as a world news leader.</p>
<p>That the book has so many editors attests to the breadth of the coverage—and the team that produced it. Trappel is professor of media policy and media economics at the University of Salzburg; Meier is a senior researcher and lecturer at the Institute of Mass Communication and Media Research at the University of Zürich; D’Haenens is associate professor in the Department of Communication at the University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands; Steemers is professor in the School of Media, Arts, and Design at the University of Westminster, Harrow; and Thomass is professor in the Institute for Media Studies at Ruhr University.</p>
