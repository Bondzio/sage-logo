<abstract>
<p>Polylactide (PLA) suffers from poor processability due to its low melt strength and slow crystallization kinetics and it is thus very challenging to achieve uniformly distributed fine-celled PLA foams with high void fractions in injection molding process. In this work, the low-pressure structural foam molding of linear PLA with a relatively high void fraction of ∼30% was conducted and by fine tuning the talc content and the foaming and processing parameters, a relatively uniform fine-celled structure with improved cell size and cell density was successfully produced. The effects of twin-screw compounding and the addition of talc on the foaming behavior, structural uniformity, crystallinity, and mechanical properties of the solid and foamed PLA samples were investigated. The results showed that the addition of 5 wt.% talc significantly improved the foaming properties such as cell density, cell size, structural uniformity, and consequently improved the mechanical properties of foams. The twin-screw compounding before injection molding did not significantly change the foaming behavior, but adversely affected the mechanical properties of the solid and foamed PLA samples due to mechanical and thermal degradation. The changes in the mechanical properties were discussed in terms of the crystallinity, talc toughening effect, and foam quality.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021955X13481993" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polylactide (PLA) is a biobased, biodegradable, and biocompatible aliphatic polyester. Due to its unique set of properties, it has many applications in the packaging, biomedical, pharmaceutical, and structural fields.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021955X13481993">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021955X13481993"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021955X13481993"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021955X13481993"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021955X13481993">5</xref></sup> As a biobased polymer, PLA is made from renewable resources such as corn. It can be naturally recycled by biological processes, thereby reducing society’s dependency on depleting fossil fuels. By extension, it could help in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Although PLA has these environmental advantages, it also has inferior properties such as poor melt strength, brittleness, a narrow processing window, and sensitivity to moisture and heat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X13481993">6</xref></sup> To broaden PLA’s applications, its properties and processing ability must be improved. The final cost of the products must also be taken into account.</p>
<p>Fine-celled injection foam molding introduces such advantages as less material usage, greater dimensional stability, a shorter cycle time, and less energy consumption. At the same time, it can potentially improve some mechanical properties such as fatigue life and impact strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021955X13481993">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021955X13481993"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021955X13481993"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021955X13481993"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X13481993"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021955X13481993"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021955X13481993"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021955X13481993"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X13481993">15</xref></sup> High-pressure microcellular injection molding is widely used in structural foaming. Cell nucleation and coalescence control in high-pressure injection molding both with and without mold opening are relatively easy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021955X13481993">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X13481993"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021955X13481993">12</xref></sup> But this technology is limited only to the void fractions of 5–15%. To achieve void fractions greater than 20% without using mold opening technology, low-pressure structural foam molding technology is used. In contrast to high-pressure structural foaming, it is very challenging to control the foaming properties of cell nucleation, growth, and coalescence in low-pressure structural foam molding technology with a short shot. The foam’s structural uniformity, high cell density, and small cell sizes are not easily achieved for a relatively high void fraction of over 20% without mold opening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021955X13481993">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X13481993"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021955X13481993">12</xref></sup> With its well-known low melt strength and slow crystallization kinetics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X13481993">6</xref></sup> it is even more difficult to uniformly foam PLA in low-pressure structural foam molding. To achieve uniformly distributed fine-celled PLA foams in low-pressure structural foaming, the melt strength and the crystallization behavior of the PLA should be improved and the processing window also should be carefully identified.</p>
<p>Substantial research has been conducted on injection foam molding and characterization for many different plastics. Yet, there has been limited research in these areas for PLA. Recently, some workers have tried the high-pressure structural foaming of PLA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X13481993">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X13481993">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021955X13481993"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021955X13481993"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021955X13481993"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021955X13481993"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021955X13481993">20</xref></sup> It has been shown that the addition of nanoclay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021955X13481993">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021955X13481993">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021955X13481993">19</xref></sup> and chain extender<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X13481993">6</xref></sup> improves the foaming behavior of PLA by enhancing the melt strength and increasing cell nucleation power. Pilla et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021955X13481993">18</xref></sup> have also reported that the average cell size decreases while the cell density and degree of PLA crystallinity increase with the fiber content in the injection-molded PLA/flax fiber composites. However, all these works are focused on the high-pressure injection foam molding with relatively low void fraction.</p>
<p>In the injection molding of PLA, most of the literature refers to the properties of as received PLA as a baseline when dealing with composites, compounds, or blends of PLA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X13481993">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021955X13481993">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021955X13481993">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021955X13481993">19</xref></sup> The majority of these material systems were, however, prepared by an aggressive compounding process. This can reduce the molecular weight of PLA due to the thermal and mechanical degradation that occurs during compounding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021955X13481993">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021955X13481993">21</xref></sup> It has also been reported that the thermal history significantly affects PLA’s crystallization behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021955X13481993">22</xref></sup> Recently, Pantani et al. studied the crystallization kinetics of as received and processed PLA. They showed that it changes after regular extrusion and injection-molding processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021955X13481993">23</xref></sup> Such results for as received neat PLA can therefore be of very limited use or even misleading for processed PLA compounds.</p>
<p>Low-pressure injection foam molding has been previously used for various thermoplastic foams such as polyethylene, polypropylene, and thermoplastic polyolefin to achieve relatively high void fraction with incomplete mold filling and without using mold opening technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021955X13481993">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021955X13481993">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X13481993"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021955X13481993">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021955X13481993">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021955X13481993">25</xref></sup> However, the low-pressure injection foam molding of PLA is much more challenging compared with these relatively foamable resins due to PLA’s weak melt strength and it has not been extensively studied.</p>
<p>In this study, we tried to find the processing window which can lead to the production of PLA/talc composite foams with uniformly distributed fine cells and a high void fraction in a low-pressure structural foaming system with partial filling. The effects of talc as a cell nucleating agent on the cell morphology, structural uniformity, crystallization behavior, and mechanical properties of PLA foams were studied. Three different solid and foamed material systems were investigated: as received neat PLA (PLA-A), processed neat PLA (PLA-P), and PLA processed with 5 wt.% talc (PLA-T). This was undertaken to decouple the effects of the compounding process and the addition of talc on the foaming properties, crystallization behavior, and tensile properties. The effects of annealing after injection molding on the crystallinity and tensile properties of the solid and foamed samples were further investigated.</p>

<p>Prior to compounding and dry blending, PLA pellets were oven dried at 65℃ for at least 6 h to remove any excess moisture. PLA with 5 wt.% talc (PLA-T) was then compounded using an intermeshing and co-rotating twin-screw extruder with a screw diameter of 30 mm [Werner &amp; Pfleiderer ZSK-30, length/diameter (L/D) = 38:1]. The compounding temperature and screw speed were 170℃ and 40 rpm, respectively. In order to decouple the sole effects of the compounding process and the addition of talc, the neat PLA was also compounded without talc (PLA-P) using the identical processing conditions as used for the PLA-T compound (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021955X13481993">Table 1</xref>).

<p>A 50-ton Arburg Allrounder 270/320 C injection molding machine (Lossburg, Germany) with a 30-mm diameter screw was used to conduct the experiments. The mold contained a rectangular cavity with a fan gate after the sprue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X13481993">Figure 1</xref>). The cavity dimensions were 152.4 mm× 101.6 mm× 3.2 mm. More details about the mold can be found in Lee et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021955X13481993">12</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021955X13481993">Table 2</xref> summarizes the processing parameters used in the injection molding of solid and foamed samples. It is noted that the processing parameters were first optimized by a series of trial and error experiments. This was done to minimize the processing temperature, and thus reduce the thermal degradation of PLA, and also to achieve relatively similar pressure profiles within the cavity at three different locations: near the gate and at the middle and end of the samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X13481993">Figure 1</xref>). Similar pressure profiles at different locations were very important to achieve uniform foam morphology along the sample. The injection flow rate affected the pressure profiles significantly and was a very effective parameter for foaming, and thus four different injection flow rates (15, 25, 50, and 100 cm<sup>3</sup>/s) were studied. For the selected processing temperature of 170℃, a melt pressure of 17 MPa was chosen to ensure that it was sufficiently higher than the solubility pressure for the 0.6 wt.% N<sub>2</sub> injected into the polymer melt.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021955X13481993">26</xref></sup>

<p>The mold cavity pressures were measured near the gate, at the middle of the cavity, and near the end of the cavity, during the entire injection cycle using three PT462E Dynisco pressure transducers and a DAQ board (Compact DAQ Kit, National Instruments). The pressure transducers were located in the inserted mold, so that they flush-mounted along the filling direction in the longitudinal centerline of the cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X13481993">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The ASTM D638-03 was adopted for the static tensile testing of the solid and foamed samples. The specimen geometry of Type IV was chosen and cut from the injection-molded samples, parallel to the samples’ longitudinal centerline with a slight distance from the center. A die cutter under compression molding was used to cut the specimens. The tensile tests were conducted at room temperature (∼25℃) and atmospheric conditions (relative humidity of ∼50 ± 5%) with a 10-kN load cell on an Instron tensile tester. The crosshead speed was set at 5 mm/min. Five replications were tested for each condition, and the average values and their standard deviations are reported. Toughness was obtained by integrating the area under the stress–strain curve. The specific values of stress, strength, modulus, and toughness were obtained by dividing their measured values by the density of the test specimen.</p>
<p>To assess the effect of annealing on the tensile properties of the injection-molded samples, the tensile bars were annealed by placing them inside a temperature-controlled oven at 90℃ for 60 min. They were then removed from the oven and cooled down to room temperature before tensile testing. The DSC results showed that 60 min of annealing at 90℃ was sufficient for the samples to fully crystallize.</p>

These were the skin layer, the transition region, and the core region, which were identified as S, T, and C, respectively, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X13481993">Figure 2</xref>. The skin layer presented a solid unfoamed structure, and its thickness remained approximately unchanged for PLA-A, PLA-P, and PLA-T at a given injection flow rate. The skin layer thickness was governed mainly by the cooling rate. Cavity pressure measurements showed very similar pressure profiles for these three materials under identical processing conditions. This indicated that the difference in their viscosity caused by processing or by the addition of 5 wt.% talc was not sufficient to change the melt flow pattern inside the cavity. Thus, the cooling rate was not significantly affected. Therefore, the difference in the cooling rate of these materials that were injection molded under the same conditions did not result in different skin layer thicknesses. Both the transition and core regions possessed a cellular structure, but with different cell morphologies. The major difference between the core and transition regions was the degree of cell elongation, which was much more severe in the transition region.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X13481993">Figure 2(a) and (b)</xref> shows that the cell morphology was similar for both the received and the processed PLA foams. The injection-molded samples had an approximately 500 µm of skin layer thickness and a region of 500 -µm thick next to the skin layer was considered as the transition region. The cells were elongated at both the core and transition regions, with a greater degree of severity in the transition region. This similarity indicated that the compounding procedure before injection molding had no significant effect on the PLA’s foaming behavior. However, the cell morphology changed after the talc was added. In the core region, the cells were relatively uniform in size and in distribution and retained their spherical shape during cell growth. Two types of cells were observed in the transition region: (a) very fine cells with relatively spherical shapes and (b) large cells that had been elongated in the melt flow direction, and which were similar to those in the neat PLA but had much smaller aspect ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X13481993">Figure 2(c)</xref>). It is believed that with the absence of talc, the PLA’s poor cell nucleating ability and relatively low melt strength coupled with the relatively high shear rates during the melt flow inside the cavity adversely affected the foaming behavior. This resulted in highly elongated cells in the direction of the melt flow throughout the part thickness between the two skin layers. Cell coalescence also occurred occasionally and created some very long and relatively large cells. However, the addition of 5 wt.% talc increased both the cell nucleation ability and the melt strength. In this condition, a larger number of cell nuclei could be created and gently grow, especially in the core region, where the shear effect was lower than that in the transition region. A significant number of cells in the transition region also retained their spherical shape. However, some highly elongated cells were observed in this region. This situation might be further improved by increasing the talc content and, therefore, the melt strength.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021955X13481993">Figure 3(a) and (b)</xref> shows the cell density and cell size of PLA-A, PLA-P, and PLA-T foams. Even though some cells were severely elongated in the transition region, the cell density of the transition region was roughly also measured using the same method as for the spherical cells of the core in order to be able to compare the results of different materials. Within the entire text, the error bars show± 1 standard deviation. Overall, the cell density was slightly higher in the transition region than in the core. One reason for this difference could be that the transition region was filled and formed earlier than the core region. Thus, the pressure drop was higher which, in turn, resulted in a greater number of cell nuclei. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021955X13481993">Figure 3(a) and (b)</xref>, the cell density and cell size did not markedly change with the addition of the compounding step, as had happened in the overall foam structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X13481993">Figure 2</xref>). The added talc, however, increased the cell density by approximately an order of magnitude and decreased the average cell size from about 100 µm to 30 µm. Furthermore, the addition of talc significantly improved the uniformity of cell size, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X13481993">Figure 4</xref>. The cell size ranged from 10 µm to 250 µm for PLA-A while the range shrank to 10–70 µm in PLA-T foams. The cell size distribution remained approximately unchanged after the compounding step (PLA-P).

The <italic>T</italic>-test analysis showed that the differences between the average void fraction values were not statistically significant at a 95% confidence interval. This was expected since the void fraction was controlled mainly by the set void fraction and the injection processing parameters that were the same for all of the foams. It is noted that the measured local void fractions were higher than the set void fraction. If the void fractions of the sprue, runner, and injection-molded parts had been uniform, the measured void fraction from the molded part would have been the same as the set void fraction. However, the void fractions of the spure, runner, and gate were lower than those of the injection-molded part itself, as also reported in Lee and Park.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X13481993">11</xref></sup> This must have been caused by the pressure in the sprue and runner that was much higher than the pressure in the mold cavity.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X13481993">Figure 6</xref> shows the SEM micrographs of PLA-T foams molded with different injection flow rates. With the increased injection flow rate, the cells started to distribute more uniformly in terms of size and location. Also, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021955X13481993">Figure 7</xref>, the higher injection flow rates resulted in smaller cell sizes and greater cell densities. Increasing the injection flow rate from 15 cm<sup>3</sup>/s to 100 cm<sup>3</sup>/s reduced the average cell size from 61 ± 20 µm to 17 ± 11 µm and increased the cell density from 5.7 × 10<sup>6</sup> ± 1.0 × 10<sup>6</sup>cells/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021955X13481993">3</xref></sup> to 1.2 × 10<sup>8</sup> ± 1.4 × 10<sup>7</sup>cells/cm<sup>3</sup>. The injection flow rate effect can be explained in terms of the melt cooling and the cavity pressure during the injection. The degree to which the melt cooled varied with the injection flow rate. A higher injection flow rate reduced the cooling rate during injection, which resulted in a lower melt viscosity and increased the mixture’s ability to flow. In addition, because the melt temperature was high, the time for cell nucleation and growth was longer at a high injection flow rate. Furthermore, the maximum pressure inside the cavity decreased with the increased injection flow rate. This would have been resulted in greater pressure drop rate during the injection and consequently larger number of cell nuclei. Therefore, higher injection flow rate provided a circumstance where a larger number of cell nuclei could grow in the matrix that had increased flowability. This resulted in spherical cells with a greater cell density and smaller cell sizes, specifically, at the core which was hotter than the transition region. The effect of the injection flow rate on foaming is further discussed in Section 3.2.2. The local void fraction measured at the middle of the samples did not significantly change with the increase in injection flow rate.

Likewise, near the gate, due to the shortest flow length being there, the shear effects and cell elongation were minimized. Even though some differences were observed in the cell morphology of different locations, the cell density, local void fraction, and pressure profile measurements revealed a noticeable structural uniformity.

The <italic>T</italic>-test analysis revealed that the differences between the cell density and void fraction values at different locations were not statistically significant at a 95% confidence interval. This indicated that the cell structure was statistically uniform throughout the PLA-T samples. For the PLA-A and PLA-P foams, however, there were some differences in the cell density and void fraction at different locations. For the PLA-P specifically, the cell density and void fraction at the sample’s end were found to be relatively lower and higher, respectively, compared with those near the gate and at the middle. Because of the combined effects of the PLA’s poor melt strength and the longer flow length at the sample’s end, there was too much cell growth and thus elongation. Also, some severe coalescence occurred at this location, which resulted in very big cells and, consequently, a lower cell density and a higher void fraction. This might have been caused by the synergistic effect of PLA’s poor melt strength and excessive cell growth at the end location. Similar observations near the gate, middle, and end locations of injection-molded samples have been also reported for other plastics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X13481993">11</xref></sup> The added talc appeared to increase the PLA’s melt strength and cell nucleating power.

<p>It has been reported in the literature that the unfoamed skin layer thickness in injection foam-molded samples is sensitive to the injection flow rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021955X13481993">28</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021955X13481993">Figure 11</xref> shows the variations in the skin layer thickness, with the injection flow rate, near the gate and at the middle and end of the PLA-T foams. At the lowest injection flow rate, the skin layer thickness was significantly non-uniform and ranged from 680 µm near the gate to 410 µm at the end of the sample. With the increased injection flow rate, the skin layer thickness decreased at all the locations with a greater rate near the gate than at the end of the sample. This trend of change in the skin layer resulted in a fairly uniform distribution of approximately 300 µm of skin layer thickness throughout the samples’ length at the highest injection flow rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021955X13481993">Figure 11</xref>). At a higher injection flow rate, the injection and filling time were shorter and thus the temperature difference between different sample’s locations was decreased. This provided a fairly consistent situation in terms of temperature and pressure in different sample’s location and gave the cells the opportunity to nucleate and grow within a greater thickness of the cavity at different locations and resulted in a smaller unfoamed layer in the skin at all the locations. The effect was more pronounced near the gate, where the melt first touched the mold cavity surface and solidified earlier. At a lower injection flow rate, there was more time for the melt to slowly pass through this region. The result was a thicker solid skin. At a high injection flow rate, the time factor was minimized, and the result was a fairly uniform skin layer at the samples’ near gate, middle, and end locations.

With the increased injection flow rate, however, the difference between the cell density values measured at different locations was reduced, and beyond the injection flow rate of 50 cm<sup>3</sup>/s, the values were very similar. To achieve final uniform cell morphology, uniform cell nucleation is required throughout the sample. Cell nucleation is controlled by the magnitude of the pressure drop and the pressure drop rate across the gate during the injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021955X13481993">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021955X13481993">12</xref></sup> To quantify the effects of these parameters, the cavity pressure was measured at the samples’ near gate, middle, and end locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X13481993">Figure 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021955X13481993">Figure 13</xref> shows the maximum values of the cavity pressures at different injection flow rates in these same locations.

Therefore, the cell nucleation behavior that is governed by the pressure drop and the pressure drop rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021955X13481993">7</xref></sup> was expected to be more uniform during the entire injection cycle at higher injection flow rate.

<p>Adding 5 wt.% talc to the compounded PLA samples further increased the crystallinity by about 50%.

<p>In most of the literature, the change in crystallinity during the compounding with talc is attributed completely to the talc effect. However, it is very important to note that compounding itself has a significant effect on the PLA’s crystallinity. For example, in this study, more than 50% of the increase in crystallinity was due to the compounding alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021955X13481993">Figure 14</xref>). The relatively high shear stresses undergone by the polymer during the injection and filling processes might have also contributed to its relatively high crystallinity through the action of shear-induced crystallinity. It should also be noted that foaming did not appear to significantly affect the samples’ final crystallinity. The difference in the crystallinity values of the corresponding solid and foamed samples was found to be statistically insignificant at a 95% confidence interval.</p>
<p>It is noted that the greater amount of crystallinity in PLA-T samples could have partially contributed to the achievement of foams with large cell density and small cell size by further increasing the melt strength during the foaming. Further study is needed to clarify this effect.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021955X13481993">Table 3</xref> lists the crystallinity of the solid and foamed PLA-A, PLA-P, and PLA-T samples before and after the annealing process. The crystallization half-time of the samples’ isothermal cold crystallization is also given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021955X13481993">Table 3</xref>.

<p>The final crystallinity after annealing was found to be approximately the same for PLA-P and PLA-T. This can be attributed to their similar processing history and thus their similar molecular structure. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021955X13481993">Table 3</xref> shows, the crystallization half-time was decreased by the added talc, indicating that it increased the PLA’s crystallization rate. This can be correlated to the higher crystallinity that the PLA-T samples achieved after injection molding.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021955X13481993">Figure 15</xref> shows the stress–strain curves for solid and foamed PLA-A, PLA-P, and PLA-T. In both solid and foamed PLAs, performing the compounding before the injection molding changed the overall failure behavior of the PLA from a relatively ductile characteristic to a brittle one. However, with the addition of 5 wt.% talc during compounding, the failure behavior resembled that of the as received PLA, that is, relatively ductile in both the solid and foamed cases.

Overall, the specific strength of the foamed samples was 10–26% lower than that of the corresponding solid samples. To evaluate the sole effect of the added talc, the PLA-P and PLA-T were compared. The strength of the foamed samples increased by 15% with the addition of 5 wt.% talc, so that the difference between the specific tensile strength of the solid and foamed PLA-T samples reached as low as 10%. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0021955X13481993">Figure 16(b)</xref>, the specific modulus of the foamed samples was higher than that of their corresponding solid samples, except in the case of processed PLA, which was slightly lower. The compounding process decreased the specific modulus of the as received PLA by about 5%. The addition of the 5 wt.% talc increased the specific modulus of the processed PLA by 15%, resulting in foamed PLA-T samples with a specific modulus that was 17% greater than that of the solid PLA-T sample.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0021955X13481993">Figure 16(c) and (d)</xref> show the strain at break and the specific toughness of the PLA-A, PLA-P, and PLA-T. Overall, the foamed samples showed a lower strain at break and a lower specific toughness up to a maximum of 14% and 33%, respectively, compared with their corresponding solid counterparts. The compounding process significantly decreased the strain at break and the specific toughness of both the solid and foamed PLA samples up to 41% and 49%, respectively. However, the addition of talc significantly improved the strain at break and the specific toughness of the processed PLA. For the foamed samples, the strain at break and the specific toughness increased by approximately 60% and 90% with the introduction of 5 wt.% talc.</p>
<p>In the case of PLA-P, increased crystallinity enhanced the strength and modulus while the mechanical degradation during the twin-screw compounding adversely affected them. Thus, it appears that these two factors compensated each other and resulted in approximately unchanged modulus and strength. However, both mechanical degradation and increased crystallinity caused a transition in the failure behavior from ductile to brittle, with a significantly decreased strain at break and lessened specific toughness.</p>
<p>In the case of solid PLA-T, even though the crystallinity was further improved with the added talc, this addition had a more pronounced toughening effect. Thus, the chain mobility was increased and resulted in a slightly lower strength and modulus. The toughening effect of talc significantly improved the strain at break and specific toughness. The reduced constraint caused by the poor interface bonding between the talc particles and the matrix molecules might have also enhanced the chain mobility. In contrast to the solid PLA-T samples, the specific strength and modulus of the foamed PLA-T samples increased by adding talc. The improvement in these properties was attributed to the uniformly distributed fine cells with greater cell density and smaller cell size in the PLA-T foams which differed from those in the PLA-A and PLA-P foams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X13481993">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, the foamed samples had lower average values for speciﬁc strength, strain at break, and speciﬁc toughness compared with those of the solid ones. This can be attributed to the presence of certain large voids that formed due to the dynamic nature of injection foam molding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X13481993">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021955X13481993">12</xref></sup> These voids may be much larger than the naturally occurring voids in the solid samples and may become regions of stress concentrations, thereby decreasing the mechanical properties of the foam.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X13481993">6</xref></sup> This was clearly seen in the inferior mechanical properties of the as received and processed neat PLA foams, which had poorer foam properties than the PLA-T samples. By adding talc to the processed PLA, the foamed samples’ mechanical properties were more improved than in the solid samples. This was associated with the more uniform cell morphology of the PLA-T samples, which reduced the number of large voids and resulted in further improved mechanical properties. For the speciﬁc modulus, the foamed PLA-T samples had higher value (17%) than their solid counterparts.</p>
<p>Comparing the specific tensile properties of the neat PLA and PLA with talc, it was seen that the combined effects of compounding and the addition of talc improved the tensile properties only slightly. In other words, most of the improvement achieved by adding talc was cancelled out by the adverse effect of the compounding itself. Understanding the exact effects of compounding can provide insights into preparing suitable compounding procedures. For example, preparing a high-content talc masterbatch and then diluting it to a lower talc content by simple dry blending can significantly reduce the compounding’s adverse effects.</p>

<p>Low-pressure structural molding of PLA foams was conducted and characterized. Three different material systems were investigated: as received neat PLA, compounded neat PLA, and PLA compounded with 5 wt.% talc. This was done to assess the sole effects of twin-screw compounding and the addition of talc on the foaming behavior, structural uniformity, crystallization behavior, and mechanical properties of the solid and foam injected PLA samples.</p>
<p>This study demonstrated the procedure and strategies of producing fine-celled PLA foams with a relatively high void fraction (∼30%) and uniform structure. The results revealed that the compounding procedure could cause significant changes in the PLA’s thermal and mechanical properties. These changes were caused not only by the additive but also by the processing itself, and they should be taken carefully into account.</p>
<p>The addition of 5 wt.% talc markedly improved the foaming ability, achieving greater cell density, smaller cell size, and increased structural uniformity throughout the sample. However, the twin-screw compounding did not significantly affect the foaming behavior. Furthermore, the injection flow rate was found to be one of the most influential processing parameters in the injection foam molding. When it was increased, the foaming properties and the structural uniformity also noticeably increased.</p>
<p>The compounding process, addition of talc, and annealing process all increased the PLA’s final crystallinity and consequently affected the mechanical properties. Talc also showed significant toughening effect. The compounding process produced a significant adverse effect and introduced a marked brittleness to the PLA samples. In both the solid and foamed processed PLA samples, this processing effect was more pronounced in the strain at break and specific toughness. The addition of talc had little effect on the PLA’s specific modulus and strength. But, it significantly increased the strain at break and the specific toughness and thus improved the ductility of the solid and foamed processed PLA samples. This improvement was more pronounced in the foamed samples than in the solid ones due to the talc effect in achieving fine-celled uniform foams. Also, the annealing process changed the failure behavior of all solid and foamed samples from ductile to brittle, with an increased modulus and strength and a reduced toughness.</p>
