<p>Introduction: To evaluate supraclavicular scalenectomy ± cervical rib excision for thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), employing Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scoring for functional assessment post-decompression. Methods: A <italic>Quick</italic>DASH score was calculated for each patient using the algorithm: ([sum of responses/n] − 1) × 25, where n = number of completed responses. Nonparametric analysis was employed, with significance defined as <italic>P</italic> ≤ .05. Results: Twenty-one patients were treated for TOS by the same surgeon; with 5 bilateral procedures (total = 26 procedures). Median DASH scores pre- and postoperatively were 68.5 and 36.0, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .002). Just one reported worsening of symptoms postoperatively. Antecedent trauma and smoking were inversely associated with DASH score postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> = .005 and <italic>P</italic> = .005). Postoperative scores were less for patients with vascular symptoms (<italic>P</italic> = .011); scores did not change significantly for those with neurologic (<italic>P</italic> = .066) or mixed symptoms (<italic>P</italic> = .345). Conclusions: This study reconfirmed the value of supraclavicular approach for TOS, with the vast majority reporting subjective improvement.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The title thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) has been broadly defined as a symptom complex characterized by pain, paraesthesia, weakness, and discomfort in the upper limb, aggravated by elevation of the arms or by exaggerated movements of the head and neck.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574411434164">1</xref></sup> The underlying structures suffering compression include the subclavian artery and vein (vascular TOS, vTOS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574411434164">2</xref></sup> and the lower trunk of the brachial plexus (neurogenic TOS, nTOS), this latter condition accounting for some 90% of all TOS presentations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574411434164">3</xref></sup> Sources of compression have been postulated to include the first rib and its anomalies, the anterior scalene muscle, the clavicle in the costoclavicular space, and the tendon of pectoralis minor in the subcoracoid tunnel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574411434164">4</xref></sup> Of these the anterior scalene muscle and the interscalene triangle—whose boundaries comprise the anterior scalene muscle anteriorly, the middle scalene muscle posteriorly, and the medial surface of the first rib inferiorly—have been postulated to be of greatest importance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574411434164">5</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) scoring system was first developed in 1994 by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, the Council of the Musculoskeletal Specialty Societies (COMSS), and the Institute for Work &amp; Health of Ontario. Despite it being the most widely tested instrument in the upper extremity literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574411434164">6</xref></sup> just 3 studies have thus far examined the use of DASH as a functional outcome measure following surgical decompression for TOS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574411434164">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574411434164"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574411434164">9</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The primary aim of this work was to evaluate the use of supraclavicular scalenectomy plus or minus cervical rib excision as a surgical approach in the management of TOS and, in particular, to examine factors which might be predictive of postoperative outcome. Although the 2010 Cochrane review on TOS concluded that “research is needed to establish … standardized methods of outcome assessment and reporting” in the management of TOS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574411434164">10</xref></sup> a secondary aim of this work was to further determine the appropriateness or otherwise of the DASH scoring system in the assessment of functional outcome following operative decompression for TOS.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1538574411434164">
<title>Preoperative Workup</title>
<p>Following a careful history, each patient was examined using a variety of techniques including the upper limb tension test (ULTT) and the 90° abduction in external rotation stress test (90° AER); these provocation tests were positive for all patients but are not analyzed here because of the interobserver variation. Preoperative X-ray views of the cervical spine and thoracic inlet were obtained for all patients, as was duplex ultrasonography. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scanning, in addition to electromyography (EMG); it was noted that the results of these investigations did not correlate with operative findings or indeed with patient outcomes, and hence these additional studies were abandoned in our practice from 2009, in favor of the more streamlined, and clinically relevant combination of plain X-rays and duplex ultrasound.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1538574411434164">
<title>Operative Technique</title>
<p>The supraclavicular approach was employed following the induction of general anesthesia. The technique employed was a modified version of that described by Cheng et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574411434164">11</xref></sup> The patient was placed in the Fowler position with the head turned away from the operative side. A curvilinear incision was made 2 cm above the clavicle, extending posterolaterally from the clavicular head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574411434164">Figure 1</xref>
). The scalene fat pad was next raised following the identification of the lateral border of the internal jugular vein, and the omohyoid was then divided. The phrenic nerve was identified, mobilized, and retracted medially, following which the anterior scalene muscle was followed down to its attachment on the first rib from which it was divided. The brachial plexus and subclavian artery and vein were then mobilized to allow their anterior displacement. Where a cervical rib was present, this was excised with a rongeur. Hemostasis was secured and the wound was examined for chylous or lymphatic leakage or evidence of pleural defect. The aforementioned scalene fat pad was then positioned loosely over the brachial plexus and subclavian vessels, the platysma was reapproximated, and the skin closed with subcuticular sutures.</p>

<sec id="section5-1538574411434164">
<title>QuickDASH Scoring System</title>
<p>The <italic>Quick</italic>DASH outcome measure was employed to assess functional outcomes. The <italic>Quick</italic>DASH questionnaire asks patients to rate 19 tasks and symptoms using a 5-point ordinal scale, with higher scores reflecting greater disability. A <italic>Quick</italic>DASH disability and symptom score is then calculated for each patient using the following algorithm: ([sum of responses/n] − 1) × 25, where n equals the number of completed responses. Patients were also asked to say simply whether their operation had led to an improvement, no improvement, or worsening of symptoms, and their responses were correlated with their DASH scores.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1538574411434164">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All data were recorded in Microsoft Excel and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software (version 18.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). The Spearman rank correlation (for continuous variables), the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, and Kruskal-Wallis test (for continuous/nominal variables) were used to determine the relationships between variables. The Wilcoxin signed ranks test was employed to investigate differences between pre- and postoperative DASH scores. Statistical significance was defined as <italic>P</italic> ≤ .05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A series of 21 patients treated for TOS by the same surgeon in our department from 2003 to 2009 is analyzed in this work. Five patients underwent bilateral procedures so a total of 26 procedures were performed. This study cohort included 6 men and 16 women (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574411434164">Table 1</xref>). The median age of the patients was 38 years, ranging from 17 to 64. Twelve (46.1%) of the procedures were performed to address vascular-related symptoms, 5 (19.2%) for neurological symptoms, and 9 (34.6%) for patients with a combination of both. Two thirds of the patients were nonsmokers.</p>

<p>Twenty-one procedures involved scalenectomy alone; 6 patients underwent both scalenectomy and cervical rib excision. The median length of hospital stay per procedure was 1 day (range 0-22); excluding the patient with a hospital stay of 22 days the range for the other 25 procedures was 0 to 8. There were 7 postoperative complications (bleeding, n = 1; neuropraxia, n = 1; respiratory compromise, n = 2, wound dehiscence and reflex sympathetic dystrophy in the same patient; and graft stenosis, n = 1. These latter 2 patients required a second operation.</p>
<p>The median follow-up time postoperatively was 60 months (range 27-90). The DASH scoring was performed at a median of 50 months (range 16-79) postoperatively; DASH scoring was not available for 5 patients (6 procedures). The median DASH scores pre- and postoperatively were 68.5 and 36, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538574411434164">Table 2</xref>
). Moderate negative correlation was noted between patient age and preoperative DASH score (<italic>r</italic> = −.458, <italic>P</italic> = .042) but not with postoperative DASH scores (<italic>r</italic> = −.371, <italic>P</italic> = .178). Preoperative DASH scores were significantly higher (indicating greater disability) in those patients without an antecedent history of trauma (<italic>P</italic> = .641). There were no significant differences in either pre- or postoperative DASH score within the smoking (<italic>P</italic> = .792) versus nonsmoking cohorts (<italic>P</italic> = .097). Similarly, no significant differences in either pre- (<italic>P</italic> = .114) or postoperative (<italic>P</italic> = .992) DASH scores were noted within patient groups delineated by symptom type (vascular, neurological, or both).</p>

<p>Significant improvement was seen in post- versus preoperative DASH scoring for those patients without a history of trauma (<italic>P</italic> = .005), but not for those with a history of trauma (<italic>P</italic> = .400; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538574411434164">Table 2</xref>). It was noted that postoperative DASH scores were significantly less than the preoperative scores for those who did not smoke (<italic>P</italic> = .005), while there was no significant difference for those who smoked (<italic>P</italic> = .109). Postoperative scores were significantly less for patients with vascular symptoms (<italic>P</italic> = .011), while scores did not change significantly for those with either neurologic (<italic>P</italic> = .066) or mixed symptoms (<italic>P</italic> = .345). Although scalenectomy alone was associated with significantly improved DASH scores postoperatively (<italic>P</italic> = .005), no significant differences were seen for patients who had undergone the combined procedure of scalenectomy plus cervical rib excision (<italic>P</italic> = .269).</p>
<p>The range of improvement in DASH scores was significantly greater in patients with neurologic symptoms than in those with either mixed or vascular symptoms (<italic>P</italic> = .023). Of those patients available for DASH scoring, just 1 reported a worsening of symptoms postoperatively; 3 reported no improvement; and the remainder reported improvement. The level of change between pre- and postoperative DASH score did not correlate with subjective response (improvement vs no improvement) for the cohort as a whole (<italic>P</italic> = .515). Similarly, no significant difference was found for either the vascular or mixed symptom groups (<italic>P</italic> = .711; <italic>P</italic> = .277, respectively).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Clinical assessment and management of TOS has proved controversial, not least because of the diverse range of signs and symptoms associated with the condition, and the failure of some authors to differentiate between vTOS and nTOS. A multitude of diagnostic approaches exist, and range from the Adson technique, which was first described in 1927 and concentrated on the role of the scalene anticus muscle in this condition,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574411434164">12</xref></sup> to modern diagnostic strategies including duplex ultrasonography, EMG, and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies, and MRI. Strategies for TOS have ranged from conservative management, comprising physiotherapy, analgesia, and modification of activities of daily living (adls), to a number of surgical approaches. The most popular of these are the transaxillary and supraclavicular procedures, the former concentrating on excision of the first rib and the latter involving scalenectomy and purported to have the advantage of allowing improved visualization of the pertinent anatomy.</p>
<p>Thoracic outlet syndrome has been principally described in young to middle-aged adults, a point reflected in this cohort with just 1 patient aged more than 60 years. Similarly, previous work has noted the predominance of this condition in women, in both the adult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574411434164">13</xref></sup> and pediatric settings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574411434164">14</xref></sup> and this is mirrored in our cohort comprising 76% female patients. The large proportion of patients with vTOS is likely secondary to the tertiary vascular nature of the center under study; TOS is a condition managed by a range of specialties including vascular, orthopedic, and neurosurgery, and hence it is plausible that many of the patients who presented initially with nTOS were referred elsewhere.</p>
<p>The importance of adequate time to follow-up was demonstrated by Altobelli et al in 2005, when they reported that, in patients undergoing surgical management of nTOS, 90% of their primary failures and 66% of their secondary failures occurred in ≤18 months post procedure, where the primary procedure involved transaxillary first rib resection (TFRR) with lower part of scalenectomy plus or minus subsequent resection of the upper part of scalenectomy with supraclavicular approach for patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms as a secondary procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574411434164">13</xref></sup> This current work involves a median follow-up of almost 60 months with a minimum of 27 months and hence should have accounted for any potential primary failure. In our cohort, 2 patients required a second operative procedure—in both cases the original procedure had involved additional intervention in addition to simple supraclavicular scalenectomy and cervical rib excision. The first patient had originally undergone emergency scalenectomy and cervical rib excision, embolectomy and vein patching of her brachial and subclavian arteries, for an acute ischemic limb secondary to a cervical rib which had resulted in a right subclavian aneurysm and embolization. She re-presented 4 years later with right reflex sympathetic dystrophy secondary to recurrent stenosis of her subclavian artery; subclavian angioplasty was hence performed, and while this successfully opened the vessel, the patient remains symptomatic secondary to the dystrophy. The second patient had had a subclavian artery aneurysm repair with vein bypass from his subclavian to brachial artery, in addition to supraclavicular scalenectomy and cervical rib excision. On routine follow-up 3 years later, stenosis of the distal graft was detected by duplex scanning; he underwent angioplasty and has remained asymptomatic since.</p>
<p>There remains a lack of consensus as to the most appropriate surgical approach in the management of TOS; as highlighted in the 2010 Cochrane Review on the subject, in addition to the transaxillary and supraclavicular approaches, numerous other procedures have also been advocated, including scalenotomy, division of fibrous bands, rib resection or a combination of these procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574411434164">10</xref></sup> There has only been 1 randomized controlled trial comparing techniques published, and the comparison made was between TFRR and supraclavicular neuroplasty of the brachial plexus (SNBP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574411434164">15</xref></sup> In relation to the technique adopted in this current work, supraclavicular scalenectomy plus or minus cervical rib excision, Vogelin et al reported outcomes on a series of 22 patients (24 procedures) who underwent this procedure between 1987 and 2000; there was a significant sustained long-term improvement in quality of life for all patients (<italic>P</italic> = .005) at a minimum of 5 years postoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574411434164">16</xref></sup> Similarly, McCarthy et al reported their outcomes for a series of 31 patients (37 limbs) who underwent supraclavicular exploration and decompression for TOS; at a median follow-up of 12 months, no patients had deteriorated and 76% were either asymptomatic or had significantly improved and, as noted by the authors these figures are comparable with the results of previously published data on supraclavicular and TFRR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574411434164">17</xref></sup> In addition, in the largest case series published thus far, Hempel et al reported on 770 supraclavicular first rib resections and scalenectomies; an excellent response was achieved in 59% (455 cases) and a good result was achieved in another 27% (206 cases).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574411434164">18</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Three articles (1 in polish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574411434164">9</xref></sup>) have previously incorporated DASH scoring in the evaluation of functional outcome after surgical decompression for TOS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574411434164">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574411434164"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574411434164">9</xref></sup> All examined outcomes following transaxillary resection. Chang et al performed longtitudinal analysis on 70 patients up to 24 months postoperatively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574411434164">7</xref></sup>; functional outcome was evaluated using both DASH scoring and the Short-Form 12 (SF12) questionnaire. The authors reported that scores correlated well across both methods. Separating their patients into neurogenic and venous TOS, it was noted that, preoperatively, DASH scores were significantly worse in the former compared with the latter (50.2 vs 20.5, <italic>P</italic> ≤ .001), while postoperatively, DASH scores improved on average 0.85 points (<italic>P</italic> ≤ .001) for neurogenic patients and 0.81 points (<italic>P</italic> ≤ .001) for venous patients, per month.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574411434164">7</xref></sup> A second study by Cordobes-Gual et al reported on a cohort of 23 patients (21 transaxillary and 2 supraclavicular), 14 and 9 of whom presented with venous and neurogenic symptoms, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574411434164">8</xref></sup> Although pre- and postoperative DASH scores did not differ for the venous cohort (14.9 vs 14.8), those with neurogenic symptoms demonstrated significant improvement (53.9 vs 17.8; <italic>P</italic> = .01).</p>
<p>This present work, in contrast to those discussed above, is the first to focus on the use of DASH scoring following adoption of the supraclavicular approach and has demonstrated significant improvement in scores which can be achieved for those who present with purely vascular symptoms. Importantly, no differences were noted in pre- versus postoperative scores for those patients who presented with mixed symptoms; this subgroup was small within our study (n = 6) however, and the trend noted (66.0 vs 52.0) suggests that expansion of our numbers would result in statistically significant values favoring supraclavicular decompression. Similarly, although our results do not show a statistically significant improvement in DASH for those with neurogenic symptoms, again it seems clear that this is because of the small size of the cohort (n = 4), and the impressive change seen in median score pre- versus postoperatively (124.5 vs 36.0, respectively) correlates well with that reported by Cordobes-Gual et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574411434164">8</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>To our knowledge this is the first case series to examine the relationship or otherwise between smoking and outcome following surgical decompression of TOS. Our findings demonstrate that, compared to smokers, nonsmokers report much improved DASH scores postoperatively. Although requiring further assessment, smoking status may thus hold potential as a clinically relevant predictor of functional outcome and will perhaps aid in identifying those patients who will do poorly as a result of operative intervention.</p>
<p>Antecedent trauma was reported in 9 (34.6%) of the procedures performed within this series. This correlates well with that reported elsewhere,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574411434164">7</xref></sup> with published work noting trauma in 15% to 80%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574411434164">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538574411434164">20</xref></sup> although McCarthy et al did not find this in the history of any of their cohort.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574411434164">17</xref></sup> We have found that those patients whose etiology included traumatic injury did not demonstrate improved DASH scores postoperatively; in contrast, significant improvement was noted in those who had not reported this as an etiological factor.</p>
<p>Despite the aforementioned significant improvements between pre- and postoperative DASH score for those with vascular symptoms, and indeed the trends seen for those with neurologic or mixed symptoms, we failed to find a significant association between the degree to which these scores improved postoperatively and patient’s own subjective assessment of whether or not they had improved. This finding is possibly explained by the small size of our cohort which makes statistical analysis difficult. This latter point highlights the most important limitation of this study; while the numbers are appropriate for the purposes of a case series and indeed reflect, and, in many instances, exceed that generally reported in the TOS-associated literature, they are nevertheless inadequate to provide robust statistical analysis.</p>
<p>This important limitation notwithstanding, the present study has reconfirmed the value of the supraclavicular approach in the management of TOS, with the vast majority of patients reporting subjective improvement postoperatively. The DASH scoring system, previously demonstrated to correlate with the SF12 in relation to outcomes following TOS, has been demonstrated to return much improved scores after decompression; while these scores did not correlate with the patient’s subjective assessment of improvement, we postulate that this was due to the small cohort studied. Importantly, this work identifies both antecedent trauma and smoking as factors inversely associated with improved DASH scores following operative decompression. It is clear that an adequately powered, prospective, multicenter trial is required in order to provide conclusive answers to many of the issues surrounding the management of TOS, and as previously highlighted, there is a need for a international registry and the development of management guidelines for this condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538574411434164">21</xref></sup>; in the interim however, we suggest that both smoking status and antecedent trauma should be incorporated into the decision-making process when considering operative decompression.</p>
