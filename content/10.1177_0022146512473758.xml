<abstract>
<p>Numerous studies report gene-environment interactions, suggesting that specific alleles have different effects on social outcomes depending on environment. In all these studies, however, environmental conditions are potentially endogenous to unmeasured genetic characteristics. That is, it could be that the observed interaction effects actually reflect underlying genetic tendencies that lead individuals into certain environments. What is critical to move this literature forward is random environmental variation that we know is not correlated with innate characteristics of subjects. We exploit a natural experiment that randomizes a particular stressor—birth weight discordance within twin pairs—to address this challenge and ask: Do random differences in early environment (prenatal nutrition) moderate genetic effects on depression, delinquency, or GPA? Using Add Health data, the only consistently significant allele–birth weight interaction we reveal works in the opposite direction of Caspi et al.’s classic finding regarding the interaction of maltreatment with genetic variation in the serotonin transporter promoter. Less robust interactions found for <italic>DRD2</italic> and MAOA are consistent with this pattern that reverses prior findings. These results do not necessarily overturn existing research but support our methodological point that gene-environment research must address endogeneity.</p>

<p>Studying genetic-environmental (GE) interactions has long been a goal of social scientists fond of touting the dependence of genetic expression on social structure. The basic GE argument is that genetic effects do not exist in a social vacuum. A specific allele does not have the same effect on individual outcomes; environmental differences determine how the gene manifests. However, how do we get from the adage that “a gene for aggression lands you in prison if you’re from the ghetto, but in the boardroom if you’re to the manor born” to a serious empirical research agenda on the study of GE interactions?</p>
<p>The basic logic for specifying GE interactions until now has been the following: A certain proportion of a population sample is found to have a variant of a particular allele (an alternative form of a gene). If this allele is shown to be randomly distributed across demographic subgroups (or within a particular subgroup such as an ethnic group), and, likewise, it is found to be associated with a specific social outcome or tendency (such as addictiveness, shyness, or schizophrenia) within that same population (or subgroup), then researchers may try to find specific environmental conditions that seem to magnify or mitigate its effect, such as family structure, parents’ behavior, or simply socioeconomic status.</p>
<p>However, there is a critical flaw with existing GE research. In all cases (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022146512473758">Caspi at el. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022146512473758">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022146512473758">Guo, Roettger, and Cai 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022146512473758">Pescosolido et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022146512473758">Shanahan et al. 2008</xref>), the environmental conditions studied (such as maltreatment or family dinners) are potentially related to the unmeasured genetic characteristics of the subjects and their families. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022146512473758">Shanahan et al. (2008)</xref> found that the “risky” <italic>DRD2</italic> genotype reduces the likelihood of postsecondary school attendance for boys and that this risk is moderated by social capital. Yet they also found that boys with the risky <italic>DRD2</italic> genotype are less likely to have high social capital environments. It could be that the alleles are interacting not with differential social environments but rather with other, nonrandomly distributed genes (even if the principal gene in question is indeed randomly distributed).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022146512473758">1</xref></sup> To provide other examples of this challenge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022146512473758">Guo, Roettger, et al. (2008)</xref> indicated that regular family meals eliminate the delinquent tendencies associated with the “risky” <italic>DRD2</italic> genotype. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022146512473758">Pescosolido et al. (2008)</xref> found that family support reduces the genetically influenced risk for alcohol dependence. Although they discussed threats to internal validity and claimed only to describe associations, the lurking question of unmeasured environmental or genetic differences that may covary with measured environment remains. The environmental moderators in both cases include family behaviors, which could easily reflect genetic rather than exogenous environmental differences. That is, family support and closeness could be related to the unmeasured genes of the respondent and his or her parents, who to a large extent determine the family environment. For example, other parental genes encouraging social disorganization (and thus fewer planned meals as a family) may be passed on to the adolescent and interact with the “risky” <italic>DRD2</italic> allele to produce the observed deleterious outcomes, with the family dinners acting as a proxy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, recent evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022146512473758">Fowler, Settle, and Christakis 2011</xref>) suggests that individuals self-select into social environments on the basis of genotype. Specifically, certain genotypes are correlated within friendship networks, and social environment is therefore endogenous to genotype. This evidence casts serious doubt on existing claims of GE interactions in the social sciences, which do not account for endogeneity in the GE association. This is not to say that the interaction effect is not “real”; it suggests that it is merely associational, and we should be cautious about drawing causal conclusions about the particular role of family eating habits.</p>
<p>An alternative but neglected perspective—to the GE emphasis on environment moderating genetic effects—is the potential moderating effect of genotype. For example, although child nutrition and birth-weight effects have been well established, their effects could differ by genotype. Such heterogeneous effects could explain, for example, why low birth weight is not equally detrimental for all children. There is variation in the sequelae of low birth weight by a variety of factors, including poverty, race, and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022146512473758">Conley, Strully, and Bennett 2003</xref>), which could reflect underlying GE interaction. In this vein, the present study makes two contributions: (1) methodologically, it advances GE research with an empirical example of a new technique that accounts for endogeneity of the GE association, and (2) substantively, it asks whether the effects of birth weight depend on genotype.</p>
<sec id="section1-0022146512473758">
<title>Background</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022146512473758">Caspi et al. (2002)</xref> claimed to have uncovered a GE interaction among 1,037 white male New Zealand children between the <italic>MAOA</italic> gene (monoamine oxidase A) and childhood maltreatment. Caspi et al. interacted the short <italic>MAOA</italic> alleles with the degree of maltreatment the respondents experienced as children to predict an index of antisocial behavior. In a multiple regression context, the interaction effect between the two measures was statistically significant. They argued that this is a true GE interaction effect, because the <italic>MAOA</italic> genotypes were not significantly differently distributed across maltreatment levels, suggesting that this genotype did not itself influence exposure to maltreatment. In a follow-up study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022146512473758">Caspi et al. 2003</xref>) using the same cohort, they found similar evidence of an interaction between stressful life events (between 21 and 26 years of age) and alleles of the serotonin transporter gene (<italic>5-HTT</italic>) linked promoter region (<italic>5-HTTLPR</italic>) in the likelihood of clinical depression at age 26.</p>
<p>However, similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022146512473758">Guo, Roettger, et al. (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022146512473758">Pescosolido et al. (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022146512473758">Caspi et al. (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022146512473758">2003)</xref> could actually have uncovered gene-gene interactions, because they did not have an exogenous source of environmental variation. For example, it may be the case that depression was induced by a gene-gene interaction, because an underlying unmeasured gene could cause the phenotype of “negative life events” to emerge in one’s early 20s: Imagine a gene that promotes excessive thrill seeking and risk taking, which in turn manifests as negative events during one’s early adulthood. As for the <italic>MAOA</italic> interaction, we face the same issue: Although measured maltreatment did not vary by <italic>MAOA</italic> status, it could have varied by other genes (present in the parents and potentially passed on to the children). Thus, it would not be the maltreatment that interacted with <italic>MAOA</italic> status but rather the underlying, unmeasured genotype, which, in combination with given <italic>MAOA</italic> alleles, caused both parents and offspring to act antisocially.</p>
<p>Thus, existing studies have not addressed the potential endogeneity of environmental context; in all cases, environmental conditions are potentially related to the unmeasured genetic characteristics of the subjects and their families. Conversely, gene markers may be acting as proxies for social conditions because of population stratification. We argue that GE research must address environmental and genetic endogeneity to be methodologically rigorous. Below, we offer more specific motivations for methodological improvements and an analytical approach that addresses both nonrandom genes and environment.</p>
<p>Beyond methodology, existing work has rarely discussed the alternative interpretation of GE interactions. Namely, the gene could be examined as the moderator rather than social environment. Birth weight is a measure of environment even before birth and is generally conceived as critical for infants, setting their chances for many later outcomes. However, birth weight may not be equally important for all individuals, and effects may vary significantly by genotype.</p>
<sec id="section2-0022146512473758">
<title>Endogeneity Concerns</title>
<p>It is difficult to quantify the potential threat of inherited factors to GE findings. The online supplemental material (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jhsb.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://jhsb.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>) includes sensitivity analyses that attempt to quantify unobserved variable bias using propensity score matching and Rosenbaum bounds estimation.] However, reported GE findings are likely misestimated. Given that the phenotypes in question are complex behavioral traits (i.e. “quantitative traits”), they are almost certain to be influenced by a wide range of genes and their interactions. In fact, supporting the notional importance of gene-gene interactions, recent genetics research has shown that among the genes studied in humans (or other [model] organisms such as the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, or the nematode worm, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>), the vast majority of genes are linked in a single network component when measured by either protein-protein interactions, regulatory relationships, or phenotypic covariation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022146512473758">Jeong et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022146512473758">Stelzl et al. 2005</xref>). This suggests that one cannot conceptualize the perturbation of one gene as unrelated to the impact of other genes. Unless we measure all genes, we cannot know for sure. (And even if we did, we would not have the statistical power to test for all possible gene-gene interactions, even in a genetic census of all humans on the planet.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022146512473758">2</xref></sup>) Thus, we must leave, for now, gene-gene interactions as a black box. The solution to this conundrum, we argue, is to find a source of environment that is orthogonal to genes and thus cannot be confounded by unmeasured gene-gene interactions.</p>
<p>Another parallel concern is population stratification, which occurs when genetic variants are not randomly distributed within a study population, and other environmental or genetic differences are correlated with this nonrandom distribution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022146512473758">Hamer and Sirota (2000)</xref> illustrated population stratification with a fictitious “chopsticks gene”: A scientist sets off in search of a gene for chopstick use and finds a strong association between chopstick use and a specific polymorphism. However, this genotype happens to be more common among Asians, who use chopsticks more often for unrelated cultural reasons, and when the analysis is redone within subgroups, the effect disappears. Thus, nonrandom distribution of polymorphisms could be correlated with environmental or cultural differences to yield spurious genetic “effects.” So although we have thus far emphasized the possibility that environment may be acting as a proxy for unmeasured genetic effects (and their interaction with measured alleles), population stratification indicates that measured genes may be acting as proxies for social environments. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022146512473758">Thomas and Witte (2002</xref>:505) pointed out that <italic>DRD2</italic> is not equally distributed by ethnicity. Therefore, interactions between <italic>DRD2</italic> and environment (or the main effect of <italic>DRD2</italic> for that matter) may actually be reflecting the social dynamics of ethnicity and not the causal effect of the <italic>DRD2</italic> allele. Others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022146512473758">Abdolmaleky et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022146512473758">Fan and Sklar 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022146512473758">Gelernter and Kranzler 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022146512473758">Sabol, Hu, and Hamer 1998</xref>) have shown significantly different ethnic distributions for <italic>5-HTT, DRD2</italic>, and <italic>MAOA</italic>. Of course, ethnicity can be controlled for, or we can stratify our sample by ethnic origin, thereby analyzing the effect of <italic>DRD2</italic> only within these subpopulations. But we can never be sure whether a given allele is orthogonal to all social environments. In other words, a particular gene variant may be overrepresented in the South, or among the highly devout, or among urban residents. The list of confounders is potentially endless.</p>
<p>We might anticipate nonrandom distribution of alleles by chance—because of sampling, migration patterns, and so on—or because those genetic loci have important effects on how we live (e.g., assortative mating on smoking or drinking behavior). Only through within-family comparisons can we be sure to address these worries about population stratification.</p>
<p>GE research is not alone in its failure to account for unmeasured genetic differences. Much of the apparent effect of birth weight may reflect inherited differences. Although some research has estimated the effect of birth weight using identical twins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022146512473758">Behrman and Rosenzweig 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022146512473758">Conley et al. 2003</xref>), most studies have relied on sibling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022146512473758">Conley and Bennett 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022146512473758">2001</xref>) or even between-family comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022146512473758">Hack et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022146512473758">Rich-Edwards 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022146512473758">Sorensen et al. 1997</xref>), which cannot rule out genetic explanations for differences in outcomes; such an approach may create spurious effects of low birth weight if the same genes driving birth weight also drive educational or developmental outcomes.</p>
<p>Low birth weight is consistently found to have developmental consequences and has been associated with a wide variety of outcomes in later life, including cognitive ability, behavioral problems, and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022146512473758">Cooper et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022146512473758">Hayes and Sharif 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022146512473758">Lowe et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022146512473758">Schlotz and Phillips 2009</xref>). In this way, birth weight (as a proxy for fetal nutrition) is a “stressor,” in the same vein as factors studied in existing GE research (e.g., childhood maltreatment, lack of social support). All of these stressors affect the context in which children grow, which research posits to interact with genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022146512473758">Caspi et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022146512473758">Guo, Roettger, et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022146512473758">Shanahan et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Shifting to an earlier period in child development, we view birth weight as an important indicator of developmental context. Increased prenatal nutrition can act as a nurturing environment, like family support, and dampen genetic risk. For example, if two children have identical genetic risk for hyperactivity, such as two copies of the “risky” <italic>DRD2</italic> A1 allele, we might expect birth weight to moderate this risk; higher birth weight could allow one to develop earlier, self-regulate and sit still at a younger age, and gain more from school than the other. The low-birth-weight child, who develops self-regulation more slowly, may receive negative feedback from school teachers, dislike school, and set off on a less adaptive trajectory. Similarly, we might expect to see an interaction between birth weight and the long <italic>5-HTT</italic> allele, which puts individuals at risk for more depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022146512473758">Caspi et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022146512473758">2010</xref>). For instance, low-birth-weight individuals may be less physically active in later life and miss out on the depression-fighting endorphins of regular exercise. In other words, fetal nutrition could amplify genetic differences in later life. Although many intervening factors could be related to later childhood contexts, including maltreatment and family closeness, an advantage to studying birth weight is that it occurs very early in life, at the proverbial “starting gate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022146512473758">Conley et al. 2003</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0022146512473758" sec-type="methods">
<title>Data and Methods</title>
<p>We deploy a novel approach: We use both monozygotic (MZ), or identical, and dizygotic (DZ), or fraternal, twin differences in birth weight to predict educational, mental health, and behavioral outcomes (all found in previous GE research) using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). MZ twins hold constant genetic differences that may influence both birth weight and the outcome of interest. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022146512473758">Behrman and Rosenzweig (2004)</xref> established that birth weight within identical twin pairs is unrelated to other observed measures in their data and illustrated a substantial distribution of birth-weight differences between identical twins. We then ask whether the treatment effect of low birth weight varies across twin pairs that are divergent on measured alleles.</p>
<p>Although birth-weight differences between identical twins are not socially determined as sociologists might traditionally conceive, they are sociologically relevant for at least two reasons. First, although random in origin because of fetal position, birth-weight differences between identical twins are a classic example of cumulative advantage. A slight difference in implantation site can translate to substantial differences in fetal nutrition, which in turn affects growth and ultimately social outcomes from education to income. The importance of such within-family factors to social stratification has garnered recent attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022146512473758">Conley 2004</xref>). Second, even though this particular etiology of birth-weight variation (in utero competition mediated by fetal position) is not due to larger social forces, the mechanism, nutritional deprivation, is the same as those sociologically causal forces that affect fetal nutrition from outside the womb (i.e., the mother’s food intake and other health conditions). At least since the Dutch famine during World War II, evidence has shown that maternal nutrition is affected by social conflict, gender discrimination, and the global distribution of food resources (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022146512473758">Roseboom et al. 2001</xref>). Caloric deprivation, in turn, affects the fetus, with lasting impacts. One estimate asserts that in the developing world, birth weight (i.e., fetal nutrition) influences gross domestic product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022146512473758">Behrman and Rosenzweig 2004</xref>). Of course, in the population at large, there are multiple causes of low birth weight. However, in the twin difference context, we hold constant etiologies such as drug, cigarette, or alcohol use, maternal preeclampsia, or prematurity. These do not figure into our analyses, because they affect both twins. Birth weight has significant sociological antecedents and sequelae; the methodological approach here should be externally valid enough to illuminate those social facts while preserving a quasi-experimental approach (i.e., internal validity). An analogy might be an experiment that adjusts class size “artificially” to understand the effects of teacher-student ratios across urban school districts.</p>
<p>However, because the strategy of using MZ twins leaves open the possibility of population stratification, we also present estimates using intrasibship comparisons among DZ twins. Each DZ twin has an equal chance of inheriting one of two alleles from each parent. In this way, with the exception of other genes that may be linked to the gene in question through linkage disequilibrium (whereby alleles at certain loci “tag along” with others because of physical proximity on a chromosome), all other genes are orthogonal to the measured genetic difference. However, in the DZ models, we cannot say that birth-weight differences are exogenous to unmeasured genetic characteristics that vary between the twins. Thus, we present findings that are robust to both these estimation strategies. (We also show, in auxiliary analyses, that birth weight seems unaffected by these genes.)</p>
<p>To preview our results, although the majority of our findings are null, we find evidence of one GE interaction effect that works in the opposite direction predicted by general understandings in the literature. Birth weight, therefore, does not matter equally by genotype. The fact that we are able to detect a highly robust GE interaction using our restrictive approach belies concerns about our models being underpowered and justifies the use of twins despite smaller sample sizes.</p>
<p>Birth weight is an important difference in childhood context that occurs at the beginning of life. Although it is not the same as measures used in previous GE research, it provides an analytically appealing “stressor” for two reasons. First, it precedes and could even influence measures used in previous GE studies. Second, it is orthogonal to genes for identical twins; that is, genes are shared completely, so they cannot affect nutritional advantage relative to one’s identical twin in the womb. Even among DZ twins, the uterus is shared, and birth-weight differences partly reflect proximity to the placenta, which occurs by chance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022146512473758">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>We admittedly sacrifice external validity for internal validity. For example, twins are generally lighter at birth than singletons, which means that we cannot generalize to all points in the distribution of birth weight. Skeptics may fail to see how birth weight, twins, or differences in twin birth weight are relevant to previous GE research or socially interesting variation in general. However, this sacrifice is justified, we believe, because of the causal traction gained. The possibility that previous GE findings are spurious—whether because of gene-gene interactions or genes acting as proxies for environmental differences due to population stratification—warrants the narrow focus of this study. Birth weight varies randomly within MZ twins, and alleles are randomly assigned within DZ twins, which make twin pairs an ideal sample to further the investigation of GE interactions. Although we do not directly test the environmental measures of the previous studies, our measure of stress, fetal nutrition, complements these and provides an example for future researchers in this area to follow when looking for exogenous environmental shocks.</p>
<p>Likewise, we also sacrifice some power by identifying off within-twin pair differences. Thus, effects would have to be (almost) twice as large as models that use all individuals with genetic data in Add Health (these approaches also suffer from inflation of standard errors due to the nonindependence of observations). So, although post hoc power tests are discouraged in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022146512473758">Hoenig and Heisey 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022146512473758">Levine and Ensom 2001</xref>), the fact that previous studies reported powerful impacts of these genes (and interaction effects) means that we should still be able to detect them with our reduced power, even if previous estimates are partially spurious. Finally, we report results with α values &lt; .10 (or .05 for a one-tailed test, which is reasonable given prior findings about the valence of effects). That said, acting as if we were designing an experiment to detect an effect size that is β ≥ .15, at α &lt; .05, with three predictors (other than the fixed effects), our minimum required sample size for a study with .80 power would be 76. All models meet this minimum. Meanwhile, our targeted, minimally detectable effect size of .15 is well within early reports for population studies of these genes on these phenotypes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022146512473758">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>MZ twin pair fixed effects exploit random variation in birth weight to identify a GE interaction. Out of concern for population stratification, we also show results for DZ twins. Fixed effects model the differences in outcomes within twin pairs (i.e., between twins):</p>

<p>where <italic>Y<sub>ij</sub></italic> is the outcome for a given twin <italic>i</italic> in pair <italic>j, b</italic> is the effect of birth weight within twin pair <italic>j</italic> that has the so-called normal allele, <italic>c</italic> is the main effect of differences in the risky gene, <italic>b</italic> + <italic>d</italic> is the effect of birth weight (within twin pairs) for those with the risky allele, <italic>e</italic> represents differences due to sex (for DZ twin pairs only), and ϵ<sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> is the sibling-specific (i.e., idiosyncratic) error, assumed to be unrelated to genes, birth weight, and control factors. MZ twins share the same genes and sex, so <italic>c</italic> and <italic>e</italic> drop out. Individuals are compared with their twins, who are the same age, obviating the issue of age differences.</p>
<p>Before presenting interaction effects, we show descriptive statistics and estimated main effects of birth weight and genotype within twin pairs. Assuming random variation, main effects of birth weight can be identified within MZ and DZ twin pairs. The main effect of a risky genotype can be identified within DZ twin pairs. However, fixed-effect models cannot identify the main effect of a genotype within identical twin pairs, because there is no genetic variation. Although we present fixed-effect models in all other cases, random-effect models estimate main effects of the alleles in question among MZ twins. Random effects assume that genotype is randomly assigned to MZ twin pairs. Caution is therefore warranted in interpreting these coefficients, because they could reflect a spurious relationship due to population stratification.</p>

<title>Data and Measures</title>
<p>Add Health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022146512473758">Harris 2009</xref>) provides birth weight and sequenced genotype data for three genes putatively related to behavioral and health outcomes conditional on environment (<italic>5-HTT, DRD2</italic>, and <italic>MAOA</italic>). These genes are involved in neurotransmitter (e.g., dopamine and serotonin) transport, receiving, and recycling, vital for cognition and behavior. Previous research, including animal-based genetic manipulation, has identified these three loci as influential on a variety of outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022146512473758">Cases et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022146512473758">Shih and Thompson 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>As in previous GE research, we focus on outcomes in young adulthood. Wave 3 of Add Health was collected in 2001 and 2002, when respondents were 18 to 26 years of age. Siblings of individuals identified as twins in the stratified sample were added, yielding 64 percent of sibling pairs from the probability sample and 36 percent from convenience sampling. Buccal swabs were collected in wave 3 from 2,612 of the 3,139 eligible siblings from wave 1 (a compliance rate of 83 % <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022146512473758">Harris et al. 2006</xref>) for deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing at the Institute for Behavioral Genetics. Monozygosity was genetically confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022146512473758">Harris et al. 2006</xref>). Our sample includes over 200 twin pairs not missing birth weight, genetic data, or outcome data for either twin (the sample size for each model depends on the number of pairs with complete outcome data).</p>
<p>Research links polymorphisms in the human genes <italic>DRD2, 5-HTT</italic>, and <italic>MAOA</italic> with behavior and health outcomes. At the D2 dopamine receptor gene locus (<italic>DRD2</italic>), the A1 allele is related to fewer receptor binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022146512473758">Pohjalainen et al. 1998</xref>). Compared with the A2 allele, possessing the A1 allele has been associated with anxiety, depression, novelty seeking, impulsiveness, lack of inhibition, and substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022146512473758">Blum et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022146512473758">Lawford et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022146512473758">Noble et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022146512473758">Wiers, Sergeant, and Gunning 1994</xref>). Consistent with previous research, individuals possessing an A1 allele are considered to have the risky genotype.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022146512473758">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previous research suggests that individuals with a short allele in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene locus (<italic>5-HTT</italic>) have stronger depressive reactions to stressful life experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022146512473758">Caspi et al. 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022146512473758">6</xref></sup> Both men and women carry two copies of <italic>DRD2</italic> and <italic>5-HTT</italic>. For both of these genes, those with no copies of the risky allele are specified in models below, but results are similar with alternative specifications.</p>
<p>The <italic>MAOA</italic> gene codes for monoamine oxidase A, which chaperones and breaks down neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin, dopamine) and for which variation has been linked to disposition toward aggression in both animals and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022146512473758">Brunner et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022146512473758">Guo, Ou, et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022146512473758">Cases et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022146512473758">Rowe 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022146512473758">Shih and Thompson 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022146512473758">Sabol et al.

Given the debate about how best to specify <italic>MAO</italic>A genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022146512473758">Deckert et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022146512473758">Sabol et al. 1998</xref>), we specify it in a variety of ways: any 3.5 or 4R versus others; any 3.5, 4, or 5R versus others; and 4R versus others. Results are similar using different specifications, and we present results using the distinction recommended by Sabol et al.: 3.5 or 4R alleles compared with 2, 3, or 5R. Men carry one copy of the <italic>MAOA</italic> gene because it is on the X chromosome. Women with two copies and men with one copy of a 3.5 or 4 repeat are included in the “nonrisky” category below.</p>
<p>Birth weight is reported by parents, measured in ounces, and logged. Results using raw birth weight in ounces and an indicator for low birth weight are also examined (low birth weight includes those weighing 1,500 to 2,500 g; no one in this sample was &lt;1,500 g); results are similar and discussed below but not shown. The average birth-weight difference between twins is nontrivial at 8 oz. Although this measure is retrospective, when children are teens, parents typically remember birth weight well (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022146512473758">Walton et al. 2000</xref> reported an 85 percent accurate recall rate when children are teenagers). Nevertheless, errors are possible, and birth weight is missing for 20 percent of the individual sample (30 percent of pairs). We address the possibility that birth weight is not missing at random in multiple ways (comparing descriptive statistics for those with and without missing data, the missing indicator method, and assigning the midpoint of 7 oz for those with valid information for pounds at birth and missing only ounces). Results are similar.</p>
<p>Depression is measured using nine items of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, which normally includes more items that were omitted from wave 3. Therefore, we also include the other six questions about the frequency of depressive symptoms in wave 3. The sum of responses for all items (listed in the online supplemental material) indicates the frequency of depressive symptoms. Results are also investigated using an indicator for “any symptoms” and logged scores (after adding one to avoid excluding those with no symptoms). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022146512473758">Fletcher and Lehrer (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022146512473758">Roberts, Lewinsohn, and Seeley (1991)</xref>, age- and gender-specific threshold measures of depression are also investigated. Results are largely the same in these specifications and are not presented. The Caspi study measured depression using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule, which may capture a different level of depression and make results less comparable.</p>
<p>Delinquency is measured using 12 questions from the Add Health wave 3 survey that ask about deviant behavior in the past 12 months. For example, questions include how often a respondent used someone else’s credit or bank card without their permission, deliberately wrote a bad check, stole something, or used a weapon (see the online supplemental material for a full list). Sensitivity analyses use an indicator for the presence of any delinquent behaviors and logged scores (after adding 1); results are similar to a linear specification. We show results from raw delinquency and depression measures in the main analysis because results are easier to interpret; we show logged measures in the online supplemental material.</p>
<p>Educational achievement is measured using cumulative high school grade point average (GPA) gathered from high school transcripts. An indicator of college attendance (as well as a continuous measure for highest grade completed) is also tested, for comparability with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022146512473758">Shanahan et al. (2008)</xref>. In general, results do not differ from those for GPA, and thus discussion concentrates on analysis of the continuous measure of achievement (i.e., GPA). An online supplemental table presents results for college attendance.</p>

<p>One concern is potentially selective data on birth weight. Approximately 20 percent of the sample is missing parent-reported birth weight. An additional 10 percent is missing birth-weight data for their twin, excluding about a third of all identical twins. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022146512473758">Table 1</xref> compares twins with and without complete birth-weight data. Both identical and fraternal twins missing birth-weight information for their twin sibling were born significantly lighter on average than others. This suggests that excluded twins may have weighed less at birth than those included in the study.</p>
<p>Low-weight babies experienced the strongest environmental insult, and their outcomes may be most sensitive to genotype. Underrepresentation of low-weight babies may therefore cause attenuation bias in GE interaction estimates. An alternative story reduces concern. Parents may better remember the birth weight of the lighter (more at risk) twin because there may be more drama associated with that twin’s perinatal period compared with the heavier, healthier twin. In this scenario, those with missing birth-weight data would be nearer the twin average.</p>
<p>A related concern is the potential relationship between missing birth-weight data and outcomes or alleles of interest. MZ twins with complete birth-weight information have significantly higher delinquency rates than those without, amounting to about half an additional delinquent act such as stealing or damaging property. This difference remains significant with binary (indicating any symptoms) and logged measures of delinquency. Twins with and without birth-weight data show no differences in the specific alleles investigated here. These birth-weight and delinquency differences, though slight, suggest that missing birth-weight data could be nonrandom. Nevertheless, sensitivity analyses, using both the missing indicator method and assigning the midpoint for those missing only ounces, yield similar results.</p>
<p>A further concern is that the genes in question could influence birth-weight differences within twin pairs. If the risky <italic>MAOA</italic> gene, for example, is associated with smaller birth-weight differences between DZ twins, the reduced birth-weight variation could yield insignificant interactions. However, regressions checking for such an association suggest it is not a concern (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022146512473758">Table 2</xref>). Among MZ twin pairs, no genes are associated with twin-pair birth-weight difference or average. Looking at <italic>5-HTT</italic> alone does not change the results. Among DZ twins, pairs in which one twin has a risky <italic>DRD2</italic> allele have slightly more similar birth weights. This effect holds when including twin pairs missing birth weight for one twin. However, the <italic>DRD2</italic> effect is not found when specifying those with two risky <italic>DRD2</italic> alleles and is only marginal when predicting difference in raw ounces at birth. At the individual level, these genes are all unrelated to birth weight. Including those with missing birth weight does not change the results.</p>

<p>Although prior research predicts an effect of <italic>MAOA</italic> and <italic>DRD2</italic> on delinquency and school continuation, our analyses of twins find insignificant main effects of variation at these genetic loci (controlling for gender and birth weight). Although rare significant relationships emerge, the overarching pattern is that main genetic effects are insignificant regardless of the specifications tested. Results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022146512473758">Table 3</xref> are similar when including twins missing birth weight, specifying the genes differently, or using alternative measures of birth weight or the outcome variable. The absence of main genetic effects suggests that previous results may be biased by population stratification.</p>
<p>Similarly, main effects of birth weight are insignificant in all of the identical and fraternal twin models shown (when an interaction with genotype is not included). This absence of birth-weight effects contradicts the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022146512473758">Conley and Bennett (2000)</xref>, who used singleton comparisons, which fail to address underlying genetic differences or experiences in utero. These results also contradict the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022146512473758">Behrman and Rosenzweig (2004)</xref>, who used twin pairs. The difference could reflect sample differences (e.g., younger cohorts in this study) or controls for genotype included here.</p>
<p>Although previous research suggests that those with risky alleles should benefit most from a ositive environment, this analysis reveals that additional fetal nourishment actually increases depression among those homozygous for the risky allele. Weighing an additional pound (above the MZ mean of 90 oz) increases depression symptoms by over 4 points (about .8 standard deviations) for those with two copies of the short allele but has no effect for others. (With a mean difference of .5 lb at birth, few twins have a 1-lb difference, but we present results with this large difference for ease of interpretation.) Results for depression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022146512473758">Table 4</xref>) reveal that birth-weight effects depend on <italic>5-HTT</italic> genotype when including all or identical twins but not fraternal twins alone. Model 3, limited to identical twins, suggests that an additional pound, compared with one’s twin, reduces depressive symptoms by 2 points for those with two long alleles (nearly .5 standard deviations). That same pound increases depressive symptoms by 2.8 points for those with one or two short alleles (about .5 standard deviations). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022146512473758">Figure 1</xref> illustrates this GE interaction, which remains significant with a Bonferroni correction for 10 hypotheses (more than the 3 outcomes by 3 genes or 9 hypotheses investigated).</p>

<p>Regressions limited to individuals with two long alleles find no effect, while birth weight increases depression among those with any short allele. Results (not shown) are null using an indicator for any depressive symptoms but are similar (though less precise) using a logged measure of depression or including twins with missing birth weight (see Table S4 in the online supplemental material).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, birth-weight effects on depression do not depend on <italic>DRD2</italic> genotype. An interaction between the long <italic>MAOA</italic> allele and birth weight is found among all twins (Model 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022146512473758">Table 4</xref>). But this disappears among fraternal twins and is only marginal among identical twins. Supporting the counterintuitive GE interaction with <italic>5-HTT</italic>, the interaction with <italic>MAOA</italic> is also different than prior literature would predict. That is, birth weight seems to reduce depression among those with the “good” allele.</p>
<p>Within identical twin pairs, birth weight does not moderate effects of <italic>MAOA</italic> genotype on delinquency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022146512473758">Table 5</xref>). There is a significant interaction with <italic>MAOA</italic> among all twins. However, similar to our results for depression, the environmental advantage of fetal nutrition accrues to those with the “good” rather than the “risky” genotype. In other words, contrary to evidence that a short <italic>MAOA</italic> genotype moderates environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022146512473758">Caspi et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022146512473758">Kim-Cohen et al. 2006</xref>), additional prenatal stress for a twin with the risky <italic>MAOA</italic> genotype actually decreases delinquency propensities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022146512473758">7</xref></sup> Effects disappear within identical twins, which suggests that omitted differences could drive results from previous research. Thus, although GE research would predict early childhood environment (fetal nutrition) to dampen effects of risky <italic>MAOA</italic> genotypes even among twins, we do not find consistent evidence of this. Rather, in some models, environmental advantage amplifies the benefits of holding a “good” <italic>MAOA</italic> allele. Although others have found insignificant <italic>MAOA</italic> interaction effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022146512473758">Haberstick et al. 2005</xref>), our null finding is limited to identical twins, which suggests that previous GE interactions could reflect population stratification.</p>

<p>Finally, results from twin comparisons shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0022146512473758">Table 6</xref> suggest that previous evidence of a <italic>DRD2</italic>–social capital interaction may have been biased by omitted differences. Among all twins, results suggest that those with no copies of the risky A1 allele have significantly lower high school GPAs and experience a boost from fetal nutrition (i.e., are more sensitive to environment). This interaction is marginally significant among fraternal twins and disappears within identical twins (Model 3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022146512473758">8</xref></sup> Thus, genetic differences between fraternal twins appear to account for apparent environmental interaction effects with <italic>DRD2</italic>.</p>

<p>To summarize, neither birth weight nor the alleles we measure appear to have any direct, main effects on the outcomes we study. However, birth weight interacts in both DZ and MZ twin models such that decreased birth weight (previously considered a risk factor) results in lower risk for depression, but only for those who have the “risky” serotonin transporter promoter region allele. Furthermore, results suggest that birth-weight effects depend on genotype.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Research claiming GE interaction fails to address a potential relationship between genes and the environmental context in question. We motivate the need to address this shortcoming and offer a method for assessing GE interaction effects: by deploying both MZ and DZ comparisons, which each complement the other’s inferential weakness. Our results do not necessarily overturn previous findings, because results could differ by age, the treatment effect of twin birth-weight differences is unclear, and external validity is limited. Nevertheless, our analysis should encourage future GE research to address endogeneity.</p>
<p>Reviewing our findings in light of previous studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022146512473758">Caspi et al. (2003)</xref> presented evidence that sensitivity to environmental insults increases with each short <italic>5-HTT</italic> allele (i.e., those with one short and one long allele fall between those with two copies of either). We also find a linear interaction between the number of long alleles and sensitivity to environment; however, our finding works in the opposite direction. Compared with those with two copies of the long (“good”) allele, heterozygotes show significantly higher depression with increased birth weight: an additional 3.7 points with each pound. Those with two copies of the short allele show the strongest interaction with this specification, increasing 5.7 points on the depression scale with an additional pound at birth (about 1.1 standard deviations). Those with short <italic>5-HTT</italic> promoters are indeed more sensitive to their environment; however, they respond in the opposite way as we would predict.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022146512473758">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the measures used here are not strictly comparable (and findings warrant replication in other samples as well as research that attempts to uncover the mechanism), the pattern of null findings for the other gene and GE interaction effects within twin pairs suggests that previous significant findings may be biased because of population stratification or omitted environmental factors (i.e., a failure to account for endogeneity). Equally intriguing, the only GE interactions we found suggest that genes and environment work together to amplify existing benefits. Interactions that disappear among MZ twins could reflect population stratification. However, the pattern of greater advantages accruing to those with “good” genes suggests that future research may gain clarity by focusing on (random) environmental advantage rather than disadvantage.</p>
<p>Our analysis also contributes to the research literature on birth weight. Not only do we find little to no main effects of birth weight on important behavioral and academic outcomes, we also find that when interacted with certain alleles, birth weight works in the opposite direction as previously supposed. As with our GE findings, it could be the case that pre- and postnatal effects work in opposite directions, averaging to zero (note 3), but that still begs the question of why previous scholars have found significant average treatment effects for related outcomes. Alternatively, results could reflect the lower average birth weight among twins, with environmental treatment clustered toward the lower end of the distribution. Thus, our results are certainly not conclusive and call for further investigation. More broadly, our results suggest that birth-weight effects are heterogeneous by genotype. If this finding is replicated, it has important public health implications. For example, health officials could work to boost nutrition among fetuses most at risk for the effects of low birth weight.</p>
<p>Beyond the specific results presented here, we purport to have developed a careful method for assessing GE interaction effects, which we encourage other researchers to use: deploying both MZ and DZ comparisons, which each complement the other’s inferential weakness. These methods and findings have important implications for future social scientific research involving genetic data. As more surveys collect genetic information from respondents, opportunities to investigate GE interactions increase. However, without random sources of genetic and environmental variation, GE results even from quality surveys will remain questionable.</p>

<p>Recent genomewide association studies are particularly subject to this criticism of population stratification. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022146512473758">Beauchamp et al. (2009)</xref> used principle components analysis to account for as much variability as possible, but it is impossible to know whether it successfully identifies all important subpopulations. Within-family studies avoid population stratification.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0022146512473758">
<label>2.</label>
<p>The discovery of about 21,000 genes, a figure much lower than originally hypothesized, means a tractable number of alleles for geneticists to study. However, if this lowly number of genes explains the development of human beings in all their forms, then gene-gene interactions are probably quite important.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0022146512473758">
<label>3.</label>
<p>Of course, birth weight differences between twins may proxy an entirely social effect rather than fetal nutrition. Namely, perhaps the smaller twin is perceived as weak and thus stigmatized (or lavished with attention and resources). We are indifferent to what exactly the causal mechanism is for birth weight to produce an effect on our measured phenotype as long as the mechanism is not contingent on genes. If, however, those families with allele A tend to overinvest in their lower-weight twin, while those with allele B tend to stigmatize the lighter sibling, then we would detect a treatment effect that would average to zero. The use of DZ twin estimates, which identify the allelic–birth-weight interaction-effect on within-family differences, could somewhat mitigate these concerns. We identify a local average treatment effect that cannot identify the mechanism by which birth weight interacts with genetic predisposition.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022146512473758">Guo, Roettger, et al.

<p>Recently, scholars have determined that this locus is triallelic. However, our data contain only the biallelic measure, which makes null findings more likely through measurement error.</p>

<p>The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022146512473758">Table 5</xref> are similar when addressing missing birth weight. Using logged delinquency, the <italic>MAOA</italic> interaction is only marginally significant among all twins (see Table S5 in the online supplemental material) and is generally not robust to other specifications of the gene.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0022146512473758">
<label>8.</label>
<p>Including twin pairs missing complete birth weight, the interaction is insignificant. No significant interaction effects with <italic>DRD2</italic> emerge for years of education or college attendance (see Table S2 in the online supplemental material).</p>

<label>9.</label>
<p>Of course, it could be the case that social treatment of twins differs by birth weight in a way that concurs with Caspi et al.’s findings. Namely, parents may differentially invest in twins by birth weight, favoring the “at-risk,” lower-birth-weight twin and thus “neglecting” the heavier one, leading to a postnatal interaction effect between <italic>5-HTT</italic> and parental investment (as proxied by birth weight).</p>
