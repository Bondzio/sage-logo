Drawing initially on Francis Bacon (p. 3) and his much quoted line about science as the key to dominion over nature, this book squarely confronts environmental thinking within this frame. Right from the initial pages, O’Lear poses matters in terms of power as the desire for mastery. Invoking Michael Mann’s discussion of power, she reinforces this framing using Mann’s language: ‘power is the ability to pursue and attain goals through the mastery of one’s environment’ (as quoted on p. 17). All through these pages, she teases out the frequently implicit and sometimes explicit spatial arrangements through which these practices of domination, or at least its attempts, shape environments.</p><p>What is implied in this formulation, and teased out in much of the rest of the book is the simple but important point that environments are increasingly made by human activity, and in the making, attempts at dominion over nature are repeatedly involved in the disputes over regulation, property, consumption, and health that now constitute environmental politics. Lurking in her formulations, but never quite confronted directly, is the issue of the making of spaces and the reinvention of natures in numerous places. Here, Neil Smith’s formulation in <italic>Uneven Development</italic> suggests that the production of spaces and nature are two sides of the same coin. O’Lear’s analysis seems to imply this without formulating it in quite these terms.</p><p>Instead she looks to the largest scales, that of the planet’s biosphere itself and invokes the theme of the Anthropocene to suggest that humanity is making environmental spaces, and in the process, metropolitan powers are shaping rural areas in new ways, remaking the world, and doing so in ways that suggest multiple scales are needed to comprehend the processes in motion. But in focusing on the matters of geography, here, she leaves the production of numerous other things undertheorized. Manufacturing is, however, a key to all this, and in underplaying this, O’Lear follows the literature in focusing more on dealing with consequences rather than understanding processes that make the things that are then contentious. In doing so, she draws attention to environmental politics as regulation. But environmental politics is also about the matters that escape the attempts to control them, precisely because environmental politics operate in ways that are frequently ill matched to the nature of that which is to be ostensibly governed.</p><p>To do so, she invokes notions of scale to juxtapose with matters of power, suggesting repeatedly that the standard scales of public administration are not those that matter in terms of environmental politics. But there is more to her invocation of scale than the administrative spaces of states, although the discussion of scale does frequently invoke the scale of nation states as the starting point for her deliberations. Scale is understood loosely, but very interestingly, as a matter of place, and more particularly a matter of how processes unfolding in one place are interconnected to other places. This is not a simple matter of size, but a matter of connections with consequences in many places. Teasing out the connections is the key to her formulation of scale, but the term itself is imprecise in such specifications. One of the strengths of the book is precisely this ambiguity, although it is noteworthy that the concept itself is not in the index, whereas the other theme, that of power, has numerous entries through the volume!</p><p>Reading this text suggests in many ways that scale as O’Lear uses it is closer to topology than topography, networks of places rather than hierarchies of spaces. As such, this formulation simultaneously emphasizes the complexity of many things that are designated environmental, while also suggesting that the spatial strategies of administration, only most obviously the exercise of sovereignty by states, is not a good fit for the issues of environment that are key to our Anthropocene Age. This matters because in this volume O’Lear is keen to emphasize politics not policy; the contestations and conflicts over environmental matters that link both everyday struggles and international agreements into the larger corpus of political deliberation. Focusing only on matters of policy and administration misses the point that environmental matters frequently operate at multiple scales that are not congruent with power understood in Mann’s terms as the mastery of state scales.</p><p>All of this is sensible but what is noteworthy is that in teasing out these themes, and despite the initial invocation of the Anthropocene as the appropriate context for thinking about environmental politics, the theme of globalization is notably absent from much of the volume. Given the hype over the term in the 1990s, in particular, this might not be a bad thing, but it does leave the reader wondering about the global economy as the scale at which so much of the current discussion is framed. The themes are here in this volume, but not theorized in a way that makes the links with either globalization or for that matter formulations of footprints and how they are related to commodity chains. In short, the volume is light on political economy and the matters on the production of nature as a mode of power that links Bacon and Mann explicitly in a discussion of how decisions are made concerning manufacturing and production of all manner of things.</p><p>In some ways, these themes are tied together in an especially interesting manner on the cover. Rarely does a book get a cover illustration that so exquisitely summarizes the content. Look carefully at that photograph of an exceedingly unexceptional street scene in India, and the questions of how to think about scale and power come clearly into focus. Crucially, and unlike so many cover images of environmental books, this is an urban scene, a streetscape with two foraging cows in the foreground. Foraging that is through the garbage strewn on the street. Selecting the vegetable matter from the plastic bags that are intermingled with organic material is a basic skill needed by all Indian cows it seems, but the simple fact of this as a common mode of ingestion speaks volumes for understanding the artificial circumstances in which nature is now contested. Are these animals organic recycling systems or something else?</p><p>The signs on the streetscape, not the Hindi language ones that are helpfully translated for Anglophones, but the advertising ones that do not need translation because they are written in English, speak of time centers, where one can purchase timex products. They also speak of property, and in case that is not clear, then the shuttered storefronts protect the private spaces of the shops from the public spaces of the street. On that street, another new species of mobility contrasts with the cows, one that we might perhaps cheekily call ‘scooterabus ubiquitus’, the two-wheeled petroleum powered replacement for quadruped locomotion that marks the spread of modernity. The emergence of climate change as the biggest scale environmental politics issue is evident in this scene too; the juxtaposition with animal life emphasizes the point that we now live in built environments that package in plastic and move on carbon fuels.</p><p>All of which returns us to the key theme of departure in the book, the scale of transformation is now global and recognizing the interconnections between the mundane practicalities of garbage disposal and transportation in the congested urban spaces of the global South is now essential to understanding how powers are remaking nature. Indeed, the whole notion of environment is thus rendered troublesome in that its formulation as external to humanity, as something other to be mastered, is no longer tenable. The modern fictions of science and mastery are also challenged by this understanding of scale as a matter of processes in various places interconnected in ways that conventional political language frequently fails to effectively grasp.</p><p>If we are to extend the formulation of Mann’s understandings of power beyond economic, military, political, and ideological, we all need to ponder how to think about the processes that are making the future, an increasingly artificial and technological future. Bacon’s promise of science has indeed given at least the small affluent part of humanity that decides on matters of what is made where, dominion over nature. But in the process that part of humanity has been very slow to realize, much less care about, how that mastery of environment produces effects well beyond the scope of what was intended. Power is now about scale indeed and the largest of scales is where we need to focus our attention clearly. But unless we understand much better the connections between many places in our artificial world in the new geological circumstances of our making, one cannot help wonder as to whether the cows in the cover image might not be a metaphor that requires much more of our attention.</p></body></article>
