<abstract>
<p>The present study reports on the motivations of adult, international learners of English, studying English 20 hours a week in a US-based Intensive English Program (IEP). Though often used as participants in language acquisition studies, there are few studies of these learners’ motivational profiles. In the current study, a questionnaire designed to measure language attitudes, learning orientations, and learning confidence was administered to 131 IEP learners. Factor analysis of the responses revealed five motivation components: Learning Self-Confidence, Attitudes toward English Language Learning/Community, Personal English Use, Value of English Learning, and International Posture. The results attest to a dualistic nature of instrumentality and suggest that even in a study abroad setting, international English learners are less motivated by positive attitudes toward the English community and more motivated by a sense of personal pride in learning and using English, even when learning confidence is low.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Within the domain of instructed second language acquisition (SLA), motivation has been argued to be the basic mechanism that propels adult learners forward. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0033688212473272">Dörnyei (2005</xref>: 65), ‘Indeed, all the other factors involved in SLA presuppose motivation to some extent’. Several components of second language (L2) motivation have been frequently investigated – including language attitudes, learning orientations, and linguistic self-confidence – although there is no general consensus on the nature of L2 motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0033688212473272">Dörnyei, 2005</xref>). This is partially because models of motivation developed in one context have not always been found to apply equally to other populations. For example, the socio-educational model of Integrative Motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0033688212473272">Gardner, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0033688212473272">2001</xref>), which emerged largely from research conducted in the socio-political context of Canada, has been challenged and re-shaped in numerous investigations in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) contexts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212473272">Dörnyei et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0033688212473272">Mori and Gobel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0033688212473272">Schmidt et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Such investigations of EFL learners have helped researchers move toward a greater understanding of motivation as a contextualized variable. However, it is important to avoid the pitfall of assuming that all international learners of English are uniform. The present study explores the extent to which learners in an Intensive English Program (IEP), where English is the dominant language of the surrounding community, are similar to the EFL populations on which theories of L2 motivation have been refined. The point has been rightly made that IEP learners are well-researched (perhaps even overly researched) in SLA studies largely due to the fact that such learners are commonplace on universities and easily accessed for university research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0033688212473272">Ortega, 2005</xref>). However, few studies have specifically investigated their L2 motivational profiles, even though there is research to suggest that the motivations of IEP learners are not the same as those of other language learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0033688212473272">Gu and Maley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0033688212473272">Noels, 2009</xref>). Moreover, such research is especially warranted given the increase in international student numbers in US universities, which has been one outcome of the internationalization of higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0033688212473272">Altbach et al., 2010</xref>: 24). In fact, according to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0033688212473272">Institute of International Education (2011)</xref>, the number of international students on US campuses has grown for five consecutive years, reaching 723,277 in 2010/11.</p>

<title>Motivation Constructs</title>
<p>The genesis of much L2 motivation research can be traced to the bilingual context of Canada and Gardner’s socio-educational model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0033688212473272">Gardner, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0033688212473272">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0033688212473272">Gardner and Lambert, 1959</xref>). Emerging from the language attitude research tradition, Gardner’s motivation model centered on the constructs of orientations and language attitudes: ‘[A learner’s] motivation to acquire the [target] language is considered to be determined by both his [or her] <italic>attitudes</italic> toward the other group and by his [or her] <italic>orientation</italic> toward learning a second language’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0033688212473272">Lambert et al., 1963</xref>: 358, italics added). Regarding attitudes, subsequent studies of EFL learners have operationalized attitudes as scales of <italic>attitudes toward English speakers</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212473272">Dörnyei et al., 2006</xref>) and <italic>attitudes toward language learning</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0033688212473272">Clément et al., 1994</xref>). In the EFL context, the strength of positive attitudes toward English speakers may be in a state of transition, with positive attitudes declining as English is increasingly considered a global language of necessity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0033688212473272">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212473272">Dörnyei et al., 2006</xref>). Regarding orientations, research has explored a variety of operationalizations. The integrative orientation scale includes items that ‘emphasize the notion of identification with the community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0033688212473272">Masgoret and Gardner, 2003</xref>: 139), whereas the instrumental orientation includes items that reflect ‘practical reasons for learning the language, without implying any interest in getting closer socially to the language community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0033688212473272">Masgoret and Gardner, 2003</xref>: 139).</p>
<p>A third noteworthy orientation is the <italic>cultural interest</italic> orientation that has been associated with learners’ interest in media-based products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0033688212473272">Csizér and Dörnyei, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0033688212473272">Dörnyei, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212473272">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212473272">Dörnyei et al., 2006</xref>). This cultural interest component has been part of the dialogue to revise the construct of integrativeness, a revision for which many have argued, particularly in the context of learning English and a globalizing world. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0033688212473272">Mori and Gobel (2006</xref>: 205) argued that the integrative factor better represented learners’ ‘interest in traveling and studying overseas, rather than a desire to integrate into the target language community’. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0033688212473272">Yashima (2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0033688212473272">Yashima et al., 2004</xref>) recast integrativeness as <italic>international posture</italic>, in order to index learners’ association of English language abilities with the ability to gain access to international communities. Studies of EFL learners have also shown that integrative and instrumental orientations may be conjoined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0033688212473272">Kimura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0033688212473272">Lamb, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Such findings on learner orientations have supported the call to reframe not only integrativeness but also instrumentality. The framework of the L2 Motivational Self System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0033688212473272">Dörnyei, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212473272">2009</xref>) has been posited as one means of doing so. In this framework a learner’s ideal L2 self includes both ‘traditional integrative and internalised instrumental motives,’ whereas the ought-to L2 self includes ‘more extrinsic (i.e. less internalised) types of instrumental motives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212473272">Dörnyei, 2009</xref>: 29). Thus the degree of internalization is theorized as the fulcrum between the two possible selves.</p>
<p>In addition to refining theories of language attitudes and orientations, language motivation research has also investigated people’s perceptions of their competence in using or learning the target language. This construct has been investigated under different labels – including linguistic self-confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212473272">Dörnyei et al., 2006</xref>) and (its obverse) anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0033688212473272">Gardner, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0033688212473272">Schmidt et al., 1996</xref>). Building on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0033688212473272">Clément (1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0033688212473272">Clément et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0033688212473272">Clément and Kruidenier, 1985</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0033688212473272">Dörnyei and Kormos (2000)</xref> also contrasted the two terms by defining language use anxiety as ‘anxiety experienced while using the L2’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0033688212473272">2000</xref>: 284) and linguistic self-confidence as self-perceptions of competence for language learning, or ‘a favorable self-conception of language aptitude, satisfaction with [one’s] progress and a belief in one’s ability to succeed in L2 learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0033688212473272">2000</xref>: 284).</p>

<title>Motivation Studies in IEP-abroad Contexts</title>
<p>In this study, the term IEP indicates a context in which learners are explicitly studying English alongside learners from diverse first language (L1) backgrounds while in an English-dominant community. These programs are predominately affiliated with American university settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0033688212473272">American Association of Intensive English Programs, 2012</xref>), and these learners are often identified in the SLA literature as ESL learners. Yet, referring to IEP learners as ESL learners risks glossing over differences between temporary sojourners, matriculated international students, and ‘permanent’ immigrant or refugee populations. A similar context found in UK-based research is a year-long foundation course program that combines an explicit academic preparation goal and English language training goal, making foundation course learners similar to IEP learners.</p>
<p>Research concerning IEP learners’ motivation in English-dominant communities can be categorized into three bodies of research. First is a small body of qualitative case study research that focused on varying definitions of IEP learners’ motivation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0033688212473272">Huang and Chang (1998)</xref> compared four learners. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0033688212473272">Russell and Yoo (2001)</xref> investigated eight learners. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0033688212473272">Kim (2009)</xref> contrasted two learners. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0033688212473272">Kobayashi (2007)</xref> focused mainly on the experiences of three learners. These case studies argue for the importance of motivation in IEP settings, while positing that it is variable across learners.</p>
<p>A second set of research investigating the motivation of IEP learners has been larger-scaled. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0033688212473272">Gradman and Hanania (1991)</xref> performed a qualitative analysis of interview data from 101 learners and identified 44 language learning background variables, including several types of motivation such as career-focused reasons for learning English. Building on this earlier work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0033688212473272">Wilhelm (1997)</xref> investigated another group of IEP learners and found three categories of motivation to be predictors of success: career-focused reasons for learning, positive attitudes toward English classes, and the support of one’s family.</p>
<p>The third body of research that includes motivation constructs has mixed IEP (or UK-foundation) learners with other learners. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0033688212473272">Al-Shehri (2009)</xref> collapsed UK-based foundation students with two populations in Saudi Arabia (EFL learners at universities and recently graduated high school students). Unfortunately, since he did not report or analyze data on the basis of the three different populations, it is not possible to discern motivation trends particular to the foundation students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0033688212473272">Gu and Maley (2008)</xref> also mixed learners from foundation courses with matriculated, international learners to investigate changes in culture shock and self-confidence that occurred when learners transitioned from life as students in China to life as students in the UK. The researchers noted that the two learning populations differed in terms of ‘experiences and attitudes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0033688212473272">Gu and Maley, 2008</xref>: 228), which they posited may ‘help to reveal the extent to which age/maturity may impact on students’ intercultural adjustment and academic performance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0033688212473272">Gu and Maley, 2008</xref>: 228). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0033688212473272">Noels (2009)</xref> previewed a work-in-progress comparing the motivational profiles of US-based IEP, heritage, and American modern language learners. She noted that the three learning populations were not identical in terms of their motivational orientations and stated that ‘students in dissimilar circumstances can have quite different foci in learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0033688212473272">Noels, 2009</xref>: 299). Together, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0033688212473272">Gu and Maley (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0033688212473272">Noels (2009)</xref> suggest that IEP learners may not be motivationally or attitudinally the same as other learning populations, even ones that seem similar in many respects. A systematic study of their motivational profiles with specific reference to potentially relevant contextual variables is needed.</p>

<title>Research Question</title>
<p>As reviewed above, the rich L2 motivation tradition has yielded a variety of constructs well-researched in the EFL context – including language attitudes, learning orientations, and linguistic self-confidence. However, the extent to which these constructs are applicable to IEP learners studying in English-dominant communities has been less well investigated even though there is research to suggest that the motivations of IEP learners are not the same as other language learners. Accordingly, the present study was designed to explore the following research question: <italic>What are the meaningful components of English learning motivation for a sample of adult, international US-based IEP learners from a variety of countries</italic>?</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>For this study, I recruited adult, international learners of English studying English 20 hours a week in a US-based IEP at a major private university in metropolitan Washington, D.C. Based on an in-house placement exam, learners are assigned to a proficiency level for a 16-week program that addresses reading, writing, listening, and speaking. I recruited learners from all but the lowest course level.</p>
<p>A total of 131 adult learners volunteered. Of these, 58% were female (N=76) and 42 % were male (N=55). Ages ranged from 18 to 61, with an average age of 26. Language backgrounds were varied, as is common for US-based IEPs, with learners from 31 countries participating; the largest number came from South Korea, as has been characteristic in studies of other similar populations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0033688212473272">Loewen et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0033688212473272">Table 1</xref> presents information on the learners’ national origins.</p>

<p>Ninety percent of learners (N=118) reported that they were self-funded; in other words, their parents, spouses, or they themselves paid for the program. This suggests that this group of learners represents a demographic of middle- and upper-class individuals and families who can afford to support learning in a US study abroad setting. Based on the personal cost associated with the choice to study abroad in the US, learners may report strong motivation for the US-learning context, including strongly positive attitudes toward Americans.</p>

Additional items to distinguish confidence in competency for language learning (Self-Confidence) and fear of language use (Anxiety) were included because some have suggested the two are separate constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0033688212473272">Clément et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0033688212473272">Clément and Kruidenier, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0033688212473272">Dörnyei and Kormos, 2000</xref>). Finally, the pragmatic goal of learning English for career purposes was divided into <italic>English for career purposes in one’s own country</italic> (item 7) and <italic>English for career purposes in an English-speaking country</italic> (item 22). In sum, the main components of motivation in the questionnaire were as follows (with the item numbers given in parenthesis):</p>

<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>During the middle of the term, volunteers came to an auditorium during their normal 2-hour, mid-day break; they completed a consent form, a biographical data form, and a questionnaire. Because learners had a variety of L1s, the questionnaire was in English. It had been piloted with learners from the lowest level classes to check that the instructions were clear and that the vocabulary used on the questionnaire was appropriate.</p>
<p>Items were scored on a six-point Likert scale, ranging from Strongly Agree (6) to Strongly Disagree (1). Negatively worded items were reverse-coded; thus, for all items, the higher the value, the more positive the sentiment. Because the questionnaires were administered over two years to two cohorts of learners, raw scores of the Likert-scale data for each year were converted into z scores following recommendations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212473272">Dörnyei (2001</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212473272">Dörnyei et al., 2006</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0033688212473272">Gardner (1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0033688212473272">2000</xref>); standardization is recommended because it puts the values from different years on the same scale, helping ensure comparability. Then, using SPSS 14.0, an exploratory factor analysis using Principal Axis Factoring was performed to identify the underlying constructs of learners’ English language learning motivation. The solution was rotated obliquely using promax because the factors were assumed to be intercorrelated. Factor loadings of 0.30 or greater were considered significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0033688212473272">Field, 2009</xref>: 644). Based on the results of the factor analysis, an average score was calculated for each factor in order to compare the characteristics of the factors.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In order to investigate patterns in the participants’ responses to the 32 motivation items, a factor analysis was performed using Principal Axis Factoring. The number of factors extracted was based on an examination of factor solutions’ eigenvalues via a scree plot. Factors having an eigenvalue greater than 1 were retained, and each factor had to load at least two items that did not load higher on other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212473272">Dörnyei, 2001</xref>). Of the 32 items, two (7 and 19) were eliminated as they showed minimal allegiance (loading value &lt; 0.1) to any factor, and the factor matrix was reanalyzed. Subsequently, the solution was rotated obliquely (promax).</p>
<p>The resulting five-factor solution loaded 28 items saliently (loading value &gt; 0.3), accounting for 49.3% of the total variance in learners’ responses to the questionnaire items. A strong Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy of 0.736 indicates that the sample size is sufficient for executing a factor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0033688212473272">Field, 2009</xref>: 647). The reliability of the 28-item solution measured by Cronbach’s alpha is a strong 0.84, and the individual factors show good reliability on the basis of their Cronbach’s alpha values, which are acceptable for short scales and in line with prior L2 motivation research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212473272">Dörnyei et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0033688212473272">Schmidt and Watanabe, 2001</xref>).

<p>Factor 1 saliently loads eight items related to learners’ perceptions of using English orally (8, 18, 25, 27, 31) and perceptions of their competence in learning English (9, 11, 16). Though the items that loaded were negatively phrased, all of the items had been reverse-coded, meaning that higher values represent more positive self-perceptions. All but one of these items (item 31) is specifically related to classroom settings and comparisons with fellow learners. To highlight the formal learning context, this first factor is labeled <italic>Learning Self-Confidence</italic>.</p>
<p>The second component loads eight salient items concerning language attitudes. Six items (14, 15, 24, 28; 3 and 30 were reverse-coded) are associated with affective attitudes toward language learning. The other two items (23, 29) reflect positive attitudes toward Americans, who make up the English language community in which the learners’ IEP experience is embedded. This factor is labeled <italic>Attitudes toward English Language Learning/Community</italic>.</p>
<p>Five items that relate to personal reasons for learning English load saliently on the third component. Three of these reflect inquisitiveness about products of English: aural media (movies, TV shows, and songs; item 4), print media (item 20), and English culture/art (item 26). Given the reach of English media through marketing initiatives and globalization, it is easy to understand such media products as representative of the most routine means through which these learners have accessed and will access English in their home countries. The factor also loads item 17, which relates to travel in English-speaking countries, and item 10, which reflects an interest in understanding English speakers themselves. The co-occurrence of these two items may reflect the learners’ desires to understand the English-speaking community currently around them due to their position as study abroad sojourners. As the items of this factor reflect reasons for using English for personal purposes, it is labeled <italic>Personal English Use</italic>.</p>
<p>The fourth component loads three salient items. Item 13 was reverse-coded so that a high score indicates that learning English is not a waste of time. Similarly, item 21 was reverse-coded so that a high score indicates that a learner does not avoid speaking English with native English speakers. Item 12 did not require reverse coding, as the item was already worded in a positive format (<italic>Learning often gives me a feeling of success</italic>). This factor suggests an underlying belief that learning English is valuable, is a personal marker of one’s success, and is linked to one’s willingness to communicate orally with native speakers. As this factor reflects a sense of personal value that comes from learning English, it is labeled <italic>Value of English Learning</italic>.</p>
<p>The final component loads four salient items and represents two underlying constructs. First, two items index a desire for multilingualism. Item 1 (<italic>I would like to learn as many foreign languages as possible.</italic>) is the highest loading item, accounting for 42% of the factor’s total weight. Item 32 (<italic>After I finish learning English, I would like to start learning another language</italic>) also expresses a multilingual desire. Second, two items that load on this factor apply this broad multilingual desire to the narrower context of the English learning experience in both general terms (item 2: <italic>I would like to get to know more Americans.</italic>) and in work-specific terms (item 22: <italic>Learning English is important to me because I would like to work in an English-speaking country.</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0033688212473272">Yashima’s (2002)</xref> label of <italic>International Posture</italic> was chosen for the factor because it has been described as expressing an affinity for what English symbolizes by loading items that reflect ‘interest in foreign or international affairs, willingness to go overseas to stay or work, readiness to interact with intercultural partners, and, one hopes, openness or a non-ethnocentric attitude toward different cultures’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0033688212473272">2002</xref>: 57; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0033688212473272">Yashima et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated the construct of language learning motivation in the context of adult learners studying in a US-based IEP to explore the extent to which constructs largely defined in the EFL context were applicable in this context. Results of a factor analysis revealed five motivation constructs, listed here in order of the lowest to highest average factor score: Learning Self-Confidence, Attitudes toward English Language Learning/Community, International Posture, Personal English Use, and Value of English Learning. These five factors reveal several interesting insights into how motivation for English language learning is related to these learners’ sense of self.</p>
<p>First, in the present study learners’ confidence in their competence for language learning (self-confidence) and their fear of language use (anxiety) were not clearly separate constructs as has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0033688212473272">Clément et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0033688212473272">Clément and Kruidenier, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0033688212473272">Dörnyei and Kormos, 2000</xref>). If they had been separate constructs, the items associated with perceptions of competence would have loaded on a separate factor than the items associated with anxiety of use. Instead the items patterned in a blended manner on two factors (Learning Self-Confidence and Value of Learning English). Specifically, the Learning Self-Confidence factor attracted a blend of eight of the items that predominantly concerned leaners’ feelings about the process of learning; this factor received the lowest average rating. In contrast, the Value of English Learning factor attracted items concerning a high sense of self-worth derived from being involved in English studies and received the highest average rating of positive agreement of all five factors. That is, for these learners, being proud of being an English learner is separate from one’s confidence in using English in learning settings. This distinction may attest to the high personal investment (in terms of both time and expense) that these individuals have made in order to become study abroad learners in a US-based IEP context.</p>
<p>It is perhaps because of these high personal costs that IEP learners are often assumed to be highly motivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0033688212473272">Moir and Nation, 2002</xref>). In contrast, in EFL contexts, learning English is increasingly assumed not to require high levels of personal motivation; rather, learning English is increasingly considered a mundane subject, similar to learning math or science: ‘More and more people do <italic>not</italic> make a motivated decision to learn English but study the language as an obvious and self-evident component of education in the 21<sup>st</sup> century’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212473272">Dörnyei et al, 2006</xref>: 89, italics added). The results of the present study may help explain these varying positions by suggesting that what constitutes <italic>highly motivated</italic> depends on how the construct is defined. For example, while these IEP learners do report relatively lower positive motivation in terms of their Attitudes toward English Language Learning/Community, which is perhaps surprising given their choice to study abroad in the US, they report high motivation for learning English as a marker of International Posture and for Personal English Use.</p>
<p>The composition of these two highly positive factors offers further insight into how these IEP learners compare to their EFL counterparts and contributes to our understanding of instrumentality. Similar to results in the EFL context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0033688212473272">Kimura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0033688212473272">Lamb, 2004</xref>), the Personal English Use factor of the present study suggests a blurring between integrative and instrumental orientations. It loads not only two traditionally integrative items (10 and 26), but also the travel to English-speaking countries item (17), which has been associated with both integrativeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0033688212473272">Gardner, 1985</xref>) and instrumentality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212473272">Dörnyei, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212473272">Dörnyei et al., 2006</xref>). The factor also loads the media-based items (4 and 20), which differentiates this factor from the EFL context of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212473272">Dörnyei et al. (2006)</xref>, where similar items were classified as cultural interest items distinct from either integrative or instrumental orientations. Thus, the Personal English Use factor of this study predominately attracts items associated with using English for a range of private entertainment and enrichment purposes. Support for this interpretation is that the factor does not load work-related uses of English, which have been considered a quintessential instrumental orientation. Instead, the International Posture factor loads an item relating to the desire to work in English-speaking countries (item 22), and this factor is reflective of the role of English as a means of interacting with the larger professional or global community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0033688212473272">1</xref></sup> The relatively more public nature of the International Posture factor and the more private nature of the Personal English Use factor may both be related to the privileged position that these learners are living into as students with the financial assets necessary to travel abroad for language learning.</p>
<p>Together these two factors illustrate two dimensions of self: one inward and private, the other outward and public. The emergence of both factors may relate to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0033688212473272">Dörnyei’s (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212473272">2009</xref>) calls to understand the notion of instrumentality through the lens of the L2 Motivational Self System. In this system instrumentality may be either a marker of the ideal L2 self or of the ought-to L2 self, with the difference hinging on the degree of internalization of the motive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212473272">Dörnyei, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0033688212473272">Kim, 2009</xref>). Future investigations might explore whether the distinction between private versus public dimensions is one way to operationalize the tipping point from less internal (i.e. the ought-to L2 self) to the more internal (i.e. the ideal L2 self).</p>

<title>Pedagogical Implications</title>
<p>In terms of classroom applications, these data yield two pedagogical recommendations. First, as Learning Self-Confidence had the lowest average factor score, some learners appear to struggle with self-confidence in relationship to their peers, which problematizes peer work. Allowing students to brainstorm alone before pairing them with classmates and varying learners’ interaction partners, including occasionally grouping students with classmates who share an L1, are strategies for mitigating face-threatening, oral interactions. Second, the Attitudes toward English Language Learning/Community had the second lowest average factor score; therefore, even when international learners are embedded in an English-dominant community, it cannot be assumed that assignments requiring learners to interact orally with a native-speaking community will be well received. This suggests that programs would do well to build bridges between the learners and the community. Equally, this finding suggests that an intercultural dimension might be included in programs to address attitudinal issues.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study of language learning motivation includes a large percentage of learners from Asia (70%), so the results of the study may be of greatest use for teachers working with Asian language learners. As this study is one of the few to examine a range of motivation constructs in the US-based IEP context, additional research is needed to confirm whether the trends evidenced in the present study emerge in other IEP learning contexts.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The present study tested the applicability of L2 motivation constructs developed in a largely EFL context to adult, international learners in a US-based IEP context. A factor model of English learning motivation based on their responses yielded five major components. Of these, Learning Self-Confidence, which relates to confidence predominately in English classroom settings, received the lowest average factor score. In contrast, the factor with the highest average factor score was Value of English Learning, which may index a realization of the linguistic capital garnered from learning English. This contrast suggests that being proud of being an English learner is separate from one’s confidence in using English in learning contexts.</p>
<p>Moreover, given learners’ choice to study abroad in the US, it is somewhat surprising that the IEP learners are similar to those in some EFL contexts in displaying lower positive Attitudes toward English Language Learning/Community (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0033688212473272">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212473272">Dörnyei et al., 2006</xref>) relative to more positive factor scores for two factors that tapped into dimensions of instrumentality: International Posture and Personal English Use. Thus, even in a context in which learners have chosen to study English in a study abroad environment, motivations for English learning seem less related to positive attitudes toward an English community and more closely associated with developing an international identity and meeting a variety of everyday personal needs, namely entertainment media and travel. Finally, the dualistic nature of instrumentality that emerged in these data supports calls to refine the definition of instrumental motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212473272">Dörnyei, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0033688212473272">Irie, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0033688212473272">Kimura et al., 2001</xref>) and may be one means of understanding how instrumental motives can become internalized as learners seek to develop their ideal L2 English selves.</p>
