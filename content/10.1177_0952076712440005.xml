<abstract>
<p>Since the introduction of devolution in 1999 there has been a growth in comparative analysis of the National Health Service (NHS) as it has developed between England, Scotland and Wales. Several analyses have considered funding and policies on provision and performance, usually noting the difficulties in carrying out comparative evaluation. Few studies to date have included detailed analysis of Northern Ireland and this paper seeks to set out and analyse the organisation of the NHS in Northern Ireland. The focus is on the structures of the NHS as it has developed since devolution and relates to similar structures in the NHS in England, Scotland and Wales. The analytical approach in the paper uses the concept of policy copying to interrogate the structural and institutional organisation of the NHS in Northern Ireland. This facilitates an assessment of the degree of divergence between Northern Ireland and the other UK countries, and the nature and scope of policy copying. The article then seeks to explain the reasons for both policy copying and the rejection of policy copying, and how this may have led to identifiable policy deficiencies.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0952076712440005" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Respective legislation in 1998 and subsequent additions devolved a very substantial area of legislative and executive decision making to the devolved institutions of governance in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Structural differences between the four countries of the UK in relation to the National Health Service (NHS) did exist prior to devolution in 1999. The Scottish and Welsh Offices had been able to introduce some distinctive features and Northern Ireland had a long period of legislative devolution until 1972, during which time a structurally integrated system of health and social care was planned and introduced. A Department of Health and Social Services continued under the procedures for administering direct rule from Westminster between 1972 and 1999. As elsewhere in the UK, Northern Ireland also saw the introduction of market-based reforms to the NHS in the early 1990s, although the operation of the internal market in Northern Ireland was somewhat more limited. This was due to a lack of competition as a result of the small size of the market and a lack of clarity about purchaser and provider roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0952076712440005">Health and Social Services Executive, 1997</xref>). Thus the existence of different territorial health departments contributed to each part of the UK having a distinctive health identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0952076712440005">Woods, 2002</xref>). Predictions for future trends were mixed; for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0952076712440005">Mooney and Poole (2004)</xref> suggested that limited institutional differences existed which did not signal a major departure from central UK themes, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0952076712440005">Woods (2002: 55)</xref> suggested that it might become necessary to speak of the UK’s National Health Services rather than the NHS. Comparative work in the first decade after devolution had a strong focus on divergent health policies and provision emerging in Scotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0952076712440005">Tannahill, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0952076712440005">Mooney and Scott, 2005</xref>) and Wales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0952076712440005">Drakeford, 2006</xref>). It was largely the custom to leave Northern Ireland out of the equation because of the suspension of devolution between 2002 and 2007, or because little was happening. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0952076712440005">Woods (2004: 324)</xref> excluded Northern Ireland from his analysis because of complexities stemming from political instability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0952076712440005">Greer (2005)</xref> linked the lack of policy outcomes to the sporadic nature of devolution, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0952076712440005">Talbot-Smith and Pollock (2006)</xref> pointed to policy development and organisational reform being limited. In the same period, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0952076712440005">Smith and Babbington (2006)</xref> agreed that health developments in Northern Ireland could be characterised as relatively inactive but with a reconfiguration of structures pending. A series of studies on health and devolution by the Nuffield Trust had left Northern Ireland out of an original report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0952076712440005">Jervis and Plowden, 2003)</xref>, and a later report was based on evidence before devolution was restored to Northern Ireland and had to be based on developments in Scotland and Wales only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0952076712440005">Jervis, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A few UK-wide studies have included Northern Ireland. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0952076712440005">Greer (2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0952076712440005">2008</xref>), compared the underlying values of the operation of the NHS in all four countries and identified Northern Ireland as having a system of permissive managerialism with an emphasis on running and administering services, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0952076712440005">Maslin-Prothero et al. (2008)</xref> fully included Northern Ireland in a discussion of a four parts or one whole NHS. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0952076712440005">Connolly et al. (2010)</xref>, in a study published by the Nuffield Trust and covering all parts of the UK, reported on the performance and resources of the systems of healthcare, before and after devolution up until 2006.</p>
<p>Devolution has created four policy arenas for the formulation and development of health policies with separate legislative, deliberative and administrative bodies. The UK-wide commitment to the NHS structure and principles and the similar allocation of funding to the devolved administrations by the Treasury under the Barnett Formula has drawn attention to the extent of policy copying when the four governments have sought to introduce change. This has been further highlighted by the most recent restructuring decisions made by the UK coalition government for England.</p>
<p>The concept of policy transfer has been established as the process by which knowledge of policy administration arrangements, institutions, programmes and ideas are transferred between jurisdictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0952076712440005">Dolowitz and Marsh, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0952076712440005">2000</xref>). There is a process of deliberate awareness and decision making to copy and transfer. Thus identifying policy transfer differs from identifying policy convergence, which may have a range of causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0952076712440005">Jones and Newburn, 2007</xref>). A process of policy transfer may also be analysed as covering a spectrum from identical copying to partial or selective copying. Policy transfer was originally studied as a concept involving policy transfer between jurisdictions, but can be applied to the contexts of federalism and devolution. In the context of devolution within the UK, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0952076712440005">Cairney et al. (2009)</xref> identify three possible flows: from the centre to the periphery, from periphery to periphery and from the periphery to the centre. Translated more specifically into the operation of the UK devolved arrangements, this means policy transfers in the area of devolved functions a) between Westminster practices for England and Scotland and/or Wales and/or Northern Ireland; b) between Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; and c) policy transfer from Scotland or Wales or Northern Ireland to England. A system of devolution seems likely to facilitate and lead to policy copying for a number of reasons. These include geographical proximity, close relationships, access to information and knowledge, and the role of national institutions – including the UK parliament, the Home Civil Service, professional bodies, trade unions and policy networks. Special mechanisms may encourage copying, such as the British–Irish Council and the now-reconvened Joint Ministerial Council, particularly if similar problems are being addressed and if innovative or successful practices are produced in one country. The process and opportunity for policy transfer is more likely to occur when a government is making a decision on changes or reforms to an existing system. Since the launch of devolution in 1999 in Northern Ireland, restructuring the Health Service has been a major policy priority, with a decision and implementation process lasting through the first period of devolution 1999 to 2002, the period of direct rule 2002 to 2007 and extending into the restoration of devolution from 2007. An examination of the degree of policy transfer that took place in this process is a useful framework of analysis in analysing the outcome of this restructuring.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0952076712440005"><title>The main characteristics of the restructured NHS in Northern Ireland</title>
<p>A commitment to reform the whole devolved system of public administration featured strongly in the first Programme for Government published by the Northern Ireland Executive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0952076712440005">Northern Ireland Executive, 2001</xref>). Initially it seemed that the reform of health structures would remain a separate exercise based on earlier exploratory proposals. After the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2002, the UK government and the Northern Ireland secretary of state decided that the Review of Public Administration (RPA) would continue with the same terms of reference and broad approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0952076712440005">RPA, 2003</xref>:5). The Review was to be based on a number of characteristics such as democratic accountability, responsiveness, subsidiary coordination of services, efficiency and effectiveness – principles seen as consistent with the Good Friday Agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0952076712440005">RPA 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0952076712440005">1</xref></sup> It also became clear that the reform of health structures was to be treated as an integral but distinct part of the Review.</p>
<p>The existing structure of health services in Northern Ireland consisted of an integrated system of health and social services, with eleven Trusts providing primary care, social work and, in some cases, secondary care. There were also, however, seven specifically hospital Trusts plus one ambulance Trust. Four commissioning bodies, the Health and Social Services boards, were also reflective of the integrated structure. Under this system some thirty-seven quangos (non-departmental public boards) operated to deliver health and social services, and these were clearly to be at risk, given the focus on reducing the number of quangos expressed by the review team. The core features of the restructuring of health services were announced by Direct Rule ministers from the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0952076712440005">NIO, 2005</xref>). These were based on a number of principles, three of which had particular salience. First, that changes in structures should be based on the continuing integration of health and personal social services. Second, that the continuance of the Boards/Trusts divide hindered the government’s intention to secure partnership working. It was suggested that the commissioning of the delivery of services need not be separated organisationally, and the development of structures should be characterised not by the need to generate competition, but by the creation of partnerships between commissioning and delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0952076712440005">RPA, 2005</xref>: 64). Third, that the new structures should accommodate the proposal on the number of new local authorities. The structural review of health and social care advocated the creation of one statutory health and social services authority and five health and social service trusts plus the Ambulance Trust. This was based on a separation between commissioning and delivery of services. The one statutory health and social services authority would commission services and be advised by seven local commissioning groups, although these would not be independent statutory bodies. Services would be provided by five health and social services trusts. The main justification for the change to a division of commissioning and provision, and centralised control by one quango, was the improvement of performance management. This was a response to an independent review of health and social care commissioned by the Direct Rule government (Appleby, 2005) although other commentators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0952076712440005">Smith et al., 2004</xref>) had questioned whether it was possible or even desirable to have a system based on a purchaser/provider split in such a small and tightly integrated system.</p>
<p>The proposals were partly implemented by the time the Executive and Assembly was restored in 2007 and the new structures had been described at this point as the most fundamental change to the health and social services for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0952076712440005">RPA, 2006a</xref>). In the event, when devolution was restored some changes and additions were made to the proposals. The new minister, Mr McGimpsey, accepted that the newly established five Trusts and the Ambulance Trust would remain but, faced with the prospect of a huge Health Services Authority to deal with everything (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0952076712440005">Northern Ireland Assembly, 2008</xref>) the Minister created three centralised bodies. Full implementation of the new structures did not take place until 2009-2010. It is now possible to describe the main characteristics of the restructuring, in particular identifying any convergence with England, Scotland and Wales. Eight key elements of the structures are examined here: organisation of primary and secondary care; integration of health and social care; the commissioning–provider relationship; the role of quangos; localism; public involvement; public health; and regulation and inspection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0952076712440005"><title>Organisation of primary and secondary care</title>
<p>As outlined above, restructuring resulted in a reconfiguration of 18 existing delivery trusts into 5 integrated health and social care trusts responsible for all aspects of health provision; primary care, secondary care, community health care and mental health services. This brought to an end 7 separate hospital trusts that previously existed for major acute and teaching hospitals. In having comprehensive health trust structures Northern Ireland differed from the structures in England, where there are primary care trusts or planned GP consortia, plus NHS Hospital Trusts and Mental Health Trusts. The structure in Northern Ireland is more similar to Scotland, with its 14 comprehensive health boards and also now to Wales, which has moved to replace local health boards and hospital trusts with a smaller number of 7 comprehensive health boards. Northern Ireland differs from England as does Scotland and Wales in not having foundation trust status for health bodies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0952076712440005"><title>Integration of health and social services</title>
<p>Northern Ireland has had a largely integrated structure of health and personal social services since the early 1970s, and the major document of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0952076712440005">Review of Public Administration (2005:64)</xref> made clear that changes in structures must be based on this integration continuing. The eventual restructuring was to move Northern Ireland further towards the full structural integration of all aspects of the delivery of health and social care through five integrated trusts. This means that Northern Ireland has made more progress towards formal structural integration than Great Britain, despite the repeated UK government commitments to break down the barriers between health and social care and to promote collaborative working. Elsewhere in the UK partnerships and collaboration have remained the main form of joined-up working between the NHS and social care services. The NHS Plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0952076712440005">Department of Health [DOH], 2000</xref>) permitted the formation in England of integrated care trusts, but only ten trusts became established. Care trusts were to be located within the NHS and most were not comprehensive in their provision, with several mainly focussed on mental health. Scotland has adopted community health and care partnerships as the main vehicle for collaboration between the NHS and local authorities. The actual impact and robustness of the structure in Northern Ireland has been questioned, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0952076712440005">Hudson and Henwood (2002)</xref> arguing that the integration was more apparent than real and did not result in better provision. Other research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0952076712440005">Challis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0952076712440005">Reilly et al., 2007</xref>) indicated that the Northern Ireland structure was more conducive to integrated work and practice in mental health and older people’s services than in England. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0952076712440005">Heenan and Birrell (2006)</xref> suggest that the full potential of the integrated structure has not been realised, but there had been benefits in the form of integrated teams and programmes of care, and ease of hospital discharges. Further analysis following the total integrated structure established in 2007 indicate some disappointing achievements in the resettlement in the community of people with learning disabilities and the continuing domination by the acute health sector over social care in the allocation of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0952076712440005">Heenan and Birrell, 2009</xref>). Despite evidence of the need for substantially greater investment in mental health and disability services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0952076712440005">Bamford, 2007)</xref>, funding bears little relevance to actual levels of need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0952076712440005">Gray and Horgan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0952076712440005">Appelby, 2011</xref>). The structural integration of health and social care remains the most distinctive feature of the health system in comparison to the rest of the UK.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0952076712440005"><title>Commissioner–provider structure</title>
<p>After the restructuring in Northern Ireland, a stronger commissioning–provider division was set up. This outcome reflected a convoluted policy-making process. Prior to the Review of Public Administration, four area health and social service boards had, in a limited way, acted as commissioning boards for the delivery trusts, but in practice had largely allocated funding to the trusts covering their geographic areas. The Review of Public Administration had rejected a commissioner/provider split or a competitive structure and called for a collaborative and cooperative approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0952076712440005">RPA, 2003</xref>: 5, 64). A different review into the resources and efficiency of health and social services at this time proposed a clear separation between commissioner and provider bodies, arguing that this would sharpen incentives and performance (Appleby, 2005). This analysis was based on inefficiencies in hospital use of resources in Northern Ireland compared to England, even though recommendations on structures fell outside the terms of reference of the Appleby review. The basis of the Appleby recommendation was accepted by the Northern Ireland Office Ministers in 2006 over the RPA team recommendation of a more collaborative approach. The structure that emerged consisted of a single pan-commissioning body for the whole of Northern Ireland, with five provider trusts. The pan–Northern Ireland body would be advised by five local commissioning bodies, which would be non-statutory bodies with a membership mainly representing professional interests.</p>
<p>What is also different in Northern Ireland is the way in which the commissioning structure applies to both health and social care. In the case of social care there is double commissioning, since health and social care trusts can also commission services (e.g. domiciliary services from the independent sector). The planned commissioning–provider model was very different from Scotland, where shortly after devolution quasi-market aspects of the health system were abolished. Whilst the Northern Ireland system could be seen as similar to England, in practice it was different on the health side as, once the new system became operative, there was no real competitive commissioning. The centralised Health and Social Care Board has functioned as a body allocating and planning funding to each of the five trusts and has other roles in monitoring performance. In 2008 the Welsh Assembly Government made the decision to end the commissioner/provider structure between boards and trusts for health. One argument for this change in Wales was that in practice health boards commissioned services from the local trust with little involvement or consideration of alternative providers and, in reality, no market choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0952076712440005">Welsh Assembly Government, 2008</xref>). This is clearly a criticism that could be applied to the attempt in Northern Ireland to set up a commissioner/provider structure, the new structure has remained in place.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0952076712440005"><title>Dominance of quangos</title>
<p>All decision making and delivery structures for health and social care in Northern Ireland, other than the responsibilities of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, have been given to quangos, with a board membership appointed by the minister. There is a long tradition in Northern Ireland of governance by quango and the extent to which the health and social services are run by quangos in Northern Ireland is greater than elsewhere in the UK. Governance by quango was a feature of British Rule in Ireland in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. In Northern Ireland in the immediate post war period, the welfare state saw the establishment of new quangos – including the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority, which was responsible for virtually all aspects of health care. The high level of autonomy enjoyed by this body reflected the desire of the Stormont government to have public services at arms length from government. With the increase in political and civil unrest in the early 1970s and the introduction of Direct Rule in 1972 the use of quangos was extended, largely on the basis that it was desirable to remove the administration of public services from the political arena to avoid political and sectarian influences. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0952076712440005">Connolly (1990)</xref> notes, some people also argued that it provided an opportunity to build greater expertise into the policy-making process through the appointments system. Under a major review of local government in 1970 (the Macrory Review) appointed boards were favoured, in part at least, because of dissatisfaction among civil servants with the performance of elected members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0952076712440005">Mackintosh, 1971</xref>).</p>
<p>Although Northern Ireland was not unique in attempting to manage public policy in this way, the approach went further than anywhere else in the UK. Given that during the years of Direct Rule Northern Ireland had no regional government and weak local government, this resulted in problems relating to accountability, remoteness from users and representativeness. While the quango was a potentially more democratic mechanism in a divided society where there was concern about the impact of sectarianism on policy making and service delivery, their continued dominance in areas such as health and social care is more questionable.</p>
<p>Despite the introduction of devolution in 1998, the strategic planning and day-to-day running of health and social services in Northern Ireland continues to be in the hands of quangos. These are now fairly small bodies with a restricted membership, comprising mainly professional representatives with no nominees and only one or two ‘lay members’. The most recent restructuring of health and social care in Northern Ireland also brought into existence four key centralised quangos, with responsibilities for public health, business services, commissioning and performance and client and patient involvement.</p>
<p>The size of the delivery trusts also differs from Britain, with several having populations close to 400,000, and thus are among the largest health-related bodies in the UK – potentially increasing problems of remoteness of users from those who run services. This structure differs from England in leaving hospitals without a separate or specialist board or management structure, although it is closer to the model in Scotland and Wales. These developments suggest that Northern Ireland has continued to move in a different direction in terms of structures and the composition of bodies responsible for health. While Northern Ireland has favoured technocratic bodies, Scotland has moved to introduce legislation for partially directly elected health boards in an effort to improve public involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0952076712440005">Scottish Government, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0952076712440005"><title>Absence of localism</title>
<p>As noted earlier, Northern Ireland’s history of a weak and minimal system of local government and prolonged period of Direct Rule from Westminster (1972–1998) allowed for a high degree of centralisation and an extension of the scope of quangos. This contributed to an absence of localism in Health and Social Service structures, most obvious in the total lack of any role for local government in the delivery of health or social care or in scrutiny or monitoring. This contrasts of course with the major responsibilities of local councils for social care in Britain and with the health care overseeing and scrutiny role of local councils in England. However, the reasons for lack of localism extend beyond the legacy of Direct Rule. Whereas a significant rationale for devolution in Scotland and Wales was to achieve locally based policy making, in Northern Ireland devolution was more about addressing constitutional issues. The public sector reform agenda in England, in terms of emphasising localism and decentralisation, has attracted little policy attention in Northern Ireland. Nor has Northern Ireland drawn on the Scottish and Welsh experience of the operation of local government and local partnership working under devolution. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0952076712440005">Birrell (2010)</xref> points to a distinctive model of public sector modernisation in Northern Ireland and the range of factors contributing to this, which he identifies as rooted in a conservative tradition and distrust between politicians, administrators, professionals and local communities. This has led in essence to a commitment in Northern Ireland to centralisation rather than to decentralisation, thereby continuing the legacy of a democratic deficit.</p>
<p>Commitments, in the government narratives in Northern Ireland on the Review of Public Administration and on local government reform to the creation of strong and dynamic local government, have not resulted in a major increase in functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0952076712440005">Knox, 2010</xref>), nor any new role for local government within health and social care. The only developments in health provision that have involved some limited partnership working with local government are in the area of public health. Some local authorities have employed ‘Investing for Health’ officers to work at a local level and cross-sectorally on population health goals prioritised in the Northern Ireland public health strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0952076712440005">DHSSPS, 2002</xref>). Potential or opportunity for enhancing localism or strengthening local accountability within the health and social care system is weak, given the fact there is no localised structure below the five large delivery quangos. Again, this indicates divergence rather than policy copying. Scotland has had a system of formal community health partnerships operational below the fourteen health boards. England has had local and small primary trusts with the planned introduction of even smaller GP consortiums to replace primary care trusts. The decision in Northern Ireland to opt for a minimalist structure may result in distancing from the local population and local community organisations from remote and largely anonymous policy makers. The question arises if Northern Ireland has moved to too sparse a structure for the very wide and comprehensive range of health, social care and child protection services that Trusts are responsible for. Overall the structure, with its more centralised provision, does not meet one of the original principles of the Review of Public Administration – the principle of subsidiarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0952076712440005">RPA, 2006a</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec8-0952076712440005"><title>Public involvement</title>
<p>A very clear difference in the new structures in Northern Ireland compared to Great Britain is the very limited arrangements for public participation. The main mechanism is a single Patient and Client Council, covering the whole of Northern Ireland. The model chosen for this body is again that of a centralised quango with an appointed board. It is not apparent how one centralised body can be responsive to local issues, represent the views of the public, or ensure that decisions are patient centred or reflect public views. The council covers adult and children’s social care as well as all health services. In practice the single council replaced a somewhat more participative system of four area-based health and community councils, which had a wide interest-based membership and had more extensive powers than the new council, including the right to visit premises. The new limited structure stands in contrast to developments in England, where there has been a continuous shift away from a paternalist model of decision making towards a model where citizens have a say in how services are designed, developed and delivered. In 2006 the government paper for England, ‘Our Health, Our Care, Our Say’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0952076712440005">DOH, 2006</xref>), led to a review of existing public and patient involvement initiatives and proposed new local involvement networks for health and social care, both for commissioning and provision. These Local Involvement Networks (LINks) cover all health and social care services except children’s social services and have wide-ranging responsibilities, including making recommendations about services, powers of inspection and ability to refer issues to the local council health overview and scrutiny committees. The coalition government has confirmed a legal duty of patient and public involvement and has proposed replacing LINks with local Health Watch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0952076712440005">DOH, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In Wales, participation is built into the management of services in setting service priorities, shaping improvements to services and considering how services should be delivered. Twenty-two community health councils, coterminous with local councils, have an important role in cooperative working arrangements between health and social care, as well as representing the views of patients and the local community. Several initiatives have also been taken in Scotland. In addition to the scheme for direct election to health boards, a Scottish Health Council has been set up to promote greater public involvement through advice and training for community health partnerships and other bodies. There has been some recognition of defects with the one Patient and Client Council model in Northern Ireland, as indicated by the establishment of a local advisory committee in each trust area, but yet again using an appointed quango model. They also have very limited powers and responsibilities and their remit is restricted to advising the Council on issues in the local area. The five Trusts in Northern Ireland have also developed user-involvement schemes, but these are largely consultative and are often focused on trying to link public involvement to the different concept of community development. Overall, it is difficult to support the view that has been expressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0952076712440005">Campbell (2007)</xref> that the NHS in Northern Ireland is noteworthy for the degree of public participation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0952076712440005"><title>Public health structures</title>
<p>Part of the NHS restructuring in Northern Ireland involved the creation of a regional agency for public health and social well-being in 2009 – the Public Health Agency. This extended the role of an existing health promotion agency and covers health protection, health improvements, public health support for commissioning and policy development, tackling the causes of poor health and addressing health inequalities. It also however has responsibility for health and social care research and development, and has Nursing and Allied Health Professions and Operations directorates. The model used is again that of a single centralised quango. The Public Health Agency has offices in each of the five Trust areas, and each Trust has an improving well-being remit, but the structural relationship between the agency and the Trusts is rather unclear. While Scotland and Wales have a similar centralised quango, these have a clear link to aspects of public health delivered by local boards. Wales introduced restructuring proposals in 2009 for the unification of public health through a national public health service for Wales. Public Health Wales has health protection and health care improvement responsibilities and conducts research. It also provides each health board and its director of public health with specialist public health support. Scotland also has a centralised board, NHS Health Scotland, with a health improvement role and a remit to tackle health inequalities. It works with local NHS boards and other bodies to implement public health improvements and a Public Health Act and (2008) prescribed public health functions for health boards and local authorities. Both Scotland and Wales have established public health observatories. In England the White Paper ‘Healthy Lives, Healthy People’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0952076712440005">DOH, 2010</xref>) proposed the establishment of a centralised body for public health – ‘Public Health England’, which would be part of the Department of Health. The White Paper envisages a strong role for local government stating that it ‘will be at the heart of the new public health system’ (p. 53). In Northern Ireland the absence of a clear structural relationship with local government is a major difference. While the Public Health Agency has a remit to ‘create better inter-sectoral working, including enhanced partnership arrangements with local government’, the mechanism through which this should happen has not been elaborated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.publichealth.hscni.net/about-us">http://www.publichealth.hscni.net/about-us</ext-link>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0952076712440005"><title>Regulation and inspection</title>
<p>Structures for regulation and inspection do not differ so much between the four countries. The major difference lies in linkages with social care. Northern Ireland moved in the restructuring to a single body, a Regulation and Improvement Authority that covers health and social care. This is not dissimilar to England, which also introduced an integrated Care Quality Commission covering health and social care, but not children’s services as in Northern Ireland. Scotland and Wales have separate structures for health and social care inspection. In Wales, Healthcare Inspectorate Wales has given particular importance to the voice of patients and the public. Both the English and Welsh bodies also took over the role of the Mental Health Commission. A review of the Mental Health Commission in Northern Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0952076712440005">Review of Mental Health Commission Working Group, 2005</xref>) recommended that the Commission should become an integral arm of the Regulation and Improvement Authority, and in April 2009 the functions of the Mental Health Commission (MHC) transferred to the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (RQIA).</p>

<sec id="sec11-0952076712440005" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Having compared eight main aspects of the restructured NHS in Northern Ireland, it is possible to identify the main structural differences and offer reasons for these. Northern Ireland is unique in having complete structural integration of health and social care. This embodies the structural integration of all health services, which is in contrast to England, although similar to Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland is also similar to England and different from Scotland and Wales in formally having a complete commissioner–provider structural divide, but in practice this does not work as a true commissioning system and has similarities to the Scottish and Welsh allocation system. While the use of quangos is to be found in NHS structures in England, Scotland and Wales, there has been a stronger reliance on the quango model for all aspects of the organisation of health and social care in Northern Ireland. Despite the overall small size of Northern Ireland, health bodies are highly centralised or, in the case of Trusts, cater for much larger populations than health bodies in Great Britain, reflecting a rejection of a commitment to localism. Compared to England, Scotland and Wales there has been little development of structures for public and user involvement. The structures for public health are not so dissimilar but there is again in Northern Ireland reliance on a centralised quango with less of a role for local government. The main mechanism for regulation and inspection has more similarity with England than with Scotland or Wales.</p>
<p>This comparison has also made it possible to identify the extent of policy copying. The main policy copying acknowledged in Northern Ireland Government narratives has been the commissioner/provider divide, although this has also applied to social care. Northern Ireland Departmental and Health and Social Care Board documents have not subsequently discussed how well this has worked or its suitability for Northern Ireland. The original policy copying from England came through the Appleby report (2005), but a further Appleby review (2011) made little comment on the issue, noting that the most appropriate structures need further investigation. Policy copying from Scotland and Wales has not really taken place and there is a lack of reference to Scotland and Wales in Northern Ireland government narratives or in commissioned consultancy reports. Thus little attention has been paid to lessons from small country governance, local responsiveness, or systems based on such values as co-production and cooperation, or the compatibility of devolved government departments with centralised quangos.</p>
<p>Given the range of important structural differences and the limits of policy copying, the question arises of what explanations can be given for the different directions and structures evident in Northern Ireland. A number of reasons can be suggested to explain why bodies developed differently in Northern Ireland and why policy copying has been limited. Firstly, during the years of Direct Rule government, the Department of Health and Social Services, through its management executive, was the dominant force in decision making and the strategic planning of health services, mostly imposing policies devised in London and allowing area boards limited scope to develop innovative policies. Post devolution, this continues to be evident in what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0952076712440005">Greer (2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0952076712440005">2007)</xref> identifies as the dominance of managerialism, the prevailing ethos of administrative conservatism with limited input from professional elites (as in Scotland), local government (as in Wales), or a commitment to market values (as in England), plus inter-sectoral focus on partnership and collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0952076712440005">Maslin-Prothero et al., 2008</xref>). Secondly, there is little evidence of professional health groups exerting influence; for example, the evidence from professional bodies in the RPA consultation had shown considerable support for the proposal to bring commissioning and delivery together structurally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0952076712440005">RPA, 2006b</xref>). Thirdly is the continuing support for centralised and large quangos as a favoured form of public administration rather than a commitment to localism, local responsiveness, accountability and involvement. This is, in significant part, due to the system of weak local government in Northern Ireland and the failure since devolution to fundamentally reform local government structures and increase capacity for greater involvement in health and social care. There are some historic reasons for the reluctance of senior civil servants and professionals to trust a greater involvement of local politicians, but there has been almost no articulation in departmental narratives of the rationale for structures to allow more public involvement. This contrasts sharply with the citizen agenda in Wales, the ideas of mutualism and co-production in Scotland, and the high profile of patient involvement in health and user participation in social care in England. The health minister’s assertion that ‘we must have a patient-led service’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0952076712440005">McGimpsey, 2007</xref>: n.p.) is hardly exemplified in the structures. Fourthly, there has been a slow response to the modernisation agenda developed over some years in Great Britain in such topics as personalisation and individual budgets. This reflects a general problem in Northern Ireland governance concerning failure to develop and agree on underlying principles and values that should underpin structural reform in health and social care, and lack of policy-making capacity and knowledge, which has resulted in little learning from modernisation of delivery agendas in Scotland, Wales and England. Rather, the tendency has been reliance on management consultant reports that focus on efficiency interpretations. A recent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0952076712440005">MacKinsey report (2011)</xref>, ‘Reshaping the System’, makes no reference to comparisons with Scotland and Wales and says little about the potential of greater use of the distinctive integrated structure in Northern Ireland. It appears unlikely that any further major restructuring of the NHS in Northern Ireland will take place in the immediate future or that there will be any policy transfer of the proposed GP consortium system in England. Northern Ireland is likely to continue with a range of distinctive organisational features and operate as a clear fourth model of NHS structures in the United Kingdom.</p>
