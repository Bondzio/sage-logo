<abstract>
<p>This paper describes how the Netmums social network has been used over recent years as a source of research and discusses whether this type of research has the potential to influence policy. Online social networks are a new phenomenon, but as they have increased in scale their potential to reflect the interests and experiences of real communities is starting to be recognised.</p>
<p>While there is significant awareness of the ways in which social networks have recently been able to further democratic processes, there has been less focus on the opportunities that they provide to change local services and government policies. The research opportunities available through the Netmums social network are diverse and the website provides access to a rich resource, but there are a number of limitations to the research that can be conducted. As yet there is little evidence to demonstrate the influence that research based on the network might have, but a comparison of research methods shows that, despite these limitations, the use of communities such as Netmums should provide researchers and policy makers with cost-effective and powerful tools of influence in the future.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1744987111432230"><title>Background to Netmums</title>
<p>The first Netmums local website was built in 2000 as a response to the founders’ personal experience of motherhood. When a woman becomes a mother, she has a need for information and support on issues of parenthood, but more than that she also becomes more aware of and focussed on the local area in which she lives, requiring information on local baby groups and activities, childcare, support services, pre-schools and local events, for example. To feel part of a community, she also needs friends to spend time and share experiences with.</p>
<p>Traditionally, local information was passed on by word of mouth. However, with a more mobile, fragmented society a new mother can take months or years to become integrated with other mums in the local community. Netmums, now one of a number of social networking sites for mums, each with its unique characteristics, has fulfilled the need for an alternative community for mothers and has grown from a single site covering the founders’ home town of Harrow to 150 local sites covering the whole of the UK, linked through a central website.</p>
<p>The desire to provide support to families has led, in the past few years, to the development of support services to help people who have questions or who are in distress. For example, a team of health visitors operate an online drop-in clinic that is open during evenings and weekends, there are relationship clinics, parenting courses (run with Family Links) and mental health support. Many of these support services are provided thanks to a grant from the Department for Education, England.</p>
<p>It is the focus on both local information, and on support, that has made the site attractive and as a result it is now the largest parenting site in the UK, with traffic increasing ten-fold in the past few years. The site is used mostly by mums, but is inclusive and supports dads, grandparents, carers and is used by professionals. The site has over 1 million registered members and more than 4 million visits each month. From October 2010 to the end of September 2011 the site recorded 19 million visitors and pages were viewed 296 million times.</p>
<p>Importantly, the site is attractive to a broad cross-section of society. A recent survey of 4500 members (Netmums, unpublished data) showed that 19% of users had household incomes of less than £15,000, with a further 10% between £15,000 and £20,000. The community clearly has the potential to act as a rich sample for researchers and this paper discusses some of the research that has been undertaken using the site, including both the opportunities and limitations of using an online community for research.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1744987111432230"><title>The power of social networking</title>
<p>Online communities such as Netmums are of considerable interest to professionals and academics from different disciplines. For example, as an internet phenomenon, social networks and the power that they have are the subjects of study by e-democracy specialists. Others are interested in the role that this particular community can have in developing policy and services that are helpful to families.</p>
<p>The term social networking had not even been applied to online communities when Netmums was set up (Netmums, 2003). It was just a few years ago that the incredible political force of large numbers of people being able to interact online came to prominence when Obama swept to power on the back of an organised e movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111432230">Aaker and Chang, 2010</xref>). At home, a similar use of technology has been given as one of the reasons for the recent landslide victory of the Scottish National Party in the May 2011 elections. The connecting of people through mobile technology has also contributed to the revolutions that swept through Tunisia and then onward in the ‘Arab Spring’, and closer to home the August riots in England.</p>
<p>This ability of people to connect with each other, to organise themselves and publish information for the world to see is transforming the big picture at moments in time, but effects on day-to-day governance are more difficult to pick out.</p>
<fig id="fig1-1744987111432230" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1744987111432230-img1.tif"/></fig>
<p>The relevance of online communities is increasingly being understood by many commercial companies, by some policy makers and by a few service providers. Of course, a community such as Netmums is more likely to influence family policy than be instrumental in a change of government, but is influencing family policy even possible?</p>
<p>There are a number of trends in the ‘real’ world of family life and the local services that shape the day-to-day experiences of parents. Many families in the UK have been affected by a stagnation in wages amongst those on lower to middle incomes (a phenomenon also seen in a significant number of other countries), with the recent economic difficulties creating added pressures. Financial pressures are a key reason for the increase in women returning to work when their children are very young, and family policies have supported this through a focus on providing support for employees through extended maternity leave, increases in paternity leave and rights and the right to request flexible working arrangements from employers.</p>
<p>In the UK there have been changes in local services with reductions in numbers of health visitors in some areas, but at the same time, significant investment in new Sure Start Children's Centres. In addition, there is now provision of free universal early years’ education for pre-school children and increased support for specific groups who are considered most likely to be vulnerable. But how effective are these policies for families? Conducting research through an online community such as Netmums might prove an effective way of finding out.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1744987111432230"><title>Online research methods</title>
<p>Netmums is a dynamic and rich research resource, providing insights into the lives and opinions of individuals and qualitative and quantitative data about communities, including selected groups within communities.</p>
<p>Within a social network such as Netmums, there are a range of methods available for investigating the views and behaviours of parents. While the site can be used to identify candidates for local and national focus groups, the real benefits come from the scale and speed of data collection that can be achieved online. Large amounts of data can be gathered in very short periods of time through surveys and polls, and through the analysis of data collected in the running of the site. More qualitative data is available through analysis of forum discussions, requested comments and specific web chats around a set of questions.</p>
<p>Clearly though, there are some critical limitations to the use of Netmums as a research resource to generate research samples, the major of these being the usually self-selected nature of the sample. Indeed, this type of research is more akin to ‘market research’ and so should be distinguished from more rigorous academic types of studies.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1744987111432230"><title>Limitations of online research</title>
<p>It can be argued that most research conducted through social networks has limitations. The main limitations of online surveys and forum discussions are that individuals are self-selecting, the research only reflects the views of the audience who are online and the research is not sufficiently robust or in depth.</p>
<p>These limitations must be acknowledged and where possible addressed. The one-off surveys that are conducted are indeed self-selecting, which means that they are only bringing in the views of, firstly, those who are members of the Netmums site and, secondly, those who choose to answer the survey or post on the forum.</p>
<p>In addition, the site can only reflect the views of those who are online, and it may be that those who are not online have a different view. This, too, is true, although it should also be recognised that these days it is a diminishing problem and the digital divide is not the same as a social divide, with many of those on lower incomes now being online. Finally, the level of detail that can be gleaned from a participant is generally quite limited.</p>
<p>Some of these limitations might be in part mitigated against if the research were submitted for research funding, through a credible research funding body, or for publication in a research journal, when it would be submitted to a rigorous process of peer review. As the possibilities from online research become more apparent, more may be put through such quality assurance processes.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1744987111432230"><title>Netmums research</title>
<sec id="sec6-1744987111432230"><title>Online surveys and polls</title>
<p>Single-question polls or multiple-question online surveys are now commonly used to seek the views of relatively large numbers of people. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987111432230">Table 1</xref> shows, Netmums regularly receives over 4000 responses to surveys, most of which only remain online for 1–2 weeks. Surveys are used for different purposes, but even the more specialist academic-led surveys tend to be written in relatively informal language and restricted to around 30 questions. They will usually include a number of demographic questions, such as age, marital status and household income, so that results can be analysed to check whether there are variations between different groups.

<p>To date such surveys conducted by Netmums have not been subjected to statistical tests of significance and the like, but instead are recognised to be snapshot surveys designed to gather a range of views and help identify broad trends through the generation of percentages, rather than opportunities for conducting examples of rigorous scientific or social research as reported in peer reviewed journals.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1744987111432230"><title>Forum analysis</title>
<p>Forum discussions are a rich source of qualitative data. The Netmums Coffee House Forum comprises thousands upon thousands of discussions, and these can be searched to draw together the most common views on particular topics. This can work especially well when identifying a range of opinions on quite disparate topics. One example of this was the recent contribution by Netmums to the Bailey Review, ‘Letting Children Be Children’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111432230">Bailey, 2011</xref>) on the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood.</p>
<p>Forum discussions can also be led by Netmums staff or invited guests and, in a similar way to a focus group, they encourage members to express their views on particular questions. Recent discussions in the past few months have been led by a number of Ministers and MPs, including Anne Milton, MP, Public Health Minister, Frank Field, MP, and Maria Miller, Minister at the Department for Work and Pensions.</p>
<p>It is usual to receive 100 or so responses and for the discussion to be viewed several thousand times. A clustering analysis is then undertaken to identify particular themes and to help the guest address the points raised when they come online to respond. Such consultative exercises are helpful in identifying the concerns and opinions of members of the community. Although the process is less systematic than a survey, it has the advantage of attracting a larger range of views than is possible from a focus group. Of course, politicians find this type of consultation, effectively a type of market research, especially attractive, because they are also able to respond with their own views and explain their proposals, so use the discussion as a conversation.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1744987111432230"><title>Analytical research</title>
<p>More in-depth work involving analysis of data is needed for the internal evaluation of some of the support services run by Netmums. For example, a ‘cases system’ enables Parent Supporter staff to record all interventions and simple counting of the numbers of people presenting with different issues gives an insight into the needs of the community for policy makers and service developers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, detailed research in the form of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with those signing up for a recent cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) course. This very much more in-depth type of research was an academic-led experiment with treatment and control groups, and thorough analysis of the effects of the course.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1744987111432230" sec-type="cases"><title>Case studies</title>
<p>The following provide examples of research conducted on Netmums.</p>
<sec id="sec10-1744987111432230"><title>Campaigning for change: Food labelling</title>
<p>In 2003 the Food Standards Agency (FSA) published a consultation on reducing the advertising of unhealthy food to children. Netmums invited its members to sign a petition supporting their work and 3000 did so. That was remarkable given that at the time Netmums only had 30,000 members, and the Board of the FSA were delighted to hear from an organisation that represented parents’ views. It was the start of some on-going work that led a few years later to a survey of members on their preferences for the Traffic Light or Guideline Daily Allowance (GDA) food labelling schemes. The survey received an enormous response, with just over 17,000 parents completing it (Netmums, 2007). A range of questions explored their ability to understand the labels and the ways in which they might affect their choices when shopping, but the headline was that 80% preferred the Traffic Light scheme. The results have been used in discussions, not only within the FSA, but have been presented in both the UK and European parliaments as providing strong evidence of the public’s view.</p>
<p>Whilst surveys of this nature can be accused of being self-selecting, such a clear trend based on so many responses is very credible to policy makers, who so often rely on market research where those taking part could also be accused of being a self-selected group.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1744987111432230"><title>Health visiting</title>
<p>Concerns about diminishing support for mothers with postnatal depression demonstrated the need for professionals who have contact with mothers when their children are very young. A survey in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111432230">Netmums, 2006</xref>) showed that increasingly parents were less inclined to call on their health visitor than previously. The predominant reason was that they felt that the professional was ‘too busy’, and a detailed analysis of the comments from mothers backed up these initial conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111432230">Russell and Drennan, 2007</xref>). Indeed, health visitors were getting busier as their numbers were decreasing across many areas of the country, with the preventative service being seen as a soft target for cuts.</p>
<p>In many areas, the shortfall was dealt with by the setting up of teams, with some lower-grade staff taking on part of the health visitor role, so in 2008 Netmums looked at the effect of this change in structure. Of those surveyed, 70% said that they valued the one-to-one relationship and the consistency of advice they received from having a single point of contact, and preferred that to having the variety of skills available from a team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111432230">Netmums, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In the following year, a further survey showed that where a mother did not have a good relationship with a single health visitor, she would be more likely to visit a GP as a first port of call on child-related issues, overall a more expensive option for the health service (Netmums, unpublished data). The results were presented at a Department of Health meeting of stakeholders on the future of health visiting.</p>
<p>These three surveys gave a clear indication that mothers valued their health visitors and that the changes in the service were having negative consequences for families. They provided a contribution to the development of a new policy on health visiting, which is seeing a recruitment of professionals in areas where numbers are currently too low.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1744987111432230"><title>Cognitive behavioural therapy: A randomised controlled trial</title>
<p>Following on from the success of emailed courses that were designed by Netmums to change behaviour to help participants improve their happiness, family’s eating and parenting, a course was developed with researchers at the University of Exeter to provide CBT for mothers with postnatal depression. The course comprised 11 emailed sessions, which included psychoeducation about postnatal depression, specific cognitive and behavioural skills associated with improving postnatal mood and practical therapy exercises to carry out. Participants were able to share their experiences in an online private forum, and had access to health visitors via an online clinic if it was needed.</p>
<p>The results of this trial, which involved 910 women, indicated an online delivery of CBT for postnatal depression is effective in improving depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987111432230">O’Mahen et al., 2010</xref>; O’Mahen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111432230">submitted</xref>). Providing therapy in this way was shown to be helpful to women with moderate and severe depression, and it was attractive to individuals who find it difficult to access traditional services (for example, those who are anxious or have high levels of stigma). One of the limitations was that the lack of personal contact meant the attrition rate was higher than for other types of counselling, so further research looking at ways to reduce the attrition rate is now starting.</p>
<p>This pioneering study has already led to new service insights into the ways in which computer-based interventions can make a significant contribution to the well-being of individuals and illustrated the way in which RCTs can be done even within online communities.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1744987111432230" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The data collected through Netmums is very interesting, but an important aim for the organisation is to provide a voice on issues that leads to improvements in the quality of life for individuals, particularly children and families. So a key question is whether research that accesses parents via the Netmums community can help to achieve change.</p>
<p>E-democracy is concerned with the use of information and communication technologies and strategies in political and governance processes. However, this is quite a narrow subset of how action and research can influence government and the services they (and others) provide.</p>
<p>Three potential routes for any source of research to influence are:
<list id="list2-1744987111432230" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>political insight – recognition of the relative value placed on aspects of life and different initiatives by different groups;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>policy development – more analytical determination of needs and framing of solutions;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>service development – shaping of the services experienced by individuals within communities.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Providing new insights on issues in a way that influences politicians has the potential to create the most profound changes, but identifying how particular campaigns or activities build a new understanding of the importance of issues is difficult to demonstrate, and indeed the research from just one source, such as Netmums, is unlikely to make any significant change on its own.</p>
<p>At the policy level, when policy makers are looking at reform in specific areas, influence is more likely to occur. Providing views on the effectiveness of current initiatives, such as Children’s Centres and early years’ education and care, can make some degree of difference, although it is again difficult to prove. Policy changes may result from widespread disaffection with the current state of services (as has recently been the case with financial support for childcare), but at the heart of policy making there is, rightly, a reliance on detailed analysis of rigorous research: an evidence-based approach.</p>
<p>The most likely opportunity to make changes is seen at the most detailed level of service development. It is at this level that results from consultations and studies can really count, particularly studies that adopt a robust scientific approach, as shown in the example of the development of the CBT course.</p>
<p>While social media provides something more akin to insight rather than robust findings from rigorous research, it is also true that even the best social or scientific research may have limitations and often does not influence policy makers in the way the researchers would like. Researchers can be frustrated that, firstly, their results do not carry sufficient weight, as political forces have more impact on the policy-making process and, secondly, that their results can take a long time to be published and disseminated. Indeed, policy makers also find that even academic research can be misleading because of sampling difficulties, and so increasingly look to meta-analysis of a large number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111432230">Hunter and Schmidt, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The observation can therefore be made that the limitations in the purity of the Netmums research do not matter, as they are made up for in other respects. Having carefully conducted studies enables Netmums to provide an authoritative view, even though the research is not gold standard. It also helps that many studies are designed in partnership with the organisations that are interested in the results, such as the Royal College of Midwives and the charity 4Children. The real reason they are useful is that they are condensing the voices of very large numbers of people. The scale of the consumer involvement means that policy makers are compelled to take note. In addition, grass-roots realism means that the results are often also of interest to the media, who like to include a real-world view in any policy debates. Hence, Netmums’ research has the potential to be very influential as it is so quickly disseminated in the media, unlike academic research, which has to go through the peer review process to publication.</p>
<p>There is increasing recognition that market research undertaken in the public interest can inform public debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987111432230">Mayo, 2010</xref>). The string of policy makers looking to the Netmums site for information suggests that this is the case, but as a hypothesis it is difficult to test and there are few clear results to date. For example, whilst the Department of Health acknowledged the work of Netmums in promoting the need for more health visitors, in reality the policy was identified by the Conservatives in opposition with Netmums as one voice amongst many, and it was the Conservatives’ drive that saw the recruitment policy become a reality.</p>
<p>There is a final hurdle that makes it difficult to effect change. As acknowledged earlier in this paper, policy makers talk about the importance of public participation and stakeholder engagement, but find it challenging to use effectively. The policy cycle still tends to start with collating evidence from experts and developing new theoretical models where solutions are proposed for the needs identified, and are then consulted upon. By the time the public are invited to comment, the policy is already at an advanced stage and there are few opportunities to make amendments.</p>
<p>In this instance, it can be difficult to separate out whether the consultation is about public relations or there is a genuine opportunity for policy development.</p>
<p>In some sectors, there have been attempts to use the power of lots of voices to identify and develop new ideas, termed ‘crowd sourcing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987111432230">Brabham, 2008</xref>) Crowd sourcing is to some extent an enormous brainstorming exercise where the wisdom of the crowd, or large numbers of people, are pooled and worked to enable ideas to be generated and developed in a way that even the top experts cannot. Although a useful method, there is still a way to go before those interested in family policy and focussed on the importance of the evidence-based approach attempt to use it in their work.</p>
<p>Trying to get the voices of parents into family policy at an earlier stage has proved difficult, with concerns about the prevalence of postnatal depression being one example, but in some cases it is starting to happen to a limited degree. For example, a survey and a forum discussion with Dame Clare Tickell were both conducted early enough for them to be helpful in her review of the Early Years Foundation Stage.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-1744987111432230" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The use of online communities as a source of data for research, including research to inform policy development, has developed significantly over the past decade. In the case of Netmums, early work revolved around the founders of the site taking a lead on issues that they perceived as of concern to members, and conducting surveys to identify views to take them to policy makers. In the past couple of years, policy makers have come to recognise the value of such input and will often come to Netmums to look for information. Academics are also becoming increasingly interested in the research potential of the Netmums site.</p>
<p>This change is welcome, but there remain limitations in the way in which it can be used at the moment. While the use of data from Netmums swings rather counter to the national drive to base policy solely on evidence from controlled trials, the numbers of people involved and the richness of the data collected through Netmums mean that the information should be expected to have some influence.</p>
<p>At this stage it is impossible to quantify that influence, but in continuing to speak out for those who are struggling and to give a balanced view on the experiences of families in their everyday lives and their relationships with public services, Netmums is in a privileged position. It allows the voices of women, who so often feel individually disempowered, to be listened to.</p>
<p>It may be that Netmums will have the greatest influence through providing an input into a large number of other people’s research projects; research is currently being conducted by a wide variety of organisations using the Netmums site. Indeed, Netmums receives requests on an almost daily basis to help academics, professional institutions and charities by encouraging participation in surveys. Recent requests have included projects being undertaken by the General Medical Council on safeguarding and Save the Children on childcare.</p>
<p>Clearly, many value Netmums for its potential to conduct research. If the limitations of this research are acknowledged, it is a rich, cheap and quick source of data providing a window into the behaviours and views of its participants. It is to be hoped that through these new alliances, the needs of families will be better understood, and services constructed to make a positive difference to their lives.</p></sec>
