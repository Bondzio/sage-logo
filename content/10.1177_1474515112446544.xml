<sec id="section1-1474515112446544">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>To reduce mortality and morbidity associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), individuals who experience ACS symptoms should seek treatment promptly. However, for this to be possible, they must adopt appropriate attitudes and beliefs about ACS symptoms and have the prerequisite knowledge to respond to those symptoms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1474515112446544">
<title>Aim:</title>
<p>This paper details the results of a cross-sectional Irish study that measured knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about ACS in patients diagnosed with ACS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1474515112446544">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A total of 1947 patients were enrolled in the study. Recruitment took place across five academic teaching hospitals in Dublin, Ireland. Knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about ACS were measured using the ACS Response Index questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1474515112446544">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Almost half the patients (<italic>n</italic>=49.5%) demonstrated high knowledge levels (i.e. &gt;70% of correct answers) about ACS symptoms. The majority recognized chest pain/pressure (98.9%) and left arm pain (90.2%) as symptoms. Many failed to associate jaw pain, heartburn and/or indigestion (44.7%), nausea and vomiting (47.6%), and neck pain (42.5%) with a heart attack. Higher knowledge levels were independently associated with higher levels of education (<italic>p</italic>=0.007), a history of angina (<italic>p</italic>=0.001), and attitudes (<italic>p</italic>=&lt;0.001) and beliefs (<italic>p</italic>=&lt;0.001) that are consistent with positively decisive responses to ACS symptoms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1474515112446544">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Despite having experienced an ACS event, overall knowledge levels were poor. Higher knowledge levels were associated with better attitudes and beliefs, indicating the inextricable relationship between all three components. Educational programmes should incorporate all three components so that prompt behaviour can be initiated when symptoms arise.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single most common cause of death in Europe. It is manifested primarily through a group of conditions known as acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which includes unstable angina, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and non-STEMI. CHD accounts for 1.92 million deaths in Europe annually. Over one in five women (22%) and men (21%) die from the disease. It is also the greatest claimant of lives in the European Union (EU), accounting for more than 741,000 deaths each year, where slightly more men (16%) than women (15%) die from the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112446544">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Much of the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS is related to pre-hospital delay. Despite the documented benefits of prompt symptom treatment, studies consistently report that most patients delay seeking help when experiencing ACS symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112446544">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112446544">3</xref></sup> Patient decision delay, a component of pre-hospital delay, is the length of time taken by an individual to recognize the presence of symptoms, attribute them to a condition that warrants medical attention and make the decision to seek assistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112446544">4</xref></sup> Patients often encounter difficulties with interpreting their symptoms. This contributes towards decision delay, which consumes the greatest proportion of pre-hospital delay time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112446544">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112446544">5</xref></sup> Decision delay and the problems with symptom interpretation are intrinsically influenced by the individual’s knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about ACS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112446544">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to Jensen and Moser,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112446544">6</xref></sup> knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs are independent constructs which are not well differentiated in the literature. An individual’s knowledge refers to the information and skills they acquire through education or experience. An attitude is an opinion one has, while a belief is something one accepts as true or real.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112446544">7</xref></sup> These terms in addition to perceptions are often used interchangeably in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112446544">6</xref></sup> A number of researchers have explored the public’s knowledge of ACS symptoms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112446544">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112446544"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112446544"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112446544"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112446544">12</xref></sup> yet few have specifically reported on attitudes and beliefs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112446544">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112446544"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112446544"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112446544">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>A review of the literature on knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about ACS suggest that chest pain as a symptom of ACS is relatively well known<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112446544">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112446544">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112446544">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112446544">12</xref></sup> although knowledge of other ACS symptoms is less evident.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112446544">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112446544">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112446544"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112446544">12</xref></sup> This has implications for individuals who experience those other ACS symptoms, particularly those that occur without chest pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112446544">15</xref></sup> It is vital therefore that people understand how ACS symptoms can manifest. Once this is achieved, they need to adopt the right attitude toward symptoms and believe in the supremacy of taking correct and appropriate actions.</p>
<p>The majority of research conducted on this area has been carried out in the USA, Australia, and Eastern Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112446544">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112446544"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112446544"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112446544"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112446544">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112446544">16</xref></sup> with only one study reported in Western Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112446544">13</xref></sup> As there is a correlation between ACS knowledge levels and pre-hospital delay time, it is important to ascertain what patients know about ACS symptoms, in addition to their attitudes and beliefs about responding to these symptoms. This information would facilitate the development of appropriately targeted information and education for patients. This is significant because pre-hospital delay time remains a problem in Ireland and beyond.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112446544">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112446544">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this study was: (1) to describe knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about ACS in patients who were diagnosed with ACS in Ireland; and (2) to determine sociodemographic factors, clinical factors, and attitudes and beliefs associated with knowledge.</p>

<title>Study participants and procedure</title>
<p>The data presented in this paper are baseline data which comprises part of a randomized controlled trial called the ACS Delay time Intervention Trial. The trial examined the impact of an educational intervention on knowledge attitudes and beliefs and on pre-hospital delay time in patients diagnosed with ACS. Recruitment took place in the coronary care units and cardiology wards in five teaching hospitals in Dublin, Ireland. Patients were initially screened for eligibility by nurses who worked in the hospitals. Written and verbal information about the study was provided. Patients were considered eligible if they had a diagnosis of ACS, were stable and planning for discharge, and were able to read, understand, and communicate in English. Study exclusion criteria included those who lived in an institutional setting or had serious complicating comorbidities and/or a profound learning disability.</p>
<p>The names of eligible and interested patients were passed on to the research nurses who were employed by the study to collect the data. Following informed consent, data were collected by the research nurse via face to face interview, between November 2007 and October 2009. The study conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and ethical approval was obtained from all articipating research sites.</p>

<sec id="section9-1474515112446544">
<title>Data collection instrument</title>
<p>Knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about ACS were measured using the modified ACS Response Index questionnaire. This instrument was also used in the PROMOTION study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112446544">10</xref></sup> having originally been adapted from the REACT trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112446544">19</xref></sup> Psychometric properties of the ACS Response Index questionnaire have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112446544">5</xref></sup> Using Cronbach α, the internal reliability measurements specific to this study were 0.85 (knowledge) 0.65 (attitudes), and 0.63 (beliefs). The questionnaire has three components all of which were scored separately.</p>
<p>Knowledge was measured on a dichotomous scale. From a list of 21 predefined ACS symptoms, patients were asked to correctly identify those symptoms that could be representative of a heart attack. Six decoy symptoms were included to assess and account for the possibility that persons would answer ‘yes’ to all items. Patients were also asked to respond to five additional knowledge questions (true/false). The total combined knowledge score was 26. For analysis purposes, the score was converted to percentage correct.</p>
<p>Attitudes and beliefs were measured using a 4-point Likert-type scale. The attitudes scale had five items which recorded patients’ attitudes to their ability to recognize symptoms and instigate appropriate help-seeking behaviour in themselves or someone else with ACS symptoms. Potential scores ranged from 5 to 20. The beliefs scale had seven items that recorded patients’ beliefs and subsequent intended actions in the event of a future heart attack. Potential scores ranged from 7 to 28.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1474515112446544">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data were analysed using PASW version 18. Descriptive statistics are presented as mean±SD or <italic>n</italic> (%). To compare the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of those with higher vs. lower levels of knowledge, the knowledge percentage score was divided at 70% (which was also the median) into two groups. Those below 70% were in the lower knowledge group. This cut-off point was the same as that used by Dracup et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112446544">10</xref></sup> to which we compared our findings. Characteristics were compared using <italic>t</italic>-tests or chi-squared tests, depending on the level of measurement. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine independent predictors of higher vs. lower levels of knowledge from among sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and attitudes and beliefs scores. The level of significance for statistical analysis was set at <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05.</p>

<title>Objective 1: description of knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs</title>
<p>Patients’ mean score on the Knowledge scale was 17.8±3.6 (range 7–25), which, when converted to percent is 68.3±13.8% (range 26.9–96.2%). Using the score of 70% or higher on the Knowledge scale of the ACS Response Index as a cut-off point, 964 (49.5%) patients were identified as having a higher level of knowledge about ACS symptoms. Patient characteristics were compared between the higher and lower knowledge score groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112446544">Table 1</xref>). Those who achieved higher knowledge scores had an increased incidence of higher education, a family history of heart disease and a previous history of angina or cardiac surgery. There were no differences between the higher and lower knowledge score groups in relation to age, gender, marital status, ACS diagnosis, history of myocardial infarction, history of angioplasty, current smoking status, hypercholesterolaemia, history of hypertension, or diabetes.</p>
<p>The Knowledge scale included five questions about heart disease (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1474515112446544">Table 2</xref>) and 21 questions about symptoms of ACS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1474515112446544">Table 3</xref>). Exploration of participant’s knowledge of heart disease demonstrates that only a minority of people (36.9%) realized that heart disease is the most common cause of death among women (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1474515112446544">Table 2</xref>), although more women (48.8%) than men (32.3%) correctly responded to this item (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001).</p>

<p>Exploration of participant’s knowledge of individual symptoms revealed that the majority of participants associated chest pain/pressure (98.9%) with symptoms of a heart attack (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1474515112446544">Table 3</xref>). This was followed by arm/shoulder pain (90.2%), shortness of breath (86.1%), and sweating (74.2%). There was a high incidence of failure to recognize some of the less common symptoms such as back pain (60.5%), jaw pain (50.4%), nausea and vomiting (47.7%), heartburn/indigestion/stomach problems (44.7%), or neck pain (42.5%) as heart attack symptoms. The inclusion of distracter symptoms resulted in a significant number of patients incorrectly agreeing that numbness/tingling in the arm/hand (76.1%), arm paralysis (60.1%), slurred speech (42.6%), and headache (30.2%) were heart attack symptoms.</p>
<p>The mean scores on the Attitudes and Beliefs scales of the ACS Response Index were 14.2±2.9 (range 5–20) and 27.0±3.2 (range 17–36), respectively. Most people (76.8%) were pretty sure or very sure that they would know if they themselves were having a heart attack. Yet, only 43.6% were confident that they could differentiate between a heart attack and other medical problems. Almost two-thirds (64.7%) agreed that most people having a heart attack have crushing, severe chest pain.</p>
<p>The majority (87%) were pretty sure or very sure that they could get help for themselves if they thought they were having a heart attack. Twenty per cent stated that they would be embarrassed to go to the hospital if they falsely thought they were having a heart attack, while 38.9% would prefer someone to drive them to the hospital than have an ambulance come to their home.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we examined knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about ACS in an Irish population who were diagnosed with ACS. Similar to other populations, we demonstrated that even patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of ACS had poor knowledge of ACS and many had inappropriate attitudes and beliefs. Our findings about level of knowledge in the sample are strikingly similar to that seen in a sample of cardiac patients from America, Australia, and New Zealand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112446544">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our study, while almost half of those surveyed had higher knowledge levels regarding ACS symptoms, the remaining 50% had a score of less than 70%, indicating inadequate knowledge levels. These figures are not unique to the Irish setting as other researchers reported that 44% of their participants were categorized with low ACS knowledge levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112446544">10</xref></sup> Knowledge of what is referred to as ‘typical’ ACS symptoms such as chest pain, arm pain and shortness of breath were well recognized in this Irish population. However, with regard to ‘atypical’ symptoms, knowledge levels were poor. These tend to be the symptoms that are less well publicized or less frequently reported. Although almost half of those surveyed had experienced symptoms of jaw pain, neck pain, heartburn and nausea, many failed to associate these symptoms with a heart attack. These findings about knowledge of individual ACS symptoms are consistent with previous studies where typical symptoms were readily identified, but those that were atypical went unrecognized by the majority.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112446544">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112446544"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112446544">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is known that symptom-related factors comprise more than half the reasons for pre-hospital delay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112446544">20</xref></sup> Patients who experience less-well-recognized ACS symptoms delay longer in seeking treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112446544">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112446544">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112446544"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112446544">23</xref></sup> However, it seems reasonable to suggest that it is difficult for most people to interpret less common ACS symptoms as potentially cardiac-related. As a consequence of limited symptom knowledge patients are at risk of prolonged pre-hospital delay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112446544">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112446544">25</xref></sup> This can impact negatively on the receipt of effective treatment modalities.</p>
<p>Studies that explored sources of public information about ACS identified that physicians rarely discussed symptoms of ACS with their patients or the appropriate action they should take in the presence of symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474515112446544">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1474515112446544"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474515112446544"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1474515112446544">29</xref></sup> Although education of patients and their families is considered an integral part of the health professional’s role, it has been suggested that the role of the physician is to ‘treat’ patients, not educate them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474515112446544">26</xref></sup> These data clearly suggest that physicians must either take responsibility for educating their patients or consistently delegate this responsibility to another clinician trained to educate patients, such as a nurse.</p>
<p>Participants in this study had a mean attitude score that was comparable to that of patients in another study, using the same instrument (14.2 vs. 14.5, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112446544">10</xref></sup> Conversely, our mean belief score finding of 27.0±3.2 was slightly higher than was reported elsewhere (22.75±3.3).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112446544">10</xref></sup> Our study was conducted in Europe while Dracup et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112446544">10</xref></sup> conducted their study in America, Australia, and New Zealand. Although the systems of education, healthcare service provision, and service opportunities differs between continents, findings from participants were similar, suggesting that lack of knowledge and inappropriate attitudes and beliefs about ACS and the actions to be taken in the event of symptoms are worldwide problems.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that all individuals in this study had experienced an ACS event, approximately one-quarter (23.3%) felt a lack of confidence that they would recognize if they were having a heart attack in the future. Furthermore, 56% expressed doubt in their own ability to differentiate between a heart attack and other medical problems. This finding provides insights into possible explanations for the ongoing problem of pre-hospital delay and the mortality and morbidity associated with ACS as a consequence. The findings mandate a requirement to make explicit to patients what constitutes an ACS event and how it might be recognized and managed. Such information would serve to increase knowledge, which would assist with improving attitudes through confidence building and beliefs through self-efficacy.</p>
<p>The majority of participants (93%) in this study believed that they should get to the hospital as quickly as possible if they had chest pain that lasted more than 15 minutes. While chest pain is regarded as the hallmark symptom of ACS, it is imperative that patients appreciate that acute myocardial infarction can occur without typical chest pain or discomfort or in the absence of symptoms (silent).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112446544">15</xref></sup> Those who present to hospital without chest pain ranges from one-third of participants in large cohort studies to one quarter of articipants in smaller studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112446544">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1474515112446544">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1474515112446544"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1474515112446544"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1474515112446544">33</xref></sup> Patients without chest pain commonly complain of shortness of breath, diaphoresis and nausea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1474515112446544">34</xref></sup> This again highlights the need to reinforce the message that ACS is multifaceted.</p>
<p>The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend prompt activation of the emergency medical system (EMS) by patients who have symptoms indicative of ACS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1474515112446544">35</xref></sup> In this study 38% were of the belief that they would rather have someone drive them to the hospital than have an ambulance come to their home if they thought they were having a heart attack. Prompt activation of ambulance services provides timely availability of advanced cardiac life support personnel and resuscitation resources. Both are essential for the potential treatment of cardiac arrest which can cause sudden death in patients experiencing an acute myocardial infarction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1474515112446544">36</xref></sup> Some studies have reported that ambulance users had significantly shorter median pre-hospital delay times than non-ambulance users.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1474515112446544">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1474515112446544">38</xref></sup> Yet patients in our study preferred to avoid ambulance use. This finding may originate from inadequate knowledge and the associated need to alter attitudes and beliefs, all of which are inter-dependent. One means by which this can be achieved is to eliminate myths and fears that inhibit appropriate behavior. Education is the cornerstone of this process.</p>
<p>With regard to independent predictors of knowledge, we identified that those with higher knowledge levels also had higher levels of education. This finding is echoed by Dracup et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112446544">10</xref></sup> who also identified that higher education levels were associated with higher knowledge levels about ACS. We also found that those with a history of angina, and those with more appropriate attitudes and beliefs had higher knowledge levels. Higher knowledge scores were independently associated with better attitudes and beliefs, a finding also reported by McKinley et al. (2009).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112446544">14</xref></sup> These findings suggest the inextricable relationship between all three indicators and support the relevance of providing clear information. If information is tangible, it can be translated into actions which are underpinned by attitudes and beliefs.</p>
<p>Our data should be considered by anyone planning to design an educational intervention relating to ACS. As symptom presentation cannot be predetermined, the entire spectrum of potential ACS symptoms should be included in cardiovascular education protocols. Emphasis should also be placed on symptom onset and severity and how an individual should act in the face of symptoms. Although it is essential that educational information about ACS symptoms target the general public, special attention should be paid to those at greatest risk of an ACS event.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1474515112446544">39</xref></sup> The provision of accurate information has the potential to result in increased knowledge and thus impact on attitudes and beliefs about ACS.</p>
<sec id="section15-1474515112446544">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The study has some limitations. As part of the questionnaire, individuals were provided with a list of potential symptoms. Some patients may have correctly guessed the answers. This would have resulted in an overestimation of knowledge levels. Nonetheless, they may equally have incorrectly assumed that answers were correct. However, we used reliable and previously tested questionnaires. Secondly, we did not seek to ascertain patients’ source of knowledge and information. This is something that might warrant exploration in the future.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study reports on knowledge, attitude and belief levels about ACS in a high risk Irish population. We found that despite having experienced a recent ACS event, knowledge levels were generally inadequate. With respect to attitudes and beliefs towards symptom recognition and response to symptoms, we identified that those patients with higher knowledge levels had better attitude and belief scores. This emphasizes how knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs are interconnected.</p>
<p>Although ACS manifests itself through a variety of symptoms, patients in this study identified primarily with chest and arm pain and shortness of breath as ACS symptoms. Other symptoms such as jaw and neck pain, indigestion and nausea and vomiting went unrecognized by more than half of those surveyed. This finding is of significance as there is an array of potential symptoms associated with ACS and symptom variation will exist both within and between individuals. There is a requirement therefore for individuals to be educated about the full range of potential ACS symptoms.</p>
<p>In this study we considered that appropriate behaviour constituted seeking the necessary assistance and making use of emergency services in the presence of ACS symptoms. However, we identified that more than one-third of patients reported that in the presence of ACS symptoms, they would avoid the use of an ambulance as a means of transport to an emergency department. This contravenes the recommended ESC guidelines, which promote a prompt activation of the EMS. Consequently, in addition to increasing knowledge about symptom recognition, the need for renewed emphasis on action and reaction to symptoms is needed. This would enhance the propensity to act appropriately by seeking the necessary assistance when ACS symptoms occur. The findings of this study may be useful for researchers interested in developing and testing interventions associated with knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about ACS.</p>
