<title>Background:</title>
<p>Immobilization in external rotation is one of the treatment options for an initial dislocation of the shoulder. However, it remains unclear how long it takes for a Bankart lesion to heal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513480620">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>Protection of a healing Bankart lesion from stretching would promote the healing process and decrease the recurrence rate after an initial dislocation of the shoulder.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513480620">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513480620">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>This was a multicenter, prospective randomized study. Between January 2005 and August 2009, 109 patients (71 male and 38 female; mean age, 30 years) with an initial traumatic dislocation of the shoulder were enrolled. After 3 weeks of immobilization in external rotation, a shoulder motion restriction band designed to avoid stretching the anteroinferior shoulder capsule was used for 0 weeks (36 patients), 3 weeks (37 patients), or 6 weeks (36 patients). After using the band, patients were allowed to use their shoulders freely, but they were advised to avoid vigorous sport activities for at least 3 months after the injury. Any recurrent dislocation and return to sports were assessed at 2-year follow-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513480620">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Of 109 patients, 90 were followed up for 2 years. The compliance rates were 60% to 72% among the groups (<italic>P</italic> = .54). The recurrence rate of dislocation was 28% in the 0-week group, 33% in the 3-week group, and 32% in the 6-week group (<italic>P</italic> = .88) according to the intention-to-treat analysis, and they were a respective 24%, 28%, and 27% according to the per-protocol analysis (<italic>P</italic> = .95). Based on the sport activity level, the recurrence rates for patients involved in contact sports (7/15, 47%) and those involved in noncontact sports (19/51, 37%) were significantly higher than for those not involved in sport activities (2/24, 8.3%) (<italic>P</italic> = .0076). Among the 3 groups, there were no significant differences in the recurrence rates. There was no significant difference in the rate of return to sports (<italic>P</italic> = .39).</p>

<body>
<p>A traumatic shoulder dislocation is notorious for its high recurrence rate after an initial dislocation; in particular, the younger the patient, the higher the recurrence rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513480620">18</xref></sup> The essential lesion is a detachment of the inferior glenohumeral ligament (IGHL)–labrum complex from the glenoid, known as a Bankart lesion. The incidence of a Bankart lesion after an initial dislocation is reported to be 94% to 97%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513480620">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513480620">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513480620">25</xref></sup> For the purpose of reducing a Bankart lesion in a better position, immobilization at 10° of external rotation was proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480620">10</xref></sup> Immobilization in external rotation is still controversial: there are both positive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480620">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513480620">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513480620">23</xref></sup> and negative data on the practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513480620">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513480620">15</xref></sup> The maximum effect of immobilization would be expected when the best immobilization position is chosen and the best immobilization length is used. Regarding the immobilization period, it ranges between 3 weeks and 5 weeks depending upon the investigators. Scheibel et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513480620">20</xref></sup> compared 3-week immobilization versus 5-week immobilization in external rotation and concluded that both immobilization periods allowed a similar coaptation of the lesion regardless of the duration of immobilization. They also reported that the recurrence rates after 3 weeks and 5 weeks of immobilization were 2 of 12 (17%) and 2 of 13 patients (15%), respectively, with no significant difference between them (Scheibel et al, unpublished data). Not only the recurrence rate but also the Constant score and Rowe score showed no significant difference between the groups. Thus, there seems to be no clinical difference between 3 weeks and 5 weeks of immobilization. Pennekamp and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513480620">16</xref></sup> took magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans immediately after the shoulder dislocation had been reduced, which showed that the Bankart lesion was reduced with the arm at 10° of external rotation, but it was separated and displaced with the arm in internal rotation. After 3 weeks of immobilization in external rotation, the lesion did stay in the reduced position even with the arm in internal rotation. This report demonstrates that 3 weeks of immobilization may probably be long enough to keep the detached lesion in the reduced position. Once the lesion remains reduced, immobilization is no longer necessary; it may even be harmful because immobilization is known to cause joint contracture and articular cartilage damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513480620">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513480620">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513480620">13</xref></sup> It seems reasonable to start moving the shoulder after 3 weeks of immobilization. However, we have to be careful not to stretch the capsular ligaments, especially the IGHL-labrum complex, which is still in the healing process after 3 weeks of immobilization. It takes at least 4 weeks for a Bankart lesion to heal in a rabbit model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513480620">1</xref></sup> and 8 weeks for the healing of the posteroinferior labrum to the glenoid in a monkey model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513480620">21</xref></sup> Healing time, however, is not known in humans. We hypothesized that during the healing process of the IGHL-labrum complex to the bone, it would be beneficial to avoid any position in which the IGHL would be elongated and put under tension. We made a simple device, a shoulder motion restriction band, which was designed to allow free shoulder motion except the position in which the healing IGHL would be put under tension. Previous anatomic and biomechanical studies showed that the IGHL was under maximum tension with the arm at 90° of abduction and maximum external rotation, but below this abduction angle, no maximum tension was observed in maximum external rotation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513480620">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513480620">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513480620">27</xref></sup> The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of this motion restriction band in reducing the recurrence rate after immobilization in external rotation.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>This was a multicenter, prospective randomized clinical trial. Because the principal investigator (E.I.) moved from one institute to another during this study period, this study was independently approved by the institutional review boards of 2 institutions: (1) Akita University School of Medicine (application number 2004-201, approved on September 27, 2004) and (2) Tohoku University School of Medicine (application number 2006-274, approved on December 18, 2006). Between January 2005 and August 2009, patients with an initial traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder who met the following inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study: those (1) with an initial anterior dislocation of the shoulder with a significant traumatic event that required manual reduction by a third party, (2) seen within 3 days of dislocation, and (3) who had no associated fractures of the shoulder detectable on routine radiographic examination. The exclusion criteria were those (1) with associated fractures of the affected shoulder, (2) with injuries to any other part of the body, and (3) with a previous operative treatment of the affected shoulder. There were 109 patients (71 male and 38 female; mean age, 30 years) enrolled in this study with informed consent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363546513480620">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>After the shoulder dislocation was reduced, postreduction radiographs (anteroposterior view and scapular Y view) were taken to confirm the reduction. Then, the participants were randomly assigned into 1 of the following 3 groups: 0-week group, 3-week group, or 6-week group. Randomization was performed using a random chart created by the principal investigator. Co-investigators allocated the patients at their institutions using this random number chart. There were 36 patients (23 male and 13 female; mean age, 31 years) in the 0-week group, 37 patients (26 male and 11 female; mean age, 30 years) in the 3-week group, and 36 patients (22 male and 14 female; mean age, 29 years) in the 6-week group. The characteristics of these patients are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546513480620">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>All the shoulders were immobilized at 10° to 15° of external rotation using a brace (Shoulder Brace ER, Alcare Co, Tokyo, Japan) for 3 weeks after the reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513480620">Figure 1</xref>). The amount of external rotation remained fairly constant after various activities and reapplication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513480620">8</xref></sup> Immobilization in external rotation was maintained except when patients took a shower. We instructed them not to elevate their affected shoulder while taking a shower. After 3 weeks of immobilization in external rotation, patients received a custom-made shoulder motion restriction band, manufactured by Alcare Co, to connect the trunk and the elbow so as to limit the elevation of the shoulder during activities of daily living (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513480620">Figure 2</xref> and online Video Supplement). By adjusting the length of the band connecting the elbow and the trunk, the shoulder elevation was limited to 60° in each patient regardless of body size so that the patient could not elevate the arm up to an apprehension position (90° of abduction and 90° of external rotation), which is known to be the position to exert a tensile force to the IGHL. Wearing the band, the patients were able to perform most of the activities of daily living except overhead activities. In our preliminary study, we asked 8 healthy volunteers to wear this band during the daytime, and we measured the abduction angle twice, at the beginning and at the end of wearing the band. The initial angle of abduction was 57.4° ± 1.7° (mean ± standard deviation), and the final angle was 57.6° ± 2.5°. We confirmed that the initial angle of shoulder abduction was well maintained with use of this band. The patients used this band for 0 weeks (no band usage; 0-week group), 3 weeks (3-week group), or 6 weeks (6-week group). They were instructed to wear the band full time except when they slept during the night. After immobilization with the brace and motion restriction with the band, we asked the patients how long they actually wore the brace and the band to determine their compliance. We advised them to avoid vigorous sport activities at least 3 months after the injury. Sport activities were categorized as contact sports such as rugby, judo, and so on and noncontact sports such as baseball, volleyball, soccer, and so on. They were followed up at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. When they were unable to come to our office, we interviewed them by telephone.</p>

<p>The primary outcome measure was the recurrence of dislocations of the shoulder. We also asked patients (1) when and how the recurrent dislocation had occurred and (2) whether they had returned to their preinjury sports.</p>

<sec id="section10-0363546513480620">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using the computer software JMP Pro 9.0.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). Compliance was assessed in all the groups. Using the immobilization brace for more than 23 hours per day for 3 weeks and using the restriction band full time except during sleep for the assigned time period (0, 3, or 6 weeks) were defined as compliant. We performed both an intention-to-treat analysis and a per-protocol analysis. Both the compliant and noncompliant patients were analyzed in the intention-to-treat analysis, whereas only those who were compliant were analyzed in the per-protocol analysis. The required sample size was calculated to be 32 in each group when the significance level was .05 and the power was 60%. Assuming that the follow-up rate was 90%, the necessary sample size was calculated to be 36 in each group. The demographic data were compared using the analysis of variance (age) or χ<sup>2</sup> test (gender, side, percentage of sport injuries). The rates of recurrence and return to sports were compared using the χ<sup>2</sup> test. Statistical significance was set at the 5% level.</p>

We further performed a subgroup analysis of those who were 30 years of age or younger (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546513480620">Table 3</xref>) and those who were older than 30 years of age (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546513480620">Table 4</xref>). The recurrence rates did not show any statistically significant difference among the 3 groups in the intention-to-treat analysis and per-protocol analysis in both young and old subgroups. Based on the sport activity level, the recurrence rates of those involved in contact sports (7/15, 47%) and those involved in noncontact sports (19/51, 37%) were significantly higher than those not involved in sport activities (2/24, 8.3%) (<italic>P</italic> = .0076). Among the 3 groups, there were no significant differences in the recurrence rates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0363546513480620">Table 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Return to Sports</title>
<p>One patient each in the 0-week group and the 3-week group and 2 patients in the 6-week group underwent surgery during the follow-up period because of recurrent dislocations. These 4 patients were excluded from the assessment of return to sports at 2 years. Eighteen patients (64%) in the 0-week group, 20 patients (69%) in the 3-week group, and 24 patients (83%) in the 6-week group were participating in sports on a regular basis at the time of the initial injury (<italic>P</italic> = .25). None of them were at a professional level. The rates of return to sports were 86% (18/21), 73% (16/22), and 88% (21/24), respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .39), but full return to the preinjury level was 62% (13/21), 55% (12/22), and 58% (14/24), respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .89). Based on the sport level, the rates of full return to contact sports were 50% (1/2), 57% (4/7), and 100% (2/2), respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .35), whereas the rates of full return to noncontact sports were 56% (9/16), 46% (6/13), and 55% (12/22), respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .85).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrated that using the restriction band for up to 6 weeks after immobilization in external rotation did not influence the recurrence rate at 2 years. According to a previous report of immobilization in external rotation, all shoulders regained normal range of motion within 2 months after immobilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480620">10</xref></sup> This indicates that during the first 2 months after the immobilization, shoulder range of motion might have been limited, and the patients gradually regained full range of motion afterward. Therefore, even in the 0-week group, in which the patients did not use the restriction band, it is most likely that they used their arms within a comfortable range of motion without bringing their arms to the anterior apprehension position. This may be one of the reasons why we were unable to detect any significant difference in the recurrence rate among the groups. A low compliance rate may be another reason. Compared with a previous study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480620">10</xref></sup> it was relatively low. Also, the shoulder motion restriction band was used only during the daytime. Some patients might have elevated their arm to the full extent of range of motion while sleeping. This might explain the similar outcome among the 3 groups.</p>
<p>Scougall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513480620">21</xref></sup> reported the healing of a detached posterior labrum to the glenoid in a monkey model. He made a posterior capsular incision and a longitudinal split to the posterior labrum on the left shoulder and the same procedure followed by an avulsion of the posterior labrum from the glenoid in the right shoulder of a monkey. After 8 weeks, the shoulder specimens were histologically evaluated. He observed sound healing of the detached labrum to the glenoid after 8 weeks from the injury. Although this was the first animal model using a monkey, he observed the healing at the 8-week point only, and the author did not evaluate the biomechanical strength of the healed structure. Abe et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513480620">1</xref></sup> reported the healing process of a Bankart lesion created in a rabbit model. The histological healing was observed at 3 weeks, and biomechanical strength was back to normal at 4 weeks. They concluded that at least 4 weeks were necessary for the healing of a Bankart lesion in a rabbit model. We still need to have a better understanding of the healing process of a Bankart lesion.</p>
<p>We did not take MRI scans of the shoulder after the reduction. It is ideal to take MRI scans after the reduction to evaluate the soft tissue injuries. If an IGHL injury occurs in the midsubstance of the capsule (capsular tear), immobilization in external rotation would not be desirable because external rotation stretches the anterior capsule and may open the capsular tear, which may result in a nonhealing lesion. However, taking MRI scans makes it far more complex to perform this study. This was a multicenter study, and making the protocol as simple as possible is an essential part of a multicenter study. This is the reason why we did not perform an MRI examination in our protocol. Had we taken an MRI scan to exclude patients with a capsular tear, the recurrence rate after immobilization in external rotation regardless of using the motion restriction band might have been better.</p>
<p>This is the first study to investigate the effect of restricting shoulder motion for up to 6 weeks after immobilization on the recurrence rate. Although we did not find any significant effect of this band on the recurrence rate, more sophisticated application of this band is necessary in a future study. At this moment, we do not have any high-level evidence in terms of when to return to activities of daily living or when to return to sports. This study is expected to shed a light on this important issue.</p>
<p>Regarding the sport activity level, this study clearly demonstrated that those who were involved in contact or noncontact sports showed significantly higher recurrence rates than those who were not involved in sport activities. In other words, sport activities are a risk factor of recurrent dislocations as reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513480620">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480620">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480620">19</xref></sup> Between contact and noncontact sports, athletes who played contact sports tended to show a higher recurrence rate (47%) than athletes in noncontact sports (37%), but the difference did not reach a statistically significant level. This might be caused by the sample size.</p>
<p>Some may argue that surgical stabilization is far superior to nonsurgical treatment. Why do we need to discuss nonsurgical treatment? We totally agree that stabilization procedures provide better stability than nonsurgical treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513480620">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513480620">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513480620">14</xref></sup> On one hand, surgical stabilization is the best treatment option that we can offer. On the other hand, surgical treatment may not be the best option for patients. Patients may not be good candidates for surgical treatment because they may not want to have surgery, they cannot afford to have surgery, or they may not be cooperative to postoperative rehabilitation. For these patients, nonsurgical treatment would be the treatment of choice. We need to determine the best possible nonsurgical treatment for such patients. We believe there is always a need for nonsurgical treatment. To meet this need, it is important to determine the best method of nonsurgical treatment.</p>
<p>There are some limitations in this study. First, the timing of using this band may not have been appropriate. We speculate that 6 weeks after 3 weeks of immobilization is the time when patients gradually regain their range of shoulder motion. Unfortunately, we could not confirm our speculation because we did not measure the range of motion in this study. Once the full range of motion is achieved, the healing IGHL is most likely put under tension with the arm in abduction and external rotation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513480620">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513480620">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513480620">27</xref></sup> In this respect, the application of the band after patients regained the full range of motion might be more appropriate to show any potential effect that this band may have. Had we measured passive and active ranges of motion before and after the band application, these data would have strengthened this discussion. Also, if we had measured the muscle strength, we might have been able to see if there were any detrimental effects to prolonged use of this restriction band. Second, we did not assess the quality of life (QOL) of the patients in this study. The Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index (WOSI) is widely used these days to assess the QOL of patients with shoulder instability. The Japanese version of the WOSI became available in 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480620">9</xref></sup> However, when our study was started in 2005, this was not available yet. In a future study, not only the recurrence rate but also a QOL assessment needs to be incorporated. A third issue is the low compliance and daytime application of the band. As discussed previously, the compliance was relatively low compared with a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480620">10</xref></sup> In addition, we allowed the patients to use the shoulder motion restriction band only during the daytime. We were afraid that application of the restriction band during the night might cause sleep disturbance in some patients, which might eventually lead to a lower compliance rate. Thus, we did not restrict their shoulder motion while they were asleep. Some patients might have elevated their arm to the anterior apprehension position while sleeping. This might have significantly affected the outcome of this study. Fourth, the patients were not blinded to the interviewers or examiners when we assessed the brace/band-wear compliance. There is a possibility of self-reported or recall bias. Fifth, we calculated the sample size with the power set at 60%. If the power had been set at 80%, the required sample size was calculated to be 55. The sample size of this study may not have been sufficient.</p>
