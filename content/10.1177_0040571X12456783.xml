<abstract>
<p>One aspect of the chilly climate of ecumenism at the present time is the idea that theological dialogue between the major Christian traditions is basically a pointless exercise in self-deception. This article considers this criticism and weighs the extent to which the churches are already united, while being, in some cases, divided where it matters most – at the Lord’s Table. It restates the ‘Faith and Order’ vision of full visible unity as an imperative of the gospel, briefly indicating how it may be pursued with realism and integrity.</p>

<body>
<p>The picture of ecumenism that some people outside the process have is of a bunch of idealists fantasizing about something that is never going to happen. For them, ecumenists live in an unreal world, detached from the hard reality of church life. They suspect that the specific traditions that are meant to be represented get thrown into the melting pot and that what they brew up there is a tasteless ecumenical soup. Those who pride themselves on being hard-headed realists about church affairs seem to think that, while the ecumenical movement may have improved the climate between church leaders and created opportunities for practical cooperation (all the better if it saves money), theological dialogue is basically hot air and talk of visible unity is cloud cuckoo land. When ecumenists get together in theological dialogue, it is thought to be a case of unreal worlds meeting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040571X12456783">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>That cynical stance grossly underestimates what ecumenism has achieved under God. It has not only largely replaced suspicion, incomprehension and competition with understanding, trust and friendship: in the form of theological dialogue, it has also significantly scaled down the extent of church-dividing issues between Christian traditions. It has achieved this by refining concepts, clearing up misunderstandings and pinpointing genuine unresolved issues. It has shown that there is ‘a certain, albeit imperfect, communion’ between churches that are not yet in full visible communion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040571X12456783">2</xref></sup> Theological convergence has reduced the cognitive distance between churches, bringing them closer together in every way. In other words, ecumenical dialogue has brought into focus the degree of unity that already exists between churches, even though it falls seriously short of the full visible unity that has consistently been articulated as the goal of the Faith and Order movement.</p>
<p>The extraordinary paradox of ecumenism is that the churches are, at the same time, both united and divided. They are generally, though not universally, united in baptism (or, better, in Christian initiation)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040571X12456783">3</xref></sup> and the profession of the trinitarian baptismal faith, and in the liturgical use of the ecumenical creeds. There is extensive agreement – though this too cannot be universalized – on aspects of ecclesiology, including the ordained ministry and the sacraments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040571X12456783">4</xref></sup> Provided that we do not insist that other churches speak our own language – provided we allow for the fact that (as Pope John XXIII put it at the opening of the Second Vatican Council) the essence of the apostolic faith is one thing and the way that it is articulated is another<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040571X12456783">5</xref></sup> – we can recognize an extensive commonality of belief.</p>
<p>This commonality of belief, though real, is not something that can be assumed on the basis of goodwill or taken for granted just because we have, on the whole, come to like each other. It can only be the result of extended theological engagement that is marked by five qualities, not all of which have always been met until now: (1) it is scholarly and rigorous and penetrates to the bedrock of the traditions; (2) it avoids deliberately ambiguous formulations that can be haggled over later; (3) it is truly representative of the traditions concerned and not a gathering of like-minded but not fully representative individuals; (4) it follows a method that consolidates and builds on what has already been gained before attempting to break fresh ground; and (5) it tests its emerging conclusions and facilitates the process of reception by consulting with the constituencies it represents, rather than presenting a fait accompli to the sponsoring churches, with little room for second thoughts. When these five criteria are met, dialogue will show genuine theological convergence and at the same time highlight those issues that continue to divide the churches and that (as we say, putting it constructively, as well as diplomatically) ‘require further study’.</p>
<p>At the same time, the churches remain divided at precisely the point where it matters most – at the celebration of the Eucharist. If, as a number of traditions (Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican) would agree, the Eucharist is the source and summit of the Church’s life,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040571X12456783">6</xref></sup> and if, as the eucharistic ecclesiology of Anglicans, Orthodox and Roman Catholics suggests, the Eucharist makes the Church,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040571X12456783">7</xref></sup> then unity in the Eucharist is the litmus test of any form of unity. In the celebration of the Eucharist by priest and people, the three key tasks of the Church’s mission come into focus: the ministry of the word, the celebration of the sacraments and the exercise of pastoral responsibility;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040571X12456783">8</xref></sup> or, as the Second Vatican Council puts it, the <italic>munera</italic> of teaching, sanctifying and governing. The Eucharist is the touchstone of unity. Without reciprocal eucharistic hospitality and interchangeable eucharistic presidency, the churches remain divided where it is most important that they should be visibly one body. The body of Christ – the ecclesial body and the sacramental body – is torn asunder.</p>
<p>How do we come to terms with the idea that the body of Christ is disunited? With my theologically realist ecclesiology of the body of Christ, I struggle to get my head around the idea that Christ is somehow torn apart in the Church. It seems almost blasphemous. But in that case what did Pascal mean when he said, ‘Jesus will be in agony until the end of the world’?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040571X12456783">9</xref></sup> St Paul uses this language too. When he speaks into the situation of schisms in Corinth he asks, ‘Has Christ been divided?’ (1 Cor. 1.13). This rhetorical question invites the answer, ‘No, that’s impossible!’, but the question is not so easily disposed of; it should continue to haunt us. When later in the same letter Paul speaks of the body and its members, his punch line is, ‘So it is with Christ’ (1 Cor. 12.12). As Calvin comments here, ‘Paul calls the Church “Christ”.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040571X12456783">10</xref></sup> ‘For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.’ If ‘body’ is not a trivial metaphor, neither is ‘members’. We are ontologically united in baptism to the body of Christ. As Paul says in the very next verse, ‘For in the one Spirit we were all baptised into one body … and we were all made to drink of one Spirit’ (1 Cor. 12.13). How can baptized Christians continue to exist in a state of separation? It’s an ontological impossibility. Indeed, what we are confronted with is the ‘impossible possibility’, the body of Christ separated from itself.</p>
<p>Yes, we may reply, but the Church has always been divided; we see division even in the New Testament; there were splits as a result of the ecumenical councils that defined the Creeds; East and West broke apart in 1054; the Reformation and Counter-Reformation brought further division that has now been projected globally; new churches are being formed every day that do not recognize most other churches: it can’t matter as much as you think, or it would not be like this. Shouldn’t we make a virtue of necessity and learn to think differently about the oneness of the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church; basically, let a thousand flowers bloom?</p>
<p>Is unity all that important: is it worth praying, working and suffering for? That is a question that must have crossed the minds of many of us who work for Christian unity. But the divisions between the churches are not merely friendly rivalries; they touch the heart of the gospel, the way of salvation. The churches are not simply going their own sweet way: the absence of visible unity and especially of eucharistic communion is a denial of the body of Christ. The unbearable paradox of ecumenism is that the churches are divided about what the Church is and who is in it. The history of Christianity has been scarred not only by separation but also by mutual excommunication, torture and horrible judicial executions.</p>
<p>Of course, we may say, God does not want that, any more than God really wanted the Israelites to exterminate the indigenous inhabitants when they reached the Promised Land: they and we simply misunderstood God’s will; but God doesn’t mind our divisions, provided that we are tolerant and friendly and goodwill prevails, just like the modern liberal democracy that is some people’s idea of heaven. Then the Church in all its diversity can be admired as a many-splendoured thing.</p>
<p>The prayer of Jesus as he consecrated himself to go to the cross was that his disciples should be visibly one, in a unity that was manifest to the world such as to enable the world to believe in him (John 17. 21–23).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040571X12456783">11</xref></sup> Extraordinarily, that prayer remains largely unanswered. And that is a massive <italic>aporia</italic> in our Christian understanding.</p>
<p>When I look at the crucifix I sometimes wonder whether Jesus would have gone all the way to the cross if he had known what his followers would do in his name, not least what they would do to his Church. If he had known all that was to follow, would he still have gone ahead? Perhaps he would have turned sadly away. Dorothy Day used to say, ‘The Church is the cross on which Christ is crucified.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040571X12456783">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>When we consider the bloody record of persecution, torture, execution and extermination, all infused with passions of fear and hatred, that have been carried out by the Church’s agents with the Church’s sanction and blessing, it seems that this instrument of God’s peace has sometimes turned into its opposite. Then, as Martin Luther used to say, Antichrist sits in the temple of God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040571X12456783">13</xref></sup> The unimaginably cruel treatment that Christians have meted out to non-Christians and indeed to their fellow Christians raises the question of <italic>ecclesiological theodicy</italic>, the issue of evil and injustice in the Church. And philosophical theologians know to their cost that there is no adequate theodicy. Add to that the recent appalling revelations of clerical sexual abuse of minors and the culpable mishandling of that by certain church authorities, and I think that you have a deep question mark at the heart of ecclesiology. How can one, as John Milton put it in the opening lines of <italic>Paradise Lost</italic>, ‘justify the ways of God to men’?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040571X12456783">14</xref></sup> – how make sense of God’s plan and purpose and Christ’s intention with regard to the Church; how affirm the Holy Spirit’s guidance?</p>
<p>‘Unreal worlds meeting’: I have to say that in fourteen years of full-time, professional work I have not experienced the ecumenical world in that way – and if I had, I would have had no truck with it. But there is no smoke without fire and I am well aware that aimless ecumenical activity exists, as well as disappointment about what the ecumenical process has delivered. But ecumenical theology has recently been undergoing reshaping and reform to move the centre of gravity away from the top-heavy institutional dimension to the inter-personal, communal and missional – without giving up on the goal of full visible communion grounded in doctrinal accord, but rather bringing out its true meaning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040571X12456783">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>What is needed is not fantasizing, but disciplined attention and critical scrutiny. The dreaming of dreams comes first (there is no progression without vision), but rigorous analysis and hard-headed pragmatics soon follow.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040571X12456783">16</xref></sup> John Paul II pointed to the disciplined vocation of ecumenism, the <italic>ascesis</italic> that it entails, when he talked about the ‘purification of memories’ and the need for ‘truthful vision’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040571X12456783">17</xref></sup> Margaret O’Gara sees ecumenical work as a form of asceticism:<disp-quote>
<p>It invites Christian scholars to enter into a process which may achieve no tangible success or rewards during their lifetime … ecumenists must follow various ascetical practices: they repeatedly fast from celebrations of the Eucharist when not in full communion with the presider; they spend their time and talents on lengthy study of positions they only gradually understand; they endure the embarrassment and frustration that flow from the sins of their own and their dialogue partner’s communion; and frequently their efforts are feared or suspected by members of their own church.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040571X12456783">18</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Yves Congar insisted that nothing changes us like ecumenical engagement. Ecumenism, he said, ‘presupposes a movement for conversion and reform co-extensive with the whole life of communions’. It demands ‘a profound moral and even religious conversion’ in our churches and in our selves. As a result, said Congar, one becomes ‘a different person’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0040571X12456783">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a crucial difference between a vision of unity inspired by the Holy Spirit, which seeks to move towards the ultimate horizon of visible unity step by step, matching practical initiatives to doctrinal agreement, and escapist fantasizing that builds castles in the air to evade the pain and scandal of division now. Head and heart must come together in ecumenical work. The need for clear-sighted realism need not mean that pragmatism becomes the order of the day. Ecumenism seen as ‘the art of the possible’ cannot dispense with the sustaining vision of the glorious body of Christ (cf. Phil. 3.21).</p>
<p>The ecumenical movement was hailed by its pioneers as a <italic>novum</italic>, a fresh work of the Holy Spirit. In the history of the Church spiritual renewal has invariably been accompanied by fresh divisions. The new wine could not be contained within the old wine skins. When the Spirit was poured out you could bet your life that there was a split looming. Could that be changing? For example, the charismatic movement of the twentieth century was a movement of spiritual renewal within the churches and across the churches, not between them. At Pentecost Peter quotes the prophecy of Joel: ‘I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams’ (Acts 2.17; cf. Joel 2.28). Where the Spirit moves, we dream not of division but of unity, not of putting asunder but of gathering together, not of discord but of harmony. We can be inspired by the Spirit both to dream the dream of unity and to work tirelessly for its progressive realization, encouraged by the extent of accord that has already been revealed. In one sense, nothing is more unreal <italic>sub specie aeternitatis</italic> than the fragmented Church of Christ: ‘From the unreal lead me to the real.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0040571X12456783">20</xref></sup></p>
