<abstract>
<p>The availability of coherent long-term measured data on climatic variables and building parameters forms the basis for predicting, analyzing, and simulating the heating or cooling energy demand on buildings. This article analyzes measured 4-year data considering the test building with an insulated cavity brick wall with a massive outer brick leaf. The results show that the solar radiation and the thermal inertia of massive outer leaf of a wall have a significant effect on the heat loss and energy consumption of the buildings throughout Finland and Scandinavia. Based on the average outdoor air temperatures, the nominal calculated heat losses could be overestimated. For more accurate heat losses, the outdoor surface temperature should be applied as a boundary condition. The measured results were verified with finite element method.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is a growing interest toward energy saving and efficiency of buildings. It has been noticed that besides the U-value, the thermal inertia should also be considered in energy-conscious building design. The influence of the thermal inertia of building structures on thermal comfort and energy consumption has been analyzed theoretically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744259112453717">Guglielmini et al., 1981</xref>). Also, the combined effect of thermal inertia and surface absorptance for solar radiation of external walls on the thermal behavior of buildings was calculated in unsteady-state conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744259112453717">Guglielmini et al., 1982</xref>). Thermal inertia was found to be an important parameter for improving thermal comfort as well as for reducing heating and cooling energy consumption of buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744259112453717">Balaras, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744259112453717">Feng, 2004</xref>). The influence of thermal inertia of Spanish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744259112453717">Orosa and Oliveira, 2012</xref>) and Italian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744259112453717">Di Perna et al., 2011</xref>) school building envelope on indoor environment has been studied. The problem of the room temperature oscillation under intermittent heating and solar radiation was analyzed for two types of composite walls that have the same U-value and different heat capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744259112453717">Faggiani et al., 1984</xref>). The thermal inertia of external walls with the same U-value is also compared in order to evaluate the influence of the relative position of a given thickness of insulation and a massive layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744259112453717">Bojic and Loveday, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259112453717">Kossecka and Kosny, 2002</xref>). Several external wall systems with the same U-value but different dynamic properties are analyzed in order to calculate the associated achievable energy savings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744259112453717">Aste et al., 2009</xref>). However, the results regarding the energy saving potential of thermal inertia are ranging from a few percentages to more than 80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744259112453717">Bojic and Loveday, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259112453717">Kossecka and Kosny, 2002</xref>). The differences in input data often cause greater differences in calculation results than the differences between various calculation and simulation methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744259112453717">Kalema et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The availability of coherent long-term measured data on climatic variables and building parameters forms the basis for predicting, analyzing, and simulating the heating or cooling energy demand of buildings. The accurate prediction requires detailed input data and understanding of time-dependent temperature distribution within the external wall structures. However, that kind of data is still scarce in literature.</p>
<p>This article considers the results of a 4-year-long field survey, where the thermal performance of external walls of eight identical test buildings was monitored constantly throughout the year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744259112453717">Lindberg et al., 2004</xref>). Each building had exterior wall constructed of different building materials. The data considered the indoor–outdoor temperatures, temperatures at various depths within the northern, southern, and western exterior wall facades, the wind speed and direction, as well as the horizontal global solar radiation. A computer system was used to monitor, check, calculate, integrate, and save the data acquired from approximately 520 sensors in each building. Measurements were taken with a time interval of 20 s. These values were integrated over a time interval of 30 min, and the minimum, maximum, and mean values were subsequently stored to a computer database.</p>
<p>Many structural solutions of external walls include an external leaf outside the thin air gap made of some durable bulky material with a considerable thermal inertia, such as brickwork or concrete. The gathered data considering the test building with an insulated cavity brick wall as an external wall envelope are further analyzed in this article. The details of the exterior wall structure with the corresponding material parameters are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744259112453717">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744259112453717">Table 1</xref>. Finite element method (FEM) was applied to verify the measured thermal behavior of the wall structure.</p>

<title>Test building</title>
<p>The floor area of each test building is 2.4 m × 2.4 m, and the free floor to ceiling height is 2.6 m. Buildings were constructed in a moderately exposed parking area within the compound of Tampere University of Technology. They were oriented in north–south direction in such a way that the external doors of each building are installed within the eastern wall. There are no other openings or windows in the external walls. The ceilings and the floors of all the buildings are equally composed of two layers of foamed polyurethane elements with an overall thickness of 200 mm. The joints between the insulation elements were sealed with polyurethane foam and ventilation tapes. The test building was heated with a 1500-W electric radiator (1248 mm × 400 mm heat panel) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744259112453717">Table 1</xref>).

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Prevailing weather conditions were measured at the site, including the outdoor temperatures, wind speed and direction, and the relative humidity of the air. The intensity of the solar radiation was also measured by a pyranometer (solar meter) that was fixed on the eaves level of one of the test buildings. The pyranometer measured the global solar radiation to the building surface, which is composed of the direct and the diffused solar radiation.</p>
<p>The indoor air temperature was monitored at three heights (near the floor surface, at the middle, and near the ceiling). Temperatures inside the wall cross-section were monitored in 14 different levels, including the inner and outer surfaces of the wall. Calibrated semiconductor sensors were used as the measuring devices. The same kind of test setting was implemented inside the three solid walls of the building facing south, west, and north. The location of the individual temperature gauges inside the wall structure is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744259112453717">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Multiplexers were used to collect the data from the sensors, so that the readings from each channel (temperature gauge) were recorded to a computer every 20 s. Analog-to-Digital and Digital-to-Analog (ADDA) cards were used for data collection and conversion. The mean temperatures from the 20-s measured values were saved to a computer hard disk every 30 min.</p>

<title>Temperature distribution</title>
<p>Here, the measured temperature distribution inside the wall section is considered during a representative period of the survey in late February 2005 only. The aim was to illustrate the effect of a massive outer leaf of a wall on thermal loss through the entire structure. The monthly heat loss calculus is performed for the entire survey period between 2002 and 2006.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1744259112453717">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the dependency between the surface temperature of the external brick leaf of the wall and the measured solar radiation at the site during late February 2005. Correlation between the measured solar irradiance at the site and the measured surface temperature of the brickwork is evident. The average ambient outdoor temperature during the period was T<sub>out,ave</sub> = −9.3°C, and the average surface temperature during the same period was T<sub>surf,ave</sub> = −5.2°C, which is 44% less than the outdoor temperature.</p>

The maximum measured outdoor temperature of the day was T<sub>out,max</sub> = −6.4°C at 15:02 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1744259112453717">Figure 4</xref>). Meanwhile, the measured surface temperature of the outer brick leaf (point 395, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744259112453717">Figure 2</xref>) was T<sub>surf(395)</sub> =+17.9°C (15:02 h, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1744259112453717">Figure 4</xref>) and the temperature of the inner surface of the brick leaf T<sub>surf(310)</sub> =+14.7°C. Temperature difference between the ambient air and the inner brick surface (point 310, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744259112453717">Figure 2</xref>) was ΔT = 21.1°C. This temperature difference between the ambient outdoor air and the inner surface of the face brick leaf generated by solar radiation has a significant effect on the actual heat loss through the insulation layer, as shown in measured temperature distribution curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1744259112453717">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Due to the high thermal inertia of the brick leaf, temperature of the inner surface of the leaf facing the air gap remains relatively high until early evening though the outer surface temperature of the leaf had already decreased significantly. At 21:00 h, the measured ambient outdoor temperature was T<sub>out</sub> = −13.1°C, temperature of the outer surface of the brick leaf T<sub>surf(395)</sub> = −7.5°C, and the measured temperature of the inner surface of the leaf T<sub>surf(310)</sub> = −3.6°C. The difference between the surface facing the air gap and the ambient air was still ΔT = 9.5°C.</p>

<title>Heat flow through the wall</title>
<p>Heat flow through the wall or any individual material layer was calculated according to the standard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744259112453717">EN ISO 6946:2007 (2007)</xref>. The following two different methods were used:</p>
<list id="list1-1744259112453717" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The nominal heat loss was determined based on the ambient average outdoor and indoor temperatures, measured every half hour at the site, and the total thermal resistance of the entire wall structure, including the inner and outer surface resistances and the thermal resistance of the air gap and the outer brick leaf according to the guidance given to the unventilated air layers in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744259112453717">EN ISO 6946:2007 (2007)</xref>. The standard concludes that the open vertical joints in the outer leaf of a masonry cavity are not regarded as ventilation openings. Thermal transmittance of the entire wall used in calculations is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744259112453717">Table 1</xref> (U<sub>wall</sub> = 0.25 W/m<sup>2</sup> K). This method is widely used in Finnish codes, for example, in calculation of the heat loss energies through the exterior walls when the required heating capacity or the energy consumption of a building is determined.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The second method applied the measured temperatures inside the wall structure, recorded similarly every 30 min during the entire survey period. This actual heat loss from the building was determined from the measured temperature difference over the d = 125-mm-thick mineral wool layer outside the inner brick wall. This way, the thermal inertia of the inner brick layer does not have an effect on the readings, and the flow through the insulation layer denotes the actual heat loss from the indoor air and the inner surface of the external wall. Only the nominal thermal conductivity of the mineral wool (λ<sub>U,min.wool</sub> = 0.045 W/m<sup>2</sup> K) was used when thermal transmittance of the layer was determined (U<sub>min.wool</sub> = 0.36 W/m<sup>2</sup> K). Now the daily fluctuation of temperature and thermal inertia of the outer brick leaf have a significant effect on the calculated heat flow through the insulation layer.</p></list-item>

<p>The heating season was determined from the indoor air temperature data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1744259112453717">Figure 5</xref>). Additional heating was required to keep the temperature at T<sub>indoor</sub> ≈ +19°C between late September and late April. The heating season therefore included the seven months between October and April.</p>

The difference is most significant during the spring on the south-facing wall, starting from the late February and lasting until the end of the heating season in April. The actual heat loss in February was over 10% less than the nominal loss due to the increased solar radiation toward the end of the month. In March, the difference was already between 18% and 27% and in April between 32% and 55%. In autumn, a significant difference was measured in early October, the monthly difference varying between 9% and 20%, which rapidly decreased toward the end of the year, being less than 5% during the three winter months between November and January.</p>

<p>The measured heat loss difference during the entire heating season varied between 11% and 23% in the 4-year survey period. Only during the three darkest winter months (November–January) the measured heat flux more or less equals the nominal heat loss calculated from the ambient indoor and outdoor temperatures. From May onward, the measured temperatures inside the test building rose above the limit value of T<sub>indoor</sub> = +19°C, the additional heating was no longer needed, and the measured heat flow rate through the wall (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1744259112453717">Table 3</xref>) was due to the risen average indoor air temperatures. Instead of heating, a cooling system of some kind would have been needed, especially in July and August while the average indoor air temperature rose above +25°C, despite the fact that the test building had not any window openings to let the solar radiation in.</p>
<p>The measured difference between the actual and the nominal heat loss is less dramatic but still significant on the north-facing wall. The difference during the spring months varied between 12% and 18% in April and between 7% and 10% in March. In autumn, the difference was less dramatic. In October, it was between 0% and 10%, and usually less than 5% during the following three winter months.</p>

<title>FE modeling and verification of the measurement data</title>
<p>FEM was used to verify the measured thermal behavior of the wall structure. A two-dimensional (2D) FE model included a 1-m-high section of the wall structure. The measured indoor air temperature was given as the inner boundary condition for the model with a constant surface resistance (R<sub>si</sub> = 0.13 m<sup>2</sup>·K/W) applied on the inner surface of the wall. The required thermal coefficients of the materials applied in the analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744259112453717">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The exact solar radiation rates or wind conditions at the instant vicinity of the surveyed walls were not known (only ambient conditions at the site were measured). Therefore, the measured surface temperature of the outer brick leaf was used as the outdoor boundary condition. It was applied as a thermal load directly on the outer surface of the brickwork. Thermal interaction over the air gap was calculated using the surface-to-surface radiation and conductance, with up-flowing heat flow inside the gap dependent on the temperature of the brickwork. Increasing the surface temperature of the brickwork increases the air velocity inside the cavity due to the increased temperature difference between the air gap air and the ambient outdoor air.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1744259112453717">Figure 7</xref> illustrates the measured and calculated temperatures at three points inside the wall structure. The given number denotes the distance from the inner surface of the wall structure. Thus, point 135 denotes the outer surface of the load-bearing brick wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744259112453717">Figure 2</xref>), point 260 is the joint surface between the mineral wool and the windshield board, and point 310 is the surface of the brickwork facing the air gap. The other curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1744259112453717">Figure 7</xref>, the measured indoor air temperature and the wall surface that denotes the measured outer surface temperature of the brickwork, were both used as the given boundary conditions in calculus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744259112453717">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Correspondences between the measured and calculated values were good as far as the temperature distribution inside the wall structure was considered. Also, the calculated heat flux through the mineral wall layer (FEM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1744259112453717">Figure 8</xref>) equaled the flux determined from the measured boundary temperatures of the layer (Measured, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1744259112453717">Figure 8</xref>). The cumulative difference between the two fluxes during the 2-day period was only 1.4%. The FE analysis verified the in situ measurements and proved the effect of the thermal inertia of the faced brickwork on the actual heat loss through the wall. Flux curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1744259112453717">Figure 7</xref> show how the temperature increase of the outer brick leaf during the day (between noon and 9 p.m.) decreases the actual heat loss by 25% in comparison to the reference flux (Reference, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1744259112453717">Figure 8</xref>) calculated using the total thermal resistance of the wall and the measured ambient outdoor and indoor temperatures.</p>

<p>It can be found from the current study that differences in the average outdoor air and outdoor surface temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1744259112453717">Figure 4</xref>) will result in considerable differences in heat fluxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1744259112453717">Figure 8</xref>) and heat losses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1744259112453717">Figure 6</xref>). Based on the average outdoor air temperatures, the heat losses of external walls of a building cannot be calculated accurately. This way, the heat losses could be overestimated. Therefore, the outdoor surface temperature is a very important boundary condition in order to calculate accurate heat losses of a building.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Thermal inertia of the massive outer leaf of an insulated cavity brick wall has a significant impact on heat flow through the wall. Solar radiation heats up the outer leaf in comparison to the ambient outdoor air temperature surrounding the building. Due to the thermal inertia of the leaf, the temperature difference between the leaf and the outdoor air remains significantly high until late evening.</p>
<p>On the south-facing wall, this thermal fluctuation of the massive outer leaf of the wall has a significant effect on the total thermal loss through the structure. According to the 4-year measurement data, the heating season of the test building lasted seven months from early October to late April. Only during the three darkest winter months (November–January), the nominal calculated heat loss corresponded relatively well with the measured losses. In October and between mid-February and April, the solar radiation had a significant effect on the measured heat loss. The actual heat loss in February was over 10% less than the nominal loss due to the increased solar radiation toward the end of the month. In March, the difference was already between 18% and 27% and in April between 32% and 55%. In autumn, a significant difference was measured in early October, the monthly difference varying between 9% and 20%, which rapidly decreased toward the end of the year. Overall, the difference between the measured and nominal loss during the heating season varied between 11% and 23% in the 4-year survey period.</p>
<p>On the north-facing wall, the measured difference between the actual and the nominal heat loss is less dramatic but still significant. The difference during the spring months varied between 12% and 18% in April and between 7% and 10% in March. In autumn, the difference was less dramatic. In October, it was between 0% and 10% and usually less than 5% during the following three winter months. The results of the current study show that the nominal calculated heat losses, based on the average outdoor air temperature, could be overestimated. For more accurate heat losses, the outdoor surface temperature should be applied as a boundary condition.</p>
<p>The northern location (latitude 61°25′N) of the survey site suggests that the solar radiation and the thermal inertia of the different structural sections of a wall have a significant effect on the actual heat loss and energy consumption of the buildings throughout Finland and Scandinavia, as the average solar radiation increases toward the south, and most of the Scandinavian building stock is located south from the survey site. Nowadays, the structural solutions of the Finnish external walls are designed considering only 3 or 4 months of the year, from November to early February, and the nominal theoretical heat loss through the wall during this period. In order to improve the energy efficiency of the building envelope, thermal insulation capacity of the wall is increased and will be further increased in the future. The basic idea is to reduce the heat loss and energy consumption of the building by 20% by increasing the thermal insulation capacity of the wall by that same amount, 20%. This highly theoretical approach only considers the three winter months of the year and ignores the other possibilities to improve the overall thermal behavior of the wall, not to mention the five summer months during which the additional heating is usually not needed at all, but a cooling system is almost a necessity.</p>
