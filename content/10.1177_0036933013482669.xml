<sec id="sec1-0036933013482669" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epiphyseal osteomyelitis in children is an uncommon condition with potentially severe consequences.</p>
<p>We discuss the case of a 7-year-old boy who presented a few days after a fall with a painful left wrist. Serial radiographs, over several weeks, showed no fracture but progressive osteopenia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the likely diagnosis and was important in surgical planning. We discuss the presentation, diagnosis, treatment and outcome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0036933013482669" sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title>
<sec id="sec3-0036933013482669"><title>History, clinical features and investigations</title>
<p>A previously well 7-year-old boy presented to the emergency department (ED) with a painful and swollen left wrist following a witnessed fall from his bicycle 3 days prior to presentation. He had not been using his arm and complained of ongoing pain.</p>
<p>His wrist was swollen but was not erythematous or bruised. He had severe pain on flexion and extension but could pronate and supinate normally. His wrist was tender dorsally generally but not focally and it was neuro-vascularly intact.</p>
<p>Radiographs at this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0036933013482669">Figure 1</xref>) showed no fracture or joint abnormality; he was splinted for analgesia.
<fig id="fig1-0036933013482669" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Initial films – distal forearm and carpus.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0036933013482669-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>He was followed up, 4 days later, at fracture clinic. His wrist was still swollen and extremely tender with limited active movement.</p>
<p>Further radiographs showed a periarticular osteopenia and increased soft tissue swelling. A provisional diagnosis of an occult physeal injury was made. The arm was splinted in a forearm cast and review arranged for a further week.</p>
<p>At this stage, the swelling and tenderness were more marked, though the distal forearm and wrist remained cool. Radiographs showed progressive carpal osteopenia but no periosteal reaction. Possible diagnoses included infection (including tuberculosis) and inflammatory arthropathy, with an occult fracture being progressively unlikely.</p>
<p>He was admitted for blood investigations, including cultures (which ultimately yielded no growth) and an MRI scan the following day.</p>
<p>MRI under general anaesthesia demonstrated abnormal signal in the distal radial metaphysis and epiphysis in keeping with bone oedema and there was a loss of cortical integrity on the lateral aspect of both the epiphysis and metaphysis and at their junction with the epiphyseal plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0036933013482669">Figure 2</xref>). There was a fluid collection approximately 1 cm in diameter at the edge of the epiphyseal plate, extending into the superficial soft tissue. It demonstrated soft tissue oedema with fluid around the tendon sheaths but no generalised synovitis. The appearance was of osteomyelitis with an associated collection extending from the epiphyseal plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0036933013482669">Figure 2</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>TB, though possible, was deemed unlikely given he had no TB contacts, no foreign travel and no chronic cough. However, a Mantoux test was performed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0036933013482669"><title>Operative findings and outcome</title>
<p>The day following his MRI the patient was taken to theatre for open incision biopsy and drainage. Operative findings were of a cortical breech of the distal radius with an associated, walled off, soft tissue collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0036933013482669">Figure 3</xref>). Samples were sent for microscopy, culture and sensitivity as well as mycobacterial culture and acid and alcohol fast bacilli staining. He was put in plaster and the boy was commenced on intravenous flucloxacillin.

</fig></p>
<p>He remained in hospital for 5 days following his operation during which time the above samples returned negative for TB and showed only scanty pus cells but with no organisms. He was discharged home with follow up at clinic and spent a total of 6 weeks on antibiotics.</p>
<p>In subsequent clinic appointments he demonstrated great improvement. By 6 weeks he had regained full movements. Radiographs demonstrated no growth arrest and by 3 months post discharge he was symptom-free with no abnormality on radiographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0036933013482669">Figure 4</xref>).

<p>Epiphyseal haematogenous osteomyelitis (HOM) is an uncommon condition, usually sub-acute but occasionally acute in which infection can spread if not detected and treated promptly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482669">1</xref></sup> Most cases of epiphyseal HOM occur around the knee,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0036933013482669">2</xref></sup> though there has been a report of osteomyelitis of the proximal radial epihysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0036933013482669">3</xref></sup> we have not been able to find a report of acute distal radial HOM.</p>
<p>It is tempting to speculate that a bone injury from trauma predisposed the tissue to develop infection subsequent to a bacteraemia, as can occur in closed fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0036933013482669">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Experiments in a rabbit tibial trauma model have demonstrated this. Morrissy and Haynes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0036933013482669">5</xref></sup> compared physeal injuries in rabbits; one group with no injuries but with a deliberate bacteraemia another group with injuries but without bacteraemia and a last group with both injuries and bacteraemia. It described that physeal injuries without bacteraemia healed within 7 days, those without injuries but with a deliberate bacteraemia developed only a small foci of osteomyelitis; whereas those with both injuries and bacteraemia developed significant osteomyelitis.</p>
<p>MRI scanning is important for both diagnosis and surgical planning e.g. metaphyseal versus epiphyseal, and in other cases for the loculated collection.</p>
<p>In our case the exact cause of the HOM cannot be determined though it is likely it was precipitated by trauma. MRI played a vital role in providing a definitive diagnosis.</p>
