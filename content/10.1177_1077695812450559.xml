<p>Walter Lippmann’s theory of democracy called on professional elites, including journalists, to shape and furnish the citizenry with “politically relevant” information because of the public’s “limited interest and intelligence” (p. 46) to fully make sense of the political world. In contrast, Williams and Delli Carpini argue that given the current new media environment and reconfigurations of the mediated public sphere, it is impossible for journalists to continue to exercise monopoly over politically relevant information. Williams is a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, and Delli Carpini is a professor of communication and the Walter H. Annenberg Dean at the Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania. These authors call for a popular democracy in which professional journalists and citizens have the same responsibilities in the media sphere.</p>
<p>While a few decades ago, newspapers, radio, and television were the veritable sources of public information and avenues for popular expression, the reality today is that younger people are relying on unorthodox sources of political information such as prime-time television dramas, late night shows, and comedies—often seen by elites in the old model of political communication as blurring of the lines between news and entertainment and online news sources. This book examines what Williams and Delli Carpini refer to as
<disp-quote>
<p>the precipitous decline in the power of journalists to control, for better or worse, the media narrative and an increase, again for better or worse, in the importance of other forms of communication, some new, and some old, to influence and/or dictate media coverage of politics. (p. 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A major strength of <italic>After Broadcast News</italic> lies in the authors’ ability to powerfully and seamlessly blend a theoretical and historical approach in a very practical way. Williams and Delli Carpini take us back into history and walk us through the different milestones in media and democracy in the American society. The book shows how different “media regimes” are associated with somewhat different notions of free press, democratic engagement, civic engagement, responsibility participation, and free speech, among others (pp. 16–50). The authors not only offer useful insights into historical junctures in media history in the United States but also begin, or at least take up, the debate about the role of professional journalists, citizen journalists, and cultural producers such as filmmakers in the shaping of public discourse in a democratic society.</p>
<p>This book problematizes the arbitrariness of the news-entertainment dichotomy and hegemonic notions of politically relevant information. A key question raised in this book was, Can journalism/journalists continue to claim to be the purveyor of public opinion in a world where comedians, satirists, ordinary citizens, and actors have become very important conduits of politically relevant and democratically useful information?</p>
<p>Williams and Delli Carpini explain politically relevant information to mean any information that provides “opportunities for understanding, deliberating and acting on the conditions of one’s everyday life, the life of fellow community members, and the norms and structures of power that shape these relationships” (p. 122). This definition points to the conceptual weakness in drawing a wedge, for example, between <italic>The Daily Show</italic> and <italic>CBS Evening News</italic>. Thus, the democratic utility—the potential to enhance democratic citizenship—of media forms or communication should be the most important indices, and not who or where those information are coming from.</p>
<p>This book neither adopts an entirely utopian view of the new media environment, nor does it have a dystopian view of it. It argues and demonstrates that past media regimes hold some lessons for the current transitional media environment, although the current online spaces have greater potential for democratic utility. For example, despite the characteristic limiting notions of politically relevant information and citizenship of the Age of Broadcast News, it was able to cultivate a nightly ritual of television news watching, which fostered a common political agenda. Despite Williams and Delli Carpini’s observation that the current media environment has the potential to enhance democracy, they do not believe market forces have the ability to remedy the situation. Deliberation, open debate, and regulation are the key to making the most of the new media environment.</p>
<p>Thus, rather than the archetypal hegemonic role of news media as the shapers and suppliers of public opinion based on notions of objectivity, this book makes another theoretical contribution by putting out a model of what the new environment should be. Williams and Delli Carpini propose that debates about the new media environment should be shaped by five norms, some of which were present in earlier regimes, but have more potential in the new media environment: transparency, pluralism of structure and content, verisimilitude—not as truth but the likelihood of truth, and practice. Practice refers to the ability to prepare people “for political and civic engagement through the media’s ability to model and be a place to rehearse such behavior” (p. 309).</p>
<p>Despite <italic>After Broadcast News</italic>’ significant contribution to the history, theory, and practice of media and political communication, its implied notions of progression of nature of media appears to be value-laden and tends to privilege newer communication environments or media regimes over earlier ones.</p>
