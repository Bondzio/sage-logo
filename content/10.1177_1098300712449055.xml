<abstract>
<p>Parents of children with autism are increasingly being considered as primary agents of intervention for their children. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether participating in a pivotal response training (PRT) group therapy program for parents of children with autism influenced related aspects of parents’ lives, namely, their levels of stress and empowerment. Seventeen families participated in a 10-week therapy group designed to train parents to use PRT, with a specific focus on their children’s language deficits. Measures of empowerment and stress were obtained at baseline and at the end of the trial. Ratings on the <italic>Parenting Stress Index/Short Form</italic> and the <italic>Family Empowerment Scale</italic> showed significant changes from pre- to posttreatment, indicating that parents felt higher levels of empowerment and lower levels of stress after the 10-week group program. Notably, stress related to parent–child interactions was most reduced. Possible causal factors and implications are discussed.</p>

<p>There is mounting evidence indicating that parenting a child with a developmental disability, including autism, is more demanding and stressful than parenting a typically developing child (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098300712449055">Baker-Ericzen, Brookman-Frazee, &amp; Stahmer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300712449055">Benson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300712449055">Brookman-Frazee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098300712449055">Noh, Dumas, Wolf, &amp; Fisman, 1989</xref>). Parents often need to learn skills for interacting with their child, who may have significant difficulties with verbal and nonverbal communication, social interactions, challenging behaviors, and in many cases, cognitive deficits. Parents are often further taxed by having to manage a complex system of services. It is not surprising then, that parents of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show higher levels of anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders than parents of children with mental retardation or typically developing children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098300712449055">Weiss, 2002</xref>). Evidence indicates that this increased stress is directly related to the demands of parenting a child with autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098300712449055">R. L. Koegel et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098300712449055">Tomanik, Harris, &amp; Hawkins, 2004</xref>), which often becomes a chronic source of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098300712449055">Gray, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098300712449055">R. L. Koegel et al. (1992)</xref> reported similar stress profiles for mothers of autistic children across different ages and functioning levels of the child. Their findings indicated that mothers of children with autism were more concerned about life-span care, their child’s cognitive impairment, and social and independent functioning when compared with mothers of typically developing children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098300712449055">Tomanik et al. (2004)</xref> reported that when children with autism are more irritable, socially withdrawn, and unable to communicate or interact with others, their mothers show the greatest amount of stress. These findings draw a direct connection between the level of impairment of the child with autism and maternal stress levels. Similar findings have also been reported by other investigators (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098300712449055">Baker-Ericzen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098300712449055">Tobing &amp; Glenwick, 2002</xref>). Fathers are also affected, with findings from a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098300712449055">Noh et al. (1989)</xref> demonstrating that both parents of children with autism experienced elevated stress on measures of adaptability, acceptability, and demandingness, suggesting that their child’s inability to interact with the environment was a primary source of stress. These investigations highlight the relationships between parental stress and level of impairment in children with autism.</p>
<p>Studies of stress related to parenting a child with autism point toward two mediating factors. First, the availability of social support is a well-documented factor and usually leads to a decrease in stress level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300712449055">Benson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098300712449055">Weiss, 2002</xref>). Evidence suggests that when parents of a child with autism have a strong informal social network, they show lower levels of stress than parents who lack social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098300712449055">Noh et al., 1989</xref>). The second factor that influences stress levels is formal professional services, although studies provide a mixed report on their impact. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300712449055">Benson (2006)</xref> reported that formal parent support (provided by school personnel, public and private agencies, and other professionals) was not a significant factor in predicting lower stress or depression in parents of children with autism. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098300712449055">Baker-Ericzen et al. (2005)</xref> found that mothers of children with autism experienced significant reductions in child-related stress following their child’s participation in an inclusive toddler program, but significant reductions in parent-related stress were not observed. These authors hypothesized that including a formal parent component in this community-based intervention program may have resulted in more positive outcomes related to parent stress. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098300712449055">Lynn (1994)</xref> reported on the benefits of clinical parent support groups for parents of developmentally disabled adolescents. Lynn’s results, which focus on a more specific type of parent support, suggest a role for clinical services in alleviating the difficulties faced by parents of children with autism. These findings support the hypothesis that participating in a therapy group with other parents of children with autism may have a positive impact on parent stress, as such a group would increase social support while providing families with professional services. This is particularly important because managing stress levels adequately is crucial in decreasing parental risks associated with chronic stress, which may include heart disease, depression, sleep problems, obesity, and autoimmune diseases (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098300712449055">Motzer &amp; Hertig, 2004</xref>). More importantly, managing parenting stress is an important factor in minimizing the risk of child maltreatment and abuse (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098300712449055">Chan, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Additional support for the importance of clinical services that address parent and family needs comes from work on empowerment. This work focuses on the need to empower parents and families to access necessary services, and to advocate for better services in the broader community. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1098300712449055">Zimmerman and Warschausky (1998)</xref> defined <italic>psychological empowerment</italic> as a construct at the individual level of analysis that “integrates perceptions of personal control, participation with others to achieve goals, and a critical awareness of the factors that hinder or enhance one’s efforts to exert control” They argue that an empowerment approach leads to an emphasis on health rather than illness, and competency rather than deficiency, leading practitioners and patients to see the patient as efficacious in the treatment process. Recent research supports the importance of empowerment-focused treatment models. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300712449055">Brookman-Frazee (2004)</xref> found that parents demonstrated decreased observed stress and increased confidence when intervention was delivered using a parent empowerment model as compared with a traditional professional-driven model. The parent empowerment model also had a positive impact on child affect, responsiveness, and engagement, suggesting that empowered parents may also be more effective intervention agents.</p>
<p>These findings have supported making family empowerment a central component in considering the value of services provided for families of children with mental health difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1098300712449055">Resendez, Quist, &amp; Matshazi, 2000</xref>). Emerging out of the shift in focus from a professional-driven model to one where family choice plays a more prominent role, empowerment has been viewed as a necessary and important outcome for many interventions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098300712449055">Dixon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098300712449055">Thompson et al., 1997</xref>). In fact, the focus on family empowerment has become prominent enough that it has influenced disabilities legislation, such as Part H of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA; 1991). Interventions that have family empowerment as a goal, seek to enable families to acquire competencies to solve problems, rather than rely solely on practitioners or professionals. Empowerment may be particularly important for families of children with autism due to the contested nature of current intervention and service delivery models, and the complex system of services that can be available, as parents are required to understand large amounts of information and make decisions for their children accordingly.</p>
<p>An ecocultural view of developmental disorders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098300712449055">Weisner, 2002</xref>) proposes that the child should be understood within the ecological and cultural environment in which she or he lives. This view leads us to see the role that parents may play in supporting interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098300712449055">Bernheimer &amp; Weisner, 2007</xref>), and parent involvement in their child’s treatment has been shown to result in improved functioning and better generalization of skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098300712449055">R. L. Koegel, Koegel, &amp; Schreibman, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098300712449055">Koren, DeChillo, and Friesen (1992)</xref> proposed that the empowered parent was more likely to engage confidently and effectively in their child’s treatment program, which was also supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300712449055">Brookman-Frazee (2004)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098300712449055">Koren and colleagues (1992)</xref> also proposed that empowered parents were likely to cope more successfully with daily routines and interact more effectively with service providers. Taken together, these findings support that increased parent empowerment may result in better child outcomes in treatment.</p>
<p>In light of previous research, supporting the importance of reducing parenting stress and increasing empowerment, educating parents and training them to deliver specific interventions may be one way of improving parent as well as child functioning. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the influence of a parent education group on parenting stress and empowerment. The 10-week parent group focused on teaching parents to use pivotal response treatment (PRT) during parent–child interactions to target child language deficits. Findings from this promising intervention have previously been published and demonstrated that parents successfully learned PRT, resulting in child language gains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300712449055">Minjarez, Williams, Mercier, &amp; Hardan, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Design</title>
<p>A pre–post within-group design was used in this study. Participants participated in a 10-week PRT parent training group and completed the measures described below at baseline and at the end of the program. As stated above, data obtained in the present study were collected as part of a larger investigation, and parent and child outcome findings were previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300712449055">Minjarez et al., 2011</xref>). The design and the methodology of these studies are described briefly below. They are outlined in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300712449055">Minjarez et al. (2011)</xref>.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Stanford University. Parents of children with ASD were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the child psychiatry division at Stanford University. Autism spectrum diagnosis was confirmed during a 2-hr clinical evaluation with a licensed psychologist, which included parent history, review of records, and patient observation. Parents of children who met criteria for autistic disorder or pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), based on the diagnostic criteria outlined in the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., text rev.; <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098300712449055">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>) were then eligible for the study. Children also had to be between 2 and 6.11 years of age and have documented evidence of language delays for their parents to be included in the study.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight families were eligible for the study, of which 26 agreed to participate in the research study (all 28 families attended the group). In total, 17 complete sets of data were collected and were included in the current analysis. Four families dropped out of the group for reasons not related to the study (e.g., time of day of group sessions did not work for them), and 5 families did not complete all questionnaires or provide the necessary home videos throughout group participation to be included in the study. As questionnaires were sent home for completion by parents, families sometimes did not remember to return them. Home videos were not provided by some families when necessary for a variety of reasons, such as technical difficulties that week and forgetting to bring videos to session. There was no evidence, however, that these families differed from the rest of the participants. The mean age of children was 3.11 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.1 years) at the beginning of the PRT program (range = 2.5–6.7 years). All children in the sample were boys. Sixteen were diagnosed with autistic disorder and one was diagnosed with PDD-NOS. Ethnic makeup of participants included Hispanic (11%), Caucasian (33%), Asian (28%), and East-Indian (28%) families. Both parents were invited to attend group therapy sessions; however, one parent was required to commit as the primary participant (i.e., attend all group sessions and interact with child during home video probes). Participation of both parents varied with a total of 24 parents participating in the therapy group (2 parents from 7 families, 1 parent from 10 families). Data were collected from 9 fathers and 15 mothers.</p>

<sec id="section4-1098300712449055">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>Group sessions were conducted in the outpatient clinic of the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Stanford University. Sessions were held in a conference room with parents and leaders seated around a large table. Children did not attend the group sessions. One individual session occurred during Week 7 of the program which included the lead clinician (a clinical psychologist), child, and parents. This session was held in a typical outpatient therapy clinic office which contained a variety of toys.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1098300712449055">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participating families attended a 10-week pivotal response training (PRT) group in an outpatient child psychiatry clinic. Specifics of group procedures and clinical content are outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300712449055">Minjarez et al. (2011)</xref>. Each family was asked to complete baseline measures, including 10-min home video probes during typical parent–child interactions (e.g., meals, play time, story time), and questionnaire measures, which are the primary source of data for the present study (see measures below). Treatment consisted of a 10-week parent training group (weekly sessions, 90 min each) in which parents were taught PRT. These procedures were based on the published manuals <italic>How to Teach Pivotal Behaviors to Children With Autism: A Training Manual</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300712449055">R. L. Koegel et al., 1989</xref>) and <italic>Teaching First Words to Children With Autism and Communication Delays Using Pivotal Response Training</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098300712449055">L. K. Koegel, Koegel, Bruinsma, Brookman, &amp; Fredeen, 2003</xref>). Parents were initially introduced to PRT through lectures and standardized video examples and then received weekly feedback about their implementation of PRT through review of home videos during group sessions. Each family also participated in one individual therapy session during Week 7 of the 10-week program. All clinic sessions were led by a licensed psychologist who specializes in PRT with assistance from a postdoctoral psychology fellow.</p>
<p>The specific content covered in the group sessions, as outlined in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300712449055">R. L. Koegel et al. (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098300712449055">L. K. Koegel et al. (2003)</xref> manuals, was reviewed during the first three sessions with ongoing feedback via videotape review in subsequent sessions. The specific PRT points that parents were taught to use include (a) presenting clear opportunities to respond while maintaining the child’s attention; (b) varying the tasks, including interspersing maintenance (tasks the child has already mastered) and acquisition (targeted skills the child has not yet mastered) to enhance child motivation; (c) incorporating child choice/shared control, that is, following the child’s lead in selection of toys and activities to enhance motivation, while maintaining some control over those items so they may be used as natural reinforcers; (d) providing immediate and contingent reinforcement for child use of target language behaviors; (e) providing natural reinforcers that are directly and functionally embedded in the interaction (e.g., child receives ball as reinforcer for saying, “ball”; child is allowed to go outside as reinforcer for saying, “outside”); and (f) providing reinforcers following expressive verbal attempts and correct responses (e.g., child is reinforced for saying “ba” instead of “ball” if that sound is a good attempt given his or her language level). Fidelity of PRT implementation was scored according to a standardized procedure typically used in PRT research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098300712449055">Symon, 2005</xref>), and parents were given feedback accordingly throughout their participation.</p>
<p>As described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300712449055">Minjarez et al., 2011</xref>), each family provided 10-min videos of interaction between one parent and his or her child before the first PRT group session as a baseline measure. On completion of the program, a posttreatment video was submitted. These videos were coded for fidelity of PRT implementation and amount of child utterances during parent–child interactions. Analyses indicated significant gains in PRT implementation with 16 of the 17 parents reaching the standard for treatment fidelity (80%) toward the end of the program. Analyses also showed a significant increase in the children’s use of functional verbal utterances from baseline to Week 10 of the program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300712449055">Minjarez et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Parents also completed pre- and posttreatment standardized questionnaires which were the primary measures for the present study. Pre- and posttreatment questionnaires were then compared to determine if parents experienced any changes in functioning after participating in the PRT group program.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section7-1098300712449055">
<title>Parenting Stress Index/Short Form (PSI/SF)</title>
<p>The PSI/SF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098300712449055">Abidin, 1995</xref>) is a 36-item self-report questionnaire, adapted from the original PSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098300712449055">Abidin, 1995</xref>). Total stress from the SF correlated at an exceptionally high level (.94) with the full-length form, a score that is similar to the test–retest reliability of the full-length form. There are three multichoice and 33 Likert-type scale items. The PSI/SF generates a total stress score and three subscale scores. The total stress score ranges from 36 to 180 and gives a measure of the total stress that the respondent is currently experiencing in his or her role as parent. Scores at or above the 90th percentile (raw score &gt; 90) indicate clinically significant levels of stress that may put the parent at risk of developing dysfunctional parenting behaviors. Parents in this range often require professional intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098300712449055">Abidin, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The three subscales provide more detail about the types of stress being reported by the parent. High scores on the Parental Distress (PD) subscale indicate that the parent is experiencing stress in relation to their role as parent, their relationship with their spouse, depression, or lack of social support. The Parent–Child Dysfunctional Interaction (P-CDI) subscale measures the amount of stress associated with interacting with the child. The Difficult Child (DC) subscale assesses the child’s characteristics that make parenting more or less difficult. By examining the subscales with the total stress measure, one can explore the aspects of parenting that are stressful, and begin to draw conclusions about the areas where the interventions may have the most effect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1098300712449055">
<title>Family Empowerment Scale (FES)</title>
<p>The FES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098300712449055">Koren et al., 1992</xref>) defines empowerment as a state that changes as circumstances and experiences change. It is often used to determine if interventions have influenced family empowerment over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098300712449055">Koren et al., 1992</xref>). This tool is designed to provide a snapshot view of empowerment, looking at the level of empowerment and the way in which it is expressed. The FES consists of 34 items that participants rate on a 5-point scale from “not true at all” to “very true.” It has strong reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098300712449055">Koren et al., 1992</xref>). The internal consistency of the levels of subscores is strong (between <italic>r</italic> = .87 and .88; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098300712449055">Early, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The FES identifies three levels of empowerment: family, service, and community/political empowerment. The family empowerment level relates to the immediate family situation and the family’s management of daily situations. The service empowerment level relates to how the family interacts with professionals and agencies that provide services for their child or children. The community empowerment level is associated with parental advocacy for improved services for children in general.</p>
<p>The theoretical basis for the model is based on the expression of empowerment in three different modes, including attitudes, knowledge, and behavior, each of which can occur within the three levels of empowerment. Hence, the FES generates scores in these three domains (attitudes, knowledge, and behavior) for all three levels of empowerment (family, service, and community).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1098300712449055">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>Although two parents from all participating families were invited to attend the program, each family identified a primary parent to attend all group therapy sessions and receive ongoing feedback. The families were asked to ensure that the primary parent was the main individual interacting with the child in all weekly videos, so she or he would receive consistent feedback. To explore any possible differences in outcomes due to participation as primary or nonprimary parent, a repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted.</p>
<p>For the primary measures, a pretest–posttest design was used to analyze changes in PSI/SF and FES scores from pre- to posttreatment using paired-sample <italic>t</italic> tests. The total score of the PSI/SF and its subscales were examined. The three levels of empowerment and their respective subdomains were used for the FES. Analyses were all two-tailed and <italic>p</italic> value was set at &lt;.05.</p>

<title>Differences Between Primary Parent and Nonprimary Parent</title>
<p>Attendance of both parents varied with a total of 24 parents attending the program (2 parents from 7 families, 1 parent from 10 families). All but 1 family adhered to the primary parent rule, so of the 17 families, 18 parents were identified as primary parents. Thus, the PSI/SF and FES data are from 18 primary parents and 6 nonprimary parents.</p>
<p>A repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted to examine any possible differences in outcomes due to articipation as primary or nonprimary parent. The within-subjects factor was time of measure (pre or post) and the between-subjects factor was whether the parent was identified as the primary participant. Results for both the three levels of empowerment from the FES and the total and subscales from the PSI/SF indicated no statistical difference between primary and nonprimary parents, so for the purposes of the analysis below, no distinctions were made between primary and nonprimary parents and all parents were included in the analysis. It should be noted that although each family selected a primary parent for the study, of the seven families where two parents attended the program, both parents attended most sessions together. Preliminary evidence from our study suggests that the nonprimary parent also learned PRT procedures and future investigations should examine changes in the ability to implement PRT in this parent.</p>

<title>PSI/SF</title>
<p>The PSI/SF yields a total stress score and also divides stress into three subscales: (a) PD, (b) P-CDI, and (c) DC. Paired-sample <italic>t</italic> tests were used to examine whether there were changes in total parent stress as well as the subscales from baseline to the final week of the 10-week PRT group.</p>
<p>At pretest, 75% of the group (18 parents) received total stress scores that were at or above the 90th percentile, indicating that they were experiencing clinically significant levels of stress in their role as parent. At posttest, only 58% (12 parents) reported total stress scores at or above the 90th percentile.</p>
<p>To examine differences in total stress scores from pre to post, paired-sample <italic>t</italic> tests were conducted. Results, which are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1098300712449055">Table 1</xref>, indicate a significant difference from pre to post, with parents reporting lower levels on the Total Stress scale after completing the PRT group.</p>

<p>To further examine this finding, paired-sample <italic>t</italic> tests were used to examine changes from pre to post in each of the three PSI/SF subscales (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1098300712449055">Table 1</xref>). Although parents reported lower scores on the PD subscale at posttest than at pretest, the difference was not statistically significant. Similar results were found for the DC subscale, with lower means at post than at pre, but differences only trended toward significance. In contrast, the differences between pre and post for the P-CDI subscale were significant, with parents reporting lower levels of stress associated with interacting with their child after completing the PRT group than before the group.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Family empowerment and parenting stress are two areas of concern for families of children with autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300712449055">Brookman-Frazee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098300712449055">Tomanik et al., 2004</xref>). In this study, we examined whether parents of children with autism participating in a 10-week group that focused on teaching them PRT to target their children’s language deficits influenced their stress and empowerment levels. Twenty-four parents attended the group sessions representing 17 children with autism. All children had been diagnosed with an ASD and had significant language delay. The group focused on teaching parents PRT strategies to promote language development.</p>
<p>Findings from the PSI/SF indicated that all parents in the group were experiencing high levels of stress, with 75% of parents reporting clinically significant levels of stress at the beginning of the trial. Lower stress levels were reported at the end of the treatment program. Interestingly, despite the observed improvement, more than half of the parents continued to report stress levels above the 90th percentile, the level used to define clinically significant levels of stress. These findings suggest that a longer duration of observation or treatment is needed to determine whether continued implementation of the techniques learned during the group could lead to further reductions in parent stress over time. The findings also may imply that, although participation in the PRT program was helpful and improvement in the children’s language was observed, the magnitude of changes observed was not enough to have a more substantial impact on parents’ stress levels. In light of the negative influence of stress on parents, families, and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098300712449055">Chan, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098300712449055">Motzer &amp; Hertig, 2004</xref>), future studies of PRT should examine the long-term impact of this therapy on parents’ stress levels.</p>
<p>Changes in the P-CDI subscale of the PSI/SF were also observed from pre- to posttreatment. This finding indicates that parents involved in the group treatment program showed a significant reduction in stress related to interacting with their child. As the PRT group focused explicitly on improving child language skills, improvement in parent–child interactions was expected and the reduction in stress in this domain is seen as an important outcome for the parents involved. This observation is supported by the analysis of changes in child language over the course of the 10-week program previously reported by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300712449055">Minjarez et al., 2011</xref>), which indicated that children of parents who participated in the treatment program demonstrated a significant increase in their number of functional verbal utterances from pre- to posttreatment. Taken together, these findings suggest that the reduction in parenting stress associated with parent–child interaction could possibly be attributed to better communication between the parent and the child, as a result of the skills learned during the PRT program.</p>
<p>Higher levels of parent empowerment were also observed at the end of 10-week group treatment program. Family empowerment was assessed using the FES which measures three levels of empowerment as well as three types of expressions of empowerment. At all three levels, family, service, and community, there was an increase from pre- to posttreatment, indicating that parents felt more empowered in their family life, when recruiting services, and in their ability to influence community level change in relation to their child’s needs. In addition to changes in the levels of empowerment, expressions of empowerment also showed increases with treatment. This finding indicates changes in the knowledge, attitudes, and behavior at all three levels, suggesting that parents felt they had better resources, and were better prepared to recruit the supports necessary for optimal treatment of their child. Increased levels of family empowerment are associated with self-efficacy and control, which has been found to be related to parents’ positive judgments about their parenting capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098300712449055">Dunst, 1999</xref>). These observations are consistent with a study of parents of children with autism, which reported that maternal self-efficacy mediated the effect of child problem behavior on maternal stress, anxiety, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098300712449055">Hastings &amp; Brown, 2002</xref>). These previous findings suggest that increasing family empowerment may have ongoing effects, on the mental health of the parents and on the choices they make for their children’s treatment programs in the future, making the increase that was observed over the 10-week PRT group an important outcome.</p>
<p>Given the pilot nature of this study, it suffers from several methodological limitations, including the absence of a control group, small sample size, and a lack of gold standard subject characterization (e.g., on diagnostic, language, and cognitive measures). In addition, dosing effects were not examined or controlled for, as no specific instructions were provided to the parents about how much intensity of intervention to provide in the home environment. This variable may have affected parent functioning, depending on how much time parents were spending implementing intervention. We also did not control for the effects of other treatments the children were receiving and how these might affect parent functioning. Future controlled studies with larger sample size that include the use of standardized measures and control group, or controlled single-case designs are needed to address these limitations.</p>
<p>In summary, findings from this study on parenting stress and family empowerment indicate that participating in the PRT group treatment program was of benefit to the parents. Although the exact relationship between the PRT group, reduced parent stress, and increased family empowerment is not explored in this study, these observations support the group model as an effective mechanism for improving parent functioning and transferring PRT skills to parents of children with autism. Future research should examine the longevity of these effects, and also assess the specific contributors of these effects. While the parenting stress data indicate that some of the reduction in stress could be associated with improved parent–child interactions, whether the change in the parents’ psychological states was due to the techniques that they learned, the improvement in their child’s language, interaction with other parents who were facing similar issues, or a combination of these, is still to be determined.</p>
